00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,462
SPEAKER_1:  So the BBC reached out and said, we want to interview you.

00:00:02,882 --> 00:00:07,198
SPEAKER_1:  I said, we've got this idea. We want to take you to a park and have you meet one of the protesters.

00:00:08,578 --> 00:00:09,726
SPEAKER_1:  who's been wielding his gun.

00:00:10,018 --> 00:00:10,942
SPEAKER_1:  outside your mosque.

00:00:11,522 --> 00:00:12,286
SPEAKER_1:  and talk to him.

00:00:13,122 --> 00:00:16,062
SPEAKER_1:  It was really interesting because they'd interviewed him before meeting me.

00:00:16,674 --> 00:00:18,462
SPEAKER_1:  and the things that he was able to utter.

00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:21,854
SPEAKER_1:  before meeting me and before meeting Syrian refugees.

00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,382
SPEAKER_1:  Was just awful.

00:00:24,866 --> 00:00:27,614
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, the most dehumanizing rhetoric that you can imagine.

00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,142
SPEAKER_1:  but then at the park.

00:00:30,818 --> 00:00:32,030
SPEAKER_1:  he meets me.

00:00:32,322 --> 00:00:33,086
SPEAKER_1:  talks to me.

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,550
SPEAKER_1:  he meets a Syrian refugee family.

00:00:36,226 --> 00:00:37,982
SPEAKER_1:  one of the girls whose leg

00:00:38,434 --> 00:00:40,606
SPEAKER_1:  had been blown off in an airstrike.

00:00:41,634 --> 00:00:43,806
SPEAKER_1:  And he said, I feel like an idiot.

00:00:44,194 --> 00:00:46,526
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, he expressed all sorts of regret.

00:00:47,522 --> 00:00:48,990
SPEAKER_1:  and was teary eyed.

00:00:49,826 --> 00:00:50,686
SPEAKER_1:  that he could.

00:00:51,074 --> 00:00:54,654
SPEAKER_1:  dehumanize people the way that he was. And so my whole thing was.

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:55,806
SPEAKER_1:  and is.

00:00:56,162 --> 00:00:58,014
SPEAKER_1:  Come inside the mosque, put your gun down.

00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:00,926
SPEAKER_1:  disarm yourself and learn.

00:01:01,922 --> 00:01:02,302
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:01:02,786 --> 00:01:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  you'll be surprised what you'll walk away with.

00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:06,942
SPEAKER_1:  and only took one meeting with Him.

00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:08,734
SPEAKER_1:  so completely.

00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:10,398
SPEAKER_1:  shift.

00:01:11,522 --> 00:01:12,766
SPEAKER_1:  his worldview at the time.

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:14,398
SPEAKER_1:  which

00:01:15,522 --> 00:01:21,982
SPEAKER_1:  was made up of heroes and villains, the Muslims unfortunately being the villains that had to be wiped off the face of the earth so that the earth could continue.

00:01:24,514 --> 00:01:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  The following is a conversation with Imam Dr. Omar Suleiman.

00:01:28,674 --> 00:01:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  He's a Muslim scholar.

00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,006
SPEAKER_0:  civil rights leader.

00:01:31,298 --> 00:01:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  founder and president of the Yakin Institute for Islamic Research.

00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  and he's a professor of Islamic studies.

00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  at Southern Methodist University.

00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,166
SPEAKER_0:  He's one of the most influential Muslims in the world.

00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:45,918
SPEAKER_0:  and as a fearless, kind-hearted human being.

00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:48,126
SPEAKER_0:  who I'm now proud to call a friend.

00:01:49,602 --> 00:01:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  As a side note, allow me to say a few words about Israel and Palestine.

00:01:53,922 --> 00:01:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  While this conversation with Omar Suleiman

00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  was mostly exploring the history and beauty of Islam.

00:01:59,778 --> 00:02:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  and the Muslim community.

00:02:01,282 --> 00:02:04,798
SPEAKER_0:  We did delve briefly into the topic of Israel and Palestine.

00:02:05,538 --> 00:02:08,062
SPEAKER_0:  This topic is an extremely challenging one.

00:02:08,514 --> 00:02:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  and an extremely important one.

00:02:10,914 --> 00:02:14,558
SPEAKER_0:  It has deep roots and implications in US politics.

00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  in global geopolitics, in military and religious conflicts, wars, and atrocities.

00:02:20,546 --> 00:02:21,022
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:02:21,378 --> 00:02:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  basic struggle of all human beings to survive, to protect their loved ones, and to flourish as individuals and as communities.

00:02:29,506 --> 00:02:31,198
SPEAKER_0:  I did not want to cover this topic.

00:02:31,426 --> 00:02:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  in a solely scholarly fashion.

00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  much like with the war in Ukraine.

00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  It is not simply a story of history, politics, religion, and

00:02:39,362 --> 00:02:40,446
SPEAKER_0:  national identity.

00:02:40,898 --> 00:02:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  It is also a deeply human story.

00:02:43,906 --> 00:02:47,358
SPEAKER_0:  in the way that my gut and my heart says to do it.

00:02:47,778 --> 00:02:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  I have to talk to everyone.

00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:51,294
SPEAKER_0:  to leaders and people on all sides.

00:02:51,746 --> 00:02:52,990
SPEAKER_0:  Muslim and Jewish.

00:02:53,218 --> 00:02:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  Israeli and Palestinian.

00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:57,726
SPEAKER_0:  from refugees to soldiers, from scholars.

00:02:58,082 --> 00:02:59,102
SPEAKER_0:  to extremists.

00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not sure if that's possible.

00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:02,942
SPEAKER_0:  or wise.

00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,734
SPEAKER_0:  But like Forrest Gump said...

00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not a smart man.

00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  and maybe you know how the rest of that goes.

00:03:09,602 --> 00:03:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  I just like to follow my heart.

00:03:11,298 --> 00:03:12,990
SPEAKER_0:  to whatever place it leads.

00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  I ask.

00:03:14,754 --> 00:03:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  the Muslim and the Jewish communities.

00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  for your patience and support as I explore this topic.

00:03:20,514 --> 00:03:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  I will make many mistakes.

00:03:22,274 --> 00:03:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  and I'll be listening to all voices so I can learn and do better.

00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:28,894
SPEAKER_0:  I've become distinctly aware.

00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:33,758
SPEAKER_0:  that my approach of talking to people from all walks of life with empathy and compassion

00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,390
SPEAKER_0:  but with backbone.

00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  can create enemies on all sides.

00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  I don't quite yet understand why this is.

00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,174
SPEAKER_0:  but I'm learning to accept.

00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  It is the reality of the world.

00:03:44,994 --> 00:03:46,334
SPEAKER_0:  Hopefully, in the end.

00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  Whatever happens.

00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  Whatever silly thing I do.

00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  as a chance of adding a bit of love to the world.

00:03:52,994 --> 00:03:53,982
SPEAKER_0:  Thanks for going along.

00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:54,846
SPEAKER_0:  with me.

00:03:55,138 --> 00:03:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  this journey.

00:03:56,706 --> 00:04:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  This is the Lex Freakman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:04:01,698 --> 00:04:02,206
SPEAKER_0:  And now...

00:04:02,562 --> 00:04:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  Dear friends.

00:04:03,522 --> 00:04:04,350
SPEAKER_0:  Here's Omar.

00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  Salman.

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  Assalamu alaikum Umar, we've been trying to do this a long time. It's the world tried to prevent it through the funny ways that the world does. But here we are. I'm a huge fan of yours. It's a huge honor to talk to you.

00:04:18,946 --> 00:04:24,286
SPEAKER_1:  Thank you for making the sacrifice and coming down, or coming up, I guess, to Dallas. I appreciate it.

00:04:24,642 --> 00:04:25,767
SPEAKER_1:  It's a short flight, but a-

00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:26,526
SPEAKER_0:  long journey.

00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:29,438
SPEAKER_0:  Let's start with the biggest question, who is God?

00:04:29,922 --> 00:04:30,750
SPEAKER_0:  according to Islam.

00:04:31,842 --> 00:04:33,086
SPEAKER_1:  God is...

00:04:33,794 --> 00:04:37,598
SPEAKER_1:  the most compassionate, the most merciful, the Creator of the heavens and the earth.

00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,198
SPEAKER_1:  He is one God.

00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:40,158
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,142
SPEAKER_1:  He begets not, nor is he begotten.

00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:43,326
SPEAKER_1:  He is unique.

00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,662
SPEAKER_1:  He is omnipotent.

00:04:45,922 --> 00:04:48,350
SPEAKER_1:  He is beyond the limitations of man.

00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,454
SPEAKER_1:  He is beyond the constructs of our imagination.

00:04:52,482 --> 00:04:54,750
SPEAKER_1:  but he is ever accessible.

00:04:55,138 --> 00:04:56,382
SPEAKER_1:  sincere supplication.

00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:58,654
SPEAKER_1:  when you call upon him.

00:04:59,490 --> 00:04:59,966
SPEAKER_1:  alone.

00:05:00,706 --> 00:05:01,342
SPEAKER_1:  One God.

00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,990
SPEAKER_1:  He is closer to you than your jugular vein, the Qur'an tells us.

00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:11,166
SPEAKER_1:  He's known by many names and attributes, but his essence is one. He's one God.

00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,054
SPEAKER_1:  uh... no human likeness

00:05:13,986 --> 00:05:16,414
SPEAKER_1:  No human imperfection can be attributed to him.

00:05:16,898 --> 00:05:17,662
SPEAKER_1:  no partners.

00:05:18,658 --> 00:05:19,646
SPEAKER_1:  uh... no image

00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:20,606
SPEAKER_1:  of him.

00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:22,462
SPEAKER_1:  can be constructed.

00:05:23,682 --> 00:05:25,214
SPEAKER_1:  And that is God.

00:05:25,698 --> 00:05:27,550
SPEAKER_0:  So God represents, He is.

00:05:28,514 --> 00:05:31,070
SPEAKER_0:  feeling of closeness that is accessible to every human being.

00:05:31,394 --> 00:05:35,134
SPEAKER_1:  Well, God's not a feeling. God is known by names and attributes.

00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:36,798
SPEAKER_1:  We call upon God.

00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:37,406
SPEAKER_1:  But.

00:05:38,242 --> 00:05:40,734
SPEAKER_1:  There is certainly a feeling of closeness.

00:05:41,058 --> 00:05:43,902
SPEAKER_1:  when you access him. So I think the beauty of Islam is that.

00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,390
SPEAKER_1:  as perfect as God is described.

00:05:48,546 --> 00:05:51,358
SPEAKER_1:  He's also so accessible to the imperfect.

00:05:51,778 --> 00:05:58,622
SPEAKER_1:  And so the idea of sincere supplication and connection to him, we worship him alone. We call upon him alone. There's no clergy. There's no barrier.

00:05:59,266 --> 00:05:59,838
SPEAKER_1:  between

00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,054
SPEAKER_1:  God end.

00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:02,014
SPEAKER_1:  and us.

00:06:03,042 --> 00:06:03,614
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:06:03,874 --> 00:06:05,118
SPEAKER_1:  that encourages.

00:06:06,114 --> 00:06:08,574
SPEAKER_1:  a sincere devotion and commitment to Him alone.

00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,774
SPEAKER_1:  And so he is certainly described.

00:06:12,194 --> 00:06:12,798
SPEAKER_1:  Supreme.

00:06:13,602 --> 00:06:14,174
SPEAKER_1:  end.

00:06:14,434 --> 00:06:16,318
SPEAKER_1:  God speaks to us through the Quran.

00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,102
SPEAKER_1:  and we speak to him through sincere supplication.

00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:22,174
SPEAKER_1:  and his attributes are the furthest.

00:06:22,434 --> 00:06:24,062
SPEAKER_1:  from us in terms of their perfection.

00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:27,038
SPEAKER_1:  but He is ever close to us.

00:06:27,426 --> 00:06:30,238
SPEAKER_1:  through our supplication, through our prayers, and through our connection to Him.

00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:33,191
SPEAKER_1:  to open the door.

00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  to that connection, to have a connection with God. How difficult is that process? How difficult was it for you?

00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  how difficult those are for the people that...

00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,286
SPEAKER_0:  for the many, many, many Muslims that you've interacted with.

00:06:45,218 --> 00:06:50,238
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I think that there are different layers of difficulty, right? There is the personal difficulty.

00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,710
SPEAKER_1:  Submitting yourself.

00:06:52,642 --> 00:06:54,014
SPEAKER_1:  to God, you know, Islam.

00:06:54,434 --> 00:06:56,638
SPEAKER_1:  requires a complete submission to him.

00:06:56,898 --> 00:06:57,406
SPEAKER_1:  And

00:06:58,306 --> 00:06:59,390
SPEAKER_1:  one of the things that.

00:06:59,682 --> 00:07:01,534
SPEAKER_1:  happens is that if we

00:07:02,914 --> 00:07:03,614
SPEAKER_1:  project.

00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:06,974
SPEAKER_1:  some of our bad experiences with authority.

00:07:07,362 --> 00:07:08,958
SPEAKER_1:  onto our relationship with God.

00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:12,190
SPEAKER_1:  then we immediately perceive him in a certain way.

00:07:12,706 --> 00:07:20,734
SPEAKER_1:  that might not allow us to gain a closeness to him because maybe we didn't have the best relationship with our parents growing up. Maybe we didn't have the best relationship with authority figures.

00:07:21,218 --> 00:07:23,966
SPEAKER_1:  in our lives and so this idea of an ultimate authority.

00:07:24,546 --> 00:07:26,846
SPEAKER_1:  to whom you submit yourself can be very difficult.

00:07:27,106 --> 00:07:28,350
SPEAKER_1:  You know, Malcolm X who...

00:07:28,578 --> 00:07:31,294
SPEAKER_1:  one of the most prominent converts to Islam in American history.

00:07:31,938 --> 00:07:36,318
SPEAKER_1:  We talked about the difficulty of prostration for the very first time, putting your head on the ground.

00:07:36,898 --> 00:07:39,390
SPEAKER_1:  putting your face on the ground and praying.

00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,310
SPEAKER_1:  God is a very humbling

00:07:41,538 --> 00:07:41,950
SPEAKER_1:  think.

00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:44,862
SPEAKER_1:  Submitting all of your affairs to him is very humbling.

00:07:45,922 --> 00:07:47,966
SPEAKER_1:  and ultimately you have to relinquish control.

00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:51,870
SPEAKER_1:  and you can't relinquish control without trust. So you have to learn to trust God.

00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,078
SPEAKER_1:  to trust God, you have to know him.

00:07:54,882 --> 00:07:56,126
SPEAKER_1:  and to know him is to love him.

00:07:56,802 --> 00:07:57,438
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

00:07:58,402 --> 00:07:59,518
SPEAKER_1:  for me personally.

00:08:00,002 --> 00:08:00,350
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:01,726
SPEAKER_1:  growing up.

00:08:02,338 --> 00:08:04,894
SPEAKER_1:  going through certain difficulties.

00:08:05,538 --> 00:08:07,326
SPEAKER_1:  having a sick parent.

00:08:07,746 --> 00:08:10,398
SPEAKER_1:  who struggled in her life with.

00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,286
SPEAKER_1:  cancer and with strokes.

00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:15,646
SPEAKER_1:  dealing with racism in South Louisiana.

00:08:16,098 --> 00:08:16,670
SPEAKER_1:  growing up.

00:08:17,442 --> 00:08:18,942
SPEAKER_1:  It was important for me.

00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  to learn about God.

00:08:21,474 --> 00:08:25,758
SPEAKER_1:  through my difficulties, for example, rather than let those difficulties turn me away from them.

00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,422
SPEAKER_1:  many times.

00:08:27,746 --> 00:08:30,078
SPEAKER_1:  people put a barrier between them and God.

00:08:30,722 --> 00:08:33,918
SPEAKER_1:  because they can't make sense of the things that are happening in their own lives.

00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:35,326
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

00:08:35,586 --> 00:08:37,054
SPEAKER_1:  they project anger.

00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:39,454
SPEAKER_1:  towards God and at the same time.

00:08:40,098 --> 00:08:41,310
SPEAKER_1:  deny their own belief in him.

00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,270
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:46,398
SPEAKER_1:  do away with this natural disposition that every one of us has to believe in Him.

00:08:47,042 --> 00:08:49,022
SPEAKER_1:  So there are intellectual barriers, certainly.

00:08:49,378 --> 00:08:51,166
SPEAKER_1:  there are experiential barriers.

00:08:52,642 --> 00:08:54,366
SPEAKER_1:  but I think that one of the...

00:08:54,594 --> 00:08:56,862
SPEAKER_1:  beautiful things about Islam is clarity.

00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:57,630
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

00:08:58,146 --> 00:08:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  there's an explanation.

00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:00,702
SPEAKER_1:

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:08,670
SPEAKER_1:  his existence, there's an explanation for our existence, there's an explanation for the existence of difficulties and trial and explanation for...

00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,806
SPEAKER_1:  the existence of desires and distractions.

00:09:12,674 --> 00:09:15,582
SPEAKER_1:  and it all comes together so beautifully and coherently.

00:09:15,842 --> 00:09:16,862
SPEAKER_1:  in Islam.

00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,102
SPEAKER_1:  I think that for many of us...

00:09:19,362 --> 00:09:21,694
SPEAKER_1:  We want to be our own gods.

00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:25,342
SPEAKER_1:  and ultimately we create and fashion gods.

00:09:25,922 --> 00:09:31,646
SPEAKER_1:  in ways that allow us to still be the ultimate determiners of our own fates, of our own.

00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:32,830
SPEAKER_1:  story.

00:09:34,082 --> 00:09:34,654
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:36,350
SPEAKER_1:  That's very unfulfilling.

00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:38,078
SPEAKER_1:  when you fail at your own plan.

00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:42,270
SPEAKER_1:  but when you realize that there is one who is all-knowing.

00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,638
SPEAKER_1:  that there is one who is all wise.

00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:51,966
SPEAKER_1:  you actually find peace in submitting yourself to Him. And so submitting your will to Him, submitting your...

00:09:52,194 --> 00:09:54,910
SPEAKER_1:  desires, submitting your own fate to him.

00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:57,502
SPEAKER_1:  becomes actually an experience of liberation.

00:09:58,146 --> 00:10:03,870
SPEAKER_1:  because you trust the one that you're submitting to. You trust his knowledge over yours. You trust his wisdom over yours.

00:10:04,578 --> 00:10:07,230
SPEAKER_1:  and that gives you a lot of peace, and then you have direct access to them.

00:10:07,682 --> 00:10:09,982
SPEAKER_1:  You pray to Him, you call upon Him, you supplicate.

00:10:10,786 --> 00:10:11,358
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:10:12,226 --> 00:10:14,430
SPEAKER_1:  Everything in your life suddenly has meaning.

00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,030
SPEAKER_1:  you know, in our faith.

00:10:17,506 --> 00:10:18,878
SPEAKER_1:  Everything is about intention.

00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,502
SPEAKER_1:  and there is an intentionality even behind the most.

00:10:21,986 --> 00:10:23,550
SPEAKER_1:  most mundane actions.

00:10:24,322 --> 00:10:25,086
SPEAKER_1:  Amor Sol.

00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:26,238
SPEAKER_1:  of food.

00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:28,318
SPEAKER_1:  in the mouth of...

00:10:28,866 --> 00:10:30,494
SPEAKER_1:  your spouse, your family.

00:10:31,202 --> 00:10:32,574
SPEAKER_1:  is looked at as a great charity.

00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:41,694
SPEAKER_1:  the way that you enter into a place and exit out of a place, what foot you step in, what foot you step out with. There's an intentionality. There's a word of remembrance that's spoken.

00:10:42,562 --> 00:10:45,790
SPEAKER_1:  There is a word of praise before and after you engage in any action.

00:10:46,498 --> 00:10:49,886
SPEAKER_1:  There are things that you say before you eat, before you sleep.

00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,086
SPEAKER_1:  There is meaning even to your sleep. One of the great.

00:10:53,346 --> 00:10:55,966
SPEAKER_1:  Companions of the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, he said,

00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,966
SPEAKER_1:  that I seek the reward for my sleep just as I seek the reward for my prayer.

00:11:00,738 --> 00:11:01,950
SPEAKER_1:  because you sleep.

00:11:02,338 --> 00:11:06,846
SPEAKER_1:  refresh yourself so that you can once again do great things and the intentionality behind that.

00:11:07,138 --> 00:11:08,862
SPEAKER_1:  allows even the sleep to be rewardable.

00:11:09,474 --> 00:11:13,822
SPEAKER_1:  You eat to nourish yourself so that you can do great things. You seek toSMARTNATHS1, THANK YOU forünü 상

00:11:14,146 --> 00:11:16,414
SPEAKER_1:  be in a position of independence and

00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:22,686
SPEAKER_1:  of being sustained so that you can sustain others. So the Prophet peace be upon him says for example that the upper hand

00:11:23,074 --> 00:11:27,486
SPEAKER_1:  is better than the lower hand. The upper hand is the giving hand, the lower hand is the receiving hand. So to seek.

00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:32,062
SPEAKER_1:  a position where you can help other people. Everything becomes intentional.

00:11:32,706 --> 00:11:34,750
SPEAKER_1:  and there's no such thing as

00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,534
SPEAKER_1:  you know, something that is meaningless and without.

00:11:37,954 --> 00:11:38,526
SPEAKER_1:  purpose.

00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:41,662
SPEAKER_1:  So every pursuit is ultimately a pursuit of God.

00:11:42,082 --> 00:11:44,414
SPEAKER_1:  and when you pursue God sincerely.

00:11:44,994 --> 00:11:51,358
SPEAKER_1:  then he rewards you not just with paradise in the afterlife, but he rewards you with a great sense of serenity and self satisfaction here.

00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:53,191
SPEAKER_1:  You mentioned part of the struggle.

00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  growing up was having a parent, your mom.

00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,526
SPEAKER_0:  who was sick, what do you remember?

00:11:59,682 --> 00:12:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  Bye bye, mom.

00:12:00,898 --> 00:12:02,878
SPEAKER_0:  What are some happy, pleasant memories?

00:12:04,482 --> 00:12:05,854
SPEAKER_1:  So my parents were...

00:12:06,274 --> 00:12:07,070
SPEAKER_1:  or my father.

00:12:07,298 --> 00:12:08,510
SPEAKER_1:  Thank God is still alive.

00:12:09,474 --> 00:12:09,918
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,062
SPEAKER_1:  My mother was a...

00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:14,046
SPEAKER_1:  Pious woman, beautiful woman.

00:12:14,914 --> 00:12:19,262
SPEAKER_1:  a righteous woman, a woman who was known for treating everyone with a great deal of love and respect.

00:12:19,618 --> 00:12:20,350
SPEAKER_1:  She was a poet.

00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,262
SPEAKER_1:  She used to write poetry about oppressed peoples around the world.

00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,798
SPEAKER_1:  From her homeland in Palestine to the genocide in Bosnia, she...

00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:32,190
SPEAKER_1:  followed every conflict before social media.

00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:34,110
SPEAKER_1:  and poured her heart into it.

00:12:34,722 --> 00:12:36,478
SPEAKER_1:  She was a woman of great charity.

00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,646
SPEAKER_1:  So when I think back to my mom growing up.

00:12:39,938 --> 00:12:43,166
SPEAKER_1:  She was known for her smile. My mom was always smiling.

00:12:43,394 --> 00:12:44,030
SPEAKER_1:  And in fact...

00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,534
SPEAKER_1:  every picture of her.

00:12:45,826 --> 00:12:46,462
SPEAKER_1:  She's smiling.

00:12:47,138 --> 00:12:48,510
SPEAKER_1:  and at her funeral.

00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,590
SPEAKER_1:  You know, people talked about her smile.

00:12:50,946 --> 00:12:56,830
SPEAKER_1:  that she would smile at everyone. And that was kind of her thing. So if you were left out of a gathering, she was smiling at you and she'd kind of welcome you in.

00:12:57,826 --> 00:13:01,598
SPEAKER_1:  I remember my mom to be content. She was a woman of prayer and a woman of content.

00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:04,766
SPEAKER_1:  So I used to see her in her prayer clothes all the time.

00:13:05,282 --> 00:13:12,350
SPEAKER_1:  In fact, when I think back to her growing up, I think of her more in her prayer clothes than in her normal clothes because that's how often she was engaged in prayer.

00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:15,838
SPEAKER_1:  And I think of her.

00:13:16,514 --> 00:13:16,990
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,694
SPEAKER_1:  making sure that everyone was included in a conversation. So she was very interesting.

00:13:22,786 --> 00:13:24,862
SPEAKER_1:  in that she had several strokes.

00:13:25,282 --> 00:13:25,694
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,838
SPEAKER_1:  and each one of those strokes.

00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,022
SPEAKER_1:  impaired.

00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:33,278
SPEAKER_1:  one of her senses to some extent. So she was partially deaf because of one stroke.

00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,830
SPEAKER_1:  and she'd be sitting in a gathering and she'd be pretty.

00:13:37,058 --> 00:13:39,934
SPEAKER_1:  quiet with a big smile on her face, very serene.

00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:46,046
SPEAKER_1:  And she would tell me, you know, which means thank God, all praise be to God that.

00:13:46,466 --> 00:13:48,062
SPEAKER_1:  I can't hear because

00:13:48,482 --> 00:13:48,894
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

00:13:49,218 --> 00:13:59,230
SPEAKER_1:  I can tell when people are gossiping, when people are saying negative things around me about other people, because she says even the look on people's faces changes. So it was really interesting because she was that spiritually.

00:13:59,778 --> 00:14:01,118
SPEAKER_1:  rooted and...

00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,486
SPEAKER_1:  deep that she said like you could see.

00:14:03,874 --> 00:14:12,190
SPEAKER_1:  on the looks on people's faces when they started to speak ill about other people that their faces would change, that their demeanor would change. He said, I would actually praise the Lord.

00:14:13,122 --> 00:14:16,990
SPEAKER_1:  that I couldn't engage in those conversations and that I wasn't sinful for hearing them.

00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,358
SPEAKER_1:  And what she would do is what people said.

00:14:20,098 --> 00:14:21,054
SPEAKER_1:  at her funeral.

00:14:21,314 --> 00:14:25,246
SPEAKER_1:  which was really beautiful to me. It was very comforting to me. And I took it as a life mission.

00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:30,078
SPEAKER_1:  that if you were new to a place or if you were kind of in the corner and not.

00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:35,870
SPEAKER_1:  not known to other people in the community and you felt left out. She was the one that literally would look around the room.

00:14:36,578 --> 00:14:38,238
SPEAKER_1:  and she'd see who was standing in the corner.

00:14:38,882 --> 00:14:46,142
SPEAKER_1:  and who was new to the community or new to whatever place. And she'd go and try to include that person in the gathering. So even when she had impaired speech and impaired hearing.

00:14:46,882 --> 00:14:50,142
SPEAKER_1:  With her smile and with her warmth, she was able to welcome people.

00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:53,182
SPEAKER_1:  uh... wherever that was and so the amount of people that came

00:14:53,986 --> 00:14:59,262
SPEAKER_1:  to her funeral and the stories that I continue to hear till this day, 15 years later, after it passing away.

00:15:00,034 --> 00:15:04,254
SPEAKER_1:  of people that said, you know, no one ever treated me the way your mother treated me.

00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:06,622
SPEAKER_1:  And she connected that to God.

00:15:07,298 --> 00:15:10,878
SPEAKER_1:  So that was actually part of my faith journey when I think of great people.

00:15:11,234 --> 00:15:12,542
SPEAKER_1:  when I think of people of faith.

00:15:13,602 --> 00:15:15,870
SPEAKER_1:  She's the first person that comes to my mind because

00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,398
SPEAKER_1:  despite her challenges.

00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:19,742
SPEAKER_1:  She was always.

00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,582
SPEAKER_1:  the greatest person that you would meet, anyone that met her.

00:15:24,002 --> 00:15:28,830
SPEAKER_1:  And that knew her would say, I'd never, I've never met anyone that kind. That was her reputation.

00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,806
SPEAKER_1:  and she was deeply empathetic.

00:15:32,034 --> 00:15:36,350
SPEAKER_1:  would shed tears over people that she had no connection to. This is again before social media, before-

00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:40,382
SPEAKER_1:  you know, the, the, the heavy exposure that we have to people in conflict zones.

00:15:40,994 --> 00:15:44,510
SPEAKER_1:  She had to engage every single human being in her life.

00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:50,014
SPEAKER_1:  in a deep and profound way because she had a profound connection to God and she believed that that was her calling.

00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:54,430
SPEAKER_1:  and none of her challenges made her bitter. In fact,

00:15:54,978 --> 00:15:57,022
SPEAKER_1:  They only made her more connected to God.

00:15:57,538 --> 00:15:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  and they only made her a better person.

00:15:59,778 --> 00:16:01,502
SPEAKER_1:  until the last breath that she took.

00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:03,134
SPEAKER_1:  Do you miss her?

00:16:05,794 --> 00:16:06,462
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,926
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, yes.

00:16:09,474 --> 00:16:10,814
SPEAKER_1:  Absolutely. But I.

00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,046
SPEAKER_1:  I feel like everything I do is an extension of her.

00:16:14,914 --> 00:16:15,998
SPEAKER_0:  So you try to carry.

00:16:16,418 --> 00:16:17,438
SPEAKER_0:  what she stood for.

00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  Absolutely. As part of yourself.

00:16:20,002 --> 00:16:24,126
SPEAKER_1:  The Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him said that when a person passes away...

00:16:24,642 --> 00:16:25,982
SPEAKER_1:  There are only three things.

00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,574
SPEAKER_1:  that continue to benefit them, that continue to extend them.

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,494
SPEAKER_1:  a continuous charity.

00:16:31,426 --> 00:16:31,934
SPEAKER_1:  or

00:16:32,226 --> 00:16:32,894
SPEAKER_1:  A

00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,486
SPEAKER_1:  piece of knowledge that continues to benefit people.

00:16:36,258 --> 00:16:37,918
SPEAKER_1:  or a righteous child that prays for them.

00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  And I want to be that child that prays for her, but also does charity in her name, extends her charity, extends what she taught me.

00:16:45,858 --> 00:16:47,390
SPEAKER_1:  by being the person that she was.

00:16:48,386 --> 00:16:51,198
SPEAKER_1:  uh... to everyone around me and there's some times where i

00:16:51,426 --> 00:16:54,366
SPEAKER_1:  Don't feel like getting out of bed sometimes where I don't feel like.

00:16:54,626 --> 00:16:57,310
SPEAKER_1:  doing for myself, but I actually feel like doing for her.

00:16:57,986 --> 00:17:00,030
SPEAKER_1:  So everything in my life that I try to do.

00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:03,134
SPEAKER_1:  I try to make it an extension of her.

00:17:03,618 --> 00:17:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  And

00:17:06,018 --> 00:17:06,782
SPEAKER_1:  That's been...

00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  My calling.

00:17:08,002 --> 00:17:09,694
SPEAKER_1:  And, you know, I believe I'll.

00:17:10,082 --> 00:17:10,750
SPEAKER_1:  Meet her again.

00:17:11,554 --> 00:17:12,894
SPEAKER_1:  I believe I'll be with her again.

00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:14,558
SPEAKER_1:  I believe.

00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,630
SPEAKER_1:  that everything I do that is good.

00:17:18,082 --> 00:17:19,518
SPEAKER_1:  will be of benefit to her.

00:17:20,418 --> 00:17:22,046
SPEAKER_1:  and I believe that it would make her proud.

00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:24,126
SPEAKER_1:  And so as much as I miss her.

00:17:24,802 --> 00:17:25,214
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  as much as I am.

00:17:28,898 --> 00:17:30,270
SPEAKER_1:  fueled to do for her.

00:17:30,914 --> 00:17:35,390
SPEAKER_1:  And so I continue that and that's kind of become part of my life. It's been my life story.

00:17:36,162 --> 00:17:39,390
SPEAKER_1:  as a child and as an adult, it's been sort of the centerpiece of my life.

00:17:40,034 --> 00:17:41,086
SPEAKER_1:  to do.

00:17:42,402 --> 00:17:43,518
SPEAKER_1:  things that

00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  Extend Her.

00:17:45,986 --> 00:17:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  And ultimately in the process, hopefully benefit me because I, I believe that she's.

00:17:50,594 --> 00:17:51,454
SPEAKER_1:  A woman who...

00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:55,518
SPEAKER_1:  I pray as Dustin for paradise and I want to do the things that would get me there too.

00:17:57,698 --> 00:17:58,823
SPEAKER_1:  What did you learn about...

00:17:58,823 --> 00:17:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  death.

00:18:00,226 --> 00:18:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  About life.

00:18:01,378 --> 00:18:01,790
SPEAKER_0:  from.

00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:03,518
SPEAKER_0:  losing her.

00:18:05,474 --> 00:18:07,486
SPEAKER_1:  I feel like the facade of...

00:18:08,098 --> 00:18:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  the material world.

00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:14,846
SPEAKER_1:  was made evident to me at a very young age. You know, most children grow up.

00:18:16,226 --> 00:18:16,862
SPEAKER_1:  Thanks for watching.

00:18:17,858 --> 00:18:19,646
SPEAKER_1:  Their parents want to protect them from everything.

00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:29,886
SPEAKER_1:  And I felt that too, you know, my mother wanted to downplay her own tragedy so that me and my brother could live a fruitful and fulfilling life. My father wanted to protect us.

00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:31,326
SPEAKER_1:  from.

00:18:32,802 --> 00:18:35,166
SPEAKER_1:  the hardship of her life.

00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:39,102
SPEAKER_1:  so that we could live fulfilling lives. He was, he'd often be the only.

00:18:39,554 --> 00:18:43,870
SPEAKER_1:  father on a field trip, even though he was a distinguished professor. I mean, he was a busy man.

00:18:44,674 --> 00:18:48,030
SPEAKER_1:  He, he was a very busy man, but he tried to show up at a field trip and

00:18:48,514 --> 00:18:50,942
SPEAKER_1:  try to make our lives as normal as possible.

00:18:53,442 --> 00:18:56,542
SPEAKER_1:  In the process, we always understood that there was more to life than...

00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:03,774
SPEAKER_1:  what other children were seeing it as. And now I know that as an adult, there's more to life than what other adults see it as, the material world.

00:19:04,546 --> 00:19:08,894
SPEAKER_1:  disappointed early on so that we could see beyond it. And I often tell people that.

00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:09,662
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,918
SPEAKER_1:  There are many that grow up in tragedy, orphan children.

00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:15,486
SPEAKER_1:  com.

00:19:15,714 --> 00:19:16,510
SPEAKER_1:  refugees.

00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  that.

00:19:18,946 --> 00:19:22,686
SPEAKER_1:  grow up and do incredible things because they immediately see past.

00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,126
SPEAKER_1:  The...

00:19:25,602 --> 00:19:26,174
SPEAKER_1:  facade.

00:19:26,754 --> 00:19:27,742
SPEAKER_1:  They see through.

00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:31,998
SPEAKER_1:  all of the material promises of this world, the deception of it.

00:19:32,898 --> 00:19:33,214
SPEAKER_1:  And that.

00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,654
SPEAKER_1:  you can choose to be bitter.

00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:35,838
SPEAKER_1:  as a result of that.

00:19:36,162 --> 00:19:37,246
SPEAKER_1:  or you can choose.

00:19:37,538 --> 00:19:37,982
SPEAKER_1:  to.

00:19:39,074 --> 00:19:39,550
SPEAKER_1:  be better.

00:19:40,706 --> 00:19:41,214
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:19:41,442 --> 00:19:45,982
SPEAKER_1:  I think that for me, I had to consciously make that decision that I was going to live a life.

00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,558
SPEAKER_1:  of prayer. I was going to live a life of charity. I was going to live a life of commitment.

00:19:51,522 --> 00:19:52,126
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,430
SPEAKER_1:  in that process.

00:19:55,074 --> 00:19:56,798
SPEAKER_1:  Invest in something that's greater.

00:19:57,282 --> 00:19:59,646
SPEAKER_1:  Invest in something that doesn't disappoint.

00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:01,854
SPEAKER_1:  and so I believe in God.

00:20:02,178 --> 00:20:03,358
SPEAKER_1:  I believe in the hereafter.

00:20:04,066 --> 00:20:06,814
SPEAKER_1:  and I believe that God will not let any trial.

00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,574
SPEAKER_1:  or effort.

00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:14,302
SPEAKER_1:  in this life go to waste without it being repaid in the hereafter. And so I work towards that. And so life and death.

00:20:15,266 --> 00:20:17,694
SPEAKER_1:  I understood existence to be transcendent.

00:20:18,114 --> 00:20:18,782
SPEAKER_1:  early on.

00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,638
SPEAKER_1:  that if I believed that.

00:20:21,442 --> 00:20:25,246
SPEAKER_1:  there was nothing to life except for life, I would be a very bitter person, but because-

00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,742
SPEAKER_1:  I know that there is more to it than this.

00:20:29,122 --> 00:20:30,174
SPEAKER_1:  I'm able to.

00:20:30,786 --> 00:20:32,030
SPEAKER_1:  exist in it.

00:20:32,962 --> 00:20:33,854
SPEAKER_1:  without being.

00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:34,942
SPEAKER_1:  depressed by it.

00:20:36,514 --> 00:20:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  Existence is transcendence.

00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,542
SPEAKER_0:  What happens after we die?

00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  after.

00:20:48,194 --> 00:20:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  the

00:20:50,498 --> 00:20:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  material instantiation.

00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  uh... fades away.

00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:57,822
SPEAKER_1:  So the Quran tells us.

00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,446
SPEAKER_1:  that God brought us from the

00:21:01,186 --> 00:21:02,334
SPEAKER_1:  darkness of the womb.

00:21:03,234 --> 00:21:04,094
SPEAKER_1:  into this life.

00:21:05,186 --> 00:21:09,022
SPEAKER_1:  You were nothing but a dirty drop of fluid and you became this fully.

00:21:09,314 --> 00:21:13,022
SPEAKER_1:  proportioned human being from the darkness of the womb you come into this life.

00:21:14,018 --> 00:21:14,846
SPEAKER_1:  You experience it.

00:21:15,138 --> 00:21:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  And then you go to the darkness of the grave only to be resurrected once again.

00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,150
SPEAKER_1:  and that.

00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:22,366
SPEAKER_1:  We are.

00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:24,126
SPEAKER_1:  souls.

00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:25,726
SPEAKER_1:  with bodies.

00:21:26,114 --> 00:21:29,662
SPEAKER_1:  not bodies with souls. And there's a huge difference between those two things.

00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  This is the vehicle that contains us here.

00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,814
SPEAKER_1:  This is the...

00:21:35,298 --> 00:21:36,542
SPEAKER_1:  material world.

00:21:36,866 --> 00:21:38,558
SPEAKER_1:  that we encounter here.

00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,542
SPEAKER_1:  but we are not this.

00:21:41,442 --> 00:21:47,390
SPEAKER_1:  and this is not our entire existence. And so the soul continues. This is a life in which...

00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:48,702
SPEAKER_1:  We...

00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:50,558
SPEAKER_1:  seek to worship Him?

00:21:51,554 --> 00:21:53,118
SPEAKER_1:  and seek to live.

00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:56,350
SPEAKER_1:  in accordance with the purpose that He has set out for us.

00:21:57,314 --> 00:21:59,742
SPEAKER_1:  and after we pass away our soul

00:22:00,034 --> 00:22:00,734
SPEAKER_1:  continues.

00:22:01,026 --> 00:22:01,694
SPEAKER_1:  onwards.

00:22:02,178 --> 00:22:02,526
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,022
SPEAKER_1:  either to reward or to

00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:06,430
SPEAKER_1:  punishment.

00:22:06,754 --> 00:22:08,062
SPEAKER_1:  or to a mixture of both.

00:22:08,386 --> 00:22:10,302
SPEAKER_1:  but it's a realm of accountability.

00:22:11,362 --> 00:22:11,966
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,910
SPEAKER_1:  Hopefully it's a realm of reward.

00:22:15,554 --> 00:22:16,542
SPEAKER_1:  Should we?

00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,942
SPEAKER_1:  exist in a way that he wants us to exist.

00:22:20,258 --> 00:22:21,383
SPEAKER_1:  So you said that you...

00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  We can look to God for wisdom to make sense of the world.

00:22:25,282 --> 00:22:26,334
SPEAKER_0:  There's a lot of stuff.

00:22:26,562 --> 00:22:26,878
SPEAKER_0:  to.

00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  us humans.

00:22:29,634 --> 00:22:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  that's difficult to make sense of.

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:32,382
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:22:33,122 --> 00:22:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  like you losing your mother.

00:22:35,394 --> 00:22:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  There's a lot of cruelty in the world.

00:22:38,242 --> 00:22:39,614
SPEAKER_0:  There's a lot of suffering in the world.

00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,438
SPEAKER_0:  What?

00:22:42,914 --> 00:22:43,646
SPEAKER_0:  wisdom.

00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:44,574
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:22:45,346 --> 00:22:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  Have you been able to find?

00:22:46,914 --> 00:22:51,166
SPEAKER_0:  from God about why there is suffering in the world, why there is cruelty.

00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:56,542
SPEAKER_1:  You know, there's a saying that I wanted to ask God about why he allows hunger and war.

00:22:56,962 --> 00:22:57,694
SPEAKER_1:  and poverty.

00:22:58,114 --> 00:22:59,998
SPEAKER_1:  but I was afraid he might ask me the same question.

00:23:01,826 --> 00:23:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  God has certainly given us enough food. There is enough food in the world.

00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,798
SPEAKER_1:  for everyone to have a 3200 calorie diet a day.

00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:12,670
SPEAKER_1:  God has certainly given us enough guidance.

00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,870
SPEAKER_1:  for us to not inflict on each other.

00:23:16,418 --> 00:23:17,886
SPEAKER_1:  the cruelty that we inflict.

00:23:18,562 --> 00:23:27,006
SPEAKER_1:  When we look to the world around us, first and foremost, we have to have a sense of accountability. We are accountable for our own actions. We don't blame God.

00:23:27,426 --> 00:23:28,574
SPEAKER_1:  for the evil of man.

00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:29,630
SPEAKER_1:  That's one.

00:23:30,946 --> 00:23:34,686
SPEAKER_1:  But at the same time, we understand that God and His wisdom...

00:23:35,202 --> 00:23:35,998
SPEAKER_1:  allows

00:23:36,578 --> 00:23:40,350
SPEAKER_1:  for certain outcomes that we cannot encompass with our own.

00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,142
SPEAKER_1:  and that...

00:23:42,882 --> 00:23:44,606
SPEAKER_1:  to isolate these incidents.

00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,678
SPEAKER_1:  and to try to make sense of them.

00:23:48,418 --> 00:23:49,598
SPEAKER_1:  is no different than...

00:23:50,306 --> 00:23:51,390
SPEAKER_1:  A baby in the womb.

00:23:52,546 --> 00:23:59,742
SPEAKER_1:  that doesn't understand the world that it's coming into and trying to explain to that baby that hasn't yet developed its own senses and its own perception of this world.

00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,110
SPEAKER_1:  what is happening to it.

00:24:02,562 --> 00:24:06,046
SPEAKER_1:  I often think of the example of a child.

00:24:06,882 --> 00:24:07,646
SPEAKER_1:  you know, having.

00:24:08,194 --> 00:24:08,638
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:24:09,122 --> 00:24:11,838
SPEAKER_1:  been at this point now through the experience of.

00:24:13,026 --> 00:24:15,870
SPEAKER_1:  I'm still learning. I'm just going into...

00:24:16,514 --> 00:24:18,782
SPEAKER_1:  having a teenager with three kids.

00:24:19,426 --> 00:24:23,742
SPEAKER_1:  and being a softie for my kids, you know, when you have to tell your child.

00:24:24,226 --> 00:24:25,662
SPEAKER_1:  that they can't have something.

00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,550
SPEAKER_1:  that they really, really want.

00:24:28,418 --> 00:24:29,406
SPEAKER_1:  and that child.

00:24:29,698 --> 00:24:32,382
SPEAKER_1:  you hate them at some point, you know, because...

00:24:32,706 --> 00:24:34,430
SPEAKER_1:  Why are you stopping me from?

00:24:35,202 --> 00:24:35,646
SPEAKER_1:  pudding.

00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,278
SPEAKER_1:  this toy in my mouth.

00:24:37,762 --> 00:24:40,222
SPEAKER_1:  and choking myself.

00:24:40,738 --> 00:24:43,294
SPEAKER_1:  They don't get it, right? But at the same time.

00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:44,990
SPEAKER_1:  you prevent them out of love.

00:24:45,826 --> 00:24:48,702
SPEAKER_1:  They're not in a position to understand that you're preventing them out of love.

00:24:49,794 --> 00:24:50,334
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:24:50,594 --> 00:24:54,334
SPEAKER_1:  to isolate these incidents with God and to say the wisdom.

00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:59,774
SPEAKER_1:  what's the wisdom? You're trying to make sense of a pixel when you can't see the bigger picture.

00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,206
SPEAKER_1:  Your mind is nuts.

00:25:02,562 --> 00:25:06,558
SPEAKER_1:  at a place where you can make sense of the bigger picture. You haven't seen the bigger picture.

00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:08,094
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

00:25:09,154 --> 00:25:11,646
SPEAKER_1:  for him to even explain to us every incident.

00:25:12,482 --> 00:25:14,654
SPEAKER_1:  would completely defeat the purpose.

00:25:14,882 --> 00:25:15,966
SPEAKER_1:  of putting your trust in him.

00:25:16,706 --> 00:25:17,182
SPEAKER_1:  So.

00:25:18,146 --> 00:25:19,166
SPEAKER_1:  We believe in a God.

00:25:19,682 --> 00:25:22,526
SPEAKER_1:  that is all-encompassing in his knowledge and wisdom.

00:25:23,394 --> 00:25:27,934
SPEAKER_1:  that gives us, and Islam is very specific by the way that there is what God...

00:25:28,546 --> 00:25:31,038
SPEAKER_1:  tells us to do and there's what God allows to happen.

00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:39,070
SPEAKER_1:  So what God tells us to do in terms of the roadmap towards good, and then what God allows to happen in His divine wisdom that no outcome can escape.

00:25:39,362 --> 00:25:39,678
SPEAKER_1:  Him.

00:25:40,258 --> 00:25:43,358
SPEAKER_1:  but at the same time we are accountable for our own actions and our own deeds.

00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:44,958
SPEAKER_1:  So when you.

00:25:45,218 --> 00:25:46,302
SPEAKER_1:  come to someone and say, you know.

00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:49,310
SPEAKER_1:  Why did God allow this to happen to this person?

00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,582
SPEAKER_1:  I can't rationalize that.

00:25:51,938 --> 00:25:52,798
SPEAKER_1:  for you because.

00:25:53,026 --> 00:25:55,390
SPEAKER_1:  My understanding is relegated.

00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,222
SPEAKER_1:  to.

00:25:56,642 --> 00:25:58,462
SPEAKER_1:  the immediate experience in front of me.

00:26:00,738 --> 00:26:01,822
SPEAKER_1:  If I know God.

00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,998
SPEAKER_1:  and if I learn about God.

00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:05,310
SPEAKER_1:  then.

00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:08,382
SPEAKER_1:  I don't have to make sense of the plan.

00:26:08,802 --> 00:26:10,622
SPEAKER_1:  but I can tell you that I trust the planner.

00:26:11,874 --> 00:26:13,822
SPEAKER_1:  And I think that that's where peace is found.

00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,750
SPEAKER_1:  You know, a lot of times you look for the light at the end of the tunnel. What's the light at the end of the tunnel?

00:26:19,234 --> 00:26:22,366
SPEAKER_1:  In Islam, there's emphasis on God and the hereafter.

00:26:22,722 --> 00:26:23,934
SPEAKER_1:  because to try to make...

00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,182
SPEAKER_1:  sense of.

00:26:25,858 --> 00:26:26,206
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:28,062
SPEAKER_1:  Divine Decree and

00:26:28,706 --> 00:26:30,494
SPEAKER_1:  why certain things happen in this world.

00:26:31,202 --> 00:26:34,366
SPEAKER_1:  without the existence of a God or without the existence of a hereafter.

00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:36,222
SPEAKER_1:  will always fail you.

00:26:36,642 --> 00:26:38,302
SPEAKER_1:  So the existence of a God.

00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,382
SPEAKER_1:  that is all knowing what we don't know.

00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,726
SPEAKER_1:  I know what you don't know.

00:26:42,178 --> 00:26:43,966
SPEAKER_1:  that understands what we don't understand.

00:26:44,482 --> 00:26:46,430
SPEAKER_1:  the existence of a God who is not.

00:26:46,658 --> 00:26:48,990
SPEAKER_1:  subject to our constrictions.

00:26:49,986 --> 00:26:50,462
SPEAKER_1:  And...

00:26:50,914 --> 00:26:52,606
SPEAKER_1:  the existence of a hereafter.

00:26:53,186 --> 00:26:53,630
SPEAKER_1:  where...

00:26:54,402 --> 00:26:56,222
SPEAKER_1:  All things find recourse.

00:26:56,738 --> 00:26:58,142
SPEAKER_1:  where there is divine recourse.

00:26:59,298 --> 00:27:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  allows for this world to be situated within the existence of something greater and not treated in isolation.

00:27:05,794 --> 00:27:06,814
SPEAKER_1:  So when you're trying to treat.

00:27:07,266 --> 00:27:09,342
SPEAKER_1:  an incident of this world in isolation.

00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:17,694
SPEAKER_1:  you're going to fail. And when you try to treat existence in this world and of this world in isolation, you're also going to fail. And so the emphasis is the belief in God.

00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,414
SPEAKER_1:  A God that is not limited.

00:27:20,962 --> 00:27:21,662
SPEAKER_1:  like you are.

00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:23,710
SPEAKER_1:  and a belief in the hereafter.

00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,526
SPEAKER_1:  that is not limited like this life.

00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,662
SPEAKER_1:  And so everything continues onwards.

00:27:29,954 --> 00:27:32,094
SPEAKER_1:  and there's divine recourse for everything.

00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:36,126
SPEAKER_1:  Each and everything, you know, the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, mentions that.

00:27:37,538 --> 00:27:41,310
SPEAKER_1:  on the day of judgment, a person who lived the most difficult of lives.

00:27:41,922 --> 00:27:43,998
SPEAKER_1:  will be dipped into paradise one time.

00:27:44,354 --> 00:27:49,918
SPEAKER_1:  and will be told, have you ever seen any sadness, any hardship? Now when you think about the most difficult,

00:27:50,306 --> 00:27:50,750
SPEAKER_1:  life.

00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:53,854
SPEAKER_1:  Some of the commentators in Islam, they said that...

00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:57,374
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, this is perhaps referring to the Prophet Job.

00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,038
SPEAKER_1:  Ayub. Peace be upon him.

00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:02,046
SPEAKER_1:  because Job lived obviously a life of great difficulty.

00:28:02,498 --> 00:28:06,462
SPEAKER_1:  but that a person who lived a very hard life would be dipped into paradise one time.

00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:07,646
SPEAKER_1:  And just with a dip.

00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:10,174
SPEAKER_1:  be asked, have you ever seen any hardship?

00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,126
SPEAKER_1:  Have you ever seen any misery?

00:28:12,706 --> 00:28:17,054
SPEAKER_1:  And that person would say, what is sadness? What is hardship? What is misery? Now, if you don't believe in-

00:28:17,378 --> 00:28:18,814
SPEAKER_1:  Hereafter, if you don't believe in-

00:28:19,234 --> 00:28:20,894
SPEAKER_1:  anything beyond this life, then

00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:25,886
SPEAKER_1:  The recourse has to happen in this life. And because we see so many people pass through this life.

00:28:27,074 --> 00:28:28,222
SPEAKER_1:  without recourse.

00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,430
SPEAKER_1:  of cruelty without recourse.

00:28:30,786 --> 00:28:31,454
SPEAKER_1:  of suffering.

00:28:32,098 --> 00:28:37,918
SPEAKER_1:  Then we're forced to try to make sense of it. And if you are someone who believes that this entire world came into existence,

00:28:38,402 --> 00:28:38,750
SPEAKER_1:  through.

00:28:39,554 --> 00:28:42,494
SPEAKER_1:  uh, randomness that were just an existence of.

00:28:43,202 --> 00:28:44,382
SPEAKER_1:  random atoms that...

00:28:44,738 --> 00:28:47,774
SPEAKER_1:  collide with each other and that all of this comes together out of nothing.

00:28:48,482 --> 00:28:51,294
SPEAKER_1:  then how can you put your trust in anything that is greater?

00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:52,958
SPEAKER_1:  So as a.

00:28:53,218 --> 00:28:56,350
SPEAKER_1:  You know, you asked me as a child of a parent who suffered.

00:28:57,346 --> 00:28:58,526
SPEAKER_1:  I believe that.

00:28:59,234 --> 00:29:00,254
SPEAKER_1:  every moment.

00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:01,086
SPEAKER_1:  that.

00:29:01,538 --> 00:29:02,206
SPEAKER_1:  My mother.

00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:03,646
SPEAKER_1:  suffered.

00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,950
SPEAKER_1:  that she will be rewarded.

00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,414
SPEAKER_1:  that she will be elevated, that all of that...

00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,254
SPEAKER_1:  made her or contributed to the beautiful person that she was.

00:29:12,578 --> 00:29:14,206
SPEAKER_1:  and will contribute to the beautiful.

00:29:14,562 --> 00:29:16,542
SPEAKER_1:  reward that she receives and the

00:29:16,962 --> 00:29:17,726
SPEAKER_1:  recourse.

00:29:18,178 --> 00:29:20,254
SPEAKER_1:  is certain to me as a believer in that.

00:29:21,282 --> 00:29:22,398
SPEAKER_1:  to the right approach.

00:29:22,562 --> 00:29:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  to making sense of the world.

00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  especially making sense of suffering and cruelty is that of humility.

00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  that we as humans

00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  cannot possibly understand.

00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  fully.

00:29:34,626 --> 00:29:38,110
SPEAKER_1:  Absolutely. In fact, in the Quran, it's very interesting when God creates Adam.

00:29:39,106 --> 00:29:40,574
SPEAKER_1:  the angels say to God.

00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:42,686
SPEAKER_1:  Are you going to create?

00:29:43,714 --> 00:29:45,950
SPEAKER_1:  a race or a species.

00:29:46,402 --> 00:29:47,486
SPEAKER_1:  that will spill blood.

00:29:47,714 --> 00:29:48,734
SPEAKER_1:  and cause corruption?

00:29:49,634 --> 00:29:52,446
SPEAKER_1:  And God says to the angels in response to that question.

00:29:52,962 --> 00:29:54,430
SPEAKER_1:  I know that which you don't know.

00:29:55,170 --> 00:30:00,446
SPEAKER_1:  So even the angels have to humble themselves for a moment. The angels who adore God, who love God, who...

00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:01,982
SPEAKER_1:  Worship Him Who...

00:30:02,402 --> 00:30:03,678
SPEAKER_1:  obey Him unconditionally.

00:30:04,034 --> 00:30:04,862
SPEAKER_1:  They are told.

00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:07,614
SPEAKER_1:  By God, I know that which you don't know.

00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:09,022
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:30:09,346 --> 00:30:14,110
SPEAKER_1:  What we extract from that, what many of the early interpretations extract from that is that

00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:17,502
SPEAKER_1:  God knows that there are human beings.

00:30:17,794 --> 00:30:20,222
SPEAKER_1:  that will come out of this enterprise.

00:30:20,706 --> 00:30:21,502
SPEAKER_1:  of humanity.

00:30:22,146 --> 00:30:24,606
SPEAKER_1:  that make the entire existence of it worth it.

00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:26,590
SPEAKER_1:  And so just as yes, there will be.

00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:28,478
SPEAKER_1:  criminals and corrupt ones.

00:30:29,282 --> 00:30:31,166
SPEAKER_1:  There will be profits and

00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:35,806
SPEAKER_1:  beautiful people that come out of this and sages and saints that come out of this.

00:30:36,514 --> 00:30:37,118
SPEAKER_1:  show.

00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:38,046
SPEAKER_1:  dot

00:30:38,466 --> 00:30:39,358
SPEAKER_1:  a human being.

00:30:40,162 --> 00:30:45,886
SPEAKER_1:  who unlike an angel who has no choice but to worship God, an angel has no sense of will, no sense of choice, an angel.

00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,358
SPEAKER_1:  is created to worship.

00:30:47,842 --> 00:30:50,686
SPEAKER_1:  and has no desires, a human being who has the choice.

00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:51,934
SPEAKER_1:  of desire.

00:30:52,418 --> 00:30:57,950
SPEAKER_1:  and worship, the choice of righteousness and wickedness, that there are human beings who will choose worship and righteousness.

00:30:58,562 --> 00:31:00,510
SPEAKER_1:  that will choose charity over cruelty.

00:31:01,346 --> 00:31:02,334
SPEAKER_1:  that will choose.

00:31:02,658 --> 00:31:05,822
SPEAKER_1:  service and choose dedication and devotion.

00:31:06,658 --> 00:31:08,062
SPEAKER_1:  over death and destruction.

00:31:08,802 --> 00:31:12,766
SPEAKER_1:  there are human beings that will in fact ascend the angels in rank.

00:31:13,442 --> 00:31:15,518
SPEAKER_1:  because they will live lives where they...

00:31:16,098 --> 00:31:18,558
SPEAKER_1:  choose that capacity, that part of themselves.

00:31:19,394 --> 00:31:20,766
SPEAKER_1:  And they lean into that.

00:31:21,378 --> 00:31:22,814
SPEAKER_1:  and worship God lovingly.

00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:23,902
SPEAKER_1:  and obey him.

00:31:24,226 --> 00:31:29,726
SPEAKER_1:  You see, some of the sages and Islam scholars, they describe this as saying that the human being has the capacity.

00:31:30,562 --> 00:31:31,582
SPEAKER_1:  to be anywhere from.

00:31:32,162 --> 00:31:32,734
SPEAKER_1:  an animal.

00:31:32,962 --> 00:31:33,566
SPEAKER_1:  to an angel.

00:31:34,114 --> 00:31:35,326
SPEAKER_1:  or even worse, to be a devil.

00:31:35,714 --> 00:31:36,670
SPEAKER_1:  you know, to an angel.

00:31:37,122 --> 00:31:40,894
SPEAKER_1:  not in the sense that we ever actually become angels or become animals, but...

00:31:41,474 --> 00:31:41,822
SPEAKER_1:  that.

00:31:42,338 --> 00:31:43,038
SPEAKER_1:  an animal.

00:31:43,266 --> 00:31:43,646
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:44,670
SPEAKER_1:  for the most part.

00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:45,662
SPEAKER_1:  seeks.

00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,510
SPEAKER_1:  its desires over everything, doesn't really think about.

00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:53,374
SPEAKER_1:  You know, many of the things that we are supposed to calculate as human beings doesn't think about.

00:31:53,794 --> 00:31:55,710
SPEAKER_1:  which territory it's infringing upon.

00:31:56,098 --> 00:32:08,190
SPEAKER_1:  or how much of its appetite it should fulfill. It simply exists to fulfill its appetite and that many human beings simply exist to fulfill their appetite. And they choose that over worship or reason or anything that is greater.

00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,862
SPEAKER_1:  They literally take their selves as gods in that sense.

00:32:13,378 --> 00:32:20,030
SPEAKER_1:  cells have no limitation on appetite. So they just keep filling that appetite and filling that appetite and filling that appetite whereas

00:32:20,866 --> 00:32:22,878
SPEAKER_1:  A human being can also go to the extent.

00:32:23,554 --> 00:32:25,150
SPEAKER_1:  of choosing something greater.

00:32:25,922 --> 00:32:31,326
SPEAKER_1:  and disciplining their desires, disciplining themselves because they're seeking a greater reward.

00:32:31,554 --> 00:32:33,694
SPEAKER_1:  You know, we know many people that are to you great things.

00:32:34,466 --> 00:32:35,582
SPEAKER_1:  in the worldly sense.

00:32:36,194 --> 00:32:39,358
SPEAKER_1:  because they choose to study over sleep, for example.

00:32:40,322 --> 00:32:42,590
SPEAKER_1:  they choose to exert themselves.

00:32:42,978 --> 00:32:45,246
SPEAKER_1:  towards their careers, towards their education.

00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:50,014
SPEAKER_1:  because they believe that ultimately the outcome of those pursuits are more rewarding.

00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,798
SPEAKER_1:  than the immediate fulfillment of their desires.

00:32:53,378 --> 00:32:55,166
SPEAKER_1:  So as believers, we choose...

00:32:55,426 --> 00:32:57,758
SPEAKER_1:  that love of God and we choose that outcome.

00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:58,814
SPEAKER_1:  that we seek.

00:32:59,234 --> 00:33:04,286
SPEAKER_1:  And we discipline ourselves to where we can even ascend past the angels in rank. Now, of course.

00:33:04,546 --> 00:33:07,102
SPEAKER_1:  said we can go as low as an animal or as low as a devil.

00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,374
SPEAKER_1:  And we have tyrants.

00:33:10,018 --> 00:33:11,838
SPEAKER_1:  past and present and future as well.

00:33:12,962 --> 00:33:13,310
SPEAKER_1:  that

00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:14,718
SPEAKER_1:  can become satanic.

00:33:15,042 --> 00:33:15,806
SPEAKER_1:  and their nature.

00:33:16,066 --> 00:33:20,542
SPEAKER_1:  because they allow their desires to take such control over them.

00:33:21,154 --> 00:33:24,350
SPEAKER_1:  that they not only worship them, but that every other...

00:33:24,834 --> 00:33:26,814
SPEAKER_1:  existing being around them.

00:33:27,522 --> 00:33:28,702
SPEAKER_1:  simply becomes.

00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:30,046
SPEAKER_1:  A piece.

00:33:30,434 --> 00:33:36,094
SPEAKER_1:  of their own puzzle in pursuit of their own lordship and their own satisfaction. They will kill. Thank you.

00:33:36,354 --> 00:33:36,990
SPEAKER_1:  Discard.

00:33:37,538 --> 00:33:40,254
SPEAKER_1:  Not because, you know, and I always say this, it's not that tyrants.

00:33:40,962 --> 00:33:42,590
SPEAKER_1:  necessarily like.

00:33:42,882 --> 00:33:44,094
SPEAKER_1:  killing people, it's that.

00:33:44,578 --> 00:33:45,534
SPEAKER_1:  people's lives.

00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:46,814
SPEAKER_1:  uh, pose.

00:33:47,266 --> 00:33:52,350
SPEAKER_1:  somewhat of an indifference to them. They're indifferent to people's existence. And so you become.

00:33:53,442 --> 00:33:55,358
SPEAKER_1:  either an object for

00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,822
SPEAKER_1:  or against me. And so.

00:33:58,434 --> 00:33:59,678
SPEAKER_1:  they're willing to discard.

00:34:00,546 --> 00:34:02,014
SPEAKER_1:  children discard people.

00:34:02,466 --> 00:34:03,838
SPEAKER_1:  discard the rights of others.

00:34:04,482 --> 00:34:06,558
SPEAKER_1:  because they ultimately have chosen.

00:34:07,298 --> 00:34:10,174
SPEAKER_1:  that the greatest pursuit of themselves.

00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:13,502
SPEAKER_1:  is the maximum position of power.

00:34:14,562 --> 00:34:17,406
SPEAKER_1:  and a place to where they can fulfill what they want to.

00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:21,758
SPEAKER_1:  of themselves without any limits and everyone else becomes.

00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:24,574
SPEAKER_1:  either a threat or an opportunity in that regard.

00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:28,574
SPEAKER_1:  So we can be devils, we can be angelic like, we could be animals.

00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,526
SPEAKER_1:  We're somewhere on that spectrum.

00:34:30,946 --> 00:34:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  And every moment contains a set of choices you can make.

00:34:34,562 --> 00:34:37,758
SPEAKER_1:  Absolutely. Every single moment contains a set of choices.

00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,030
SPEAKER_1:  And that's where the intentionality comes in.

00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,246
SPEAKER_1:  All right, so.

00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:43,486
SPEAKER_1:  the Prophet Muhammad.

00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:48,766
SPEAKER_1:  As Peace Be Upon Him says that I saw a person strolling in paradise because he removed something harmful from the road.

00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:50,334
SPEAKER_1:  He-

00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:55,774
SPEAKER_1:  tells us about a woman that lived the life in prostitution, but that

00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:56,958
SPEAKER_1:  Repented.

00:34:57,218 --> 00:34:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  to God when she was thirsty one day.

00:34:59,874 --> 00:35:01,950
SPEAKER_1:  and she saw a dog that was also thirsty.

00:35:02,338 --> 00:35:09,438
SPEAKER_1:  And she said that I was thirsty and God gave me water. So I'm gonna choose to give water to that thirsty dog. And God enters her into paradise as a result of that.

00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,838
SPEAKER_1:  sometimes the small moments.

00:35:12,482 --> 00:35:12,990
SPEAKER_1:  with

00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,814
SPEAKER_1:  A small sincere deed.

00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,590
SPEAKER_1:  can have a huge impact on a person's trajectory.

00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,214
SPEAKER_1:  So every moment is a moment of choices.

00:35:21,634 --> 00:35:22,238
SPEAKER_1:  and.

00:35:22,914 --> 00:35:24,318
SPEAKER_1:  when we choose.

00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,462
SPEAKER_1:  belief righteousness.

00:35:26,818 --> 00:35:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  a pursuit of something greater.

00:35:28,802 --> 00:35:29,246
SPEAKER_1:  then

00:35:29,474 --> 00:35:30,622
SPEAKER_1:  We find ways.

00:35:31,106 --> 00:35:32,062
SPEAKER_1:  to turn things.

00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,494
SPEAKER_1:  that are otherwise mundane.

00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:35,710
SPEAKER_1:  and two.

00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:39,038
SPEAKER_1:  miraculous acts, right? Where we can.

00:35:39,394 --> 00:35:39,742
SPEAKER_1:  We can-

00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,534
SPEAKER_1:  choose God over ourselves.

00:35:42,018 --> 00:35:43,006
SPEAKER_1:  and in the process.

00:35:43,234 --> 00:35:44,926
SPEAKER_1:  choose a better fate for ourselves.

00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  How difficult is the process of?

00:35:47,906 --> 00:35:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  knowing.

00:35:49,218 --> 00:35:51,166
SPEAKER_0:  understanding what is the righteous action.

00:35:52,354 --> 00:35:53,150
SPEAKER_0:  of uh...

00:35:54,274 --> 00:35:56,542
SPEAKER_0:  knowing what it means to be a good man.

00:35:57,634 --> 00:35:58,366
SPEAKER_1:  Oh good woman.

00:35:59,234 --> 00:36:00,862
SPEAKER_1:  Well, the truth has consequences.

00:36:01,282 --> 00:36:01,726
SPEAKER_1:  So.

00:36:02,114 --> 00:36:04,158
SPEAKER_1:  Don't seek out the truth unless you're willing to.

00:36:04,482 --> 00:36:08,350
SPEAKER_1:  Abide by what you find. So a lot of people want to mold.

00:36:09,154 --> 00:36:11,518
SPEAKER_1:  their journey in accordance with.

00:36:11,778 --> 00:36:16,478
SPEAKER_1:  a predetermined pursuit that they already have. And so when they approach religion, they approach it like...

00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,782
SPEAKER_1:  another product, you know, there was a.

00:36:19,202 --> 00:36:25,374
SPEAKER_1:  An article that was actually written by a rabbi, I've spoken about this in several sermons. It was called The Allure of Narcissistic Spirituality.

00:36:25,826 --> 00:36:28,606
SPEAKER_1:  the allure of narcissistic spirituality where he talks about

00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:32,286
SPEAKER_1:  you know how religion becomes just another product of your own.

00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,878
SPEAKER_1:  self-adoration and worship.

00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:37,086
SPEAKER_1:  to where you only approach religion.

00:36:37,346 --> 00:36:38,206
SPEAKER_1:  the extants.

00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:38,846
SPEAKER_1:  that.

00:36:39,266 --> 00:36:40,254
SPEAKER_1:  It gives you...

00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:47,838
SPEAKER_1:  more happiness in the worldly sense. You only approach of it what is therapeutic. So it becomes just.

00:36:48,098 --> 00:36:48,638
SPEAKER_1:  as

00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:49,982
SPEAKER_1:  secular.

00:36:50,722 --> 00:36:56,254
SPEAKER_1:  in its nature as any other practice of meditation or whatever it may be or some other product.

00:36:56,546 --> 00:36:57,662
SPEAKER_1:  kind of mentions, you know how.

00:36:58,434 --> 00:37:00,350
SPEAKER_1:  He took that from a person that...

00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:01,918
SPEAKER_1:  is praying in a temple.

00:37:02,594 --> 00:37:03,262
SPEAKER_1:  ends.

00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:06,814
SPEAKER_1:  A guy walks into the temple and bumps into him, and then he curses the guy out.

00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,702
SPEAKER_1:  So he didn't see his.

00:37:08,994 --> 00:37:11,134
SPEAKER_1:  behavior towards that person as...

00:37:11,554 --> 00:37:11,934
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

00:37:12,418 --> 00:37:13,278
SPEAKER_1:  part of his.

00:37:13,506 --> 00:37:15,070
SPEAKER_1:  trajectory of worship. the

00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,150
SPEAKER_1:  just saw his being godly.

00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:19,614
SPEAKER_1:  as the worship that he was engaged in.

00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  The truth has.

00:37:21,922 --> 00:37:23,326
SPEAKER_1:  consequences, the truth.

00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:24,318
SPEAKER_1:  has.

00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:28,926
SPEAKER_1:  circumstances that are required of you, actions that are required of you that

00:37:29,346 --> 00:37:36,062
SPEAKER_1:  may be somewhat inconvenient. So you have to be willing to engage in a sincere pursuit of truth and look for truth for what it is.

00:37:36,866 --> 00:37:38,974
SPEAKER_1:  and not simply look for comfort and convenience.

00:37:39,618 --> 00:37:42,910
SPEAKER_1:  And when you engage in that journey of

00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,446
SPEAKER_1:  wanting to know.

00:37:45,218 --> 00:37:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  You have to engage it thoroughly.

00:37:47,618 --> 00:37:48,158
SPEAKER_1:  End.

00:37:48,482 --> 00:37:52,990
SPEAKER_1:  sincerely and try your best to remove any bias. I think that's what makes the

00:37:53,506 --> 00:37:55,742
SPEAKER_1:  the religion of Islam such a phenomenon for people.

00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:56,702
SPEAKER_1:  that.

00:37:56,962 --> 00:38:04,702
SPEAKER_1:  with all the Islamophobia and the bigotry towards it, still the fastest growing religion in the United States and the fastest growing religion in the world. No, that's not all birth rate.

00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:05,406
SPEAKER_1:  You

00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:07,038
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, we have a lot of kids.

00:38:08,162 --> 00:38:08,542
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:38:08,962 --> 00:38:10,878
SPEAKER_1:  Many people, you know, you met someone.

00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:15,134
SPEAKER_1:  just before we started this interview, many people in fact in a post-9-11 world.

00:38:16,162 --> 00:38:18,430
SPEAKER_1:  solve what they saw of Islam in the media.

00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  and they actually...

00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:26,718
SPEAKER_1:  you know, went and checked out copies of the Quran and started to read about the religion and their sincere pursuit of truth.

00:38:27,266 --> 00:38:27,870
SPEAKER_1:  End it up.

00:38:28,354 --> 00:38:34,110
SPEAKER_1:  embracing religion that they believed was the greatest source of destruction in the world and now it's the greatest source of peace for them.

00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,542
SPEAKER_1:  in their own existence, in their own lives.

00:38:36,802 --> 00:38:38,014
SPEAKER_1:  You have to be willing.

00:38:38,658 --> 00:38:41,022
SPEAKER_1:  to engage in a sincere pursuit of

00:38:41,378 --> 00:38:42,302
SPEAKER_1:  wanting to know?

00:38:43,138 --> 00:38:44,414
SPEAKER_1:  and then be willing.

00:38:44,994 --> 00:38:47,550
SPEAKER_1:  to engage in sincere commitment after you know.

00:38:47,906 --> 00:38:53,310
SPEAKER_1:  Otherwise, the heart rusts. And so there's a process in the Quran talks about this of making the heart.

00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:54,686
SPEAKER_1:  like fertile soil.

00:38:55,234 --> 00:38:56,030
SPEAKER_1:  towards truth.

00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:02,654
SPEAKER_1:  So you have a sincere pursuit, but then at some point, if you come to know, and then you ignore what you come to know,

00:39:03,202 --> 00:39:08,190
SPEAKER_1:  then the heart rusts and it becomes harder to recognize it the second time around and the third time around. F

00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,590
SPEAKER_1:  When people come to me and they say, you know.

00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:15,070
SPEAKER_1:  I'm looking for something. I'm looking for God. I'm looking for...

00:39:15,714 --> 00:39:16,478
SPEAKER_1:  My purpose.

00:39:16,866 --> 00:39:18,782
SPEAKER_1:  The first thing I tell them is I say, listen.

00:39:19,842 --> 00:39:20,798
SPEAKER_1:  What you need to do is...

00:39:21,186 --> 00:39:26,974
SPEAKER_1:  if you're really looking for God and you believe in God. And there are often people that say, I believe in God, but I don't know.

00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:31,710
SPEAKER_1:  where to go with this. Right? In Islam we call that the Fitra.

00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,046
SPEAKER_1:  a natural disposition towards.

00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,062
SPEAKER_1:  the belief in the existence of God.

00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:36,990
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:39:37,474 --> 00:39:41,470
SPEAKER_1:  But where do I go from here? You know, what do I do now? And I say, the first thing you need to do is

00:39:42,978 --> 00:39:44,126
SPEAKER_1:  You need to sincerely.

00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:46,622
SPEAKER_1:  Say, Oh God, guide me to the truth.

00:39:47,362 --> 00:39:51,710
SPEAKER_1:  Call upon God sincerely, Sam, calling upon you alone, and I'm asking you to guide me to the truth.

00:39:52,002 --> 00:39:52,958
SPEAKER_1:  Show me what it is.

00:39:53,314 --> 00:39:53,694
SPEAKER_1:  All right.

00:39:54,562 --> 00:39:55,134
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:39:55,746 --> 00:39:56,990
SPEAKER_1:  That's the heart function.

00:39:58,082 --> 00:40:01,342
SPEAKER_1:  then you need to actually investigate and try to suspend bias.

00:40:01,634 --> 00:40:04,222
SPEAKER_1:  right? Investigate the world religions, investigate.

00:40:04,514 --> 00:40:06,494
SPEAKER_1:  the claims to truth.

00:40:06,786 --> 00:40:08,254
SPEAKER_1:  uh... investigate

00:40:08,738 --> 00:40:12,254
SPEAKER_1:  uh, use, you know, rational inquiry to the extent that.

00:40:12,642 --> 00:40:14,078
SPEAKER_1:  the heart becomes satisfied.

00:40:14,818 --> 00:40:15,390
SPEAKER_1:  End.

00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,246
SPEAKER_1:  Suspend bias.

00:40:17,826 --> 00:40:19,326
SPEAKER_1:  and you'll be surprised.

00:40:19,554 --> 00:40:20,766
SPEAKER_1:  And so for a lot of people.

00:40:21,442 --> 00:40:22,974
SPEAKER_1:  They come to me and they say, you know.

00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,278
SPEAKER_1:  this about Islam, I'm like, look, I'm...

00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,846
SPEAKER_1:  If you're just going to talk to me about what you've seen of Islam in the media, if you were serious about it.

00:40:31,298 --> 00:40:32,766
SPEAKER_1:  You know, if you're serious about it, then.

00:40:33,538 --> 00:40:34,974
SPEAKER_1:  You're not simply

00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:36,670
SPEAKER_1:  going to be satisfied.

00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:37,694
SPEAKER_1:  with.

00:40:38,626 --> 00:40:39,070
SPEAKER_1:  The.

00:40:39,394 --> 00:40:43,998
SPEAKER_1:  highly edited images and distorted facts that come towards you.

00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:45,438
SPEAKER_1:  about this.

00:40:45,826 --> 00:40:46,366
SPEAKER_1:  Religion.

00:40:48,066 --> 00:40:51,838
SPEAKER_1:  What are you looking for? Right? Are you looking for a scapegoat?

00:40:52,098 --> 00:40:59,934
SPEAKER_1:  Islam poses a threat to many people. Right? Are you looking for a scapegoat? Are you looking for the big, bad, scary foreign enemy?

00:41:00,738 --> 00:41:01,854
SPEAKER_1:  or are you looking at?

00:41:02,786 --> 00:41:06,270
SPEAKER_1:  a religion that one fourth of the world adheres to.

00:41:06,754 --> 00:41:08,286
SPEAKER_1:  and if one fourth of us were bad.

00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:10,174
SPEAKER_1:  the world would not exist.

00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:19,262
SPEAKER_1:  Right, so are you looking towards this religion that one fourth of the world adheres to? Are you going to read about the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him? Are you going to read the Quran yourself? Are you going to...

00:41:19,842 --> 00:41:21,214
SPEAKER_1:  Investigate for yourself.

00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,830
SPEAKER_1:  what it is that this faith has to offer and find in it.

00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:26,878
SPEAKER_1:  a great sense of.

00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:30,494
SPEAKER_1:  of wisdom, a great sense of beauty, a great sense of truth.

00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,374
SPEAKER_1:  And I think that for a lot of people.

00:41:34,018 --> 00:41:37,854
SPEAKER_1:  You know, they find that Islam has such a beautiful combination of

00:41:38,594 --> 00:41:41,854
SPEAKER_1:  the intellectual proofs as well as the spiritual experiences that.

00:41:42,594 --> 00:41:43,614
SPEAKER_1:  often combine?

00:41:43,906 --> 00:41:47,902
SPEAKER_1:  what people seek in the Western and the Eastern religion. So I had an interesting.

00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:48,798
SPEAKER_1:  two weeks.

00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:50,622
SPEAKER_1:  Two weeks in a row.

00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:55,870
SPEAKER_1:  Um, this was August, two weeks in a row. I had someone who converted to Islam.

00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:57,598
SPEAKER_1:  that went from being

00:41:58,018 --> 00:41:59,742
SPEAKER_1:  that started off as a Methodist.

00:42:00,194 --> 00:42:02,334
SPEAKER_1:  went from being a Methodist to being a Buddhist to being a Muslim.

00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:06,142
SPEAKER_1:  So two weeks in a row I had a Methodist turned Buddhist turned Muslim.

00:42:06,594 --> 00:42:10,750
SPEAKER_1:  Great journey. Yeah, I called my Methodist friends. I have a lot of-

00:42:11,202 --> 00:42:18,206
SPEAKER_1:  Methodist pastors in the city that I work with. And I said, what's going on here, man, you sending people onto this interesting journey of Buddhism and then Islam?

00:42:18,914 --> 00:42:24,414
SPEAKER_1:  But both of them had a very similar story, which is that they had sought in Buddhism, for example, the...

00:42:25,186 --> 00:42:28,062
SPEAKER_1:  you know, some of the meditative practices that are found.

00:42:28,482 --> 00:42:31,518
SPEAKER_1:  that really Western religion, which has been dominated by.

00:42:31,746 --> 00:42:32,670
SPEAKER_1:  capitalism and

00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:35,518
SPEAKER_1:  dominated by very material things.

00:42:36,002 --> 00:42:41,918
SPEAKER_1:  can be very unfulfilling. They found that in some of the Eastern philosophies and the meditative practices and then they came to Islam.

00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:47,038
SPEAKER_1:  and it combines their belief in sort of the Abrahamic way.

00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:48,574
SPEAKER_1:  It emerged.

00:42:48,898 --> 00:42:50,974
SPEAKER_1:  their belief in one God and

00:42:51,234 --> 00:42:51,870
SPEAKER_1:  profits.

00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:56,542
SPEAKER_1:  like Abraham and Moses and Jesus, peace be upon them all, with.

00:42:57,282 --> 00:42:58,686
SPEAKER_1:  a deep tradition.

00:42:59,394 --> 00:43:05,342
SPEAKER_1:  of meditative practices, of consciousness, of connection to God on a regular basis, and they found that to be very fulfilling.

00:43:05,698 --> 00:43:06,750
SPEAKER_1:  both intellectually.

00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:07,934
SPEAKER_1:  and spiritually.

00:43:08,354 --> 00:43:14,590
SPEAKER_1:  And so I was like, that's interesting, you know, two people in two weeks that went through that journey. So I think Islam is very wholesome.

00:43:15,298 --> 00:43:17,630
SPEAKER_1:  comprehensive when people actually approach it.

00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:18,398
SPEAKER_1:  with

00:43:18,754 --> 00:43:19,390
SPEAKER_1:  humility.

00:43:19,938 --> 00:43:20,766
SPEAKER_1:  And uh...

00:43:21,378 --> 00:43:23,230
SPEAKER_1:  and appreciate what it has to offer.

00:43:25,026 --> 00:43:26,430
SPEAKER_0:  As you mentioned,

00:43:27,298 --> 00:43:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  In the minds of some Americans, after 9-11, the religion of Islam was associated with

00:43:35,234 --> 00:43:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe you could say evil in the world. Maybe you can say.

00:43:39,426 --> 00:43:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  uh, terrorism.

00:43:41,122 --> 00:43:43,422
SPEAKER_0:  How can you respond to this association?

00:43:43,682 --> 00:43:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  How does it make you feel, first of all, as a devout Muslim yourself?

00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:48,638
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:43:49,314 --> 00:43:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  How can you overcome it?

00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:54,366
SPEAKER_0:  Personally, how can you overcome it as a community and as a religious leader?

00:43:55,586 --> 00:43:57,694
SPEAKER_1:  It's interesting because 9 11 now.

00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:00,638
SPEAKER_1:  We're talking over 21 years ago.

00:44:01,506 --> 00:44:02,814
SPEAKER_1:  You know, there's people born.

00:44:03,106 --> 00:44:04,981
SPEAKER_0:  after 9-11. It's crazy.

00:44:04,981 --> 00:44:05,982
SPEAKER_1:  them all the time.

00:44:06,466 --> 00:44:11,454
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so when I'm talking to young Muslims, I'm talking about post-9-11, post-9-11, they're like, I didn't-

00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:15,710
SPEAKER_1:  I was born in 2005. What are you talking about post 9-11? I'm like, well, you know.

00:44:15,938 --> 00:44:19,550
SPEAKER_1:  I remember being a teenager. I remember being in high school and this happened. Right. A lot of us.

00:44:19,842 --> 00:44:25,662
SPEAKER_1:  that experienced 9-11 as high schoolers or as college students and remember distinctly what it was like to be a Muslim.

00:44:26,082 --> 00:44:27,966
SPEAKER_1:  pre-911 and post-911.

00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:31,742
SPEAKER_1:  uh... we can relate to that experience and we could we could identify

00:44:32,226 --> 00:44:33,150
SPEAKER_1:  That juncture.

00:44:33,506 --> 00:44:34,782
SPEAKER_1:  you know, very clearly.

00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:38,942
SPEAKER_1:  and talk about it and speak to the change in the perceptions of Islam.

00:44:39,682 --> 00:44:42,078
SPEAKER_1:  that happen here in the United States and around the world.

00:44:42,434 --> 00:44:43,006
SPEAKER_1:  but a lot of.

00:44:43,426 --> 00:44:46,942
SPEAKER_1:  young people are born into that reality and are experiencing.

00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:48,318
SPEAKER_1:  the aftermath.

00:44:48,898 --> 00:44:49,598
SPEAKER_1:  of it.

00:44:50,306 --> 00:44:51,198
SPEAKER_1:  And, um,

00:44:51,874 --> 00:44:54,398
SPEAKER_1:  You don't unfortunately have to deal with the bigotry that has.

00:44:54,754 --> 00:44:55,166
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:56,158
SPEAKER_1:  Not just...

00:44:56,482 --> 00:44:57,630
SPEAKER_1:  you know, taken.

00:44:57,858 --> 00:44:59,870
SPEAKER_1:  greater shape in.

00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,726
SPEAKER_1:  Media Constructions of Islam.

00:45:02,338 --> 00:45:06,430
SPEAKER_1:  but also policies, right? a lot of the civil liberties of the muslim community

00:45:06,978 --> 00:45:11,422
SPEAKER_1:  uh... we're taking away from us you read about the patriot act to read about the securitization

00:45:11,874 --> 00:45:13,214
SPEAKER_1:  of the Muslim community.

00:45:13,474 --> 00:45:19,102
SPEAKER_1:  and some of the unfair practices that have been engaged by the Bush administration, the Obama administration, the Trump administration.

00:45:19,426 --> 00:45:21,182
SPEAKER_1:  and continue into the Biden administration.

00:45:21,698 --> 00:45:24,446
SPEAKER_1:  international Islamophobia.

00:45:25,474 --> 00:45:28,606
SPEAKER_1:  the hatred of Muslims and the bigotry.

00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:29,918
SPEAKER_1:  That is...

00:45:30,146 --> 00:45:31,006
SPEAKER_1:  wielded against.

00:45:31,554 --> 00:45:34,718
SPEAKER_1:  Muslims on the basis of this idea that we are.

00:45:35,106 --> 00:45:36,254
SPEAKER_1:  are barbaric people.

00:45:37,538 --> 00:45:40,254
SPEAKER_1:  ascribed to a religion of hate and violence.

00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:41,470
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:43,934
SPEAKER_1:  has had immediate.

00:45:44,578 --> 00:45:48,894
SPEAKER_1:  consequences for us no matter where we are in terms of our age.

00:45:49,954 --> 00:45:53,406
SPEAKER_1:  in terms of our experience. We have dealt with that in different ways. Now,

00:45:55,042 --> 00:45:57,086
SPEAKER_1:  The Association of Islam.

00:45:57,506 --> 00:45:58,142
SPEAKER_1:  terrorism.

00:45:58,658 --> 00:45:59,966
SPEAKER_1:  is a lazy association.

00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:02,590
SPEAKER_1:  It's one that ignores.

00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  both.

00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:05,694
SPEAKER_1:  The history of violence.

00:46:06,498 --> 00:46:08,254
SPEAKER_1:  as well as its everyday occurrence.

00:46:09,346 --> 00:46:11,422
SPEAKER_1:  You know, we're good for how many mass shootings a year.

00:46:12,194 --> 00:46:15,390
SPEAKER_1:  When's the last time you heard of a Muslim carrying out a mass shooting in America?

00:46:16,098 --> 00:46:18,302
SPEAKER_1:  Alright, how many of those mass shootings?

00:46:18,626 --> 00:46:22,366
SPEAKER_1:  if you were to scrub the social media, what 400, 500 mass shootings a year,

00:46:23,298 --> 00:46:26,718
SPEAKER_1:  were to scrub the social media of some of those that carried out those shootings.

00:46:27,074 --> 00:46:29,630
SPEAKER_1:  You know, we're good for one or two idiots a year, right?

00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:32,158
SPEAKER_1:  unfortunate that you're going to have people that.

00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:35,742
SPEAKER_1:  uh... that carry out despicable acts of violence

00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:36,798
SPEAKER_1:  But.

00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:40,254
SPEAKER_1:  when we as Muslims hear someone in the media say

00:46:40,802 --> 00:46:43,326
SPEAKER_1:  Terrorism has been ruled out as a possibility.

00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:46,974
SPEAKER_1:  while the blood is still on the floor of that Walmart?

00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:48,286
SPEAKER_1:  We already know that.

00:46:48,546 --> 00:46:50,654
SPEAKER_1:  The police chief just said that that wasn't a Muslim.

00:46:50,882 --> 00:46:51,390
SPEAKER_1:  Don't worry.

00:46:51,938 --> 00:46:54,174
SPEAKER_1:  you know, that wasn't all, sorry, the guy or an ISIS guy.

00:46:54,754 --> 00:46:55,134
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

00:46:55,394 --> 00:46:56,670
SPEAKER_1:  It was one of our own.

00:46:56,898 --> 00:46:58,942
SPEAKER_1:  Right. And so it's, it's become

00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,798
SPEAKER_1:  frankly ridiculous.

00:47:01,058 --> 00:47:01,694
SPEAKER_1:  Because...

00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:05,278
SPEAKER_1:  the association of violence with Islam.

00:47:06,178 --> 00:47:08,414
SPEAKER_1:  is one that is used.

00:47:08,642 --> 00:47:09,438
SPEAKER_1:  to actually

00:47:09,794 --> 00:47:10,174
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

00:47:11,074 --> 00:47:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  Carry out acts of violence against Muslims worldwide. It justifies bad policy towards Muslims worldwide.

00:47:17,442 --> 00:47:18,942
SPEAKER_1:  and then in the United States.

00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:21,278
SPEAKER_1:  And it's just factually so lazy.

00:47:21,762 --> 00:47:27,294
SPEAKER_1:  There was a study just about how the media gives more attention to acts of violence done by Muslims.

00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:28,606
SPEAKER_1:  and immediately.

00:47:28,834 --> 00:47:30,494
SPEAKER_1:  uh... stamps it with the slam

00:47:31,106 --> 00:47:33,342
SPEAKER_1:  up to 300% more than it will.

00:47:33,762 --> 00:47:37,182
SPEAKER_1:  with another act of violence carried out in the name of anything else. So.

00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:40,670
SPEAKER_1:  you don't hear about the acts of violence that are carried out by others.

00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:43,966
SPEAKER_1:  You don't hear about the religion of the perpetrators.

00:47:45,058 --> 00:47:48,894
SPEAKER_1:  You don't associate terrorism with actions, frankly, of state terrorism.

00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:50,110
SPEAKER_1:  You know, when

00:47:50,338 --> 00:47:51,230
SPEAKER_1:  Governments.

00:47:51,714 --> 00:47:52,382
SPEAKER_1:  Launch.

00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:54,750
SPEAKER_1:  chemical attacks or drone weddings.

00:47:55,746 --> 00:47:59,134
SPEAKER_1:  and do so while explicitly dehumanizing the people.

00:47:59,618 --> 00:48:00,894
SPEAKER_1:  just because they do so.

00:48:02,146 --> 00:48:05,630
SPEAKER_1:  with the government apparatus doesn't make it any less.

00:48:05,986 --> 00:48:06,718
SPEAKER_1:  terroristic.

00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:12,062
SPEAKER_1:  than if it's a lone person that goes out and commits an act of violence trying to achieve a political goal.

00:48:13,378 --> 00:48:15,806
SPEAKER_1:  So the association is lazy, historically speaking.

00:48:16,514 --> 00:48:25,630
SPEAKER_1:  crusades. I grew up in Louisiana. I saw clan rallies, Ku Klux Klan rallies my whole life. People said, well, that's a thing of the past. Well, guess what? We see.

00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,838
SPEAKER_1:  many some ones as many acts.

00:48:28,386 --> 00:48:28,766
SPEAKER_1: .

00:48:29,442 --> 00:48:31,294
SPEAKER_1:  are carried out with the same.

00:48:31,586 --> 00:48:34,462
SPEAKER_1:  vitriol that was generated by the Ku Klux Klan.

00:48:35,778 --> 00:48:38,334
SPEAKER_1:  We have people standing in front of our mosques.

00:48:38,594 --> 00:48:41,790
SPEAKER_1:  that belong to right-wing hate militias carrying...

00:48:42,082 --> 00:48:45,822
SPEAKER_1:  AR-15s talking about wanting to inflict harm on Muslims.

00:48:46,082 --> 00:48:46,814
SPEAKER_1:  I have been.

00:48:47,234 --> 00:48:48,798
SPEAKER_1:  to Christchurch, New Zealand.

00:48:49,314 --> 00:48:50,654
SPEAKER_1:  and buried the victims.

00:48:50,946 --> 00:48:51,422
SPEAKER_1:  of

00:48:51,714 --> 00:48:54,270
SPEAKER_1:  a white supremacist terrorist who was inspired by

00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:59,422
SPEAKER_1:  the political rhetoric here in the United States, in his own words, in his manifesto, to go and kill.

00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:00,862
SPEAKER_1:  50 innocent people.

00:49:01,218 --> 00:49:03,902
SPEAKER_1:  and Christchurch in Zealand, one of the most peaceful cities in the world.

00:49:04,578 --> 00:49:07,518
SPEAKER_1:  And by the way, Lex, I mean, it's really interesting, like with Christchurch.

00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:08,926
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

00:49:09,634 --> 00:49:12,446
SPEAKER_1:  the man wanted and I won't even say his name.

00:49:13,346 --> 00:49:18,302
SPEAKER_1:  But his next target after the two mosques, had he not been stopped, was to go to a Muslim daycare.

00:49:18,946 --> 00:49:20,158
SPEAKER_1:  So what drives someone?

00:49:20,898 --> 00:49:22,142
SPEAKER_1:  to dehumanize people.

00:49:22,754 --> 00:49:27,454
SPEAKER_1:  to that extent that he was willing to go to a daycare and murder a bunch of kids because he saw them.

00:49:27,906 --> 00:49:30,046
SPEAKER_1:  as a demographic threat to civilization.

00:49:30,754 --> 00:49:32,478
SPEAKER_1:  so Muslims are terrorized.

00:49:33,506 --> 00:49:34,302
SPEAKER_1:  because.

00:49:34,594 --> 00:49:35,646
SPEAKER_1:  They are falsely.

00:49:36,034 --> 00:49:37,662
SPEAKER_1:  depicted as terrorists.

00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,646
SPEAKER_1:  Muslims suffer.

00:49:40,034 --> 00:49:44,062
SPEAKER_1:  domestically and globally because of this false association. It's a lazy association.

00:49:44,834 --> 00:49:46,462
SPEAKER_1:  And when someone comes around and says, well...

00:49:47,202 --> 00:49:47,582
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:49:47,874 --> 00:49:51,838
SPEAKER_1:  Fine, not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims. I say that.

00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:54,398
SPEAKER_1:  you clearly don't read statistics.

00:49:55,202 --> 00:49:56,350
SPEAKER_1:  whether we're talking about.

00:49:56,642 --> 00:49:57,054
SPEAKER_1:  the

00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:58,654
SPEAKER_1:  20th century.

00:49:58,946 --> 00:50:01,406
SPEAKER_1:  and I'm a student of history and I believe you are as well.

00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,134
SPEAKER_1:  all the isms.

00:50:03,394 --> 00:50:07,646
SPEAKER_1:  World War I, World War II had nothing to do with religion, certainly had nothing to do with Islam.

00:50:08,194 --> 00:50:08,958
SPEAKER_1:  fascism.

00:50:09,442 --> 00:50:13,950
SPEAKER_1:  Soviet atheism, right? Many of these systems where people were murdered.

00:50:14,562 --> 00:50:16,894
SPEAKER_1:  in the millions, Nazism.

00:50:17,442 --> 00:50:20,766
SPEAKER_1:  uh, the Holocaust, Rwanda, Cambodia, I can go on and on.

00:50:21,122 --> 00:50:22,174
SPEAKER_1:  the Rohingya today.

00:50:22,402 --> 00:50:24,478
SPEAKER_1:  the greatest atrocity towards the Uyghurs.

00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:26,558
SPEAKER_1:  Where is Islam fit in all of this?

00:50:26,818 --> 00:50:28,126
SPEAKER_1:  People do horrible things.

00:50:28,962 --> 00:50:30,910
SPEAKER_1:  they stamp it with religion at times.

00:50:31,618 --> 00:50:34,174
SPEAKER_1:  but the only group of people that seem to suffer.

00:50:34,594 --> 00:50:36,574
SPEAKER_1:  after an act of violence is committed.

00:50:37,186 --> 00:50:41,438
SPEAKER_1:  are Muslims because any act of violence that is committed by a Muslim will immediately

00:50:42,018 --> 00:50:43,134
SPEAKER_1:  Be blamed on Islam.

00:50:43,746 --> 00:50:44,254
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:50:44,674 --> 00:50:46,590
SPEAKER_1:  billion people will have to carry the burden.

00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:47,486
SPEAKER_1:  of

00:50:48,034 --> 00:50:50,302
SPEAKER_1:  the act of a single perpetrator.

00:50:51,426 --> 00:50:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  End.

00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  Just to reiterate.

00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  In case the numbers are not known, you mentioned Christchurch.

00:50:57,922 --> 00:51:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  Those are two mask shootings.

00:51:00,962 --> 00:51:04,254
SPEAKER_0:  51 people killed and 48 were injured in New Zealand

00:51:04,738 --> 00:51:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:51:06,306 --> 00:51:07,678
SPEAKER_0:  So it's uh...

00:51:08,962 --> 00:51:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  It's hate manifesting itself in.

00:51:11,618 --> 00:51:12,478
SPEAKER_0:  And then uh...

00:51:12,962 --> 00:51:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  actual human suffering and destruction.

00:51:16,802 --> 00:51:17,310
SPEAKER_0:  Absolutely.

00:51:17,922 --> 00:51:20,542
SPEAKER_0:  Is there similarities between?

00:51:21,986 --> 00:51:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim hate.

00:51:25,186 --> 00:51:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:51:25,794 --> 00:51:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  Is there a-

00:51:26,594 --> 00:51:29,054
SPEAKER_0:  Something deeper to say about hate in general here.

00:51:29,474 --> 00:51:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  that is beyond just.

00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:33,918
SPEAKER_0:  particularly hate towards Muslims.

00:51:34,306 --> 00:51:35,710
SPEAKER_1:  Absolutely. Look, um,

00:51:36,194 --> 00:51:36,926
SPEAKER_1:  in Pittsburgh.

00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:40,670
SPEAKER_1:  the synagogue shooting, the perpetrator particularly target.

00:51:41,154 --> 00:51:41,854
SPEAKER_1:  targeted that.

00:51:42,914 --> 00:51:44,789
SPEAKER_1:  synagogue because tree of life

00:51:44,789 --> 00:51:48,542
SPEAKER_0:  synagogue tree of life synagogue 11 killed 6 wounded in 2018

00:51:49,762 --> 00:51:50,430
SPEAKER_1:  because

00:51:51,202 --> 00:51:52,830
SPEAKER_1:  He believed that they were.

00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:56,766
SPEAKER_1:  taking in Syrian refugees or supporting Syrian Muslim refugees.

00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:58,174
SPEAKER_1:  You think about that.

00:51:59,298 --> 00:52:00,286
SPEAKER_1:  The San Diego.

00:52:00,642 --> 00:52:03,806
SPEAKER_1:  synagogue shooting that took place shortly after.

00:52:04,034 --> 00:52:06,110
SPEAKER_1:  uh... he went to a mosque and then he went to a synagogue

00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:07,582
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:52:08,546 --> 00:52:09,886
SPEAKER_1:  Look, the idea of.

00:52:11,298 --> 00:52:13,726
SPEAKER_1:  scapegoating minority populations.

00:52:14,818 --> 00:52:15,486
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:17,150
SPEAKER_1:  attributing to them.

00:52:18,082 --> 00:52:23,006
SPEAKER_1:  a disproportionate sense of power and a nefarious element where they can't be trusted.

00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:25,470
SPEAKER_1:  and unless we wipe them out.

00:52:26,594 --> 00:52:28,542
SPEAKER_1:  then they're going to wipe us out.

00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:33,118
SPEAKER_1:  underlies many of the bigotries that exist. I mean, look, um...

00:52:33,538 --> 00:52:35,646
SPEAKER_1:  after Trump announced his Muslim ban.

00:52:36,258 --> 00:52:37,630
SPEAKER_1:  There was a shooting in Canada.

00:52:38,178 --> 00:52:40,190
SPEAKER_1:  an attack in Canada on a mosque in Quebec.

00:52:40,738 --> 00:52:41,918
SPEAKER_1:  or six people were killed.

00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:45,758
SPEAKER_1:  the shooter explicitly said that.

00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:48,798
SPEAKER_1:  the reason why he went to that mosque in Quebec.

00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  and shot dead six Muslim worshipers was because he was afraid that because of the ban.

00:52:55,266 --> 00:53:00,414
SPEAKER_1:  on Syrian refugees in the United States, they would come to Canada. And he didn't want them to feel welcomed in Canada.

00:53:02,114 --> 00:53:03,390
SPEAKER_1:  So there is a connection.

00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:08,382
SPEAKER_1:  And I think it's when you are able to dehumanize large groups of people.

00:53:09,378 --> 00:53:09,918
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:11,166
SPEAKER_1:  A tribute.

00:53:11,586 --> 00:53:12,990
SPEAKER_1:  a nefarious element to them.

00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:18,206
SPEAKER_1:  than unfortunately in a world that's becoming more and more polarized where people

00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:21,182
SPEAKER_1:  are able to construct their entire world views.

00:53:21,858 --> 00:53:23,038
SPEAKER_1:  based on an algorithm.

00:53:24,002 --> 00:53:25,214
SPEAKER_1:  that their social media.

00:53:25,762 --> 00:53:26,814
SPEAKER_1:  uh, caters to.

00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:29,438
SPEAKER_1:  you're going to have...

00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:31,102
SPEAKER_1:  some of these.

00:53:31,394 --> 00:53:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  Attacks happen.

00:53:32,706 --> 00:53:36,062
SPEAKER_1:  and there's going to be an unfortunate connection between them.

00:53:37,634 --> 00:53:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  So what I, what I tell people is that, you know, I think with all of these people that shoot up synagogues and shoot up mosques and even before that actually the

00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  Charleston.

00:53:47,074 --> 00:53:48,670
SPEAKER_1:  South Carolina.

00:53:48,962 --> 00:53:50,462
SPEAKER_1:  I was shooting at an AME church.

00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:52,830
SPEAKER_1:  You know?

00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:54,654
SPEAKER_1:  when he went there.

00:53:55,714 --> 00:53:58,750
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, he actually said that before he murdered.

00:53:59,042 --> 00:54:01,214
SPEAKER_1:  nine worshipers in that church.

00:54:02,818 --> 00:54:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  He was taken aback by how nice they were to him. He sat there for two hours before he turned a gun on.

00:54:08,962 --> 00:54:11,038
SPEAKER_1:  many people who are over the age of 80 years old.

00:54:11,714 --> 00:54:12,894
SPEAKER_1:  and murdered them in cold blood.

00:54:14,402 --> 00:54:19,454
SPEAKER_1:  So this is what I talk about when I say that as human beings, we have the propensity, unfortunately.

00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:20,190
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

00:54:21,122 --> 00:54:23,646
SPEAKER_1:  to become worse than devils or we can choose.

00:54:24,354 --> 00:54:25,502
SPEAKER_1:  to be angelic.

00:54:26,434 --> 00:54:28,446
SPEAKER_1:  when we choose worship and righteousness.

00:54:29,026 --> 00:54:30,078
SPEAKER_1:  over ourselves.

00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:33,022
SPEAKER_1:  So that's a spiritual crisis as well.

00:54:33,378 --> 00:54:36,670
SPEAKER_1:  and a crisis of meaning and emptiness.

00:54:37,346 --> 00:54:38,206
SPEAKER_1:  where I think.

00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:43,998
SPEAKER_1:  People are willing to inflict great pain on others when they can't make sense of their pain in their own lives.

00:54:46,786 --> 00:54:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  I'd like to try to figure out together with you sort of...

00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:51,998
SPEAKER_0:  A way out.

00:54:53,282 --> 00:54:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  to try to.

00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  decrease the amount of hate in the world, but...

00:54:57,538 --> 00:55:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe it's useful to talk about the BBC documentary.

00:55:01,378 --> 00:55:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  that uh...

00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  It's kind of interesting that people should check out. It's called United States of Hate, Muslims Under Attack.

00:55:08,418 --> 00:55:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  and you appear in that, you have conversations with people who are.

00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:13,854
SPEAKER_0:  anti-muslim.

00:55:14,146 --> 00:55:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  And it's, I believe most of it takes.

00:55:17,122 --> 00:55:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  place here in Dallas.

00:55:19,554 --> 00:55:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  And can you just tell me about this little documentary about that time, what it was like to interact?

00:55:25,058 --> 00:55:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  What was the group in the documentary and what was it like to interact with them?

00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,462
SPEAKER_1:  you know in the very beginning of uh...

00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  The Rise.

00:55:32,482 --> 00:55:33,086
SPEAKER_1:  of

00:55:33,762 --> 00:55:37,534
SPEAKER_1:  At that time actually, Ted Cruz, Donald Trump, like when Islamophobia...

00:55:38,306 --> 00:55:46,046
SPEAKER_1:  uh, was at the center of many of the presidential candidates campaigns at the time. So this must've been 2015. Yes,

00:55:46,274 --> 00:55:47,294
SPEAKER_1:  2015.

00:55:48,706 --> 00:55:49,214
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:54,142
SPEAKER_1:  the mayor of Irving at the time, Beth Van Dyne, who is now a congresswoman.

00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:55,678
SPEAKER_1:  had

00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:57,470
SPEAKER_1:  put out the idea.

00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:00,798
SPEAKER_1:  that Muslims were operating a Sharia court.

00:56:01,314 --> 00:56:02,398
SPEAKER_1:  in Irving, Texas.

00:56:03,906 --> 00:56:06,270
SPEAKER_1:  and suddenly there was hysteria.

00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:11,230
SPEAKER_1:  Because again, there's the idea that Muslims are here to dominate, Muslims are here to overthrow.

00:56:11,746 --> 00:56:12,510
SPEAKER_1:  everything.

00:56:12,834 --> 00:56:13,630
SPEAKER_1:  that you have.

00:56:13,986 --> 00:56:16,670
SPEAKER_1:  in the United States. There was hysteria here.

00:56:17,858 --> 00:56:20,094
SPEAKER_1:  And it was unfortunate because, um,

00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:21,982
SPEAKER_1:  what it unleashed.

00:56:22,658 --> 00:56:28,446
SPEAKER_1:  You know, especially with the national discourse at the time, again, the presidential campaign, you know, Donald Trump says, I think Islam hates us.

00:56:29,314 --> 00:56:31,582
SPEAKER_1:  When he uses those words, I think Islam hates us.

00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:36,926
SPEAKER_1:  when Ted Cruz suggests that Muslim neighborhoods could be patrolled or should be patrolled.

00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:39,230
SPEAKER_1:  and then you have the Irving Mayer.

00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:40,446
SPEAKER_1:  saying that.

00:56:41,154 --> 00:56:44,606
SPEAKER_1:  one of the most populated cities with Muslims in America.

00:56:45,282 --> 00:56:48,222
SPEAKER_1:  they're operating under an alternative.

00:56:48,546 --> 00:56:50,014
SPEAKER_1:  legal and alternate legal system.

00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:51,038
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:56:52,322 --> 00:56:56,286
SPEAKER_1:  Funny enough, the year before that she'd come to the mosque and she praised the diversity of Irving.

00:56:56,834 --> 00:56:59,838
SPEAKER_1:  she was talking about how welcome she felt in the mosque and the next thing we know.

00:57:00,578 --> 00:57:06,014
SPEAKER_1:  You have these crazy white supremacist groups, openly white supremacists that affiliate themselves with...

00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:07,902
SPEAKER_1:  The Clan and others.

00:57:08,802 --> 00:57:12,030
SPEAKER_1:  protesting regularly in front of our mosques with their AR-15s.

00:57:12,706 --> 00:57:13,246
SPEAKER_1:  end

00:57:13,474 --> 00:57:13,918
SPEAKER_1:  um...

00:57:14,498 --> 00:57:16,286
SPEAKER_1:  telling people to go back home and I'm like.

00:57:16,674 --> 00:57:22,526
SPEAKER_1:  I'm from New Orleans. I'm not planning to move back to New Orleans. I'm home. We're, we're, we're home. We're good. You know, we're, we're staying put.

00:57:23,394 --> 00:57:24,830
SPEAKER_1:  and we refuse to be intimidated.

00:57:25,602 --> 00:57:29,502
SPEAKER_1:  But then when the Syrian refugee crisis is unfolding as well.

00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:31,230
SPEAKER_1:  Dallas has

00:57:31,746 --> 00:57:32,158
SPEAKER_1:  bin.

00:57:32,386 --> 00:57:41,086
SPEAKER_1:  one of the more popular destinations, if you will. I'm not talking about it like a vacation destination, but where a lot of refugees have come to just because of the infrastructure that we have set up here.

00:57:41,698 --> 00:57:43,070
SPEAKER_1:  to receive refugees.

00:57:43,746 --> 00:57:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  And so that hysteria.

00:57:45,506 --> 00:57:46,622
SPEAKER_1:  uh... was

00:57:47,106 --> 00:57:48,030
SPEAKER_1:  an unfortunate.

00:57:48,386 --> 00:57:49,502
SPEAKER_1:  perfect combustion.

00:57:49,922 --> 00:57:53,534
SPEAKER_1:  of the national discourse with the local discourse with the incoming.

00:57:54,114 --> 00:57:55,102
SPEAKER_1:  refugees.

00:57:55,842 --> 00:57:56,414
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:57:56,898 --> 00:57:59,518
SPEAKER_1:  We would do all sorts of welcome refugee events.

00:58:00,034 --> 00:58:00,830
SPEAKER_1:  And we do that.

00:58:01,122 --> 00:58:02,174
SPEAKER_1:  You know, and we don't.

00:58:02,402 --> 00:58:06,494
SPEAKER_1:  only do that for Muslim refugees by the way. There are refugees from other parts of the world as well.

00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:13,150
SPEAKER_1:  But we would host events at our mosques, you know, to welcome refugees, to help integrate them into the community, to...

00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:17,086
SPEAKER_1:  do things for them. So you have these armed protests happening, right?

00:58:18,658 --> 00:58:19,742
SPEAKER_1:  horrible because...

00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:23,198
SPEAKER_1:  Think about the trauma to the children.

00:58:23,522 --> 00:58:30,686
SPEAKER_1:  that are hearing about Tree of Life and hearing about some of these other incidents that are unfolding. And really one of the first communities that was targeted was the Sikh community in Madison.

00:58:31,362 --> 00:58:35,006
SPEAKER_1:  That was one of the first shootings and then the AME Church Charleston.

00:58:36,002 --> 00:58:36,734
SPEAKER_1:  and then you just had.

00:58:37,282 --> 00:58:42,686
SPEAKER_1:  tons of places of worship being targeted, right? So they're seeing this unfold and they're seeing these guns in front of their mosques and-

00:58:43,074 --> 00:58:44,350
SPEAKER_1:  the result.

00:58:45,378 --> 00:58:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  many as well. I just don't want to get shot. I don't want to go to the mosque. I don't want to have this happen to me.

00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  So when BBC reached out and said, we want to do a documentary about this.

00:58:55,202 --> 00:58:55,582
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:59,390
SPEAKER_1:  Unfortunately, Dallas was the only place in America where you had regular.

00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:05,022
SPEAKER_1:  armed groups in front of our mosques. So it was happening around the country infrequently, but here it was happening.

00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:06,078
SPEAKER_1:  every week.

00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:08,830
SPEAKER_1:  So the BBC reached out and said, we want to interview you.

00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:12,958
SPEAKER_1:  I said, we've got this idea. We want to put you, we want to take you to a park.

00:59:13,186 --> 00:59:14,878
SPEAKER_1:  and have you meet one of the protesters.

00:59:15,522 --> 00:59:17,374
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, who's been wielding his gun.

00:59:17,666 --> 00:59:18,590
SPEAKER_1:  outside your mosque.

00:59:19,202 --> 00:59:19,966
SPEAKER_1:  and talk to him.

00:59:20,802 --> 00:59:21,374
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:59:21,602 --> 00:59:24,542
SPEAKER_1:  It was really interesting because they'd interviewed him before meeting me.

00:59:25,154 --> 00:59:26,942
SPEAKER_1:  and the things that he was able to utter.

00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:30,366
SPEAKER_1:  before meeting me and before meeting Syrian refugees.

00:59:31,106 --> 00:59:31,550
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

00:59:32,162 --> 00:59:32,894
SPEAKER_1:  Was just awful.

00:59:33,346 --> 00:59:36,190
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, the most dehumanizing rhetoric that you can imagine.

00:59:37,122 --> 00:59:38,622
SPEAKER_1:  but then at the park.

00:59:39,298 --> 00:59:40,510
SPEAKER_1:  He meets me.

00:59:40,802 --> 00:59:41,566
SPEAKER_1:  talks to me.

00:59:42,082 --> 00:59:44,062
SPEAKER_1:  he meets a Syrian refugee family.

00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,494
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, one of the girls whose leg

00:59:46,914 --> 00:59:49,150
SPEAKER_1:  had been blown off in an airstrike.

00:59:50,146 --> 00:59:52,318
SPEAKER_1:  And he said, I feel like an idiot.

00:59:52,674 --> 00:59:55,102
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, he expressed all sorts of regret.

00:59:56,034 --> 00:59:57,502
SPEAKER_1:  and was teary eyed.

00:59:58,306 --> 00:59:59,198
SPEAKER_1:  that he could.

00:59:59,586 --> 01:00:03,198
SPEAKER_1:  dehumanize people the way that he was. And so my whole thing was.

01:00:03,682 --> 01:00:04,318
SPEAKER_1:  and is.

01:00:04,674 --> 01:00:06,526
SPEAKER_1:  Come inside the mosque, put your gun down.

01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:09,406
SPEAKER_1:  disarm yourself and learn.

01:00:10,402 --> 01:00:10,814
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:00:11,298 --> 01:00:13,054
SPEAKER_1:  you'll be surprised what you'll walk away with.

01:00:13,986 --> 01:00:15,422
SPEAKER_1:  and only took one meeting with Him.

01:00:15,682 --> 01:00:16,126
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:00:16,994 --> 01:00:17,918
SPEAKER_1:  so completely.

01:00:18,786 --> 01:00:19,774
SPEAKER_1:  Ah, shift.

01:00:20,706 --> 01:00:21,950
SPEAKER_1:  his worldview at the time.

01:00:23,074 --> 01:00:23,646
SPEAKER_1:  which

01:00:24,738 --> 01:00:31,198
SPEAKER_1:  was made up of heroes and villains, the Muslims unfortunately being the villains that had to be wiped off the face of the earth so that the earth could continue.

01:00:32,194 --> 01:00:33,278
SPEAKER_1:  So that was a...

01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:36,766
SPEAKER_1:  That was an interesting documentary and it was an interesting social experiment.

01:00:37,474 --> 01:00:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  What's it feel like to have...

01:00:40,354 --> 01:00:41,182
SPEAKER_0:  all these.

01:00:41,858 --> 01:00:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  people that hate you.

01:00:44,322 --> 01:00:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  and others in the community, people you love.

01:00:48,226 --> 01:00:48,638
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:00:49,186 --> 01:00:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  with guns.

01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:52,798
SPEAKER_0:  threatening violence.

01:00:53,922 --> 01:00:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  basically that we don't want you here.

01:00:56,354 --> 01:00:57,479
SPEAKER_0:  in this country on this

01:00:57,479 --> 01:00:57,886
SPEAKER_1:  Earth.

01:01:00,002 --> 01:01:00,414
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:01:01,378 --> 01:01:02,174
SPEAKER_1:  It's not nice.

01:01:02,882 --> 01:01:04,574
SPEAKER_1:  That's not great. I mean, it's um...

01:01:05,698 --> 01:01:07,038
SPEAKER_1:  Definitely a challenge, but...

01:01:07,458 --> 01:01:08,414
SPEAKER_1:  Look, there are...

01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:11,550
SPEAKER_1:  challenges that we face as Muslims.

01:01:12,226 --> 01:01:17,854
SPEAKER_1:  Um, being in the United States, being in a hostile climate, there are different types of challenges and, uh,

01:01:18,594 --> 01:01:21,566
SPEAKER_1:  I think what we've had to do as a Muslim community.

01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:25,534
SPEAKER_1:  is see beyond both the guns and the roses.

01:01:25,954 --> 01:01:26,526
SPEAKER_1:  end

01:01:26,786 --> 01:01:28,318
SPEAKER_1:  Think about who we are first.

01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:30,494
SPEAKER_1:  because frankly...

01:01:31,298 --> 01:01:31,742
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:01:32,578 --> 01:01:35,934
SPEAKER_1:  Islamophobia exists in different forms and from different sides.

01:01:36,738 --> 01:01:37,214
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:01:37,922 --> 01:01:41,214
SPEAKER_1:  We try to use this as an opportunity to instill an hour.

01:01:41,474 --> 01:01:42,206
SPEAKER_1:  Young people.

01:01:43,202 --> 01:01:45,790
SPEAKER_1:  not just a sense of belonging, but a sense of purpose.

01:01:46,466 --> 01:01:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  Oh.

01:01:47,874 --> 01:01:49,022
SPEAKER_1:  Do not be intimidated.

01:01:50,114 --> 01:01:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  and in fact show them.

01:01:52,482 --> 01:01:55,678
SPEAKER_1:  the best of your Islam, live your life. Because at the end of the day,

01:01:56,866 --> 01:01:58,398
SPEAKER_1:  the goal that is sought.

01:01:58,946 --> 01:02:00,958
SPEAKER_1:  through intimidation is silence.

01:02:01,954 --> 01:02:04,670
SPEAKER_1:  And so we have to carry ourselves as.

01:02:05,058 --> 01:02:07,966
SPEAKER_1:  proud American Muslims. We don't have to impress anyone.

01:02:08,674 --> 01:02:12,126
SPEAKER_1:  and we don't need to relinquish an iota of our faith.

01:02:13,058 --> 01:02:14,750
SPEAKER_1:  to coexist with anyone.

01:02:14,978 --> 01:02:15,390
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

01:02:15,778 --> 01:02:16,446
SPEAKER_1:  We are.

01:02:16,962 --> 01:02:17,982
SPEAKER_1:  Satisfied.

01:02:18,242 --> 01:02:19,518
SPEAKER_1:  with who we are.

01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  We don't see.

01:02:21,762 --> 01:02:22,686
SPEAKER_1:  contradiction.

01:02:23,842 --> 01:02:24,414
SPEAKER_1:  between.

01:02:25,186 --> 01:02:26,110
SPEAKER_1:  our place.

01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:26,814
SPEAKER_1:  of

01:02:27,106 --> 01:02:29,182
SPEAKER_1:  residence and our religion.

01:02:29,602 --> 01:02:33,630
SPEAKER_1:  our nationality, our religion, we don't see that as a problem. Right. So that's a

01:02:34,434 --> 01:02:37,310
SPEAKER_1:  That's something for them to work out, not for you to work out.

01:02:37,634 --> 01:02:41,310
SPEAKER_1:  That's what I would tell young Muslims that continue to live your faith fully.

01:02:42,082 --> 01:02:43,998
SPEAKER_1:  and demonstrate the beauty of it.

01:02:44,578 --> 01:02:47,134
SPEAKER_1:  and do not let the ugliness of the world consume you.

01:02:49,026 --> 01:02:50,590
SPEAKER_0:  But for those young Muslims.

01:02:50,914 --> 01:02:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  What would you say?

01:02:52,546 --> 01:02:54,718
SPEAKER_0:  how they should feel towards the people that hate them.

01:02:56,066 --> 01:02:57,374
SPEAKER_0:  The natural human.

01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:01,086
SPEAKER_0:  There's a desire still to have anger, to have...

01:03:01,826 --> 01:03:03,358
SPEAKER_0:  or is that meant to have hate back?

01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  people that hate you.

01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:08,606
SPEAKER_1:  the Quran says respond to that which is evil with that which is better.

01:03:09,154 --> 01:03:10,238
SPEAKER_1:  and you will find...

01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:11,070
SPEAKER_1:  Nah.

01:03:11,874 --> 01:03:13,470
SPEAKER_1:  Sometimes your enemy will become.

01:03:13,954 --> 01:03:14,878
SPEAKER_1:  your close friend.

01:03:15,778 --> 01:03:17,470
SPEAKER_1:  So respond with that which is better.

01:03:17,762 --> 01:03:18,686
SPEAKER_1:  doesn't mean

01:03:18,946 --> 01:03:19,710
SPEAKER_1:  Be passive.

01:03:20,002 --> 01:03:21,118
SPEAKER_1:  sometimes.

01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:23,358
SPEAKER_1:  there needs to be a demonstration of strength.

01:03:24,194 --> 01:03:26,302
SPEAKER_1:  Sometimes there needs to be a demonstration.

01:03:26,722 --> 01:03:27,230
SPEAKER_1:  of

01:03:27,746 --> 01:03:28,350
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:03:29,314 --> 01:03:30,046
SPEAKER_1:  ignoring.

01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:31,550
SPEAKER_1:  uh... people altogether

01:03:32,514 --> 01:03:38,142
SPEAKER_1:  But ultimately you can't let the way people treat you shape who you're going to be in the world.

01:03:39,042 --> 01:03:42,718
SPEAKER_1:  And so that's why I say we have to look beyond the guns and the roses. We have to look beyond.

01:03:43,426 --> 01:03:45,534
SPEAKER_1:  the hostility of our enemies.

01:03:45,826 --> 01:03:46,526
SPEAKER_1:  and the

01:03:46,754 --> 01:03:47,710
SPEAKER_1:  Temporary.

01:03:48,002 --> 01:03:51,390
SPEAKER_1:  an opportunistic embrace of some of those who claim to be our allies.

01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:53,310
SPEAKER_1:  and be us.

01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:58,430
SPEAKER_1:  and treat the world and treat the people of this world in accordance with your standards.

01:03:59,106 --> 01:04:00,030
SPEAKER_1:  not with theirs.

01:04:00,386 --> 01:04:01,438
SPEAKER_1:  So don't teach them.

01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:05,886
SPEAKER_1:  you know, or don't let them teach you bad character, you teach them good character.

01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:09,726
SPEAKER_1:  So live your life and live your faith.

01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:10,718
SPEAKER_1:  beautifully.

01:04:11,458 --> 01:04:13,598
SPEAKER_1:  and let people see the beauty of it through your.

01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:14,750
SPEAKER_1:  through your bink.

01:04:15,138 --> 01:04:16,958
SPEAKER_1:  and do not let their ugliness

01:04:17,762 --> 01:04:18,398
SPEAKER_1:  consume you.

01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:19,710
SPEAKER_1:  but at the same time.

01:04:20,162 --> 01:04:23,294
SPEAKER_1:  Sometimes you've got to give people room to express frustration.

01:04:24,034 --> 01:04:25,438
SPEAKER_1:  to say that.

01:04:25,986 --> 01:04:27,070
SPEAKER_1:  This is unacceptable.

01:04:27,458 --> 01:04:29,118
SPEAKER_1:  to have demonstrations of strength.

01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:30,974
SPEAKER_1:  and...

01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:34,718
SPEAKER_1:  I think that those things don't have to all contradict each other.

01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:37,214
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think about...

01:04:37,634 --> 01:04:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  These kinds of protests are not allowed in many parts of the world.

01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  What do you think about?

01:04:43,522 --> 01:04:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  one of the most to you directly personally painful manifestations of the first amendment

01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  of the people's right to freedom of speech and to protest.

01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:54,878
SPEAKER_0:  to say hateful things.

01:04:55,618 --> 01:04:57,886
SPEAKER_0:  You've been at the receiving end.

01:04:58,882 --> 01:05:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  of the worst of it.

01:05:01,186 --> 01:05:04,958
SPEAKER_0:  What, what, what, what do you feel about this particular freedom?

01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  that's at the core of the founding of this country.

01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:11,070
SPEAKER_1:  Look, I think that you have to take it away from the.

01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:21,438
SPEAKER_1:  text and look at it within reality. Let's be real. Would Muslims be able to protest in front of churches with guns on a weekly basis in this country? I don't think so.

01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:23,143
SPEAKER_1:  So that's a tip.

01:05:23,143 --> 01:05:25,393
SPEAKER_0:  Pragmatically speaking, there's a hypocrisy too.

01:05:25,393 --> 01:05:26,558
SPEAKER_1:  What's a lot of not?

01:05:26,818 --> 01:05:28,958
SPEAKER_1:  Major hypocrisy. Free speech.

01:05:29,666 --> 01:05:31,550
SPEAKER_1:  is an ideal that is weaponized.

01:05:31,906 --> 01:05:32,606
SPEAKER_1:  against.

01:05:33,442 --> 01:05:36,542
SPEAKER_1:  the Muslim community and against other communities.

01:05:37,346 --> 01:05:37,790
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:05:38,018 --> 01:05:41,630
SPEAKER_1:  in such a hypocritical way. You know, you take, for example, some countries in Europe.

01:05:41,954 --> 01:05:43,678
SPEAKER_1:  Let's kind of move away from this.

01:05:43,938 --> 01:05:45,310
SPEAKER_1:  look at the hypocrisy of.

01:05:46,146 --> 01:05:46,622
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

01:05:47,202 --> 01:05:48,958
SPEAKER_1:  place like France where

01:05:49,506 --> 01:05:54,878
SPEAKER_1:  the caricaturing and the portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him in derogatory ways.

01:05:55,554 --> 01:05:57,726
SPEAKER_1:  will be used as the hallmark of free speech.

01:05:58,402 --> 01:05:58,910
SPEAKER_1:  But...

01:05:59,746 --> 01:06:00,766
SPEAKER_1:  Muslims that.

01:06:01,282 --> 01:06:02,366
SPEAKER_1:  Well, caricature.

01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:03,870
SPEAKER_1:  Ah, Macron.

01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:04,574
SPEAKER_1:  Arrrr

01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:05,726
SPEAKER_1:  Challenge.

01:06:06,050 --> 01:06:10,494
SPEAKER_1:  some of the values of France, the supposed and trying values of France.

01:06:11,074 --> 01:06:12,894
SPEAKER_1:  will end up in prison and end up deported.

01:06:13,474 --> 01:06:17,566
SPEAKER_1:  And so here in the United States, there's a great hypocrisy. I don't think that-

01:06:18,306 --> 01:06:18,718
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:24,702
SPEAKER_1:  places of worship should have armed protesters in front of them. I think that that poses a security risk. I think that it's.

01:06:25,218 --> 01:06:25,822
SPEAKER_1:  Not okay.

01:06:26,658 --> 01:06:27,358
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:06:28,194 --> 01:06:29,022
SPEAKER_1:  And I think that.

01:06:29,442 --> 01:06:32,254
SPEAKER_1:  speech is weaponized against the Muslim community.

01:06:32,834 --> 01:06:33,790
SPEAKER_1:  and often.

01:06:34,146 --> 01:06:35,934
SPEAKER_1:  is held up as this great value.

01:06:36,546 --> 01:06:37,822
SPEAKER_1:  but really to attain.

01:06:38,178 --> 01:06:39,422
SPEAKER_1:  very lowly things.

01:06:40,034 --> 01:06:42,686
SPEAKER_1:  and is often to our detriment.

01:06:43,906 --> 01:06:46,174
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, just even watching that documentary.

01:06:49,698 --> 01:06:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  It's hard to put into words, but somehow that...

01:06:53,122 --> 01:06:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  does not capture.

01:06:55,586 --> 01:06:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  what maybe the founders intended.

01:06:59,202 --> 01:07:03,390
SPEAKER_0:  What I would see is the great ideal of the freedom of speech.

01:07:06,498 --> 01:07:08,254
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know what the solution to that is.

01:07:09,122 --> 01:07:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  I think taking it outside of words.

01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe.

01:07:12,322 --> 01:07:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  that requires a community a cultural pressure.

01:07:15,266 --> 01:07:15,934
SPEAKER_0:  to be better.

01:07:16,898 --> 01:07:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:07:18,178 --> 01:07:22,206
SPEAKER_0:  It's not about the law, it's more about just the culture of pressure. What is and isn't okay.

01:07:22,658 --> 01:07:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  Is there something deeply wrong about that kind of hate?

01:07:27,042 --> 01:07:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, because it was dehumanizing other...

01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  people that are here in America.

01:07:32,162 --> 01:07:33,598
SPEAKER_1:  that they're Americans.

01:07:34,338 --> 01:07:37,150
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean, it's, it's, we have to interrogate.

01:07:38,338 --> 01:07:39,550
SPEAKER_1:  the foundations.

01:07:39,842 --> 01:07:42,750
SPEAKER_1:  of our country when our country is in such turmoil.

01:07:43,394 --> 01:07:44,478
SPEAKER_1:  and such chaos.

01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:45,182
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

01:07:45,602 --> 01:07:47,454
SPEAKER_1:  no country in the world.

01:07:48,034 --> 01:07:49,854
SPEAKER_1:  has the mass shootings that we have.

01:07:50,498 --> 01:07:52,126
SPEAKER_1:  No country in the world has.

01:07:52,866 --> 01:07:57,086
SPEAKER_1:  some of the polarization that we have, we have to interrogate that and say.

01:07:57,506 --> 01:08:00,094
SPEAKER_1:  what it is that we're doing wrong that's leading to that.

01:08:01,218 --> 01:08:02,270
SPEAKER_1:  And I think again that...

01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:04,734
SPEAKER_1:  it's reaching a point where it's unsustainable.

01:08:05,954 --> 01:08:07,358
SPEAKER_1:  if we don't do better.

01:08:08,354 --> 01:08:10,110
SPEAKER_1:  and try to solve.

01:08:10,754 --> 01:08:12,126
SPEAKER_1:  some of the rifts right now.

01:08:12,578 --> 01:08:14,014
SPEAKER_1:  that exists in our society.

01:08:14,786 --> 01:08:15,998
SPEAKER_1:  then we're going to end up in...

01:08:16,578 --> 01:08:18,174
SPEAKER_1:  you know, in a place where.

01:08:18,658 --> 01:08:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  We may not be able to climb out of this.

01:08:22,402 --> 01:08:23,678
SPEAKER_0:  What do you think about?

01:08:24,034 --> 01:08:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  You mentioned the Muslim ban. What do you think about executive order 13769?

01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  titled Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States.

01:08:34,498 --> 01:08:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  Often referred to as the Muslim ban or the Trump travel ban, it was

01:08:38,594 --> 01:08:39,774
SPEAKER_0:  and executive order.

01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  by President Trump that was in effect from January 27th, 2017.

01:08:45,346 --> 01:08:48,734
SPEAKER_0:  for just a few months until March 6th, 2017.

01:08:49,282 --> 01:08:49,726
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  What was this executive order and what was it?

01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  effect on your life and on

01:08:55,874 --> 01:08:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  the life of the Muslim community and

01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  It's just the life of Americans.

01:09:02,466 --> 01:09:03,326
SPEAKER_1:  It was...

01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:05,822
SPEAKER_1:  disgraceful it was a

01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:07,774
SPEAKER_1:  tactic that was used.

01:09:08,578 --> 01:09:09,150
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

01:09:09,570 --> 01:09:10,526
SPEAKER_1:  you know, at the time.

01:09:11,298 --> 01:09:11,774
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:14,782
SPEAKER_1:  very similar to the whole build the wall rhetoric.

01:09:15,170 --> 01:09:18,334
SPEAKER_1:  um... to to play to a particular political

01:09:18,754 --> 01:09:20,350
SPEAKER_1:  sloganeering and

01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:23,454
SPEAKER_1:  carrying out those types of acts against the Muslim community.

01:09:24,194 --> 01:09:26,110
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, you're not going to face.

01:09:26,402 --> 01:09:26,846
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

01:09:27,618 --> 01:09:32,510
SPEAKER_1:  much opposition typically in any meaningful way that would be politically costly.

01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:34,590
SPEAKER_1:  when he rolled it out.

01:09:35,074 --> 01:09:35,742
SPEAKER_1:  at the time.

01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:37,598
SPEAKER_1:  there were people in flight.

01:09:37,922 --> 01:09:39,358
SPEAKER_1:  on their way to the United States.

01:09:40,162 --> 01:09:42,526
SPEAKER_1:  that were held in airports around the country.

01:09:43,234 --> 01:09:44,254
SPEAKER_1:  um... children.

01:09:44,642 --> 01:09:45,534
SPEAKER_1:  elderly people.

01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:47,966
SPEAKER_1:  that were held in these small rooms.

01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:49,086
SPEAKER_1:  End.

01:09:49,346 --> 01:09:50,014
SPEAKER_1:  treated.

01:09:50,434 --> 01:09:54,046
SPEAKER_1:  Awfully before being put back on a plane and sent to where they were. There were families that.

01:09:54,722 --> 01:09:56,894
SPEAKER_1:  had medical needs that were never able to.

01:09:57,474 --> 01:09:59,006
SPEAKER_1:  uh... come together he

01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:01,054
SPEAKER_1:  specifically targeted.

01:10:01,538 --> 01:10:02,622
SPEAKER_1:  Muslim countries.

01:10:03,266 --> 01:10:08,222
SPEAKER_1:  to play to that idea of a complete ban of Muslims, which he knew was not feasible.

01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:09,662
SPEAKER_1:  at the time.

01:10:10,498 --> 01:10:10,942
SPEAKER_1:  Now.

01:10:11,362 --> 01:10:13,086
SPEAKER_1:  Personally, you know Dallas had the

01:10:13,314 --> 01:10:15,806
SPEAKER_1:  the largest amount, the largest number.

01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:17,086
SPEAKER_1:  of

01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:18,782
SPEAKER_1:  detainees.

01:10:19,042 --> 01:10:20,350
SPEAKER_1:  uh... in the airport

01:10:21,026 --> 01:10:23,582
SPEAKER_1:  We have one of the largest airports in America and.

01:10:24,162 --> 01:10:25,982
SPEAKER_1:  uh... we took to the airport

01:10:27,234 --> 01:10:28,734
SPEAKER_1:  and we stayed there for a few days.

01:10:29,506 --> 01:10:33,758
SPEAKER_1:  It was one of the New York Times pictures of the year when we did our prayer.

01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:38,238
SPEAKER_1:  because when we had to do our prayer, it wasn't just Muslims that came to the airport.

01:10:38,594 --> 01:10:41,406
SPEAKER_1:  It was many people that came to the airport of different faiths.

01:10:41,730 --> 01:10:43,230
SPEAKER_1:  were outraged by what they had seen.

01:10:43,842 --> 01:10:48,734
SPEAKER_1:  So when we do our prayer, there was a protest chant that, you pray we stay.

01:10:49,442 --> 01:10:51,294
SPEAKER_1:  And so the airport had to.

01:10:51,778 --> 01:10:53,214
SPEAKER_1:  Make room for us because...

01:10:53,698 --> 01:10:56,254
SPEAKER_1:  like a thousand people that need to have our five daily prayers.

01:10:57,282 --> 01:11:01,534
SPEAKER_1:  So we would do our prayers in the airport. We waited. We continued.

01:11:02,306 --> 01:11:04,670
SPEAKER_1:  until the detainees were.

01:11:05,058 --> 01:11:05,758
SPEAKER_1:  Freed.

01:11:06,242 --> 01:11:07,326
SPEAKER_1:  At least temporarily.

01:11:07,842 --> 01:11:12,478
SPEAKER_1:  Unfortunately, some elements of that legislation remained and it was an ongoing...

01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:13,342
SPEAKER_1:  struggle.

01:11:13,922 --> 01:11:14,910
SPEAKER_1:  Look, what I'll say is that-

01:11:15,138 --> 01:11:17,982
SPEAKER_1:  Those are some of the more obvious manifestations of...

01:11:18,306 --> 01:11:19,582
SPEAKER_1:  anti-Muslim bigotry.

01:11:20,578 --> 01:11:21,214
SPEAKER_1:  But...

01:11:21,858 --> 01:11:22,654
SPEAKER_1:  Again.

01:11:23,074 --> 01:11:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  There's hypocrisy on all sides of the political aisle here in the United States.

01:11:27,970 --> 01:11:34,558
SPEAKER_1:  There is Islamophobia of different flavors. I think even the term Islamophobia can become contentious because there are people that

01:11:34,978 --> 01:11:39,134
SPEAKER_1:  attack us in different ways and that might not be as overtly bigoted, but.

01:11:39,874 --> 01:11:42,270
SPEAKER_1:  nonetheless are infringing on our rights.

01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:42,878
SPEAKER_1:  B.

01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:44,286
SPEAKER_1:  full American Muslims.

01:11:45,346 --> 01:11:47,966
SPEAKER_1:  and Muslims find themselves in a very strange political place.

01:11:48,898 --> 01:11:49,310
SPEAKER_1:  Where?

01:11:50,114 --> 01:11:51,294
SPEAKER_1:  You've got one side.

01:11:51,778 --> 01:11:52,126
SPEAKER_1:  that.

01:11:52,578 --> 01:11:54,142
SPEAKER_1:  seemingly wants to annihilate you.

01:11:54,946 --> 01:11:57,246
SPEAKER_1:  and another side that only accepts you.

01:11:58,178 --> 01:12:00,094
SPEAKER_1:  if you're willing to assimilate.

01:12:00,834 --> 01:12:07,614
SPEAKER_1:  but no one really allows you to be a full on American Muslim. So Muslims find themselves in a very strange place right now.

01:12:08,482 --> 01:12:08,990
SPEAKER_1:  with

01:12:09,314 --> 01:12:12,094
SPEAKER_1:  all of the political sides with the political parties.

01:12:12,610 --> 01:12:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  Where do Muslims sit politically?

01:12:15,042 --> 01:12:16,446
SPEAKER_0:  Are they politically engaged?

01:12:17,634 --> 01:12:20,958
SPEAKER_0:  in the functioning United States where they find themselves politically as a community.

01:12:21,506 --> 01:12:21,854
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:12:22,754 --> 01:12:25,470
SPEAKER_1:  Muslims find themselves in an awkward place politically.

01:12:25,954 --> 01:12:27,102
SPEAKER_1:  That's the best way to put it.

01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  We.

01:12:28,546 --> 01:12:29,758
SPEAKER_1:  our religious community.

01:12:30,594 --> 01:12:31,358
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

01:12:31,618 --> 01:12:34,046
SPEAKER_1:  we don't find ourselves welcomed.

01:12:34,466 --> 01:12:38,174
SPEAKER_1:  uh... by the left which has a hostility towards religion

01:12:38,498 --> 01:12:41,123
SPEAKER_1:  And most left spaces and most liberal spaces.

01:12:41,123 --> 01:12:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know because it's...

01:12:42,882 --> 01:12:45,950
SPEAKER_0:  of religion has many conservative elements.

01:12:46,178 --> 01:12:51,326
SPEAKER_1:  Right. So the Muslim community is in its nature conservative for what that's worth. Right. It's a conservative community.

01:12:52,002 --> 01:12:56,478
SPEAKER_1:  It's a community that has certain orthodoxies and practices.

01:12:57,058 --> 01:12:57,502
SPEAKER_1:  that.

01:12:58,178 --> 01:12:58,622
SPEAKER_1:  wood.

01:12:59,170 --> 01:13:03,102
SPEAKER_1:  make it disagreeable in its nature and its practice to many on the left.

01:13:03,394 --> 01:13:03,806
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:13:04,258 --> 01:13:07,678
SPEAKER_1:  Many on the right just see us as a group of foreigners.

01:13:08,578 --> 01:13:10,398
SPEAKER_1:  and a threat in that regard.

01:13:11,138 --> 01:13:11,582
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:13:12,034 --> 01:13:14,622
SPEAKER_1:  We find ourselves in this awkward place. There's also the-

01:13:15,394 --> 01:13:17,726
SPEAKER_1:  presence of sort of the pro-Israel.

01:13:18,306 --> 01:13:24,126
SPEAKER_1:  dominance of both parties, the foreign policy of both parties is detrimental to Muslims globally

01:13:24,738 --> 01:13:25,214
SPEAKER_1:  um...

01:13:25,826 --> 01:13:27,998
SPEAKER_1:  the securitization of the Muslim community.

01:13:28,226 --> 01:13:36,830
SPEAKER_1:  in the name of countering violent extremism. Unfortunately, the Muslim community has had both Republican and Democratic administrations run over its rights.

01:13:37,794 --> 01:13:43,422
SPEAKER_1:  So we find ourselves kind of in this awkward space, right? We are a religious community that's also-

01:13:43,938 --> 01:13:44,734
SPEAKER_1:  minority.

01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:48,158
SPEAKER_1:  the racialization of the Muslim community.

01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:50,462
SPEAKER_1:  sort of robs us of who we are.

01:13:50,754 --> 01:13:55,550
SPEAKER_1:  and how we get to engage them with different platforms and different peoples.

01:13:56,034 --> 01:13:57,374
SPEAKER_1:  around us.

01:13:57,762 --> 01:14:00,839
SPEAKER_1:  we find ourselves in a very awkward place. Is there in general...

01:14:00,839 --> 01:14:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  a lack.

01:14:01,858 --> 01:14:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  of representation.

01:14:03,746 --> 01:14:04,638
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

01:14:04,898 --> 01:14:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  places of power.

01:14:06,626 --> 01:14:14,206
SPEAKER_1:  I don't think representation is everything. I think that representation can actually be detrimental sometimes because you can have people that.

01:14:14,786 --> 01:14:16,350
SPEAKER_1:  uh, represent you.

01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:18,942
SPEAKER_1:  but that don't actually represent your.

01:14:19,650 --> 01:14:24,638
SPEAKER_1:  your priorities as a community, as a faith community. So we don't want to be tokenized as a community.

01:14:24,930 --> 01:14:27,518
SPEAKER_1:  We want to be engaged and engage.

01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:29,118
SPEAKER_1:  fully as Muslims.

01:14:29,794 --> 01:14:30,366
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:14:30,786 --> 01:14:35,134
SPEAKER_1:  be respected as American Muslims. I wrote something at the time actually of Muslim ban.

01:14:35,458 --> 01:14:38,302
SPEAKER_1:  I wrote an article for CNN called, I am not your American Muslim.

01:14:38,914 --> 01:14:40,126
SPEAKER_1:  I am not your American Muslim.

01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:42,558
SPEAKER_1:  Because we are not a tool.

01:14:42,786 --> 01:14:44,734
SPEAKER_1:  of liberals against conservatives.

01:14:45,602 --> 01:14:48,030
SPEAKER_1:  nor are we simply to be made out to be.

01:14:48,386 --> 01:14:49,662
SPEAKER_1:  your villain or your victim.

01:14:50,594 --> 01:14:51,070
SPEAKER_1:  where...

01:14:51,586 --> 01:14:52,478
SPEAKER_1:  people of faith.

01:14:53,634 --> 01:14:55,134
SPEAKER_1:  were people that...

01:14:55,650 --> 01:14:59,838
SPEAKER_1:  have values where people that want to see our places of worship thrive?

01:15:00,418 --> 01:15:02,270
SPEAKER_1:  where people that have something to offer.

01:15:02,914 --> 01:15:03,326
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

01:15:03,842 --> 01:15:06,622
SPEAKER_1:  to this country, to the people around us of good.

01:15:07,362 --> 01:15:09,214
SPEAKER_1:  but ultimately we want to engage.

01:15:09,826 --> 01:15:10,238
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:15:10,594 --> 01:15:16,222
SPEAKER_1:  be engaged with on the basis of who we actually are, not who you need us to be right now.

01:15:16,770 --> 01:15:17,982
SPEAKER_1:  And that's been the problem.

01:15:18,754 --> 01:15:21,694
SPEAKER_1:  that we've had, so it's not a lack of representation.

01:15:22,370 --> 01:15:24,382
SPEAKER_1:  as much as a lack of authentic engagement.

01:15:25,666 --> 01:15:27,070
SPEAKER_1:  You mentioned...

01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:29,502
SPEAKER_0:  Daily Prayer.

01:15:30,562 --> 01:15:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:15:32,514 --> 01:15:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  If I may, looking at the time, this might be time.

01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:37,054
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:15:37,346 --> 01:15:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  If it's okay, I would love it if you allow me to.

01:15:41,154 --> 01:15:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  follow along at least in movement as you pray.

01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  Absolutely.

01:15:47,778 --> 01:15:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  Thank you for allowing me to join you.

01:15:49,442 --> 01:15:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  in that.

01:15:50,466 --> 01:15:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  I don't-

01:15:51,778 --> 01:15:52,990
SPEAKER_0:  Can you maybe describe?

01:15:54,754 --> 01:15:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  What?

01:15:57,154 --> 01:16:02,206
SPEAKER_0:  What does the prayer represent? What is the actual practice of prayer like? What is the process like?

01:16:03,138 --> 01:16:03,934
SPEAKER_1:  Sure, so.

01:16:04,194 --> 01:16:05,534
SPEAKER_1:  Prayer is the...

01:16:06,018 --> 01:16:07,902
SPEAKER_1:  central pillar if you will of Islam.

01:16:08,194 --> 01:16:08,542
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:16:09,666 --> 01:16:10,238
SPEAKER_1:  It is.

01:16:10,818 --> 01:16:12,094
SPEAKER_1:  The life of the believer.

01:16:12,578 --> 01:16:14,078
SPEAKER_1:  encapsulated.

01:16:14,882 --> 01:16:15,262
SPEAKER_1:  in

01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:17,630
SPEAKER_1:  to a very specific act.

01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  of devotion that's done.

01:16:19,682 --> 01:16:20,830
SPEAKER_1:  at least five times a day.

01:16:21,058 --> 01:16:23,038
SPEAKER_1:  So there are different types of prayer. There's prayer.

01:16:23,682 --> 01:16:24,734
SPEAKER_1:  There's supplication.

01:16:24,962 --> 01:16:27,582
SPEAKER_1:  So the five daily prayers are called Salah.

01:16:27,906 --> 01:16:29,470
SPEAKER_1:  as the obligatory prayers.

01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:33,630
SPEAKER_1:  And then beyond that, there are voluntary prayers.

01:16:33,858 --> 01:16:34,526
SPEAKER_1:  that are done.

01:16:34,850 --> 01:16:36,446
SPEAKER_1:  throughout the day as well.

01:16:37,122 --> 01:16:38,942
SPEAKER_1:  So you can pray before and after.

01:16:39,266 --> 01:16:47,550
SPEAKER_1:  obligatory prayers and then there are other times of the day that you can pray also. And the best prayer, voluntary prayer, is at night, in the middle of the night, because the time that you're closest to God.

01:16:48,290 --> 01:16:49,566
SPEAKER_1:  sincere.

01:16:50,178 --> 01:16:52,094
SPEAKER_1:  away from the eyes of people.

01:16:52,418 --> 01:16:52,926
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

01:16:53,378 --> 01:16:59,710
SPEAKER_1:  just in the still of the night and you'd pray in a similar way with the standing and the bowing the prostration reciting the Quran

01:17:00,002 --> 01:17:03,614
SPEAKER_1:  And then you have supplication and words of remembrance that you are to do throughout the day.

01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:08,990
SPEAKER_1:  between all of them. So when people say, do you pray five times a day? I say at least five times a day.

01:17:09,346 --> 01:17:09,758
SPEAKER_1:  um...

01:17:09,922 --> 01:17:15,038
SPEAKER_0:  What are the words of this application? Do they come from the Quran or do they come from your own heart? Where do they come from?

01:17:15,266 --> 01:17:18,174
SPEAKER_1:  So basically you say Allahu Akbar.

01:17:18,914 --> 01:17:20,990
SPEAKER_1:  uh... which means i'm going to kill you right

01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:23,614
SPEAKER_1:  Or so they say, right?

01:17:25,538 --> 01:17:26,302
SPEAKER_1:  God is greater.

01:17:26,754 --> 01:17:31,262
SPEAKER_1:  You start off with that expression of God's greatness, and then you recite the opening chapter of the Quran.

01:17:31,842 --> 01:17:35,294
SPEAKER_1:  which is known as Al-Fatiha. It's the first chapter of the Qur'an.

01:17:35,906 --> 01:17:43,710
SPEAKER_1:  In the name of God, the most compassionate, the most merciful. All praises be to God, the Lord of all the worlds, most compassionate, most merciful, Master of the Day of Judgment.

01:17:44,066 --> 01:17:46,430
SPEAKER_1:  You alone we worship and from you alone we seek help.

01:17:46,818 --> 01:17:49,950
SPEAKER_1:  Guide us to the straight path, the path of those who have earned your favor.

01:17:50,242 --> 01:17:52,958
SPEAKER_1:  not those who have earned your wrath nor those who have gone astray.

01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:54,814
SPEAKER_1:  So that's a translation of the first.

01:17:55,138 --> 01:17:57,054
SPEAKER_1:  chapter, the opening chapter of the Quran.

01:17:57,666 --> 01:18:01,310
SPEAKER_1:  which is known as At-Fatiha. So we recite that in every one of the units of prayer.

01:18:02,018 --> 01:18:02,430
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:18:03,074 --> 01:18:06,110
SPEAKER_1:  And then after that, we recite something else from the Quran.

01:18:06,658 --> 01:18:09,854
SPEAKER_1:  So some other portion of the Quran, and then we say Allahu Akbar.

01:18:10,338 --> 01:18:10,942
SPEAKER_1:  Once again.

01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:13,438
SPEAKER_1:  God is greater. God as greater than other beings Christ.

01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:14,462
SPEAKER_1:  bowing.

01:18:14,786 --> 01:18:20,222
SPEAKER_1:  And in bowing we say, Subhanarabbiyaalazim, Subhanarabbiyaalazim, Subhanarabbiyaalazim, which means,

01:18:20,706 --> 01:18:22,142
SPEAKER_1:  Glory be to God.

01:18:22,722 --> 01:18:25,054
SPEAKER_1:  The Almighty. Glory be to God, The Almighty.

01:18:25,634 --> 01:18:28,222
SPEAKER_1:  Glory be to God the Almighty. And then you come back up.

01:18:28,578 --> 01:18:29,246
SPEAKER_1:  and you say...

01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:32,894
SPEAKER_1:  God has heard the one who has praised him.

01:18:33,698 --> 01:18:34,174
SPEAKER_1:  And then...

01:18:34,466 --> 01:18:39,646
SPEAKER_1:  The response is, رَبَّنَا وَلَكَ الْحَمْتِ, unto you, O Lord, belongs all praise.

01:18:40,354 --> 01:18:41,790
SPEAKER_1:  and then we go into prostration.

01:18:42,146 --> 01:18:44,286
SPEAKER_1:  and prostration is at the heart of the prayer.

01:18:45,090 --> 01:18:45,534
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:18:45,826 --> 01:18:47,646
SPEAKER_1:  It is the most beautiful.

01:18:48,194 --> 01:18:50,270
SPEAKER_1:  portion of the prayer and it is.

01:18:50,946 --> 01:18:52,702
SPEAKER_1:  the most beloved position.

01:18:53,410 --> 01:18:56,414
SPEAKER_1:  for a servant of God and that which is most pleasing to God.

01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:58,142
SPEAKER_1:  It's when you

01:18:58,402 --> 01:18:59,614
SPEAKER_1:  say at that point.

01:19:00,098 --> 01:19:01,534
SPEAKER_1:  Subhanah Rabbia Al-A'la

01:19:01,986 --> 01:19:03,870
SPEAKER_1:  All glory be to God the Most High.

01:19:04,194 --> 01:19:06,718
SPEAKER_1:  All glory be to God the most high. So while you put yourself.

01:19:07,298 --> 01:19:08,478
SPEAKER_1:  in the lowest position.

01:19:08,866 --> 01:19:09,694
SPEAKER_1:  You acknowledge.

01:19:10,306 --> 01:19:15,870
SPEAKER_1:  God being the Most High and the Prophet peace and blessings be upon him said that the closest that a person is to God.

01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:17,758
SPEAKER_1:  is when they are in prostration.

01:19:18,274 --> 01:19:22,014
SPEAKER_1:  That is the time that your supplications are most precious and beloved.

01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:24,062
SPEAKER_1:  That is the time that you can.

01:19:24,546 --> 01:19:28,990
SPEAKER_1:  Cry your heart out. That is the time that you really feel a sense of great closeness.

01:19:29,474 --> 01:19:32,606
SPEAKER_1:  and devotion to God. And as I was telling you earlier,

01:19:33,058 --> 01:19:37,630
SPEAKER_1:  the time that your, your mind is under your heart for a change, right? the only position, physical position.

01:19:38,114 --> 01:19:39,774
SPEAKER_1:  that your mind is actually under your heart.

01:19:40,450 --> 01:19:42,846
SPEAKER_1:  And you really have a chance to pour your emotions out.

01:19:43,202 --> 01:19:44,510
SPEAKER_1:  and to connect deeply to God.

01:19:44,802 --> 01:19:49,502
SPEAKER_1:  It's the prayer of all of the prophets. Jesus, peace be upon Him, as described.

01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:52,158
SPEAKER_1:  even biblically as falling on his face in prayer.

01:19:52,866 --> 01:19:57,790
SPEAKER_1:  And so it really is, I think, the most intimate moment that you get with God.

01:19:58,434 --> 01:19:59,006
SPEAKER_1:  End.

01:19:59,490 --> 01:20:02,046
SPEAKER_1:  the deepest part of the prayer. the word Masjid.

01:20:02,786 --> 01:20:06,558
SPEAKER_1:  which is mosque in Arabic means place of sujood, place of prostration.

01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:09,822
SPEAKER_1:  So think of the rest of prayer as an introduction to.

01:20:10,466 --> 01:20:12,702
SPEAKER_1:  that particular part of the prayer where you really.

01:20:13,282 --> 01:20:14,366
SPEAKER_1:  Immerse yourself.

01:20:14,754 --> 01:20:16,990
SPEAKER_1:  not that you shouldn't be immersed in your prayer throughout.

01:20:17,314 --> 01:20:19,230
SPEAKER_1:  but when you're in seduce, when you're in prostration.

01:20:19,810 --> 01:20:23,230
SPEAKER_1:  That's where you're really closest and most connected to God. So we do that.

01:20:24,162 --> 01:20:25,374
SPEAKER_1:  And so some prayers.

01:20:25,634 --> 01:20:26,494
SPEAKER_1:  are

01:20:27,042 --> 01:20:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  two units.

01:20:28,642 --> 01:20:30,846
SPEAKER_1:  Well, the first prayer of the day.

01:20:31,586 --> 01:20:34,014
SPEAKER_1:  which is before sunrise, the earliest prayer.

01:20:34,338 --> 01:20:35,262
SPEAKER_1:  is two units.

01:20:35,842 --> 01:20:36,222
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:20:36,514 --> 01:20:38,686
SPEAKER_1:  The second prayer, which is around noon.

01:20:39,426 --> 01:20:40,350
SPEAKER_1:  is four units.

01:20:40,706 --> 01:20:42,686
SPEAKER_1:  And then afternoon, another four units.

01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:47,006
SPEAKER_1:  And then the sunset prayer is three units. And then the evening prayer is four units.

01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:50,846
SPEAKER_1:  So each prayer has a different number of units to it.

01:20:51,298 --> 01:20:53,118
SPEAKER_1:  and some voluntary prayers that surround it.

01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:55,102
SPEAKER_1:  when you come back up.

01:20:55,394 --> 01:20:59,166
SPEAKER_1:  You express also a form of greeting towards God.

01:20:59,394 --> 01:20:59,870
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:21:00,098 --> 01:21:01,214
SPEAKER_1:  channeling your prayers.

01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:02,910
SPEAKER_1:  and your blessings towards God.

01:21:03,554 --> 01:21:08,446
SPEAKER_1:  You reiterate the Shahadah, which is the first pillar of Islam. I testify that there is only one God.

01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:11,262
SPEAKER_1:  and that Muhammad is his servant and messenger.

01:21:11,874 --> 01:21:15,678
SPEAKER_1:  And then you read what's called Salah Ibrahimiyah, which is the Abrahamic prayer.

01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:20,894
SPEAKER_1:  So you send peace and blessings upon Muhammad and his family and Abraham and his family.

01:21:21,730 --> 01:21:25,086
SPEAKER_1:  Abraham, peace be upon him, is really at the core of this religion.

01:21:25,666 --> 01:21:27,550
SPEAKER_1:  At the end of the prayer, you...

01:21:27,778 --> 01:21:28,478
SPEAKER_1:  You son.

01:21:28,802 --> 01:21:32,958
SPEAKER_1:  Peace and blessings and prayers upon, again, both Muhammad and his family and Abraham and his family.

01:21:33,922 --> 01:21:36,766
SPEAKER_1:  And then you have another chance to make some of your own personal prayers.

01:21:36,994 --> 01:21:39,550
SPEAKER_1:  And then you say, Assalamu alaikum warahmatullah.

01:21:40,226 --> 01:21:42,302
SPEAKER_1:  Peace be on to you in the mercy of God.

01:21:42,722 --> 01:21:43,166
SPEAKER_1:  to your right.

01:21:43,778 --> 01:21:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  Peace be unto you and the mercy.

01:21:45,442 --> 01:21:46,014
SPEAKER_1:  of God.

01:21:46,242 --> 01:21:48,766
SPEAKER_1:  your left and that means everything and everyone to your right.

01:21:49,378 --> 01:21:52,414
SPEAKER_1:  everyone and everything to your left. So you imagine a congregation.

01:21:53,186 --> 01:21:56,222
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, when you're in worship, right, you're, you're sending that to.

01:21:56,610 --> 01:22:00,190
SPEAKER_1:  the angels and the human beings next to you, your fellow worshippers next to you.

01:22:01,346 --> 01:22:06,430
SPEAKER_1:  And you'll even say you'll seek forgiveness from God afterwards. There are supplications that surround the prayer.

01:22:07,586 --> 01:22:10,366
SPEAKER_1:  And you will say Allahumma anta assalam wa minkasalam.

01:22:10,914 --> 01:22:14,558
SPEAKER_1:  that O Allah, O God, you are peace and from you is peace.

01:22:15,042 --> 01:22:16,478
SPEAKER_1:  and to you belongs all glory.

01:22:16,738 --> 01:22:17,310
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:22:17,634 --> 01:22:18,686
SPEAKER_1:  All praise.

01:22:19,394 --> 01:22:26,750
SPEAKER_1:  almost to say that you received something in this prayer, that you receive a great sense of inner peace and now you're spreading that. So as it

01:22:27,298 --> 01:22:28,606
SPEAKER_1:  Really comes into you then.

01:22:28,994 --> 01:22:29,694
SPEAKER_1:  you can give.

01:22:30,178 --> 01:22:32,830
SPEAKER_1:  You can give to the world around you what you generate in your own heart.

01:22:33,698 --> 01:22:37,278
SPEAKER_1:  And in prayer, you generate a great sense of tranquility, a great sense of peace.

01:22:37,986 --> 01:22:41,694
SPEAKER_1:  The Quran says, verily in the remembrance of God do hearts find.

01:22:41,986 --> 01:22:42,686
SPEAKER_1:  contentment.

01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:44,030
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:22:44,450 --> 01:22:45,342
SPEAKER_1:  prayer is.

01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:48,062
SPEAKER_1:  an exercise in the remembrance of God.

01:22:48,866 --> 01:22:49,246
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:22:49,602 --> 01:22:51,646
SPEAKER_1:  That is again, obligatory five times a day.

01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:53,438
SPEAKER_1:  no matter where you are.

01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:55,262
SPEAKER_1:  So, anywhere in the world.

01:22:55,394 --> 01:22:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  Anywhere you find yourself in your life and in...

01:22:58,626 --> 01:23:00,830
SPEAKER_0:  uh... different life circumstances anywhere

01:23:00,962 --> 01:23:03,294
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. So outside coffee shop in the grass.

01:23:03,554 --> 01:23:04,702
SPEAKER_1:  outside of the coffee shop.

01:23:04,802 --> 01:23:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  as it did a few days ago. So anywhere at all, and that means.

01:23:10,882 --> 01:23:11,902
SPEAKER_1:  airports included

01:23:12,066 --> 01:23:15,454
SPEAKER_0:  given the context of our previous conversation of.

01:23:16,258 --> 01:23:17,854
SPEAKER_0:  I hate your toe words.

01:23:18,210 --> 01:23:19,390
SPEAKER_0:  people of Muslim faith.

01:23:19,906 --> 01:23:20,862
SPEAKER_0:  That means...

01:23:21,346 --> 01:23:24,158
SPEAKER_0:  uh... you probably through the practice of prayer

01:23:24,386 --> 01:23:25,511
SPEAKER_0:  It attracts people.

01:23:25,511 --> 01:23:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  I've attracted curiosity, I've attracted hate. I've had people walk up to me like, hey man, you okay? You know, in the airport. Everything.

01:23:32,098 --> 01:23:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  So most probably these conversations of curiosity and opportunity to actually...

01:23:37,378 --> 01:23:39,207
SPEAKER_0:  talk about the values.

01:23:39,207 --> 01:23:41,726
SPEAKER_1:  And I try to make it a point to tell people.

01:23:42,018 --> 01:23:46,558
SPEAKER_1:  If I'm about to pray in front of them. So like in an airport, let's say, for example, go to the corner.

01:23:46,914 --> 01:23:47,710
SPEAKER_1:  next to a gate.

01:23:48,002 --> 01:23:50,142
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. And if there are people sitting there like, Hey, I'm about to

01:23:50,786 --> 01:23:54,206
SPEAKER_1:  engaged in a prayer, I hope you don't mind. They'll really appreciate the courtesy most of the time.

01:23:55,042 --> 01:23:55,390
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:23:55,778 --> 01:24:00,414
SPEAKER_1:  But no, I mean, when those five times come in they're kind of windows, right?

01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:02,654
SPEAKER_1:  we have to pray.

01:24:02,946 --> 01:24:04,318
SPEAKER_1:  and uh...

01:24:05,570 --> 01:24:12,510
SPEAKER_1:  That means at work, that means at school, that means when you're traveling. Although there are some concessions that allow you to combine prayers at.

01:24:12,834 --> 01:24:15,038
SPEAKER_1:  certain times when you're traveling, for example.

01:24:16,546 --> 01:24:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  Even then, you're going to have to pray.

01:24:19,906 --> 01:24:21,214
SPEAKER_1:  I think that

01:24:22,626 --> 01:24:23,774
SPEAKER_1:  what that does.

01:24:24,642 --> 01:24:25,118
SPEAKER_1:  to.

01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:28,574
SPEAKER_1:  bring you back to God.

01:24:30,050 --> 01:24:31,006
SPEAKER_1:  no matter what you're doing.

01:24:31,842 --> 01:24:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  It's actually.

01:24:32,866 --> 01:24:35,134
SPEAKER_1:  You know, you think of it this way, you're in a meeting.

01:24:35,522 --> 01:24:36,638
SPEAKER_1:  You're engaged in something.

01:24:36,962 --> 01:24:38,078
SPEAKER_1:  You're really stressed out.

01:24:38,626 --> 01:24:41,822
SPEAKER_1:  And you also have the ablution before the prayer where you wash up.

01:24:42,178 --> 01:24:43,806
SPEAKER_1:  Wash your face, wash your limbs.

01:24:44,322 --> 01:24:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  and engage in prayer.

01:24:46,178 --> 01:24:47,262
SPEAKER_1:  what it does for you.

01:24:48,130 --> 01:24:49,854
SPEAKER_1:  and anchoring you in...

01:24:50,242 --> 01:24:51,486
SPEAKER_1:  something more meaningful.

01:24:52,450 --> 01:24:53,982
SPEAKER_1:  when you are in the turmoil.

01:24:54,274 --> 01:24:56,542
SPEAKER_1:  of a lot of times what's not so meaningful.

01:24:57,314 --> 01:24:58,718
SPEAKER_1:  is incredible.

01:24:58,978 --> 01:25:00,446
SPEAKER_1:  And so it's a gift from God.

01:25:01,282 --> 01:25:01,822
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:25:02,466 --> 01:25:03,454
SPEAKER_1:  It is an obligation.

01:25:03,842 --> 01:25:06,046
SPEAKER_1:  It's something that we have to do as Muslims.

01:25:07,074 --> 01:25:07,454
SPEAKER_1:  but.

01:25:07,810 --> 01:25:08,478
SPEAKER_1:  If you...

01:25:08,738 --> 01:25:10,270
SPEAKER_1:  actually learn its essence then.

01:25:11,074 --> 01:25:11,966
SPEAKER_1:  it can feel.

01:25:12,354 --> 01:25:14,238
SPEAKER_1:  more like a joy than it is an obligation.

01:25:15,170 --> 01:25:18,014
SPEAKER_1:  and then you're called to at night, especially again the night prayer.

01:25:18,338 --> 01:25:20,414
SPEAKER_1:  as a big part of who we are as Muslims.

01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:22,622
SPEAKER_1:  waking up in the last part of the night.

01:25:23,362 --> 01:25:25,470
SPEAKER_1:  The Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him said that the

01:25:25,698 --> 01:25:30,590
SPEAKER_1:  The best prayer and the best fasting was of that of David, peace be upon him. So we think of David.

01:25:31,074 --> 01:25:35,582
SPEAKER_1:  David. He's a prophet in Islam as well. I'm sure you'll ask me about the whole concept of prophethood.

01:25:36,066 --> 01:25:40,094
SPEAKER_1:  You're hearing Abraham and David and others, right? So David peace be upon him, he said that.

01:25:40,578 --> 01:25:43,134
SPEAKER_1:  David used to fast every other day.

01:25:43,682 --> 01:25:45,630
SPEAKER_1:  And he used to pray the last third of the night.

01:25:46,146 --> 01:25:47,934
SPEAKER_1:  He'd stand up and pray in the last dirt of the night.

01:25:48,706 --> 01:25:49,950
SPEAKER_1:  So, fasting.

01:25:50,306 --> 01:25:52,126
SPEAKER_1:  uh... is a big part of who we are

01:25:52,962 --> 01:25:54,910
SPEAKER_1:  and praying in the last third of the night.

01:25:55,714 --> 01:26:01,342
SPEAKER_1:  Meaning before that early morning prayer, you know, waking up if you can at 4 a.m., 430 a.m., 5 a.m.

01:26:02,786 --> 01:26:05,054
SPEAKER_1:  and praying even for a few minutes.

01:26:05,506 --> 01:26:05,950
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:26:06,690 --> 01:26:08,702
SPEAKER_1:  there's something in the serenity of the night.

01:26:09,762 --> 01:26:10,142
SPEAKER_1:  that.

01:26:11,170 --> 01:26:12,286
SPEAKER_1:  can unlock anew.

01:26:12,866 --> 01:26:16,414
SPEAKER_1:  a sense of inner joy and peace that nothing else in the world can give you.

01:26:17,186 --> 01:26:20,542
SPEAKER_0:  And again, that pulls you away from all the turmoil of day-to-day life.

01:26:21,186 --> 01:26:21,694
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:26:22,242 --> 01:26:25,534
SPEAKER_0:  If it's little things or if it's big things, just pause it.

01:26:25,922 --> 01:26:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  pulls you out of it to remember what is.

01:26:28,866 --> 01:26:30,046
SPEAKER_0:  more important than life.

01:26:30,434 --> 01:26:31,902
SPEAKER_1:  So when we think about access.

01:26:32,674 --> 01:26:38,814
SPEAKER_1:  In the last third of the night, we're taught that God says, is there anyone seeking forgiveness that I may forgive them?

01:26:39,554 --> 01:26:42,270
SPEAKER_1:  Is there anyone seeking refuge that I may grant it to them?

01:26:42,882 --> 01:26:44,702
SPEAKER_1:  Is there anyone asking for anything?

01:26:44,962 --> 01:26:45,950
SPEAKER_1:  that I may give it to them.

01:26:46,306 --> 01:26:48,862
SPEAKER_1:  So whatever you're calling upon him with at that time.

01:26:49,090 --> 01:26:50,270
SPEAKER_1:  He's responding to you.

01:26:50,978 --> 01:26:52,190
SPEAKER_1:  in a way that befits him.

01:26:53,026 --> 01:26:53,918
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

01:26:54,370 --> 01:26:55,646
SPEAKER_1:  It's closeness as well.

01:26:56,418 --> 01:26:57,118
SPEAKER_1:  And.

01:26:57,442 --> 01:26:59,486
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, you would think that you sleep less.

01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:00,190
SPEAKER_1:  So...

01:27:01,154 --> 01:27:01,854
SPEAKER_1:  You're probably.

01:27:02,082 --> 01:27:03,038
SPEAKER_1:  More cranky, but...

01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:04,062
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:27:04,418 --> 01:27:06,302
SPEAKER_1:  The happiest people in the world are the people that.

01:27:06,594 --> 01:27:08,382
SPEAKER_1:  stand up in that last third of the night and pray.

01:27:08,866 --> 01:27:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, there's a deeply meditative, contemplative.

01:27:12,450 --> 01:27:13,566
SPEAKER_0:  aspect to it today.

01:27:14,210 --> 01:27:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  I think...

01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  Probably.

01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  strengthens your sleep if anything else once you return to it.

01:27:20,258 --> 01:27:20,734
SPEAKER_1:  There you go.

01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:25,278
SPEAKER_1:  See, people underestimate that. There was a great sage in Islam. He was asked, he said, how come?

01:27:25,698 --> 01:27:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  the people who pray at night.

01:27:27,746 --> 01:27:28,190
SPEAKER_1:  are.

01:27:28,674 --> 01:27:37,534
SPEAKER_1:  uh, the most beautiful of people and they're, they're, they're fresh in the day, it doesn't make sense. And he said, because they secluded themselves with the most merciful and he dressed them in his light.

01:27:38,306 --> 01:27:38,878
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

01:27:39,490 --> 01:27:42,270
SPEAKER_1:  There's a beauty that it generates.

01:27:42,978 --> 01:27:43,358
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:27:43,906 --> 01:27:50,846
SPEAKER_1:  And that's why we're to aspire to that really as believers, that's kind of your highest thing. Like don't just pray the five prayers. If you can pray at night, pray at night.

01:27:51,298 --> 01:27:52,423
SPEAKER_1:  and connect at that time.

01:27:52,423 --> 01:27:59,710
SPEAKER_0:  Good friend of mine, Andrew Huberman, who's a neuroscientist from Stanford. He has an amazing podcast called Huberman Lab.

01:28:00,258 --> 01:28:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  but he's also a scholar of sleep.

01:28:03,266 --> 01:28:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  Among many other things and so I would love him to he probably knows the science on this too

01:28:09,122 --> 01:28:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  There's probably good science that actually studies...

01:28:12,482 --> 01:28:14,270
SPEAKER_0:  practicing Muslims to see what

01:28:14,946 --> 01:28:15,806
SPEAKER_0:  wuh uh

01:28:16,034 --> 01:28:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  the benefits of sleep I would love to actually...

01:28:18,882 --> 01:28:28,126
SPEAKER_1:  see what that says. We have amazing, I don't want to cut you off, we have amazing hygiene because of how much we have to wash up for prayer. That's true. And it's great for our limbs as well, right?

01:28:28,578 --> 01:28:29,022
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:28:29,346 --> 01:28:32,830
SPEAKER_1:  You know, and that's one of the added benefits, right? It's good for us.

01:28:33,090 --> 01:28:36,286
SPEAKER_1:  Worship that we do is not torturous. It's actually good for us.

01:28:36,578 --> 01:28:39,230
SPEAKER_1:  However, the core objective of worship has to remain.

01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:40,254
SPEAKER_1:  That it's.

01:28:40,674 --> 01:28:45,470
SPEAKER_1:  something you do out of worship and something you do out of a sense of obligation and gratitude to God.

01:28:45,730 --> 01:28:50,910
SPEAKER_1:  not because of those things. Like I'm not gonna fast because it's good for my health, but I know it's good for my health to fast.

01:28:51,682 --> 01:28:55,166
SPEAKER_1:  but it's pretty cool when you walk into, I'll share this with you. There is a man.

01:28:55,842 --> 01:28:56,702
SPEAKER_1:  He was a...

01:28:57,154 --> 01:29:03,166
SPEAKER_1:  a scholar from Turkey, an Islamic scholar from Turkey. And he had visited us in Dallas and he was 108 years old.

01:29:03,522 --> 01:29:04,830
SPEAKER_1:  and he could still pray.

01:29:05,410 --> 01:29:06,622
SPEAKER_1:  bowing and prostrating.

01:29:07,394 --> 01:29:11,582
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, his limbs and you think about that, like someone at that age still being able to do that. So,

01:29:11,938 --> 01:29:15,966
SPEAKER_1:  it's good for your limbs, good for your health, good for your gut, good for your sleep, good for your mind.

01:29:16,514 --> 01:29:21,406
SPEAKER_0:  I think the mind one is the really one we've been talking about and that's really, really the big one.

01:29:21,794 --> 01:29:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  and in the small day-to-day psychological sense and in the big philosophical sense what it means to be a human being.

01:29:28,706 --> 01:29:30,590
SPEAKER_0:  I, we should also mention that.

01:29:31,586 --> 01:29:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  and during the prayer.

01:29:33,346 --> 01:29:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  as you've explained you.

01:29:35,490 --> 01:29:36,478
SPEAKER_0:  should face Mecca.

01:29:36,866 --> 01:29:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  Mm-hmm.

01:29:37,826 --> 01:29:39,422
SPEAKER_0:  So what is Mecha and...

01:29:40,130 --> 01:29:42,494
SPEAKER_0:  What's the experience of visiting Mecca like?

01:29:43,554 --> 01:29:44,318
SPEAKER_1:  So, Mecca.

01:29:44,578 --> 01:29:45,150
SPEAKER_1:  is

01:29:45,506 --> 01:29:46,302
SPEAKER_1:  The Home

01:29:46,786 --> 01:29:51,326
SPEAKER_1:  that Abraham, peace be upon him, built along with his son, Ishmael, peace be upon him.

01:29:52,322 --> 01:29:56,542
SPEAKER_1:  and it gives the Muslims a unified direction of prayer.

01:29:57,026 --> 01:29:57,790
SPEAKER_1:  It's

01:29:58,082 --> 01:30:00,318
SPEAKER_1:  sort of at the center geographically.

01:30:01,058 --> 01:30:01,534
SPEAKER_1:  Uh huh.

01:30:01,762 --> 01:30:03,166
SPEAKER_1:  of who we are.

01:30:03,874 --> 01:30:04,958
SPEAKER_1:  Um, and.

01:30:05,794 --> 01:30:07,262
SPEAKER_1:  when we pray towards it.

01:30:08,418 --> 01:30:09,630
SPEAKER_1:  It's not that.

01:30:10,434 --> 01:30:10,974
SPEAKER_1:  It's not that-

01:30:11,362 --> 01:30:17,886
SPEAKER_1:  that's the only place that you can supplicate, turn towards, but it gives us a unified sense of direction. It gives us a unified sense of prayer.

01:30:19,106 --> 01:30:19,422
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:30:19,938 --> 01:30:21,214
SPEAKER_1:  Mecca is...

01:30:21,922 --> 01:30:24,606
SPEAKER_1:  our Qibla, it's our place of direction.

01:30:25,122 --> 01:30:31,486
SPEAKER_1:  when we are alive and when we are dead. So actually we pray facing towards it. When we die we are also faced towards it in our graves.

01:30:32,386 --> 01:30:34,878
SPEAKER_1:  And it kind of gives us that unifying spirit. So this is-

01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:35,550
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

01:30:36,002 --> 01:30:37,054
SPEAKER_1:  The Valley of Becca.

01:30:37,442 --> 01:30:40,510
SPEAKER_1:  also in the Bible spoken about the Valley of Beqa.

01:30:41,474 --> 01:30:45,854
SPEAKER_1:  and where other biblical scholars would also mention Mount Perrin.

01:30:46,722 --> 01:30:48,094
SPEAKER_1:  and it is the place.

01:30:48,322 --> 01:30:48,702
SPEAKER_1:  dot

01:30:49,378 --> 01:30:49,822
SPEAKER_1:  Adam.

01:30:50,242 --> 01:30:50,750
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

01:30:51,138 --> 01:30:56,382
SPEAKER_1:  In the Quran, Adam peace be upon him first had a place constructed there as a place of worship.

01:30:57,570 --> 01:30:59,422
SPEAKER_1:  from the angels towards God and then...

01:30:59,682 --> 01:31:00,446
SPEAKER_1:  when Abraham.

01:31:00,706 --> 01:31:01,342
SPEAKER_1:  settles.

01:31:01,826 --> 01:31:03,678
SPEAKER_1:  Hagar and Ishmael in Mecca.

01:31:05,186 --> 01:31:06,654
SPEAKER_1:  they build this house of worship.

01:31:07,522 --> 01:31:08,638
SPEAKER_1:  And that is where.

01:31:09,218 --> 01:31:10,430
SPEAKER_1:  The Gushing Springs.

SPEAKER_1:  that they can sustain themselves from.

01:31:20,706 --> 01:31:25,150

01:31:26,050 --> 01:31:26,590
SPEAKER_1:  is

01:31:27,042 --> 01:31:27,998
SPEAKER_1:  given a place.

01:31:28,322 --> 01:31:31,038
SPEAKER_1:  and there's a story and a history that's going to unfold.

01:31:31,522 --> 01:31:32,670
SPEAKER_1:  from that place of Mecca.

01:31:33,218 --> 01:31:36,062
SPEAKER_1:  And then Isaac is born, peace be upon him, 13 years later.

01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:40,318
SPEAKER_1:  And there's a story and a history that comes from that. But ultimately...

01:31:41,026 --> 01:31:42,110
SPEAKER_1:  Mecca is...

01:31:42,562 --> 01:31:45,022

01:33:02,402 --> 01:33:06,750
SPEAKER_1:  concerns and superficial barriers and distinctions.

01:33:07,554 --> 01:33:08,702
SPEAKER_1:  that exist in this life.

01:33:09,154 --> 01:33:11,198

01:33:11,778 --> 01:33:12,830
SPEAKER_1:  circle around.

01:33:13,058 --> 01:33:14,078

SPEAKER_1:  We are.

01:33:19,938 --> 01:33:23,774
SPEAKER_1:  do seven rounds between Safa and Marwa, the two mountains where Hagar.

01:33:24,322 --> 01:33:25,182
SPEAKER_1:  when she wants.

01:33:25,506 --> 01:33:27,902

SPEAKER_1:  looking for water, trusting God was provided for, we too.

01:33:32,674 --> 01:33:35,262
SPEAKER_1:  go between the two mountains of Safa and Marwa.

01:33:35,682 --> 01:33:38,142
SPEAKER_1:  to express that trust in God and to follow in that way.

01:33:38,786 --> 01:33:40,670
SPEAKER_1:  And these are ultimately, these are the rituals that.

01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:43,646
SPEAKER_1:  Abraham himself engaged in.

01:33:43,938 --> 01:33:44,446
SPEAKER_1:  um...

01:33:45,314 --> 01:33:46,686
SPEAKER_1:  in our tradition and

01:33:46,978 --> 01:33:52,990
SPEAKER_1:  Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him engaged in. And so we engage in the exact same rituals and there are divine wisdoms to them that

01:33:53,346 --> 01:33:54,942
SPEAKER_1:  we might not even be able to.

01:33:55,362 --> 01:33:56,670
SPEAKER_1:  unpack and reflect upon.

01:33:57,506 --> 01:33:59,358
SPEAKER_1:  But it really is in that place where.

01:34:00,130 --> 01:34:00,510
SPEAKER_1:  um...

01:34:01,218 --> 01:34:02,014
SPEAKER_1:  you find.

01:34:02,754 --> 01:34:07,230
SPEAKER_1:  most beautiful global expression of Islam. You see people from all over the world.

01:34:07,906 --> 01:34:12,990
SPEAKER_1:  People that don't speak the same languages, people from all sorts of backgrounds, and they're all doing the exact same thing.

01:34:13,730 --> 01:34:16,158
SPEAKER_1:  and in a matter of seconds when the call of prayer comes.

01:34:16,898 --> 01:34:18,142
SPEAKER_1:  in a matter of seconds.

01:34:18,818 --> 01:34:22,334
SPEAKER_1:  two, three million people get arranged in perfect rows for prayer.

01:34:22,626 --> 01:34:24,510
SPEAKER_1:  and it just, it looks like.

01:34:25,122 --> 01:34:26,494
SPEAKER_1:  this perfect optical.

01:34:27,298 --> 01:34:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  you know uh...

01:34:28,674 --> 01:34:30,110
SPEAKER_1:  vision of just beauty.

01:34:30,498 --> 01:34:31,518
SPEAKER_1:  when you see people.

01:34:32,002 --> 01:34:32,766
SPEAKER_1:  in unison.

01:34:32,994 --> 01:34:34,878
SPEAKER_1:  Standing, bowing, prostrating.

01:34:35,618 --> 01:34:37,470
SPEAKER_1:  and you don't know who the person next to you is.

01:34:38,370 --> 01:34:45,374
SPEAKER_1:  And that's where, you know, you, you know, Malcolm X, you read about the history of Malcolm X when he went to Hajj, that's where his entire worldview shifts.

01:34:46,050 --> 01:34:46,494
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

01:34:46,754 --> 01:34:47,582
SPEAKER_1:  not just.

01:34:48,002 --> 01:34:49,022
SPEAKER_1:  his previous.

01:34:49,730 --> 01:34:50,718
SPEAKER_1:  baggage.

01:34:51,074 --> 01:34:52,030
SPEAKER_1:  Um, but.

01:34:53,314 --> 01:34:53,982
SPEAKER_1:  The dream.

01:34:54,434 --> 01:34:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  that.

01:34:55,106 --> 01:34:56,990
SPEAKER_1:  he then had the

01:34:57,634 --> 01:34:59,070
SPEAKER_1:  possibilities that he saw.

01:34:59,714 --> 01:35:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  for people to be able to overcome some of the false distinctions that we have.

01:35:04,290 --> 01:35:06,174
SPEAKER_1:  race and class.

01:35:07,298 --> 01:35:08,286
SPEAKER_1:  and to see.

01:35:09,218 --> 01:35:11,326
SPEAKER_1:  God as one and to come together.

01:35:12,770 --> 01:35:16,926
SPEAKER_1:  and worship Him alone and also seeing each other, equal participants in that worship.

01:35:17,442 --> 01:35:18,590
SPEAKER_1:  If we could just linger it.

01:35:18,754 --> 01:35:19,870
SPEAKER_0:  on it a little bit.

01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  I think you've mentioned that Malcolm X...

01:35:23,810 --> 01:35:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  has been in part misunderstood.

01:35:26,306 --> 01:35:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  What are some aspects of him that are misunderstood?

01:35:29,410 --> 01:35:31,294
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I think reading is autobiography is.

01:35:33,186 --> 01:35:36,958
SPEAKER_1:  for anyone that wants to understand him, right? So you read him his own words.

01:35:37,826 --> 01:35:39,326
SPEAKER_1:  Malcolm lived the tragedy.

01:35:39,810 --> 01:35:40,798
SPEAKER_1:  of being.

01:35:41,602 --> 01:35:43,326
SPEAKER_1:  a young, disenfranchised.

01:35:43,906 --> 01:35:46,014
SPEAKER_1:  black man in America who went through

01:35:46,498 --> 01:35:49,406
SPEAKER_1:  all of the difficulties that were posed.

01:35:50,242 --> 01:35:52,382
SPEAKER_1:  in a 1950s America.

01:35:53,058 --> 01:35:53,438
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

01:35:53,826 --> 01:35:56,574
SPEAKER_1:  towards him. I mean, he went through the system and it was...

01:35:57,218 --> 01:36:01,022
SPEAKER_1:  awful for him and he had to pull himself out of that and make himself into

01:36:01,826 --> 01:36:04,350
SPEAKER_1:  an incredible orator and incredible leader.

01:36:05,090 --> 01:36:09,534
SPEAKER_1:  that suddenly had a pretty empowering vision and a calm and

01:36:09,890 --> 01:36:10,558
SPEAKER_1:  And.

01:36:11,010 --> 01:36:13,694
SPEAKER_1:  Nonetheless, courageous, but a calm presence to him.

01:36:14,594 --> 01:36:17,822
SPEAKER_1:  uh, and was able to bring together people.

01:36:18,050 --> 01:36:21,182
SPEAKER_1:  especially uplift black people in America to believe in themselves.

01:36:21,890 --> 01:36:23,198
SPEAKER_1:  young

01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:29,918
SPEAKER_1:  Young men in America and in prisons in particular will read the autobiography of Malcolm X and see hope for themselves.

01:36:30,434 --> 01:36:31,390
SPEAKER_1:  to come out of.

01:36:32,034 --> 01:36:32,926
SPEAKER_1:  The darkness.

01:36:33,634 --> 01:36:34,110
SPEAKER_1:  of

01:36:35,010 --> 01:36:36,926
SPEAKER_1:  you know, being in prison, not just by.

01:36:37,506 --> 01:36:39,038
SPEAKER_1:  the bars in front of them.

01:36:39,842 --> 01:36:41,662
SPEAKER_1:  but also by.

01:36:41,954 --> 01:36:43,038
SPEAKER_1:  what they thought to be.

01:36:43,522 --> 01:36:44,350
SPEAKER_1:  their own worth.

01:36:44,866 --> 01:36:48,350
SPEAKER_1:  prior to that moment. And so Malcolm climbs out of

01:36:48,866 --> 01:36:51,678
SPEAKER_1:  that and he goes through multiple phases.

01:36:52,450 --> 01:36:54,686
SPEAKER_1:  Malcolm dies as an orthodox Muslim.

01:36:55,522 --> 01:36:55,934
SPEAKER_1:  Who?

01:36:56,578 --> 01:36:59,966
SPEAKER_1:  does not believe in the superiority of one race over the other.

01:37:00,802 --> 01:37:01,342
SPEAKER_1:  finds.

01:37:01,922 --> 01:37:03,294
SPEAKER_1:  Great tranquility.

01:37:03,906 --> 01:37:05,342
SPEAKER_1:  in the practice of the Hajj.

01:37:06,114 --> 01:37:06,558
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:37:07,106 --> 01:37:09,918
SPEAKER_1:  great clarity and I think you read his letters from Mecca.

01:37:10,850 --> 01:37:17,086
SPEAKER_1:  And he talks about his change, his transformation in particular. And it was a process. It's a process for him.

01:37:17,858 --> 01:37:21,502
SPEAKER_1:  but he inspires the likes of Muhammad Ali to become the person that he becomes.

01:37:21,858 --> 01:37:22,462
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:24,126
SPEAKER_1:  inspires many other people.

01:37:24,930 --> 01:37:26,046
SPEAKER_1:  uh... till today

01:37:26,754 --> 01:37:27,582
SPEAKER_1:  to really

01:37:28,386 --> 01:37:31,710
SPEAKER_1:  see themselves and see the world differently in light of that.

01:37:31,970 --> 01:37:33,438
SPEAKER_1:  understanding of monotheism.

01:37:34,562 --> 01:37:37,566
SPEAKER_0:  So he was deeply a man of faith.

01:37:37,826 --> 01:37:41,150
SPEAKER_0:  and throughout his life the nature of that faith has.

01:37:41,378 --> 01:37:42,110
SPEAKER_0:  changed.

01:37:42,530 --> 01:37:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  As he grew as he...

01:37:44,482 --> 01:37:45,854
SPEAKER_0:  interact with.

01:37:46,914 --> 01:37:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  I would say a cruel society that he was living.

01:37:51,330 --> 01:37:54,686
SPEAKER_0:  You mentioned he inspired Muhammad Ali who

01:37:55,394 --> 01:37:57,982
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think it's an overstatement to say it's probably.

01:37:58,722 --> 01:38:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  the most, quite possibly the most famous.

01:38:01,442 --> 01:38:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  American Muslim from America

01:38:04,002 --> 01:38:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  Could you maybe make a few comments?

01:38:06,242 --> 01:38:07,367
SPEAKER_0:  as an athlete yourself.

01:38:07,367 --> 01:38:10,367
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

01:38:10,367 --> 01:38:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  what impact did...

01:38:13,538 --> 01:38:20,734
SPEAKER_0:  Islam have on Muhammad Ali's life and what and vice versa, what impact did he have as a leader, as a religious figure?

01:38:21,090 --> 01:38:22,974
SPEAKER_0:  on the Muslim community.

01:38:24,098 --> 01:38:26,622
SPEAKER_1:  I think Muhammad Ali, his quotes on...

01:38:26,946 --> 01:38:36,446
SPEAKER_1:  Islam are precious because he talks about how he sought the wealth of this world and he found it in Islam. He found a greater meaning and he attributes everything that he became.

01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:37,950
SPEAKER_1:  To his faith.

01:38:38,818 --> 01:38:42,206
SPEAKER_1:  uh, his sense of, of strength and commitment.

01:38:42,882 --> 01:38:44,894
SPEAKER_1:  uh, the willingness to

01:38:45,858 --> 01:38:46,814
SPEAKER_1:  take a stand.

01:38:47,330 --> 01:38:47,774
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

01:38:48,418 --> 01:38:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  for the truth.

01:38:50,722 --> 01:38:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  when it was extremely unpopular.

01:38:53,410 --> 01:38:56,478
SPEAKER_1:  on the basis of his faith and on the basis of his integrity.

01:38:57,378 --> 01:38:58,398
SPEAKER_1:  I think that.

01:38:58,722 --> 01:39:00,894
SPEAKER_1:  He inspired people with his confidence.

01:39:01,794 --> 01:39:02,430
SPEAKER_1:  end.

01:39:05,058 --> 01:39:06,110
SPEAKER_1:  his coherence.

01:39:06,562 --> 01:39:08,094
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, he was incredibly eloquent.

01:39:09,090 --> 01:39:10,078
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, poetic.

01:39:11,810 --> 01:39:12,830
SPEAKER_1:  and is unwavering.

01:39:13,666 --> 01:39:14,654
SPEAKER_1:  seemed unbreakable.

01:39:15,202 --> 01:39:17,598
SPEAKER_1:  as relentless as he was in the ring.

01:39:17,890 --> 01:39:20,958
SPEAKER_1:  He was even more so outside of the ring. The man could not be broken.

01:39:21,890 --> 01:39:22,398
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:39:22,818 --> 01:39:24,318
SPEAKER_1:  Everything was stacked up against them.

01:39:25,026 --> 01:39:29,022
SPEAKER_1:  but he perseveres and he does so then through Parkinson's.

01:39:30,210 --> 01:39:32,350
SPEAKER_1:  and chooses to live a life of.

01:39:33,250 --> 01:39:36,638
SPEAKER_1:  of giving, a life of service, a life of using his platform.

01:39:37,730 --> 01:39:38,110
SPEAKER_1:  to.

01:39:38,658 --> 01:39:40,862
SPEAKER_1:  bring up issues of importance and to.

01:39:41,602 --> 01:39:43,454
SPEAKER_1:  champion the rights of others, so he wasn't.

01:39:43,842 --> 01:39:47,102
SPEAKER_1:  satisfied at any point in his life with simply being a boxing great.

01:39:47,554 --> 01:39:48,446
SPEAKER_1:  boxing champion.

01:39:49,410 --> 01:39:50,782
SPEAKER_1:  uses it for so much more.

01:39:51,554 --> 01:39:57,374
SPEAKER_1:  And so he goes down as one of the most famous Americans period of the 20th century one of the most transformative Americans period.

01:39:57,954 --> 01:40:00,030
SPEAKER_1:  of the 20th century, not just American Muslims.

01:40:00,930 --> 01:40:01,342
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

01:40:01,730 --> 01:40:03,838
SPEAKER_1:  and a lot of people that loved him when he died.

01:40:04,546 --> 01:40:05,630
SPEAKER_1:  would not have loved him.

01:40:06,306 --> 01:40:09,086
SPEAKER_1:  if they were around in the 1960s and the 1970s.

01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:12,126
SPEAKER_1:  You know, they said they loved him when he couldn't speak anymore.

01:40:12,482 --> 01:40:15,102
SPEAKER_1:  many of those who celebrated him at the time of his death.

01:40:15,810 --> 01:40:17,246
SPEAKER_1:  would have been his greatest opponents.

01:40:17,858 --> 01:40:19,006
SPEAKER_1:  at the peak of his career.

01:40:19,458 --> 01:40:22,083
SPEAKER_1:  And when he was taking the stance that he was taking.

01:40:22,083 --> 01:40:25,086
SPEAKER_0:  fearless and part of this his faith was helping him.

01:40:25,474 --> 01:40:26,782
SPEAKER_0:  take the fearless stance.

01:40:27,170 --> 01:40:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  but throughout all of it.

01:40:28,674 --> 01:40:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  Given the strength, I think he's also a symbol of compassion.

01:40:31,906 --> 01:40:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  Trolls, bye.

01:40:33,026 --> 01:40:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  through all the fun kinda.

01:40:35,714 --> 01:40:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, the poetic nature of who he was.

01:40:38,594 --> 01:40:41,150
SPEAKER_0:  and the fearless nature of who he was, there's always like a...

01:40:41,634 --> 01:40:43,838
SPEAKER_0:  and like a deep love for the sport.

01:40:44,610 --> 01:40:45,790
SPEAKER_0:  and for humanity.

01:40:45,922 --> 01:40:49,118
SPEAKER_1:  Absolutely. And that's the thing, right? It was so obvious that.

01:40:49,762 --> 01:40:51,710
SPEAKER_1:  despite everything that had happened to him.

01:40:52,994 --> 01:40:55,742
SPEAKER_1:  He never loses himself.

01:40:56,162 --> 01:40:58,398
SPEAKER_1:  neither to the fame nor to the fear.

01:40:59,170 --> 01:41:00,254
SPEAKER_1:  He always...

01:41:01,346 --> 01:41:03,198
SPEAKER_1:  stays himself, he's authentic.

01:41:03,714 --> 01:41:04,414
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:41:04,642 --> 01:41:07,358
SPEAKER_1:  And you know, when I went to his funeral and it was one of the most beautiful.

01:41:08,258 --> 01:41:09,982
SPEAKER_1:  things I've ever seen because...

01:41:10,722 --> 01:41:11,518
SPEAKER_1:  Everyone.

01:41:12,130 --> 01:41:16,670
SPEAKER_1:  in Louisville, Kentucky, had a story with Muhammad Ali, right? The guy that he saves.

01:41:17,154 --> 01:41:18,590
SPEAKER_1:  from committing suicide.

01:41:19,138 --> 01:41:19,742
SPEAKER_1:  The

01:41:20,066 --> 01:41:22,366
SPEAKER_1:  school kids, the hotel.

01:41:22,818 --> 01:41:28,670
SPEAKER_1:  shuttle driver, the gas station worker, everyone has a story of Muhammad Ali in Louisville, Kentucky.

01:41:29,570 --> 01:41:30,334
SPEAKER_1:  And when he...

01:41:31,202 --> 01:41:32,574
SPEAKER_1:  when he passes away.

01:41:33,186 --> 01:41:34,526
SPEAKER_1:  Everybody comes out.

01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:37,470
SPEAKER_1:  and stands in front of their homes and they take...

01:41:38,242 --> 01:41:40,638
SPEAKER_1:  casket and they drive around the streets of Louisville.

01:41:41,122 --> 01:41:45,310
SPEAKER_1:  and he had this dream. I'm very close to some of his children.

01:41:46,082 --> 01:41:49,310
SPEAKER_1:  Incredible people, by the way, just incredible human beings.

01:41:50,018 --> 01:41:51,870
SPEAKER_1:  and he had this dream that he shared with them.

01:41:52,706 --> 01:41:53,054
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:41:53,282 --> 01:41:55,934
SPEAKER_1:  He was jogging around the streets of Louisville, Kentucky.

01:41:56,994 --> 01:41:58,334
SPEAKER_1:  and everyone.

01:41:58,978 --> 01:42:00,382
SPEAKER_1:  had come out to wave to him.

01:42:00,834 --> 01:42:05,342
SPEAKER_1:  And so he's running around jogging and, and, and waving to everybody in the streets of Louisville, Kentucky.

01:42:05,634 --> 01:42:06,910
SPEAKER_1:  Then he gets to the cemetery.

01:42:07,362 --> 01:42:09,118
SPEAKER_1:  and he says he flies into the heavens.

01:42:09,954 --> 01:42:10,398
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:42:10,722 --> 01:42:13,630
SPEAKER_1:  his dream and he had this dream years ago.

01:42:14,210 --> 01:42:15,550
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, if you look at his funeral.

01:42:16,578 --> 01:42:17,662
SPEAKER_1:  It's such a beautiful.

01:42:18,722 --> 01:42:20,350
SPEAKER_1:  You can't make it up. It's such a b-

01:42:20,610 --> 01:42:21,342
SPEAKER_1:  beautiful

01:42:22,018 --> 01:42:29,662
SPEAKER_1:  moment where it seems to come to reality because everybody in Louisville just comes out and just waves by says casket. And then when he gets to the

01:42:30,114 --> 01:42:32,254
SPEAKER_1:  cemetery, the gates close and...

01:42:33,058 --> 01:42:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  He goes off to be with his Lord and we pray that it's a good place for him.

01:42:37,122 --> 01:42:38,247
SPEAKER_1:  So Muhammad Ali

01:42:38,247 --> 01:42:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  He's probably one of the great 20th century representatives of Islam.

01:42:42,818 --> 01:42:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:42:43,714 --> 01:42:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  For me personally at least.

01:42:45,602 --> 01:42:55,134
SPEAKER_0:  Hopefully I'm not showing my bias. One of the great modern representatives is Khabib Naremberg Medov, who's a great fighter and a great human being. So you've gotten a chance to meet him.

01:42:55,682 --> 01:43:07,742
SPEAKER_0:  I should also say you're friends, you're good friends with a lot of really interesting Muslim people. I mean, it's such a widespread religion. There's just so much variety of different people that are practicing Muslims.

01:43:08,130 --> 01:43:08,958
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:43:09,922 --> 01:43:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

01:43:11,074 --> 01:43:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  Does Khabib represent what do you like about him as a Muslim? What do you like about him as a person, as representative of the religion?

01:43:18,498 --> 01:43:20,446
SPEAKER_1:  I think Habib...

01:43:21,474 --> 01:43:22,910
SPEAKER_1:  First of all, he is a great person.

01:43:23,394 --> 01:43:23,774
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

01:43:24,162 --> 01:43:24,990
SPEAKER_1:  humble person.

01:43:25,378 --> 01:43:26,174
SPEAKER_1:  He's shown.

01:43:26,722 --> 01:43:30,846
SPEAKER_1:  And now Islam as well, kind of following in that. They're really showing the beauty of.

01:43:31,138 --> 01:43:32,190
SPEAKER_1:  faith in their lives.

01:43:32,770 --> 01:43:34,366
SPEAKER_1:  their culture, their values.

01:43:35,170 --> 01:43:35,582
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:43:36,098 --> 01:43:37,662
SPEAKER_1:  Everything from the way.

01:43:38,338 --> 01:43:40,766
SPEAKER_1:  that he carried himself in a principled way.

01:43:41,890 --> 01:43:43,070
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, you know, like, like.

01:43:43,618 --> 01:43:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  Every Muslim kid grew up.

01:43:45,506 --> 01:43:47,582
SPEAKER_1:  in a public school cafeteria.

01:43:47,938 --> 01:43:51,422
SPEAKER_1:  before Islamic schools were a thing in the United States, people were not eating pork for example.

01:43:51,842 --> 01:43:53,118
SPEAKER_1:  kind of being the odd person out.

01:43:53,890 --> 01:43:54,974
SPEAKER_1:  So when you got a fighter...

01:43:55,362 --> 01:43:55,966
SPEAKER_1:  and uh...

01:43:56,898 --> 01:43:58,814
SPEAKER_1:  in the UFC scene.

01:43:59,074 --> 01:44:00,318
SPEAKER_1:  doesn't drink alcohol.

01:44:00,546 --> 01:44:02,238
SPEAKER_1:  kind of maintains like a very.

01:44:02,946 --> 01:44:03,358
SPEAKER_1:  um...

01:44:04,578 --> 01:44:05,438
SPEAKER_1:  insistence.

01:44:05,666 --> 01:44:06,494
SPEAKER_1:  principles.

01:44:07,202 --> 01:44:07,710
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:44:08,034 --> 01:44:08,478
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

01:44:08,898 --> 01:44:10,014
SPEAKER_1:  to his religion.

01:44:10,850 --> 01:44:14,366
SPEAKER_1:  It really is inspiring. Growing up, we had Hakeem El-Ajwan in the 1990s.

01:44:14,914 --> 01:44:16,734
SPEAKER_1:  basketball who was fasting in the NBA.

01:44:17,154 --> 01:44:20,254
SPEAKER_1:  I think Habib is that for a lot of people, there's a lot of young people today.

01:44:20,674 --> 01:44:24,094
SPEAKER_1:  and people in general. I think beyond that, the values.

01:44:25,058 --> 01:44:26,718
SPEAKER_1:  how he honored his father.

01:44:27,618 --> 01:44:28,830
SPEAKER_1:  and how he honors his mother.

01:44:29,442 --> 01:44:31,454
SPEAKER_1:  and how he continues to put family first.

01:44:32,130 --> 01:44:33,502
SPEAKER_1:  That's a beautiful part of a slump.

01:44:33,922 --> 01:44:35,998
SPEAKER_1:  That's a beautiful part of our value system.

01:44:36,802 --> 01:44:37,278
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:44:37,666 --> 01:44:39,646
SPEAKER_1:  We have a lot of emphasis on family.

01:44:40,162 --> 01:44:42,174
SPEAKER_1:  Family is central to Islam.

01:44:42,882 --> 01:44:44,990
SPEAKER_1:  and his honoring of his father was so beautiful.

01:44:45,314 --> 01:44:45,726
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:44:46,114 --> 01:44:48,190
SPEAKER_1:  And again, what he's willing to do for his mother.

01:44:48,866 --> 01:44:51,710
SPEAKER_1:  You know, it's just so beautiful. And I think that.

01:44:51,938 --> 01:44:53,950
SPEAKER_1:  We saw it frankly even with Morocco.

01:44:54,306 --> 01:44:55,326
SPEAKER_1:  in the World Cup.

01:44:56,610 --> 01:44:58,590
SPEAKER_1:  You know, there is a lot of Islamophobia.

01:44:59,266 --> 01:45:02,686
SPEAKER_1:  in this recent world cup episode, you know, a lot of.

01:45:03,234 --> 01:45:05,150
SPEAKER_1:  The criticism of Qatar.

01:45:05,410 --> 01:45:07,262
SPEAKER_1:  while no government is beyond reproach.

01:45:07,554 --> 01:45:09,598
SPEAKER_1:  Certainly no government is beyond reproach.

01:45:09,858 --> 01:45:14,526
SPEAKER_1:  had very obvious blatant Islamophobic undertones. And then with Morocco rising.

01:45:14,978 --> 01:45:16,510
SPEAKER_1:  being the first African Muslim.

01:45:17,122 --> 01:45:26,814
SPEAKER_1:  Arab team, you know, to get that far in the world cup. What did you see beyond the consistent honoring of Palestine? You also saw the honoring of the mothers every single.

01:45:27,298 --> 01:45:27,710
SPEAKER_1:  time.

01:45:27,970 --> 01:45:32,478
SPEAKER_1:  the game would end, they go into a prostration of gratitude. So just like we prostrate in prayer.

01:45:32,962 --> 01:45:34,206
SPEAKER_1:  prostration of gratitude.

01:45:34,882 --> 01:45:37,438
SPEAKER_1:  And then they go and they kiss their mother's foreheads.

01:45:37,666 --> 01:45:40,542
SPEAKER_1:  dance with their mothers on the field, hug their moms, and honor their moms.

01:45:40,962 --> 01:45:41,918
SPEAKER_1:  That's Islam for you.

01:45:42,594 --> 01:45:43,134
SPEAKER_1:  Habib.

01:45:43,522 --> 01:45:46,110
SPEAKER_1:  After his fight, what does he do? He prostrates.

01:45:46,722 --> 01:45:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  points up to the heavens. It's God and then he prostrates.

01:45:51,106 --> 01:45:52,190
SPEAKER_1:  The whole Moroccan team.

01:45:52,674 --> 01:45:55,678
SPEAKER_1:  beautifully prostrates, even when they lost.

01:45:56,258 --> 01:45:58,846
SPEAKER_1:  They prostrated out of gratitude. They honored their mothers.

01:45:59,554 --> 01:46:02,462
SPEAKER_1:  So I think sometimes athletes are able to demonstrate.

01:46:02,882 --> 01:46:07,550
SPEAKER_1:  some of these beautiful values of Islam in a way that the world can maybe see them in a different light.

01:46:08,226 --> 01:46:09,694
SPEAKER_0:  values of humility.

01:46:09,922 --> 01:46:11,518
SPEAKER_0:  and the values of love.

01:46:12,194 --> 01:46:14,302
SPEAKER_0:  Love broadly, but love for family.

01:46:14,498 --> 01:46:16,734
SPEAKER_1:  And look how everyone around Habib talks about it.

01:46:17,602 --> 01:46:17,918
SPEAKER_1:  Right?

01:46:18,338 --> 01:46:20,158
SPEAKER_1:  No one ever, no one ever.

01:46:20,450 --> 01:46:23,262
SPEAKER_1:  says he's a jerk, no one ever says he's mistreated them.

01:46:23,778 --> 01:46:27,742
SPEAKER_1:  They've all got stories, right? That's what a beautiful Muslim does.

01:46:28,162 --> 01:46:29,310
SPEAKER_1:  beautiful human being.

01:46:29,922 --> 01:46:30,270
SPEAKER_1:  You.

01:46:30,978 --> 01:46:33,854
SPEAKER_1:  treat the people in such a way that all these stories come out later.

01:46:34,434 --> 01:46:34,814
SPEAKER_1:  of

01:46:35,234 --> 01:46:37,918
SPEAKER_1:  how good you were to everyone that came into contact with you.

01:46:38,146 --> 01:46:39,582
SPEAKER_1:  And Habib was that person.

01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:42,206
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, he is that person. He does a great job of.

01:46:42,562 --> 01:46:43,966
SPEAKER_1:  treating people with a lot of respect.

01:46:44,706 --> 01:46:45,950
SPEAKER_1:  Obviously no one is.

01:46:46,466 --> 01:46:49,790
SPEAKER_1:  Perfect, right? I mean, imperfections are for everybody, but...

01:46:51,010 --> 01:46:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  I definitely think that.

01:46:52,802 --> 01:46:54,462
SPEAKER_1:  He did a beautiful job representing.

01:46:55,266 --> 01:46:56,734
SPEAKER_1:  his faith in those moments.

01:46:57,250 --> 01:46:57,630
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:46:58,274 --> 01:47:03,198
SPEAKER_1:  you know, beyond punching people in the face. That's kind of a different subject. Smashing faces.

01:47:03,554 --> 01:47:05,566
SPEAKER_1:  Not the smashing faces part.

01:47:05,794 --> 01:47:09,310
SPEAKER_1:  the prostration part and the humility.

01:47:09,634 --> 01:47:14,718
SPEAKER_1:  I tell you, man, he's not humble in the ring, right? He's a, he, he, he would maul his opponents, right? But, uh,

01:47:14,978 --> 01:47:16,103
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, as as

01:47:16,103 --> 01:47:25,246
SPEAKER_0:  The practitioner is a fan of the sport, of all grappling sports for me. There's also a beauty to the art of grappling and the fighting sports, but yes.

01:47:25,794 --> 01:47:26,526
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:47:27,074 --> 01:47:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  I think his, again, humility, his honor outside.

01:47:31,906 --> 01:47:34,654
SPEAKER_0:  the cage is exemplary.

01:47:34,946 --> 01:47:35,710
SPEAKER_0:  The money.

01:47:36,002 --> 01:47:36,766
SPEAKER_0:  The Fame.

01:47:37,186 --> 01:47:38,782
SPEAKER_0:  The power hasn't changed a bit.

01:47:38,946 --> 01:47:42,750
SPEAKER_1:  No, not at all. And that's, that's actually, I think the most beautiful part when I met him.

01:47:43,490 --> 01:47:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  I found him to be.

01:47:45,698 --> 01:47:46,622
SPEAKER_1:  as humble.

01:47:47,010 --> 01:47:48,926
SPEAKER_1:  as he is on screen.

01:47:49,410 --> 01:47:54,590
SPEAKER_1:  And that's always very endearing and all of the stories of the people that have been around him for a much longer time.

01:47:55,106 --> 01:47:55,934
SPEAKER_1:  Very humble man.

01:47:56,386 --> 01:47:59,134
SPEAKER_1:  I pray for him, honestly, I pray for Islam, I pray for...

01:47:59,650 --> 01:48:00,670
SPEAKER_1:  that family.

01:48:01,794 --> 01:48:04,990
SPEAKER_1:  that God keeps them grounded and protected and together.

01:48:05,474 --> 01:48:07,838
SPEAKER_1:  and that they maintain that beautiful spirit.

01:48:08,194 --> 01:48:11,358
SPEAKER_1:  Cause even if you, if you just watch the lead up to the last, uh,

01:48:12,162 --> 01:48:15,230
SPEAKER_1:  the last fight with Islam, just the way they carry themselves their day to day.

01:48:15,938 --> 01:48:17,630
SPEAKER_1:  They never relinquish their prayers.

01:48:18,306 --> 01:48:20,318
SPEAKER_1:  They never relinquish their family.

01:48:20,578 --> 01:48:22,270
SPEAKER_1:  ties the things that

01:48:22,562 --> 01:48:26,142
SPEAKER_1:  make them who they are to be better fighters because they don't see

01:48:26,850 --> 01:48:27,422
SPEAKER_1:  That's...

01:48:27,906 --> 01:48:32,574
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, they have to let go of those things. In fact, they attribute all of their worldly success.

01:48:33,218 --> 01:48:34,110
SPEAKER_1:  uh... to them

01:48:34,338 --> 01:48:35,326
SPEAKER_1:  that faith and so on.

01:48:35,618 --> 01:48:37,438
SPEAKER_1:  Beautiful examples and I think that.

01:48:37,986 --> 01:48:38,366
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

01:48:38,786 --> 01:48:41,054
SPEAKER_1:  It's good for young Muslims to see.

01:48:41,378 --> 01:48:44,254
SPEAKER_1:  themselves in that and it's good for other people to see Islam.

01:48:44,866 --> 01:48:45,854
SPEAKER_1:  I threw that as well.

01:48:46,690 --> 01:48:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  when you mention the prophets.

01:48:48,770 --> 01:48:52,446
SPEAKER_0:  You often say, peace and blessings be upon them. Yes.

01:48:53,826 --> 01:48:55,486
SPEAKER_0:  What is that phrase?

01:48:55,842 --> 01:48:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  Mean.

01:48:56,962 --> 01:49:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  is why do you say it, is it to celebrate the people, is it a constant reminder that these are figures that should be celebrated?

01:49:05,570 --> 01:49:12,190
SPEAKER_1:  Absolutely. So it's part of our tradition that when we say the name of a prophet, at least the first time in the conversation, we say, peace be upon him.

01:49:13,186 --> 01:49:13,758
SPEAKER_1:  And then...

01:49:14,082 --> 01:49:17,086
SPEAKER_1:  afterwards, it's still praiseworthy to say Peace be upon him.

01:49:17,858 --> 01:49:21,278
SPEAKER_1:  So if you're reading an Islamic article and you see in parentheses.

01:49:21,666 --> 01:49:22,686
SPEAKER_1:  TBUH.

01:49:23,330 --> 01:49:25,182
SPEAKER_1:  Peace be unto Him or peace be upon Him.

01:49:26,114 --> 01:49:31,582
SPEAKER_1:  When I was in high school, I often tell the story I wrote an article about Jesus, peace be upon him, in Islam and Christianity.

01:49:32,450 --> 01:49:33,246
SPEAKER_1:  and my uh...

01:49:33,666 --> 01:49:38,558
SPEAKER_1:  teacher comes up to me and she says, you can't do that. I said, what? She like slams the paper on, on the desk.

01:49:39,586 --> 01:49:41,054
SPEAKER_1:  She says, you can't say Jesus.

01:49:42,050 --> 01:49:46,654
SPEAKER_1:  I said, no, no, PBUH, peace be upon him.

01:49:46,914 --> 01:49:47,454
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:49:47,714 --> 01:49:50,846
SPEAKER_1:  That's what it means and something that we reserve for the prophets.

01:49:51,266 --> 01:49:53,502
SPEAKER_1:  of God and we honor them with.

01:49:54,626 --> 01:49:56,062
SPEAKER_1:  So who is Muhammad?

01:49:57,666 --> 01:49:59,294
SPEAKER_1:  So the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him.

01:49:59,778 --> 01:50:03,006
SPEAKER_1:  is the descendant of Abraham, peace be upon him, through Ishmael.

01:50:03,906 --> 01:50:05,150
SPEAKER_1:  God promises.

01:50:05,858 --> 01:50:07,262
SPEAKER_1:  Hagar and Ishmael.

01:50:07,650 --> 01:50:09,950
SPEAKER_1:  that he will make of him a great nation.

01:50:10,850 --> 01:50:11,614
SPEAKER_1:  And so...

01:50:11,874 --> 01:50:14,046
SPEAKER_1:  There are prophets that are descended from Isaac.

01:50:14,946 --> 01:50:15,486
SPEAKER_1:  And then...

01:50:16,034 --> 01:50:17,502
SPEAKER_1:  from the Brothers of Isaac.

01:50:18,050 --> 01:50:19,518
SPEAKER_1:  comes the prophet Muhammad.

01:50:20,610 --> 01:50:26,878
SPEAKER_1:  And he is the final prophet of a long line of prophets. And we do not distinguish between the prophets in regards to.

01:50:27,650 --> 01:50:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  their role.

01:50:28,546 --> 01:50:29,790
SPEAKER_1:  And so Islam has a very...

01:50:30,018 --> 01:50:33,374
SPEAKER_1:  accessible theology. It's something that resonates with.

01:50:34,498 --> 01:50:35,326
SPEAKER_1:  A professor.

01:50:35,618 --> 01:50:37,342
SPEAKER_1:  and an Ivy League university and.

01:50:37,762 --> 01:50:39,358
SPEAKER_1:  you know, a person who

01:50:39,938 --> 01:50:45,630
SPEAKER_1:  maybe even illiterate, this idea of one God that sent many prophets and all of the prophets out a singular message.

01:50:45,954 --> 01:50:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  Worship one God.

01:50:47,522 --> 01:50:51,326
SPEAKER_1:  and respond to the messages of that one God through his messengers.

01:50:52,034 --> 01:50:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:50:53,122 --> 01:50:53,630
SPEAKER_1:  Adam.

01:50:54,626 --> 01:50:55,934
SPEAKER_1:  through Muhammad you have.

01:50:56,354 --> 01:50:58,558
SPEAKER_1:  many of the prophets that are mentioned in the Old Testament.

01:50:59,330 --> 01:51:03,870
SPEAKER_1:  Moses, peace be upon him, being the most spoken about prophet in the Quran, in fact Abraham.

01:51:04,642 --> 01:51:04,990
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:51:05,666 --> 01:51:09,598
SPEAKER_1:  Jesus, peace be upon him, many of these prophets that aren't familiar.

01:51:10,306 --> 01:51:13,470
SPEAKER_1:  to people all of them are considered prophets in Islam the prophet Muhammad.

01:51:14,018 --> 01:51:15,838
SPEAKER_1:  Peace be upon him being the last of them.

01:51:16,738 --> 01:51:18,622
SPEAKER_1:  He comes at a time where

01:51:19,202 --> 01:51:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  there was still a lot.

01:51:21,282 --> 01:51:22,206
SPEAKER_1:  of confusion.

01:51:23,010 --> 01:51:28,190
SPEAKER_1:  about what the world had just encountered in Christ, in Jesus Christ, peace be upon them.

01:51:28,642 --> 01:51:30,718
SPEAKER_1:  You gotta think about it this way, that this is still.

01:51:31,298 --> 01:51:33,438
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, you know, he's born in the sixth century.

01:51:34,402 --> 01:51:34,782
SPEAKER_1:  There.

01:51:35,650 --> 01:51:37,086
SPEAKER_1:  is still great debate.

01:51:37,730 --> 01:51:39,390
SPEAKER_1:  about who Jesus was.

01:51:39,810 --> 01:51:42,078
SPEAKER_1:  The Council of Nicaea happens in the 4th century.

01:51:42,690 --> 01:51:46,110
SPEAKER_1:  where you kind of have a standardizing of Western Christianity.

01:51:46,626 --> 01:51:47,742
SPEAKER_1:  but then you have Eastern.

01:51:48,002 --> 01:51:52,670
SPEAKER_1:  Christians that are still maintaining very different theologies and very different conceptions of Christ.

01:51:53,826 --> 01:51:55,550
SPEAKER_1:  There is no Arabic Bible at the time.

01:51:56,226 --> 01:51:56,670
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:51:57,282 --> 01:51:57,886
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:51:58,498 --> 01:52:00,190
SPEAKER_1:  he kind of brings together.

01:52:01,250 --> 01:52:01,822
SPEAKER_1:  The

01:52:02,178 --> 01:52:06,782
SPEAKER_1:  message and the mission of all of those prophets and it fits perfectly.

01:52:07,138 --> 01:52:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  into

01:52:08,322 --> 01:52:09,214
SPEAKER_1:  A singular.

01:52:09,570 --> 01:52:10,398
SPEAKER_1:  string of thought.

01:52:11,234 --> 01:52:11,742
SPEAKER_1:  where

01:52:12,290 --> 01:52:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  You don't have to reject Jesus, peace be upon him, but Islam also is staunchly opposed to the idea of a trinity, the idea of a begotten son of God.

01:52:20,034 --> 01:52:23,678
SPEAKER_1:  that all the conceptions of the Messiah, and there were many claimants of the Messiah.

01:52:24,290 --> 01:52:26,462
SPEAKER_1:  prior to Christ, peace be upon Him.

01:52:27,202 --> 01:52:27,646
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

01:52:27,906 --> 01:52:29,214
SPEAKER_1:  None of them included.

01:52:29,602 --> 01:52:30,622
SPEAKER_1:  an idea of...

01:52:30,914 --> 01:52:33,086
SPEAKER_1:  Trinity or of Him actually being a part of.

01:52:33,346 --> 01:52:37,054
SPEAKER_1:  God himself, a begotten son of God, but rather a great and mighty prophet.

01:52:37,634 --> 01:52:38,974
SPEAKER_1:  that would

01:52:39,266 --> 01:52:40,254
SPEAKER_1:  Restore Glory.

01:52:40,770 --> 01:52:42,014
SPEAKER_1:  on Earth, so he...

01:52:42,786 --> 01:52:45,598
SPEAKER_1:  he really captures theologically.

01:52:46,210 --> 01:52:47,038
SPEAKER_1:  or rather.

01:52:47,458 --> 01:52:50,174
SPEAKER_1:  we would say God captures through him theologically.

01:52:50,818 --> 01:52:54,142
SPEAKER_1:  a coherence and a unifying message of all of the prophets.

01:52:54,818 --> 01:52:56,254
SPEAKER_1:  that there's only one God.

01:52:56,674 --> 01:52:58,206
SPEAKER_1:  and that that God has sent.

01:52:59,138 --> 01:52:59,934
SPEAKER_1:  messages.

01:53:00,162 --> 01:53:01,246
SPEAKER_1:  and scriptures.

01:53:01,922 --> 01:53:03,998
SPEAKER_1:  to ultimately guide people back towards him.

01:53:04,610 --> 01:53:06,430
SPEAKER_1:  and that all of the profits are equal.

01:53:06,818 --> 01:53:09,374
SPEAKER_1:  and the sight of God. There is no distinction between them.

01:53:10,146 --> 01:53:10,878
SPEAKER_1:  And that's...

01:53:11,298 --> 01:53:11,998
SPEAKER_1:  We are.

01:53:12,514 --> 01:53:16,190
SPEAKER_1:  to live our lives in accordance with the message.

01:53:16,674 --> 01:53:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  as best manifested by the messenger.

01:53:19,618 --> 01:53:23,998
SPEAKER_1:  And so the prophets are exemplary human beings. And this is where we kind of sometimes maybe have.

01:53:25,026 --> 01:53:26,910
SPEAKER_1:  uh... a difference in a somewhat say well

01:53:27,842 --> 01:53:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  You know, Noah did this and David did this. As Muslims, we don't believe.

01:53:32,706 --> 01:53:36,766
SPEAKER_1:  We don't hold many of the stories that have been attributed to these prophets.

01:53:37,154 --> 01:53:37,726
SPEAKER_1:  to be true.

01:53:38,242 --> 01:53:38,654
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:53:38,946 --> 01:53:43,198
SPEAKER_1:  We don't believe that the prophets are capable of major sins. We believe they're exemplary human beings.

01:53:44,002 --> 01:53:45,246
SPEAKER_1:  and that they kind of give us.

01:53:46,146 --> 01:53:48,478
SPEAKER_1:  manifestation of the scriptures that they were sent with.

01:53:49,026 --> 01:53:52,670
SPEAKER_1:  of how to live noble lives and the most documented human being in history.

01:53:52,930 --> 01:53:53,694
SPEAKER_1:  Um, is the

01:53:53,954 --> 01:53:57,150
SPEAKER_1:  Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him. We know everything about him, his family life.

01:53:58,050 --> 01:54:02,302
SPEAKER_1:  his day to day, the way he would greet you, the way he'd look at you, everything about his physical appearance.

01:54:02,946 --> 01:54:06,622
SPEAKER_1:  It's documented in immaculate detail and Muslims have a standard.

01:54:07,426 --> 01:54:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  that they then seek to live up to.

01:54:09,986 --> 01:54:11,038
SPEAKER_1:  uh... with

01:54:11,362 --> 01:54:16,702
SPEAKER_1:  how to treat your family, how to be in your community, how to be in your worship, how to be in your social interactions.

01:54:17,250 --> 01:54:20,766
SPEAKER_1:  how to carry yourself with your neighbors. it's a full complete.

01:54:21,538 --> 01:54:22,622
SPEAKER_1:  guidebook.

01:54:23,074 --> 01:54:24,350
SPEAKER_1:  through his example.

01:54:25,090 --> 01:54:26,174
SPEAKER_1:  where

01:54:26,434 --> 01:54:29,278
SPEAKER_1:  We have the Quran, which is the word of God. And then you have...

01:54:29,762 --> 01:54:32,478
SPEAKER_1:  biography of the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him, which is

01:54:33,410 --> 01:54:35,166
SPEAKER_1:  a living manifestation.

01:54:35,746 --> 01:54:36,798
SPEAKER_1:  of that word.

01:54:37,250 --> 01:54:39,390
SPEAKER_1:  that has been documented for us to live by.

01:54:39,938 --> 01:54:40,798
SPEAKER_1:  until the end of time.

01:54:41,858 --> 01:54:42,238
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:54:42,370 --> 01:54:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  Muhammad.

01:54:44,002 --> 01:54:45,438
SPEAKER_0:  If I may peace be upon him.

01:54:46,018 --> 01:54:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  uh

01:54:47,810 --> 01:54:50,110
SPEAKER_0:  is really the...

01:54:50,338 --> 01:54:54,046
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, like you said, the manifestation is the thing to be, the example of a good man.

01:54:54,370 --> 01:54:54,846
SPEAKER_1:  Yes.

01:54:55,202 --> 01:54:56,446
SPEAKER_1:  Example of a good human being.

01:54:58,082 --> 01:54:59,774
SPEAKER_1:  Is the Quran the word of God?

01:55:00,930 --> 01:55:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  So the Quran, and this is what distinguishes the Quran in many ways.

01:55:04,802 --> 01:55:07,710
SPEAKER_1:  uh... from other scriptures as Muslims we do believe

01:55:08,386 --> 01:55:08,734
SPEAKER_1:  That.

01:55:09,122 --> 01:55:11,518
SPEAKER_1:  God has sent divine revelation prior.

01:55:11,906 --> 01:55:13,374
SPEAKER_1:  We believe that the original

01:55:13,602 --> 01:55:14,334
SPEAKER_1:  scriptures.

01:55:15,138 --> 01:55:17,822
SPEAKER_1:  prior to the multiple versions and...

01:55:18,466 --> 01:55:23,294
SPEAKER_1:  the changes and revisions throughout history, the original scriptures that were given to the prophets.

01:55:23,906 --> 01:55:24,926
SPEAKER_1:  whether it was the Telerot.

01:55:25,442 --> 01:55:25,918
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

01:55:26,178 --> 01:55:27,358
SPEAKER_1:  to Moses.

01:55:27,874 --> 01:55:28,862
SPEAKER_1:  or the Gospels.

01:55:29,538 --> 01:55:32,414
SPEAKER_1:  were all original divine revelations.

01:55:33,058 --> 01:55:38,046
SPEAKER_1:  but they have been changed over time. The Quran is the word of God with a promise that He will guard it.

01:55:38,274 --> 01:55:38,942
SPEAKER_1:  for all of time.

01:55:39,458 --> 01:55:42,590
SPEAKER_1:  and it's probably one of the greatest miracles because in 1400 years.

01:55:43,234 --> 01:55:43,870
SPEAKER_1:  We have.

01:55:44,418 --> 01:55:48,638
SPEAKER_1:  the Quran preserved through oral transmission and through written transmission.

01:55:49,506 --> 01:55:52,094
SPEAKER_1:  and there are almost 2 billion Muslims in the world.

01:55:52,482 --> 01:55:56,222
SPEAKER_1:  And they all recite this book the exact same way. And there's only one version of it.

01:55:56,610 --> 01:55:57,182
SPEAKER_1:  And so...

01:55:57,666 --> 01:55:59,070
SPEAKER_1:  when I'm reciting the Quran.

01:55:59,682 --> 01:56:01,918
SPEAKER_1:  If I say, ooh, or ee, or ah.

01:56:02,402 --> 01:56:03,038
SPEAKER_1:  differently.

01:56:03,746 --> 01:56:05,086
SPEAKER_1:  and Ethiopian Muslim.

01:56:05,314 --> 01:56:06,430
SPEAKER_1:  a Chinese Muslim.

01:56:06,946 --> 01:56:15,326
SPEAKER_1:  A Yemeni Muslim can correct me, an eight year old kid in any one of those countries can correct me because they will know that this is not how it's memorized. So it was memorized.

01:56:15,874 --> 01:56:17,374
SPEAKER_1:  from the start committed to.

01:56:17,602 --> 01:56:18,174
SPEAKER_1:  Memory

01:56:18,658 --> 01:56:20,702
SPEAKER_1:  in the time of the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him.

01:56:21,410 --> 01:56:22,014
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:56:22,562 --> 01:56:23,966
SPEAKER_1:  preserved in writing.

01:56:24,418 --> 01:56:25,342
SPEAKER_1:  and pass down.

01:56:25,570 --> 01:56:28,958
SPEAKER_1:  and memorized by millions and millions of people around the world.

01:56:29,218 --> 01:56:31,166
SPEAKER_1:  and it's 600 pages.

01:56:32,450 --> 01:56:34,846
SPEAKER_1:  And you can't go to a city in America.

01:56:35,682 --> 01:56:37,342
SPEAKER_1:  a city in the United States of America.

01:56:38,114 --> 01:56:41,758
SPEAKER_1:  and not find at least one person or group of people that memorize it.

01:56:42,306 --> 01:56:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  that have committed it to memory. And so there's an emphasis on

01:56:45,538 --> 01:56:46,430
SPEAKER_1:  committing it to memory.

01:56:47,010 --> 01:56:49,374
SPEAKER_1:  as well as understanding it and applying it.

01:56:49,794 --> 01:56:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  and practicing it as much as we can.

01:56:53,986 --> 01:56:55,102
SPEAKER_1:  What are some...

01:56:56,962 --> 01:56:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe...

01:56:58,466 --> 01:56:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  deep.

01:56:59,042 --> 01:57:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  or insightful differences.

01:57:01,954 --> 01:57:04,254
SPEAKER_0:  between the Quran, the Torah, and the Bible.

01:57:05,730 --> 01:57:09,630
SPEAKER_1:  Well, like I said, so you've got the original revelations of those scriptures.

01:57:09,922 --> 01:57:13,822
SPEAKER_1:  but there are so many versions of those scriptures and there are times throughout history where

01:57:14,434 --> 01:57:17,950
SPEAKER_1:  there have been changes just from an objective perspective.

01:57:19,330 --> 01:57:21,662
SPEAKER_1:  What is the original scripture that was given to?

01:57:22,274 --> 01:57:22,686
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

01:57:22,946 --> 01:57:24,254
SPEAKER_1:  Moses, peace be upon him.

01:57:24,738 --> 01:57:25,246
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:57:25,474 --> 01:57:28,958
SPEAKER_1:  what was initially communicated to Jesus, peace be upon Him, those things.

01:57:29,666 --> 01:57:30,110
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:57:30,562 --> 01:57:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  have changed over time.

01:57:32,962 --> 01:57:33,566
SPEAKER_1:  However...

01:57:34,210 --> 01:57:35,678
SPEAKER_1:  there's still some truth.

01:57:36,098 --> 01:57:38,526
SPEAKER_1:  that remains even in those scriptures. And so it stops there.

01:57:39,042 --> 01:57:41,726
SPEAKER_1:  There are still things that line up, especially with.

01:57:41,986 --> 01:57:42,942
SPEAKER_1:  the Old Testament.

01:57:43,458 --> 01:57:44,766
SPEAKER_1:  and Islam.

01:57:45,058 --> 01:57:47,934
SPEAKER_1:  there are still many things that line up between the two.

01:57:48,802 --> 01:57:51,518
SPEAKER_1:  the Bible as well, the New Testament. Now,

01:57:51,938 --> 01:57:53,214
SPEAKER_1:  Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.

01:57:53,922 --> 01:57:55,710
SPEAKER_1:  It's different because these are not.

01:57:56,130 --> 01:57:56,638
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:57:57,122 --> 01:58:00,350
SPEAKER_1:  original scriptures. These are testimonies that were obviously collected.

01:58:00,994 --> 01:58:01,758
SPEAKER_1:  around.

01:58:02,050 --> 01:58:06,526
SPEAKER_1:  the entire phenomenon of the coming of Christ, but the authors themselves, the biographies.

01:58:07,202 --> 01:58:11,038
SPEAKER_1:  the documentation even of those original testimonies and gospels, what made.

01:58:11,618 --> 01:58:17,310
SPEAKER_1:  the cut in terms of being included within the Gospels and what didn't, because there were many Gospels at the time in that sense.

01:58:17,794 --> 01:58:22,046
SPEAKER_1:  is different from what we believe was Scripture communicated to Jesus, peace be upon Him.

01:58:22,946 --> 01:58:24,286
SPEAKER_1:  the Quran

01:58:24,738 --> 01:58:25,630
SPEAKER_1:  is different.

01:58:25,954 --> 01:58:27,166
SPEAKER_1:  in several ways.

01:58:28,258 --> 01:58:29,374
SPEAKER_1:  it confirms.

01:58:29,954 --> 01:58:31,390
SPEAKER_1:  what came before it.

01:58:31,842 --> 01:58:34,846
SPEAKER_1:  but it's the document and preserved Word of God to be recited throughout.

01:58:35,202 --> 01:58:35,774
SPEAKER_1:  throughout time.

01:58:36,322 --> 01:58:38,366
SPEAKER_1:  So it confirms much of what came before it.

01:58:39,106 --> 01:58:42,846
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, and it resides amongst us and within us.

01:58:43,298 --> 01:58:43,806
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhh

01:58:44,034 --> 01:58:45,406
SPEAKER_1:  for the rest of time.

01:58:45,666 --> 01:58:46,366
SPEAKER_1:  and threw it.

01:58:47,074 --> 01:58:47,678
SPEAKER_1:  We honor.

01:58:47,938 --> 01:58:49,406
SPEAKER_1:  those revelations.

01:58:49,666 --> 01:58:50,590
SPEAKER_1:  that came through.

01:58:51,138 --> 01:58:52,222
SPEAKER_1:  the prophets of old.

01:58:52,898 --> 01:58:53,534
SPEAKER_1:  because

01:58:54,178 --> 01:59:00,222
SPEAKER_1:  The essence, the core of what came through those revelations is preserved in the Quran and with us. I tell people this.

01:59:00,770 --> 01:59:01,694
SPEAKER_1:  all the time that.

01:59:02,370 --> 01:59:04,990
SPEAKER_1:  The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, introduced

01:59:05,762 --> 01:59:06,238
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:59:06,626 --> 01:59:07,870
SPEAKER_1:  Jesus peace be upon him.

01:59:08,642 --> 01:59:09,118
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:59:09,506 --> 01:59:11,774
SPEAKER_1:  even Moses, peace be upon him, to much of.

01:59:12,418 --> 01:59:13,118
SPEAKER_1:  the world.

01:59:14,146 --> 01:59:22,974
SPEAKER_1:  There are Muslims around the world that are named Isa, that are named Jesus. There are Muslims around the world that are named Ibrahim, Abraham. Muslims around the world named Musa.

01:59:23,778 --> 01:59:25,630
SPEAKER_1:  and they learned of these figures through

01:59:26,178 --> 01:59:27,038
SPEAKER_1:  The Revelation.

01:59:27,266 --> 01:59:30,206
SPEAKER_1:  that came to the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him. nuu料dimensional

01:59:30,978 --> 01:59:34,718
SPEAKER_1:  Maryam, one of the most popular names in Islam, Mary.

01:59:35,426 --> 01:59:38,302
SPEAKER_1:  peace be upon her. Whole chapter in the Qur'an named after

01:59:39,138 --> 01:59:45,694
SPEAKER_1:  Mariam, which is actually what I was reciting in the prayer was the chapter of Mariam, the chapter of the story of Mary, peace be upon her.

01:59:46,306 --> 01:59:49,374
SPEAKER_1:  So the Quran contains the stories it contains.

01:59:49,826 --> 01:59:50,206
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:59:51,906 --> 01:59:57,758
SPEAKER_1:  legislation and law, but primarily it was revealed over 23 years. So it actually was coming in accordance with

01:59:58,018 --> 02:00:00,958
SPEAKER_1:  some of the events that were unfolding in the life of the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him.

02:00:02,114 --> 02:00:02,846
SPEAKER_1:  The first...

02:00:03,330 --> 02:00:06,366
SPEAKER_1:  Thirteen years of that was primarily belief in God.

02:00:06,818 --> 02:00:08,158
SPEAKER_1:  belief in the hereafter.

02:00:08,706 --> 02:00:11,294
SPEAKER_1:  and things that surrounded the core creed of Islam.

02:00:11,650 --> 02:00:12,158
SPEAKER_1:  And then.

02:00:12,546 --> 02:00:13,438
SPEAKER_1:  Legislation.

02:00:13,666 --> 02:00:15,422
SPEAKER_1:  law, stories of the prophets.

02:00:15,874 --> 02:00:16,222
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

02:00:16,642 --> 02:00:19,102
SPEAKER_1:  came down in accordance with the unfolding events.

02:00:19,618 --> 02:00:22,014
SPEAKER_1:  as well as prophesying some of the things that were to come.

02:00:22,786 --> 02:00:32,030
SPEAKER_1:  and speaking about some of the things that had just happened. And it is completed in the lifetime of the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon it, memorized and then communicated to generation after generation after generation.

02:00:32,258 --> 02:00:33,246
SPEAKER_1:  so that we have it in its.

02:00:33,826 --> 02:00:34,951
SPEAKER_1:  pristine fashion. no.

02:00:34,951 --> 02:00:35,966
SPEAKER_0:  billions of people.

02:00:36,354 --> 02:00:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

02:00:37,442 --> 02:00:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  All across the world, all the different cultures, all...

02:00:41,570 --> 02:00:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  memorizing the same words.

02:00:44,866 --> 02:00:51,006
SPEAKER_0:  One of the pillars, or maybe I should say one of the central practices, is the month of Ramadan.

02:00:51,362 --> 02:00:53,822
SPEAKER_0:  What is the importance of this month?

02:00:54,082 --> 02:00:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:00:55,074 --> 02:00:57,699
SPEAKER_0:  What does the process of it entail?

02:00:57,699 --> 02:00:58,078
SPEAKER_1:  also.

02:00:58,722 --> 02:01:09,406
SPEAKER_1:  So Islam has, I think it'd be good to maybe lay this out for people, the articles of faith in the pillars of Islam. So the articles of faith, there are six articles of faith and this kind of lays the foundation for my noodleinpsь.

02:01:09,858 --> 02:01:11,838
SPEAKER_1:  the creed of Islam. So belief in God.

02:01:12,418 --> 02:01:13,438
SPEAKER_1:  belief in the angels.

02:01:13,826 --> 02:01:17,630
SPEAKER_1:  belief in the messages, belief in the messengers.

02:01:18,914 --> 02:01:21,182
SPEAKER_1:  belief in the Day of Judgment and belief in divine decree.

02:01:22,082 --> 02:01:23,326
SPEAKER_1:  So these are the six.

02:01:23,682 --> 02:01:24,702
SPEAKER_1:  Articles of Faith.

02:01:25,442 --> 02:01:27,934
SPEAKER_1:  Belief in God, belief in the angels, belief in.

02:01:28,226 --> 02:01:32,254
SPEAKER_1:  The messages being the scriptures, belief in the messengers being the prophets.

02:01:32,770 --> 02:01:35,294
SPEAKER_1:  belief in the day of judgment and belief in divine decree.

02:01:37,218 --> 02:01:41,118
SPEAKER_1:  That's what you have to believe to be a Muslim. You have to believe in those six things, right?

02:01:41,570 --> 02:01:42,974
SPEAKER_1:  and then you go to.

02:01:43,682 --> 02:01:46,142
SPEAKER_1:  The pillars of faith, the five pillars of faith.

02:01:47,042 --> 02:01:47,486
SPEAKER_1:  are.

02:01:48,002 --> 02:01:50,398
SPEAKER_1:  sort of, or they make up the structure.

02:01:50,914 --> 02:01:52,350
SPEAKER_1:  of those articles of faith.

02:01:52,738 --> 02:01:54,142
SPEAKER_1:  practice of the Muslim. So what are you learning?

02:01:54,946 --> 02:01:55,838
SPEAKER_1:  to be a Muslim.

02:01:56,226 --> 02:01:57,342
SPEAKER_1:  You testify.

02:01:58,146 --> 02:01:59,518
SPEAKER_1:  that there's only one God.

02:02:00,002 --> 02:02:00,862
SPEAKER_1:  worthy of worship.

02:02:01,378 --> 02:02:05,342
SPEAKER_1:  and unconditional obedience, and then you testify that Muhammad is the final messenger of God.

02:02:06,274 --> 02:02:09,374
SPEAKER_1:  That's the first pillar, the actual testimony entering into Islam.

02:02:09,858 --> 02:02:11,262
SPEAKER_1:  Then it's the five daily prayers.

02:02:11,842 --> 02:02:15,518
SPEAKER_1:  practicing the five daily prayers at least as a bare minimum obligation.

02:02:16,130 --> 02:02:16,638
SPEAKER_1:  The

02:02:16,866 --> 02:02:18,206
SPEAKER_1:  mandatory charity,

02:02:18,658 --> 02:02:22,654
SPEAKER_1:  which is called the zakat, that Muslims have to give at least 2.5%.

02:02:23,266 --> 02:02:24,574
SPEAKER_1:  of their retained earnings.

02:02:25,058 --> 02:02:27,518
SPEAKER_1:  uh... to specific categories of charity

02:02:28,066 --> 02:02:30,878
SPEAKER_1:  then it is the fasting of the month of Ramadan.

02:02:31,842 --> 02:02:33,630
SPEAKER_1:  the mandatory fasting of the month of Ramadan.

02:02:34,274 --> 02:02:39,838
SPEAKER_1:  And then it's the Hajj, if you can do so, the pilgrimage, if you can do so once in your lifetime. So those are the five pillars of Islam.

02:02:40,610 --> 02:02:41,790
SPEAKER_1:  So, Ramadan.

02:02:42,722 --> 02:02:47,262
SPEAKER_1:  is a month in which Muslims engage in this incredible spiritual bootcamp.

02:02:48,066 --> 02:02:48,510
SPEAKER_1:  Now...

02:02:48,738 --> 02:02:50,782
SPEAKER_1:  Fasting can mean different things to different people.

02:02:51,426 --> 02:02:51,902
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

02:02:52,290 --> 02:02:53,342
SPEAKER_1:  when we fast.

02:02:53,666 --> 02:02:57,054
SPEAKER_1:  We fast from before sunrise to sunset for an entire month.

02:02:57,538 --> 02:02:59,806
SPEAKER_1:  and there's no food or water.

02:03:00,130 --> 02:03:00,734
SPEAKER_1:  Period.

02:03:01,538 --> 02:03:03,326
SPEAKER_1:  and no intimacy as well. So…

02:03:03,554 --> 02:03:05,598
SPEAKER_1:  you would abstain from intimacy with your spouse as well.

02:03:06,082 --> 02:03:06,622
SPEAKER_1:  in that time.

02:03:07,266 --> 02:03:09,598
SPEAKER_1:  No food or water, no bread, no nothing.

02:03:09,858 --> 02:03:12,446
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, you don't eat or drink, even if you live in Texas.

02:03:13,090 --> 02:03:15,934
SPEAKER_1:  where you get these long hot days in the summer.

02:03:16,226 --> 02:03:18,974
SPEAKER_1:  And of course Islam is on a lunar calendar, so it moves every.

02:03:19,234 --> 02:03:21,630
SPEAKER_1:  every year, about 10 days earlier.

02:03:23,042 --> 02:03:23,966
SPEAKER_1:  during that time.

02:03:24,450 --> 02:03:25,438
SPEAKER_1:  You restrict.

02:03:25,666 --> 02:03:26,782
SPEAKER_1:  the intake.

02:03:27,842 --> 02:03:28,542
SPEAKER_1:  to the body.

02:03:28,962 --> 02:03:31,102
SPEAKER_1:  so that you can focus on the intake of the soul.

02:03:32,258 --> 02:03:35,806
SPEAKER_1:  So instead of being focused on consumption, constant consumption,

02:03:36,546 --> 02:03:39,518
SPEAKER_1:  You are consuming words of remembrance, words of prayer.

02:03:39,810 --> 02:03:44,094
SPEAKER_1:  You're to be hyper conscious of not doing anything that would spiritually validate your fast.

02:03:44,418 --> 02:03:51,486
SPEAKER_1:  just as you would physically. So just like you won't eat or drink, you certainly won't engage in sin, though you shouldn't engage in sins throughout the year, but...

02:03:52,834 --> 02:03:54,814
SPEAKER_1:  You know, you're not going to speak.

02:03:55,618 --> 02:03:58,590
SPEAKER_1:  words of evil, you're not going to gossip or slander.

02:03:59,170 --> 02:04:03,294
SPEAKER_1:  You try to fast with your eyes, not look at things that are not praiseworthy.

02:04:03,842 --> 02:04:04,990
SPEAKER_1:  So you try to engage.

02:04:05,250 --> 02:04:06,302
SPEAKER_1:  and a wholesome.

02:04:06,722 --> 02:04:07,870
SPEAKER_1:  uh... act of

02:04:08,162 --> 02:04:10,942
SPEAKER_1:  Disciplining yourself with the consciousness of God.

02:04:11,938 --> 02:04:12,478
SPEAKER_1:  But then...

02:04:12,738 --> 02:04:13,438
SPEAKER_1:  channel that.

02:04:13,922 --> 02:04:17,758
SPEAKER_1:  into engaging the soul instead, exercising the soul instead.

02:04:18,754 --> 02:04:29,438
SPEAKER_1:  And what you'll find with Muslims and this act of God consciousness, where they reduce the consumption is they become far more grateful for the blessings of God because throughout our lives we just take sips of water, we eat what we can, we snack.

02:04:30,850 --> 02:04:31,262
SPEAKER_1:  when

02:04:32,034 --> 02:04:37,438
SPEAKER_1:  You're abstaining from that. You become so much more grateful for that sip of water, so much more grateful for that bite of food.

02:04:38,114 --> 02:04:44,894
SPEAKER_1:  so much more aware of the one who provided those blessings to you, so much more aware of those that don't have the same access to those blessings that you have.

02:04:45,250 --> 02:04:46,366
SPEAKER_1:  So you also develop.

02:04:46,626 --> 02:04:52,126
SPEAKER_1:  sense of empathy for the poor that don't have access to those blessings on a regular basis that can't help but fast.

02:04:53,026 --> 02:04:54,590
SPEAKER_1:  And on top of that again.

02:04:55,074 --> 02:04:55,870
SPEAKER_1:  spiritually.

02:04:56,226 --> 02:04:58,686
SPEAKER_1:  You are engaged in extra reading.

02:04:59,202 --> 02:05:01,598
SPEAKER_1:  At that time, people are listening to more lectures.

02:05:01,858 --> 02:05:02,398
SPEAKER_1:  people are.

02:05:02,946 --> 02:05:07,934
SPEAKER_1:  engaged in extra acts of devotion, extra acts of charity. Muslims are most charitable.

02:05:08,354 --> 02:05:09,406
SPEAKER_1:  in the month of Ramadan.

02:05:09,954 --> 02:05:17,470
SPEAKER_1:  So you just feel great and it's hard to explain to someone that doesn't do it because it sounds like torture to people. Right. What in the world are you doing?

02:05:18,146 --> 02:05:20,446
SPEAKER_1:  you know, four o'clock on a hot Texas day.

02:05:20,930 --> 02:05:23,710
SPEAKER_1:  not eating or drinking, you're probably dehydrated and cranky.

02:05:24,034 --> 02:05:25,342
SPEAKER_1:  have a caffeine headache and...

02:05:25,922 --> 02:05:27,870
SPEAKER_1:  You probably can't wait for this month to be over.

02:05:28,130 --> 02:05:31,806
SPEAKER_1:  But in reality, you talk to Muslims their favorite time of the year is Ramadan.

02:05:32,482 --> 02:05:33,470
SPEAKER_1:  You feel amazing.

02:05:33,858 --> 02:05:35,390
SPEAKER_1:  you feel absolutely incredible.

02:05:35,810 --> 02:05:37,790
SPEAKER_1:  because you taste a different type of consumption.

02:05:38,210 --> 02:05:39,934
SPEAKER_1:  You feed your soul for a change.

02:05:40,450 --> 02:05:41,822
SPEAKER_1:  And in that process.

02:05:42,498 --> 02:05:43,422
SPEAKER_1:  You connect.

02:05:44,034 --> 02:05:45,406
SPEAKER_1:  with God in a way?

02:05:46,338 --> 02:05:50,110
SPEAKER_1:  that you simply could not without the distractions of the day to day throughout the year.

02:05:50,914 --> 02:05:56,030
SPEAKER_1:  Now it's good that it's one month of the year because it's honestly physically taxing, right?

02:05:56,866 --> 02:05:57,982
SPEAKER_1:  It gives you a chance.

02:05:58,242 --> 02:06:04,414
SPEAKER_1:  to experience it for that one month, but then you're encouraged to fast a few days of the year as well outside of the month of Ramadan.

02:06:04,834 --> 02:06:06,110
SPEAKER_1:  to keep that connection.

02:06:06,914 --> 02:06:08,039
SPEAKER_1:  What are the hardest parts that-

02:06:08,039 --> 02:06:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  But maybe...

02:06:09,090 --> 02:06:09,630
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:06:09,922 --> 02:06:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  for people outside of...

02:06:12,802 --> 02:06:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  the Muslim faith.

02:06:15,394 --> 02:06:15,934
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:06:17,282 --> 02:06:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, we'll be curious about.

02:06:20,482 --> 02:06:22,590
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I think the hardest part is...

02:06:23,266 --> 02:06:24,391
SPEAKER_1:  Physically the physics

02:06:24,391 --> 02:06:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  or is it the spiritual? hello, I'm super Muscat and I think the

02:06:28,194 --> 02:06:30,558
SPEAKER_1:  So as Ramadan goes on.

02:06:31,106 --> 02:06:34,558
SPEAKER_1:  your acts of worship increase. So in the last 10 nights of Ramadan,

02:06:35,106 --> 02:06:37,310
SPEAKER_1:  Um, there is an intense.

02:06:38,050 --> 02:06:38,686
SPEAKER_1:  period.

02:06:39,298 --> 02:06:46,078
SPEAKER_1:  of prayer throughout the night. So every night in Ramadan, we have something called the Tarawih prayers. The Tarawih prayers are about an hour, hour and a half of prayer.

02:06:46,530 --> 02:06:49,886
SPEAKER_1:  outside of the five daily prayers. So the mosques are packed every night in Ramadan.

02:06:50,914 --> 02:06:52,702
SPEAKER_1:  the last ten nights of Ramadan.

02:06:53,346 --> 02:06:57,950
SPEAKER_1:  People will engage in prayer throughout the entire night. So the only sleep that you're probably getting

02:06:58,690 --> 02:07:01,182
SPEAKER_1:  is actually a couple of hours in the morning before you go to work.

02:07:02,018 --> 02:07:04,798
SPEAKER_1:  So it's everything sort of put together the.

02:07:05,442 --> 02:07:08,190
SPEAKER_1:  disruption of schedule, the disruption of diet.

02:07:08,418 --> 02:07:08,990
SPEAKER_1:  the

02:07:09,250 --> 02:07:10,654
SPEAKER_1:  physically exerting yourself.

02:07:11,618 --> 02:07:11,966
SPEAKER_1:  but

02:07:12,962 --> 02:07:14,238
SPEAKER_1:  the way you feel.

02:07:16,450 --> 02:07:17,310
SPEAKER_1:  is unmatched.

02:07:17,666 --> 02:07:18,814
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, you feel...

02:07:19,522 --> 02:07:20,638
SPEAKER_1:  so fulfilled.

02:07:21,794 --> 02:07:26,142
SPEAKER_1:  through that deprivation and it's actually the point. You know, it all ties back together when you talk about.

02:07:26,562 --> 02:07:27,870
SPEAKER_1:  even tests and trials.

02:07:28,450 --> 02:07:28,830
SPEAKER_1:  that

02:07:29,506 --> 02:07:32,766
SPEAKER_1:  God does not deprive us of anything except that He gives us something greater.

02:07:33,250 --> 02:07:33,982
SPEAKER_1:  in return.

02:07:34,562 --> 02:07:37,694
SPEAKER_1:  and you do not deprive yourself of anything for the sake of God.

02:07:38,050 --> 02:07:39,998
SPEAKER_1:  except that he gives you something greater in return.

02:07:40,738 --> 02:07:45,790
SPEAKER_1:  And so fasting is an exercise in patience that unlocks an infinite sense of gratitude.

02:07:46,402 --> 02:07:47,742
SPEAKER_1:  and a greater connection to God.

02:07:49,058 --> 02:07:50,183
SPEAKER_1:  Many people predict that.

02:07:50,183 --> 02:07:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  Islam will surpass Christianity as the largest religion.

02:07:54,114 --> 02:07:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  by the end of the century.

02:07:56,194 --> 02:07:59,454
SPEAKER_0:  by the number of its adherents and practitioners.

02:08:00,034 --> 02:08:02,686
SPEAKER_0:  What responsibility does that place on people like you?

02:08:03,330 --> 02:08:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  who is a religious leader, who is somebody who teaches, who grows, who cares for the community, for the Muslim community, but actually for all people.

02:08:11,138 --> 02:08:12,702
SPEAKER_1:  I think what that means is that.

02:08:13,410 --> 02:08:16,062
SPEAKER_1:  We have a responsibility to

02:08:17,346 --> 02:08:19,966
SPEAKER_1:  Teach and live our faith in the most beautiful of ways not.

02:08:20,962 --> 02:08:22,910
SPEAKER_1:  its values and

02:08:23,298 --> 02:08:24,190
SPEAKER_1:  ideals.

02:08:24,418 --> 02:08:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  are not just expressed by you, but experienced by everyone around you.

02:08:29,058 --> 02:08:29,726
SPEAKER_1:  And so...

02:08:30,018 --> 02:08:34,238
SPEAKER_1:  What I often teach my community is that look, if a Muslims in the area, what are they?

02:08:35,330 --> 02:08:37,502
SPEAKER_1:  What are your neighbors experiencing of you?

02:08:37,890 --> 02:08:39,358
SPEAKER_1:  What are people experiencing of you?

02:08:39,682 --> 02:08:40,478
SPEAKER_1:  You know, and there's...

02:08:40,930 --> 02:08:42,718
SPEAKER_1:  There are statistics to Muslims being

02:08:42,946 --> 02:08:45,182
SPEAKER_1:  most charitable communities in America.

02:08:45,890 --> 02:08:49,406
SPEAKER_1:  We're a community of great service the community of volunteer in a community that

02:08:49,666 --> 02:08:51,454
SPEAKER_1:  greatly enriches the world around us.

02:08:52,130 --> 02:08:54,238
SPEAKER_1:  I think that oftentimes people forget the history.

02:08:54,562 --> 02:08:55,422
SPEAKER_1:  of Muslims.

02:08:55,938 --> 02:08:57,982
SPEAKER_1:  you know, being at the forefront of contributing.

02:08:58,242 --> 02:09:00,158
SPEAKER_1:  the areas of medicine and science.

02:09:00,866 --> 02:09:02,494
SPEAKER_1:  all sorts of ways, education.

02:09:02,914 --> 02:09:04,254
SPEAKER_1:  really changing the world.

02:09:04,706 --> 02:09:05,886
SPEAKER_1:  through their commitment to faith.

02:09:07,458 --> 02:09:08,990
SPEAKER_1:  but on a deeply personal level.

02:09:10,562 --> 02:09:11,006
SPEAKER_1:  You know?

02:09:11,906 --> 02:09:13,502
SPEAKER_1:  It's important for us.

02:09:14,178 --> 02:09:15,518
SPEAKER_1:  to be representatives.

02:09:16,258 --> 02:09:16,702
SPEAKER_1:  of

02:09:17,090 --> 02:09:21,374
SPEAKER_1:  the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him in a way that makes Islamophobia impossible.

02:09:22,626 --> 02:09:24,862
SPEAKER_1:  I tell people this, that.

02:09:25,442 --> 02:09:29,278
SPEAKER_1:  it's very hard you know you mentioned united states of hate uh... the remarkably

02:09:29,890 --> 02:09:30,334
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

02:09:30,818 --> 02:09:32,510
SPEAKER_1:  the one man, the protester who...

02:09:33,346 --> 02:09:35,294
SPEAKER_1:  met me and sort of changed his world view.

02:09:36,130 --> 02:09:37,246
SPEAKER_1:  It's very hard for...

02:09:38,146 --> 02:09:39,390
SPEAKER_1:  people to believe.

02:09:40,034 --> 02:09:41,278
SPEAKER_1:  what they hear about Islam.

02:09:41,762 --> 02:09:42,878
SPEAKER_1:  if they see you live it.

02:09:43,906 --> 02:09:48,670
SPEAKER_1:  Now that does not excuse bigotry, that doesn't excuse the prejudice against Muslims.

02:09:49,378 --> 02:09:51,294
SPEAKER_1:  but it's important for us.

02:09:51,906 --> 02:09:53,278
SPEAKER_1:  to sort of take it as.

02:09:53,666 --> 02:09:55,550
SPEAKER_1:  a responsibility as Muslims.

02:09:56,482 --> 02:09:58,846
SPEAKER_1:  to channel our faith in the most beautiful of ways.

02:09:59,554 --> 02:10:01,342
SPEAKER_1:  God describes faith in the Quran.

02:10:01,986 --> 02:10:05,758
SPEAKER_1:  in the chapter of Abraham, peace be upon him, as a tree with firm foundations.

02:10:06,338 --> 02:10:12,158
SPEAKER_1:  the firm foundation being the testimony of faith, the oneness of God, so the tree of monotheism with firm foundations.

02:10:12,514 --> 02:10:13,982
SPEAKER_1:  and then branches high in the sky.

02:10:14,594 --> 02:10:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  providing shade to everything and everyone around you.

02:10:17,794 --> 02:10:20,158
SPEAKER_1:  and producing fruit at all times.

02:10:20,386 --> 02:10:22,270
SPEAKER_1:  the tree of faith of a Muslim.

02:10:22,690 --> 02:10:23,998
SPEAKER_1:  is not seasonal, so.

02:10:24,514 --> 02:10:25,598
SPEAKER_1:  you should be producing f-

02:10:26,114 --> 02:10:29,374
SPEAKER_1:  with your faith at all times, good works and things that.

02:10:29,954 --> 02:10:30,846
SPEAKER_1:  people can

02:10:31,394 --> 02:10:36,190
SPEAKER_1:  can actually experience. And I think that Muslims have historically contributed to the world around them.

02:10:37,058 --> 02:10:39,102
SPEAKER_1:  and I think that Muslims today are still contributing.

02:10:39,426 --> 02:10:41,342
SPEAKER_1:  uh, to the world around them. But I think that.

02:10:42,370 --> 02:10:42,878
SPEAKER_1:  we can.

02:10:43,266 --> 02:10:43,870
SPEAKER_1:  Never.

02:10:44,290 --> 02:10:45,502
SPEAKER_1:  do enough of.

02:10:45,762 --> 02:10:47,230
SPEAKER_1:  holding ourselves accountable.

02:10:47,586 --> 02:10:48,670
SPEAKER_1:  to the message.

02:10:49,026 --> 02:10:49,406
SPEAKER_1:  That's it.

02:10:49,634 --> 02:10:50,974
SPEAKER_1:  We hold dear to our hearts.

02:10:51,458 --> 02:10:55,230
SPEAKER_1:  and trying to be the best representatives of that message and of that messenger.

02:10:55,842 --> 02:10:57,118
SPEAKER_1:  to the world around us.

02:10:57,794 --> 02:11:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  So not only are you a...

02:11:00,610 --> 02:11:03,742
SPEAKER_0:  a religious leader in the Muslim community, but you have a lot of friends.

02:11:04,514 --> 02:11:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  uh, horror.

02:11:05,890 --> 02:11:09,342
SPEAKER_0:  from different religions, you have a lot of Jewish friends.

02:11:10,594 --> 02:11:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  As we've talked about a lot offline.

02:11:13,570 --> 02:11:14,046
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

02:11:14,434 --> 02:11:17,438
SPEAKER_0:  and we'll probably hopefully get a chance to talk to as well here.

02:11:17,666 --> 02:11:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  I wouldn't.

02:11:18,498 --> 02:11:20,414
SPEAKER_0:  On that topic, let me bring up.

02:11:20,962 --> 02:11:22,846
SPEAKER_0:  another tragic event that

02:11:23,234 --> 02:11:27,582
SPEAKER_0:  was just a little bit less than a year ago in this very community here in Dallas.

02:11:28,002 --> 02:11:30,334
SPEAKER_0:  There was a synagogue hostage crisis.

02:11:31,010 --> 02:11:35,710
SPEAKER_0:  Can you describe what happened and what was your experience like through it and afterwards?

02:11:36,226 --> 02:11:36,670
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:11:37,186 --> 02:11:41,886
SPEAKER_0:  what were the bad things you saw and what are the good things you saw in the community?

02:11:44,226 --> 02:11:45,246
SPEAKER_1:  The Colleyville.

02:11:45,794 --> 02:11:47,710
SPEAKER_1:  synagogue, a situation.

02:11:48,002 --> 02:11:50,526
SPEAKER_1:  It's kind of surreal that we're coming up on a year of that.

02:11:51,746 --> 02:11:54,462
SPEAKER_1:  But I'll actually tell you exactly what happened that morning.

02:11:54,690 --> 02:11:55,710
SPEAKER_1:  I was out with the family.

02:11:56,738 --> 02:11:58,174
SPEAKER_1:  and that morning...

02:11:58,818 --> 02:12:03,102
SPEAKER_1:  I kid you not that very morning I was telling my kids the story of Muhammad Ali.

02:12:03,618 --> 02:12:04,574
SPEAKER_1:  talking that man.

02:12:04,930 --> 02:12:10,398
SPEAKER_1:  out of committing suicide off the roof. And I showed them the YouTube video. My wife pulled it up on her phone. Kids were sitting in the backseat.

02:12:11,330 --> 02:12:12,990
SPEAKER_1:  We talked about that video.

02:12:13,858 --> 02:12:16,734
SPEAKER_1:  and talked about that importance of helping people.

02:12:17,730 --> 02:12:21,374
SPEAKER_1:  We also went to visit a loved one in the cemetery that day.

02:12:21,954 --> 02:12:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  And we went to breakfast. So we're out as a family that day, right? And there's a lot of meaning that's sort of coming together.

02:12:28,578 --> 02:12:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  for us and a lot of discussion, deep discussion we're having as a family.

02:12:32,450 --> 02:12:32,926
SPEAKER_1:  And then.

02:12:33,154 --> 02:12:35,774
SPEAKER_1:  some of our community groups, we get this message that.

02:12:36,194 --> 02:12:37,374
SPEAKER_1:  There's a synagogue.

02:12:37,858 --> 02:12:38,910
SPEAKER_1:  That's been taken.

02:12:39,138 --> 02:12:39,614
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

02:12:40,098 --> 02:12:40,958
SPEAKER_1:  hostage.

02:12:41,762 --> 02:12:43,422
SPEAKER_1:  A rabbi and his congregation taken.

02:12:43,650 --> 02:12:45,086
SPEAKER_1:  as hostages and.

02:12:45,954 --> 02:12:47,966
SPEAKER_1:  go to this Facebook link and it was the feed.

02:12:48,642 --> 02:12:49,598
SPEAKER_1:  of the synagogue.

02:12:50,210 --> 02:12:51,646
SPEAKER_1:  and you could hear the gunman.

02:12:51,906 --> 02:12:52,606
SPEAKER_1:  shouting.

02:12:53,698 --> 02:12:55,518
SPEAKER_1:  and it became apparent.

02:12:55,810 --> 02:12:56,286
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:12:56,962 --> 02:12:58,110
SPEAKER_1:  very early on that.

02:12:58,434 --> 02:13:00,542
SPEAKER_1:  It was a man that was claiming to be Muslim

02:13:00,994 --> 02:13:02,494
SPEAKER_1:  that was holding them hostage.

02:13:03,362 --> 02:13:04,158
SPEAKER_1:  Now all these...

02:13:04,418 --> 02:13:07,070
SPEAKER_1:  Synagogue massacres, all these places of worship.

02:13:07,618 --> 02:13:09,662
SPEAKER_1:  We're not attacked by Muslims, right? This is...

02:13:11,106 --> 02:13:13,566
SPEAKER_1:  uh... a different type of situation but

02:13:15,906 --> 02:13:17,054
SPEAKER_1:  My first instinct.

02:13:17,570 --> 02:13:18,270
SPEAKER_1:  was

02:13:19,874 --> 02:13:22,270
SPEAKER_1:  Like all that happened this morning was not random.

02:13:23,714 --> 02:13:24,734
SPEAKER_1:  So I told my wife.

02:13:25,186 --> 02:13:26,910
SPEAKER_1:  I told my kids I'm gonna go down there.

02:13:27,906 --> 02:13:28,926
SPEAKER_1:  Ah, it's a callee bill.

02:13:29,954 --> 02:13:30,462
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:13:31,234 --> 02:13:32,350
SPEAKER_1:  She was very supportive.

02:13:32,962 --> 02:13:34,302
SPEAKER_1:  Obviously there was a moment of shock.

02:13:35,330 --> 02:13:35,710
SPEAKER_1:  like

02:13:36,002 --> 02:13:36,862
SPEAKER_1:  kids were like.

02:13:37,506 --> 02:13:40,030
SPEAKER_1:  Wait, what? And I said, look, remember what we talked about this morning?

02:13:41,282 --> 02:13:41,758
SPEAKER_1:  um...

02:13:42,050 --> 02:13:43,486
SPEAKER_1:  We can't be indifferent to the stuff.

02:13:44,674 --> 02:13:50,526
SPEAKER_1:  We still go back and revisit that day. You know, like it's crazy how it was all falling into place. It's not an accident, right?

02:13:51,362 --> 02:13:52,574
SPEAKER_1:  So I dropped them off at home.

02:13:52,834 --> 02:13:54,622
SPEAKER_1:  And I started to drive to Colleyville.

02:13:55,586 --> 02:13:56,542
SPEAKER_1:  I called the, um.

02:13:57,122 --> 02:13:57,726
SPEAKER_1:  Irving.

02:13:57,986 --> 02:13:59,966
SPEAKER_1:  police department and I asked them to

02:14:00,578 --> 02:14:02,494
SPEAKER_1:  called the Colleyville Police Department.

02:14:03,522 --> 02:14:03,998
SPEAKER_1:  So that.

02:14:04,546 --> 02:14:06,302
SPEAKER_1:  they could kind of know that I'm coming down there.

02:14:06,946 --> 02:14:08,286
SPEAKER_1:  I called.

02:14:08,834 --> 02:14:10,654
SPEAKER_1:  some of the faith leaders in the community.

02:14:11,042 --> 02:14:13,406
SPEAKER_1:  to see if they could put me in touch with those on the ground.

02:14:14,274 --> 02:14:16,478
SPEAKER_1:  that I wouldn't get shot when I showed up there.

02:14:17,474 --> 02:14:19,358
SPEAKER_1:  and eventually I had to wait out.

02:14:19,874 --> 02:14:21,918
SPEAKER_1:  outside until they got clearance to come through.

02:14:22,818 --> 02:14:26,014
SPEAKER_1:  and to just offer whatever support I could, pastoral support.

02:14:26,690 --> 02:14:28,030
SPEAKER_1:  support with

02:14:28,290 --> 02:14:30,398
SPEAKER_1:  trying to free the hostages.

02:14:30,658 --> 02:14:34,686
SPEAKER_1:  of the synagogue at the time. It was operating out of a church right across the street from.

02:14:35,042 --> 02:14:35,870
SPEAKER_1:  the synagogue.

02:14:36,930 --> 02:14:37,502
SPEAKER_1:  Um

02:14:38,498 --> 02:14:39,550
SPEAKER_1:  day long.

02:14:40,002 --> 02:14:41,950
SPEAKER_1:  just wondering, you know, what was going to happen.

02:14:42,786 --> 02:14:43,582
SPEAKER_1:  looking at.

02:14:43,842 --> 02:14:45,214
SPEAKER_1:  the family of the Rabbi.

02:14:45,442 --> 02:14:45,918
SPEAKER_1:  the time.

02:14:46,370 --> 02:14:48,030
SPEAKER_1:  wondering what was going to happen.

02:14:49,570 --> 02:14:52,894
SPEAKER_1:  and trying to just be as supportive as I possibly could.

02:14:53,282 --> 02:14:54,046
SPEAKER_1:  at that time.

02:14:55,042 --> 02:14:57,022
SPEAKER_1:  Thankfully, they all

02:14:57,474 --> 02:14:58,078
SPEAKER_1:  God out.

02:14:58,562 --> 02:14:59,230
SPEAKER_1:  in the evening.

02:15:00,322 --> 02:15:01,182
SPEAKER_1:  And I think that...

02:15:02,274 --> 02:15:02,878
SPEAKER_1:  you know

02:15:04,194 --> 02:15:05,726
SPEAKER_1:  Looking back on that.

02:15:06,082 --> 02:15:06,526
SPEAKER_1:  day.

02:15:08,962 --> 02:15:13,438
SPEAKER_1:  My wife actually asked me, she said, would you have done it differently? And I said, no, I really wouldn't because I think that

02:15:13,666 --> 02:15:13,982
SPEAKER_1:  that

02:15:14,818 --> 02:15:19,998
SPEAKER_1:  Things happen sometimes, you've got to act on your good instinct sometimes, right? When you talk about like being calculated.

02:15:21,186 --> 02:15:22,014
SPEAKER_1:  think sometimes.

02:15:23,234 --> 02:15:26,878
SPEAKER_1:  we're calculated when we shouldn't be. And that's when that good instinct comes in.

02:15:27,682 --> 02:15:29,310
SPEAKER_1:  where you're called to do something else.

02:15:29,922 --> 02:15:31,582
SPEAKER_0:  What did it feel like to be a-

02:15:31,842 --> 02:15:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  Most of them in a situation like that.

02:15:34,434 --> 02:15:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, were you a human being? Were you a religious?

02:15:39,650 --> 02:15:44,286
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I don't, I don't, I don't see, I can't, I can't separate anything about myself.

02:15:44,706 --> 02:15:46,142
SPEAKER_1:  in that situation, right? so

02:15:47,074 --> 02:15:48,414
SPEAKER_1:  When I had to pray, I had to pray.

02:15:49,378 --> 02:15:50,462
SPEAKER_1:  to help people out.

02:15:50,754 --> 02:15:52,158
SPEAKER_1:  give people words of comfort.

02:15:52,770 --> 02:15:54,334
SPEAKER_1:  to try to appeal.

02:15:54,786 --> 02:15:56,158
SPEAKER_1:  to the senses of...

02:15:57,026 --> 02:15:58,526
SPEAKER_1:  whoever I could at the time.

02:15:59,522 --> 02:16:01,694
SPEAKER_1:  I didn't see myself as, like, uh...

02:16:02,082 --> 02:16:03,486
SPEAKER_1:  a guy trying to...

02:16:06,018 --> 02:16:07,006
SPEAKER_1:  trying to show.

02:16:07,266 --> 02:16:11,262
SPEAKER_1:  a particular part of Islam there. I just saw myself as someone that was trying to-

02:16:11,874 --> 02:16:12,926
SPEAKER_1:  help a family get there.

02:16:13,154 --> 02:16:17,630
SPEAKER_1:  their husband and father back, right? And so it was more of just like that part of me was there.

02:16:18,274 --> 02:16:21,438
SPEAKER_1:  You know, you can, you can kind of see yourself, right? This is the irony of it.

02:16:22,850 --> 02:16:24,478
SPEAKER_1:  when Christ Church New Zealand happened.

02:16:25,858 --> 02:16:33,182
SPEAKER_1:  That was kind of our worst nightmare as Texas Muslims, because we've had armed groups in front of our mosques threatening to do what that man did in Christchurch.

02:16:34,658 --> 02:16:36,350
SPEAKER_1:  And so when you see a wife and kids.

02:16:37,442 --> 02:16:37,886
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:16:38,402 --> 02:16:40,638
SPEAKER_1:  wondering if they're going to get their dad back.

02:16:42,018 --> 02:16:43,390
SPEAKER_1:  you kind of see yourself there.

02:16:43,714 --> 02:16:46,014
SPEAKER_1:  And so I just saw myself in that situation.

02:16:46,274 --> 02:16:48,254
SPEAKER_1:  What would I want people to be doing for me in that moment?

02:16:48,802 --> 02:16:50,846
SPEAKER_1:  What would I want people to be telling my family in that moment?

02:16:51,618 --> 02:16:54,046
SPEAKER_1:  So that's really where I went to and that's really where.

02:16:54,498 --> 02:16:56,254
SPEAKER_1:  where I dug into and I prayed a lot that day.

02:16:56,642 --> 02:17:00,734
SPEAKER_1:  a lot, a lot for the right words, for the right actions, what I could do.

02:17:01,378 --> 02:17:02,398
SPEAKER_1:  to just help.

02:17:04,994 --> 02:17:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  What are the lessons now a year later?

02:17:08,482 --> 02:17:09,886
SPEAKER_0:  that you take away from that day.

02:17:10,658 --> 02:17:12,286
SPEAKER_1:  in the days. Less than Thanks

02:17:13,602 --> 02:17:14,526
SPEAKER_1:  Don't be indifferent.

02:17:15,426 --> 02:17:19,006
SPEAKER_1:  Don't be indifferent to the suffering around you or even that's distant from you.

02:17:19,938 --> 02:17:21,406
SPEAKER_1:  because it's somehow related to you.

02:17:21,858 --> 02:17:22,942
SPEAKER_1:  So just don't be indifferent.

02:17:25,698 --> 02:17:29,310
SPEAKER_0:  So you're proud that you stepped up and you went there and then.

02:17:29,826 --> 02:17:31,774
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, look, I don't think...

02:17:35,330 --> 02:17:36,606
SPEAKER_1:  I don't think I did much.

02:17:36,898 --> 02:17:41,150
SPEAKER_1:  being really honest, this is not me trying to be humble here. I don't think I did much. I think I did what I did.

02:17:41,378 --> 02:17:41,694
SPEAKER_1:  I was.

02:17:42,242 --> 02:17:43,358
SPEAKER_1:  what I was called to do.

02:17:43,618 --> 02:17:43,998
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:17:45,762 --> 02:17:46,398
SPEAKER_1:  I wish.

02:17:46,818 --> 02:17:49,566
SPEAKER_1:  that it never happens, right? as a whole, but.

02:17:50,530 --> 02:17:51,294
SPEAKER_1:  I'm glad that.

02:17:51,522 --> 02:17:53,726
SPEAKER_1:  the relationships that have been built over time.

02:17:54,114 --> 02:17:54,590
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

02:17:55,202 --> 02:18:01,502
SPEAKER_1:  came into being in that day, right? We could call upon people that we knew, call upon each other and as a community where they come together, you know.

02:18:01,762 --> 02:18:02,942
SPEAKER_1:  Dallas has been through a lot.

02:18:03,490 --> 02:18:04,190
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of pain.

02:18:05,314 --> 02:18:07,262
SPEAKER_1:  but we've come together through a lot of pain as well.

02:18:07,906 --> 02:18:08,382
SPEAKER_1:  So.

02:18:08,642 --> 02:18:12,926
SPEAKER_1:  It's, it's kind of one of those things where we're united in our pain, you know, when you suffer together.

02:18:13,698 --> 02:18:16,222
SPEAKER_1:  you build certain bonds together.

02:18:16,546 --> 02:18:18,814
SPEAKER_1:  So Dallas has been through a lot as a community.

02:18:19,490 --> 02:18:22,302
SPEAKER_1:  But we've come together through a lot as a community.

02:18:23,490 --> 02:18:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, the thing about violence and war.

02:18:26,530 --> 02:18:27,742
SPEAKER_0:  It destroys.

02:18:28,322 --> 02:18:33,950
SPEAKER_0:  It caused so much suffering, but it also sort of brings out some of the best aspects of human nature and unites people.

02:18:34,498 --> 02:18:37,873
SPEAKER_0:  It's an interesting way how our human civilization functions.

02:18:37,873 --> 02:18:38,270
SPEAKER_1:  functions.

02:18:38,786 --> 02:18:42,046
SPEAKER_1:  Well, that's the beauty that you don't just want to see, but you also want to be.

02:18:42,754 --> 02:18:45,182
SPEAKER_1:  You know, we're living in a climate where.

02:18:46,402 --> 02:18:49,726
SPEAKER_1:  There's a lot of that, right? So how do you actually...

02:18:50,370 --> 02:18:50,750
SPEAKER_1:  Oh.

02:18:51,490 --> 02:18:52,958
SPEAKER_1:  get through that and actually.

02:18:55,010 --> 02:18:56,990
SPEAKER_1:  not allow yourself to succumb to that.

02:18:58,306 --> 02:19:00,190
SPEAKER_1:  and be another voice in that polarization.

02:19:04,898 --> 02:19:06,023
SPEAKER_1:  It seems that there are...

02:19:06,023 --> 02:19:07,774
SPEAKER_0:  history and still in the world today.

02:19:08,674 --> 02:19:11,710
SPEAKER_0:  Religion has been a source of some of the

02:19:12,098 --> 02:19:14,142
SPEAKER_0:  of a lot of polarization.

02:19:14,498 --> 02:19:16,446
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of conflict, even war.

02:19:17,346 --> 02:19:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:19:18,018 --> 02:19:19,038
SPEAKER_0:  Why do you think that is?

02:19:20,130 --> 02:19:21,822
SPEAKER_1:  Listen, I think at the essence of it.

02:19:22,914 --> 02:19:23,902
SPEAKER_1:  As always.

02:19:24,226 --> 02:19:26,270
SPEAKER_1:  some sort of political instability.

02:19:27,266 --> 02:19:29,886
SPEAKER_1:  that leaves behind a brutalized population.

02:19:30,850 --> 02:19:33,406
SPEAKER_1:  and vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

02:19:36,322 --> 02:19:38,014
SPEAKER_1:  As I said in the 20th century.

02:19:39,138 --> 02:19:39,518
SPEAKER_1:  with.

02:19:39,810 --> 02:19:41,950
SPEAKER_1:  the bloodiest century that we've had to date.

02:19:43,394 --> 02:19:47,870
SPEAKER_1:  Where does religion fall on any of that? Where does religion fall in the isms? Where does religion fall?

02:19:48,354 --> 02:19:49,502
SPEAKER_1:  in the world wars.

02:19:50,338 --> 02:19:51,454
SPEAKER_1:  Where does religion fall?

02:19:52,098 --> 02:19:55,678
SPEAKER_1:  And much of that, even when we talk about things like the crusades remove.

02:19:56,002 --> 02:19:57,022
SPEAKER_1:  the Islamic framing.

02:19:57,666 --> 02:19:59,198
SPEAKER_1:  The crusades, the crusades.

02:19:59,618 --> 02:20:00,766
SPEAKER_1:  Were they really about religion?

02:20:01,154 --> 02:20:03,934
SPEAKER_1:  the Mongols and the destruction of the Mongols.

02:20:04,450 --> 02:20:05,470
SPEAKER_1:  Was it about religion?

02:20:06,562 --> 02:20:07,934
SPEAKER_1:  Myanmar and the Rohingya.

02:20:08,482 --> 02:20:08,830
SPEAKER_1:  day.

02:20:09,154 --> 02:20:10,334
SPEAKER_1:  Is it about Buddhism?

02:20:10,850 --> 02:20:13,054
SPEAKER_1:  So I think that these are essentially.

02:20:13,666 --> 02:20:14,398
SPEAKER_1:  political.

02:20:14,626 --> 02:20:15,358
SPEAKER_1:  issues.

02:20:15,650 --> 02:20:17,054
SPEAKER_1:  political causes.

02:20:17,634 --> 02:20:19,262
SPEAKER_1:  where you have people that.

02:20:19,938 --> 02:20:20,510
SPEAKER_1:  Rise up.

02:20:20,802 --> 02:20:21,886
SPEAKER_1:  and that use.

02:20:22,338 --> 02:20:26,558
SPEAKER_1:  religion to disguise things that are far, far, far from religion.

02:20:26,850 --> 02:20:28,190
SPEAKER_1:  And if you want to manipulate.

02:20:28,482 --> 02:20:30,558
SPEAKER_1:  a religious scripture. You could turn any book.

02:20:31,362 --> 02:20:32,222
SPEAKER_1:  Any scripture.

02:20:32,898 --> 02:20:35,134
SPEAKER_1:  into a violent scripture if you have a violent aim.

02:20:35,714 --> 02:20:39,678
SPEAKER_1:  So I think that that's where you find people manipulating versus.

02:20:39,938 --> 02:20:41,086
SPEAKER_1:  manipulating religion.

02:20:41,954 --> 02:20:44,286
SPEAKER_1:  to justify sick ideologies.

02:20:45,218 --> 02:20:46,526
SPEAKER_1:  that are based.

02:20:47,554 --> 02:20:49,918
SPEAKER_1:  and thrive in political instability.

02:20:50,370 --> 02:20:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  So these are fundamentally political geopolitical conflicts.

02:20:54,338 --> 02:20:57,822
SPEAKER_1:  Not religious conflicts. Absolutely. Look, when you talk about a group like ISIS.

02:20:59,266 --> 02:21:02,014
SPEAKER_1:  Islam has been in Iraq for a very, very long time.

02:21:04,130 --> 02:21:07,262
SPEAKER_1:  Iraq has been bombed by now five consecutive presidents.

02:21:07,522 --> 02:21:08,030
SPEAKER_1:  or four.

02:21:08,290 --> 02:21:09,022
SPEAKER_1:  It's been.

02:21:09,314 --> 02:21:11,102
SPEAKER_1:  bombed into the stone ages.

02:21:11,778 --> 02:21:13,694
SPEAKER_1:  there is no political infrastructure.

02:21:14,082 --> 02:21:15,646
SPEAKER_1:  devastation and destruction.

02:21:16,290 --> 02:21:18,206
SPEAKER_1:  and desperation as a result of that.

02:21:18,946 --> 02:21:23,422
SPEAKER_1:  Many of the old Saddam loyalists and Saddam's regime was a secularist regime.

02:21:24,194 --> 02:21:27,966
SPEAKER_1:  uh, are now heads of ISIS, right? It just moved into that.

02:21:28,418 --> 02:21:30,366
SPEAKER_1:  when you create that type of chaos.

02:21:31,074 --> 02:21:32,062
SPEAKER_1:  you generate.

02:21:32,546 --> 02:21:33,566
SPEAKER_1:  and environments.

02:21:34,114 --> 02:21:34,718
SPEAKER_1:  Where...

02:21:35,170 --> 02:21:37,758
SPEAKER_1:  groups like ISIS are bound to rise out of.

02:21:38,626 --> 02:21:39,102
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

02:21:40,034 --> 02:21:40,862
SPEAKER_1:  Islam did not.

02:21:41,250 --> 02:21:42,366
SPEAKER_1:  you know, cause this.

02:21:42,594 --> 02:21:45,758
SPEAKER_1:  People didn't wake up in Iraq one day and say, hey, let's create a group called ISIS.

02:21:46,018 --> 02:21:47,230
SPEAKER_1:  because Islam tells us to.

02:21:48,034 --> 02:21:48,350
SPEAKER_1:  Alright.

02:21:49,090 --> 02:21:50,398
SPEAKER_1:  Iraq was bombed.

02:21:50,978 --> 02:21:51,550
SPEAKER_1:  into.

02:21:52,226 --> 02:21:52,958
SPEAKER_1:  this place.

02:21:53,762 --> 02:21:55,262
SPEAKER_1:  and we have to.

02:21:55,874 --> 02:21:56,574
SPEAKER_1:  Not just.

02:21:56,866 --> 02:21:57,598
SPEAKER_1:  free religion.

02:21:58,434 --> 02:21:58,814
SPEAKER_1:  from.

02:21:59,362 --> 02:22:02,430
SPEAKER_1:  the responsibility from having to bear the responsibility.

02:22:03,074 --> 02:22:04,254
SPEAKER_1:  of much of.

02:22:04,706 --> 02:22:06,078
SPEAKER_1:  the hatred and violence.

02:22:06,306 --> 02:22:07,710
SPEAKER_1:  but we have to interrogate.

02:22:08,738 --> 02:22:09,214
SPEAKER_1:  The.

02:22:09,602 --> 02:22:12,286
SPEAKER_1:  political instability that was caused.

02:22:13,410 --> 02:22:14,590
SPEAKER_1:  where we justified.

02:22:15,906 --> 02:22:16,830
SPEAKER_1:  as Americans.

02:22:17,314 --> 02:22:18,718
SPEAKER_1:  These are taxpayer dollars.

02:22:19,458 --> 02:22:20,542
SPEAKER_1:  were we justified.

02:22:21,186 --> 02:22:22,462
SPEAKER_1:  with what was done in Iraq.

02:22:22,914 --> 02:22:25,246
SPEAKER_1:  Do we even know what was done in Iraq and Afghanistan?

02:22:26,498 --> 02:22:27,518
SPEAKER_1:  These drones that...

02:22:27,810 --> 02:22:28,222
SPEAKER_1:  drop.

02:22:28,578 --> 02:22:32,254
SPEAKER_1:  using our tax dollars under Democratic and Republican regimes.

02:22:33,378 --> 02:22:33,982
SPEAKER_1:  End.

02:22:34,370 --> 02:22:34,782
SPEAKER_1:

02:22:36,162 --> 02:22:37,534
SPEAKER_1:  thousands of innocent people.

02:22:37,890 --> 02:22:39,774
SPEAKER_1:  in weddings in Yemen and Somalia.

02:22:40,482 --> 02:22:41,534
SPEAKER_1:  Are these justified?

02:22:42,082 --> 02:22:43,678
SPEAKER_1:  When you think about dehumanization.

02:22:46,370 --> 02:22:49,502
SPEAKER_1:  Can the average American name a single victim of the Iraq War?

02:22:51,074 --> 02:22:56,062
SPEAKER_1:  Is there a picture that comes to your mind? Is there a person? Absolutely not, because that's the dehumanization.

02:22:56,898 --> 02:22:59,134
SPEAKER_1:  I often talk about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

02:22:59,554 --> 02:23:00,446
SPEAKER_1:  his progression.

02:23:01,122 --> 02:23:04,094
SPEAKER_1:  as a faith leader in America, as a political leader in America.

02:23:04,610 --> 02:23:07,902
SPEAKER_1:  Dr. King was deeply unpopular when he took his stand on Vietnam.

02:23:08,354 --> 02:23:09,982
SPEAKER_1:  and he mentions how first.

02:23:10,338 --> 02:23:11,454
SPEAKER_1:  He had to see.

02:23:12,418 --> 02:23:13,150
SPEAKER_1:  Vietnam.

02:23:14,146 --> 02:23:19,646
SPEAKER_1:  through the lens of the soldiers, because many of the soldiers that were lost, they were American soldiers, right? And that was...

02:23:20,226 --> 02:23:24,062
SPEAKER_1:  That was a crime that they were sent to fight a war that they should not have been sent to fight.

02:23:24,642 --> 02:23:25,246
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:23:25,986 --> 02:23:32,318
SPEAKER_1:  there was an injustice that was done towards them. He said, but things really changed when he started to see it from the other side of the bullet.

02:23:33,090 --> 02:23:34,462
SPEAKER_1:  when he started to see the world.

02:23:34,690 --> 02:23:35,070
SPEAKER_1:  through.

02:23:35,682 --> 02:23:37,374
SPEAKER_1:  Vietnam through the Vietnamese child.

02:23:38,306 --> 02:23:39,038
SPEAKER_1:  And that's where...

02:23:39,490 --> 02:23:41,662
SPEAKER_1:  he resorted to breaking the silence.

02:23:41,922 --> 02:23:43,294
SPEAKER_1:  That's where he changed his tune.

02:23:44,066 --> 02:23:48,350
SPEAKER_1:  Because we dehumanize our victims so much that they're not even relevant to our discourse.

02:23:48,930 --> 02:23:51,358
SPEAKER_1:  until they become able villains.

02:23:52,098 --> 02:23:52,830
SPEAKER_1:  to our story.

02:23:53,570 --> 02:23:55,966
SPEAKER_1:  And then now they're attacking us because they hate us.

02:23:56,418 --> 02:24:03,358
SPEAKER_1:  Now they're blowing us up because they hate us. Their religion tells them to do this to us. What have we allowed to be done to them?

02:24:04,162 --> 02:24:05,694
SPEAKER_1:  using our tax dollars.

02:24:06,498 --> 02:24:07,102
SPEAKER_1:  in our name.

02:24:08,706 --> 02:24:09,118
SPEAKER_1:  So.

02:24:09,474 --> 02:24:11,262
SPEAKER_1:  I think that we have to interrogate.

02:24:11,874 --> 02:24:13,918
SPEAKER_1:  the political chaos that was caused.

02:24:14,498 --> 02:24:15,358
SPEAKER_1:  Not just.

02:24:15,746 --> 02:24:17,214
SPEAKER_1:  not just free religion.

02:24:17,698 --> 02:24:18,110
SPEAKER_1:  from.

02:24:18,434 --> 02:24:19,806
SPEAKER_1:  the groups that were created.

02:24:20,418 --> 02:24:20,926
SPEAKER_1:  But what

02:24:21,410 --> 02:24:22,110
SPEAKER_1:  was done.

02:24:22,562 --> 02:24:26,517
SPEAKER_1:  to those countries and what continues to be done in many of these places. If winner

02:24:26,517 --> 02:24:26,942
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:24:28,162 --> 02:24:31,006
SPEAKER_0:  the pride that people had about America.

02:24:31,394 --> 02:24:35,262
SPEAKER_0:  where everybody came together after 9-11 and there was all the American flags.

02:24:37,282 --> 02:24:40,734
SPEAKER_0:  That was beautiful to see, but then you have to transfer that.

02:24:41,378 --> 02:24:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  And I wish all of us

02:24:43,842 --> 02:24:45,726
SPEAKER_0:  Americans could go and see.

02:24:46,338 --> 02:24:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  the daughters that would lose their parents, the parents that would lose their daughters and sons because bombs dropped.

02:24:52,738 --> 02:24:53,406
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:24:53,890 --> 02:24:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  the thousands, the tens of thousands of civilians that died.

02:24:58,562 --> 02:25:02,974
SPEAKER_0:  in Afghanistan and in Iraq because of the decisions made.

02:25:04,578 --> 02:25:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  in the name of politics, like if we just met those families.

02:25:07,650 --> 02:25:10,046
SPEAKER_0:  And if we empathize with them.

02:25:10,338 --> 02:25:12,350
SPEAKER_0:  and just put ourselves in their place.

02:25:13,698 --> 02:25:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  It's impossible not to feel hate.

02:25:16,514 --> 02:25:17,854
SPEAKER_0:  for America for Everybody.

02:25:18,306 --> 02:25:21,854
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I visited Ukraine and spoke to a lot of Ukrainians and.

02:25:22,370 --> 02:25:23,550
SPEAKER_0:  They said, um...

02:25:24,930 --> 02:25:25,534
SPEAKER_0:  You know, there's...

02:25:25,922 --> 02:25:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  There's loved ones that are Russians before the war.

02:25:28,930 --> 02:25:29,630
SPEAKER_0:  But now...

02:25:30,178 --> 02:25:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  All they have is hate.

02:25:32,034 --> 02:25:35,710
SPEAKER_0:  And if you ask many of them, will they ever forgive? Not not.

02:25:36,034 --> 02:25:36,926
SPEAKER_0:  Not the regime.

02:25:37,922 --> 02:25:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  not the soldiers who will ever forgive Russians.

02:25:41,154 --> 02:25:43,134
SPEAKER_0:  Many of them say never.

02:25:44,546 --> 02:25:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  and that never...

02:25:46,178 --> 02:25:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  feels like it's a generational.

02:25:48,546 --> 02:25:48,958
SPEAKER_0:  Never.

02:25:49,698 --> 02:25:50,110
SPEAKER_1:  Hmm.

02:25:50,626 --> 02:25:51,422
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, look.

02:25:53,474 --> 02:25:54,622
SPEAKER_1:  You think about this.

02:25:55,458 --> 02:25:58,590
SPEAKER_1:  You know, if your grandparents were wiped out in a drone attack, your parents...

02:25:59,426 --> 02:26:02,782
SPEAKER_1:  your brothers, your sisters, all of your loved ones, and you're missing a leg and an eye.

02:26:04,002 --> 02:26:09,374
SPEAKER_1:  and the world does not take you into consideration, you'll never be seen or considered in the halls of Congress are discussed.

02:26:10,946 --> 02:26:12,190
SPEAKER_1:  What are you gonna grow up with?

02:26:14,818 --> 02:26:20,606
SPEAKER_1:  But the thing is, is that we should not be speaking about this only from the standpoint of, oh shoot, they're going to grow up and hate us.

02:26:22,146 --> 02:26:24,126
SPEAKER_1:  we should be thinking about what was done to them.

02:26:24,514 --> 02:26:25,438
SPEAKER_1:  and hate that.

02:26:26,018 --> 02:26:26,846
SPEAKER_1:  despise that.

02:26:27,234 --> 02:26:28,094
SPEAKER_1:  that it's ugly.

02:26:28,482 --> 02:26:30,878
SPEAKER_1:  you see when people carry out a terrorist attack.

02:26:31,778 --> 02:26:33,022
SPEAKER_1:  They're not considering.

02:26:33,730 --> 02:26:39,646
SPEAKER_1:  lives of the civilians in these places. So those that perpetrate the 9-11 attacks are not seen.

02:26:40,802 --> 02:26:42,622
SPEAKER_1:  the thousands of people that they killed.

02:26:42,850 --> 02:26:45,374
SPEAKER_1:  the human beings, the lives, many of whom are Muslim by the way.

02:26:45,666 --> 02:26:46,238
SPEAKER_1:  actually no.

02:26:46,914 --> 02:26:48,670
SPEAKER_1:  One of them was a very active Muslim.

02:26:48,962 --> 02:26:50,494
SPEAKER_1:  Islamic Circle of North America.

02:26:51,490 --> 02:26:51,806
SPEAKER_1:  I mean.

02:26:52,898 --> 02:26:54,334
SPEAKER_1:  They didn't see those stories, right?

02:26:55,714 --> 02:26:56,894
SPEAKER_1:  when you drop a bomb.

02:26:57,794 --> 02:26:59,838
SPEAKER_1:  on this many people, when you drone people.

02:27:00,258 --> 02:27:02,302
SPEAKER_1:  and you say, oops, collateral damage.

02:27:02,946 --> 02:27:04,318
SPEAKER_1:  We were looking for one person.

02:27:04,738 --> 02:27:05,726
SPEAKER_1:  killed 40 people.

02:27:06,306 --> 02:27:07,454
SPEAKER_1:  and there's no count.

02:27:08,034 --> 02:27:08,926
SPEAKER_1:  No names.

02:27:09,570 --> 02:27:12,350
SPEAKER_1:  Nothing that can be recalled in the American memory.

02:27:13,474 --> 02:27:14,270
SPEAKER_1:  That's a problem.

02:27:14,626 --> 02:27:17,470
SPEAKER_1:  a fundamental issue with how we treat the rest of the world.

02:27:18,338 --> 02:27:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  Right?

02:27:20,322 --> 02:27:21,854
SPEAKER_1:  I'm an American. I've.

02:27:22,210 --> 02:27:23,902
SPEAKER_1:  I think that I'm responsible.

02:27:24,290 --> 02:27:26,718
SPEAKER_1:  to the extent that I have to critique these policies.

02:27:27,298 --> 02:27:29,726
SPEAKER_1:  And I have to try to challenge.

02:27:30,210 --> 02:27:32,062
SPEAKER_1:  America to deal with the world differently.

02:27:33,186 --> 02:27:35,166
SPEAKER_1:  And when I go overseas...

02:27:37,090 --> 02:27:41,694
SPEAKER_1:  when I'm around Muslims in the Muslim world, right? in the Middle East and in the Muslim world.

02:27:43,618 --> 02:27:46,878
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I have to, I'm speaking as a Palestinian.

02:27:47,202 --> 02:27:50,846
SPEAKER_1:  American Muslim who grew up in South Louisiana. I've got a

02:27:51,170 --> 02:27:52,478
SPEAKER_1:  complex.

02:27:52,706 --> 02:27:57,022
SPEAKER_1:  background here, right? A lot of experiences here that I'm grateful for because they all contribute.

02:27:57,666 --> 02:27:58,142
SPEAKER_1:  to.

02:27:58,818 --> 02:27:59,230
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

02:27:59,906 --> 02:28:04,510
SPEAKER_1:  who i who i am and who what i know when and what i've been i think they're all enriching

02:28:05,442 --> 02:28:07,678
SPEAKER_1:  I wouldn't relinquish the Palestinian part.

02:28:08,322 --> 02:28:09,342
SPEAKER_1:  I wouldn't relinquish.

02:28:09,698 --> 02:28:12,510
SPEAKER_1:  the American part and I certainly wouldn't relinquish the Muslim part.

02:28:13,922 --> 02:28:14,526
SPEAKER_1:  But it's...

02:28:14,914 --> 02:28:16,670
SPEAKER_1:  helping people consider.

02:28:18,018 --> 02:28:19,166
SPEAKER_1:  what they're not seeing.

02:28:19,778 --> 02:28:22,334
SPEAKER_1:  and when you can dehumanize entire groups of people.

02:28:23,490 --> 02:28:24,222
SPEAKER_1:  to where you can.

02:28:24,514 --> 02:28:25,726
SPEAKER_1:  reduce them to chalk.

02:28:26,178 --> 02:28:27,262
SPEAKER_1:  Casualty counts.

02:28:27,554 --> 02:28:29,662
SPEAKER_1:  and not be able to recall a single story.

02:28:30,754 --> 02:28:31,294
SPEAKER_1:  then

02:28:31,586 --> 02:28:34,782
SPEAKER_1:  You have to take a step back and ask yourself, what are we becoming?

02:28:35,650 --> 02:28:39,902
SPEAKER_1:  What are we becoming? Not a single victim of Afghanistan or Iraq.

02:28:40,674 --> 02:28:41,758
SPEAKER_1:  millions of people.

02:28:42,146 --> 02:28:43,198
SPEAKER_1:  Not a single person.

02:28:44,002 --> 02:28:45,054
SPEAKER_1:  in the average American.

02:28:45,794 --> 02:28:46,430
SPEAKER_1:  conjuring their head.

02:28:48,610 --> 02:28:49,758
SPEAKER_0:  If you apply...

02:28:50,402 --> 02:28:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  this to a very difficult topic of Israel and Palestine.

02:28:54,178 --> 02:28:55,774
SPEAKER_1:  Speaking of which, right?

02:28:56,322 --> 02:29:00,414
SPEAKER_0:  You have been critical of the policies of the state of Israel, but...

02:29:00,770 --> 02:29:04,350
SPEAKER_0:  as we've mentioned, very supportive of Jewish people.

02:29:04,738 --> 02:29:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  a lot of friends, rabbis and

02:29:07,330 --> 02:29:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:29:08,482 --> 02:29:11,518
SPEAKER_0:  Jews in general here in Dallas and across the world.

02:29:12,322 --> 02:29:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  What is the difference to you in that part of the world between politics and religion? Well, in this case,

02:29:19,234 --> 02:29:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  Zionism and Judaism, both terms broadly defined.

02:29:25,154 --> 02:29:26,983
SPEAKER_1:  Both terms broadly defined.

02:29:26,983 --> 02:29:28,958
SPEAKER_0:  I say that because those terms...

02:29:30,530 --> 02:29:33,214
SPEAKER_0:  There's technical definitions and there's other.

02:29:33,474 --> 02:29:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  popularly used and so you have to be kind of just like we said with Islamophobia

02:29:38,050 --> 02:29:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  These terms are...

02:29:39,458 --> 02:29:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  they become politicized.

02:29:41,922 --> 02:29:44,286
SPEAKER_0:  So just generally speaking, I think.

02:29:44,706 --> 02:29:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  Zionism.

02:29:46,690 --> 02:29:50,065
SPEAKER_0:  has to do with politics and Judaism.

02:29:50,065 --> 02:29:54,238
SPEAKER_1:  the best into it. Yeah. It's the great complexity like to a lot of people like, wait a minute.

02:29:54,818 --> 02:29:59,998
SPEAKER_1:  Right. And you got to take a step back and wonder why there are so many Zionist anti-Semites in America.

02:30:00,866 --> 02:30:01,214
SPEAKER_1:  Ha ha.

02:30:01,570 --> 02:30:02,494
SPEAKER_1:  and there are so many.

02:30:02,786 --> 02:30:04,894
SPEAKER_1:  anti-Zionists who are far from being.

02:30:05,378 --> 02:30:10,270
SPEAKER_1:  anti-Semites, anti-Zionism that are opposed to the ideology that are opposed to

02:30:10,594 --> 02:30:11,678
SPEAKER_1:  the implications of it.

02:30:12,706 --> 02:30:15,998
SPEAKER_1:  Look, I think that it's fundamentally secular.

02:30:16,226 --> 02:30:20,638
SPEAKER_1:  Um, when you think about it, there is an ethnosupremacism there is.

02:30:22,114 --> 02:30:23,422
SPEAKER_1:  I am the child of-

02:30:23,682 --> 02:30:24,030
SPEAKER_1:  of.

02:30:24,290 --> 02:30:26,686
SPEAKER_1:  Palestinians that were forcibly displaced.

02:30:27,234 --> 02:30:31,294
SPEAKER_1:  I've never been able to go to where my parents, my grandparents are from.

02:30:32,482 --> 02:30:40,318
SPEAKER_1:  I've never been able to see that land. I've never been able to access that. I have cousins that I'll never be. Well, I shouldn't say never. Insha'Allah, God willing, I will meet them.

02:30:40,930 --> 02:30:43,454
SPEAKER_1:  but that I've only been able to speak through a phone.

02:30:44,482 --> 02:30:45,822
SPEAKER_1:  FaceTime, Zoom.

02:30:48,162 --> 02:30:48,574
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:30:49,442 --> 02:30:50,270
SPEAKER_1:  I think that.

02:30:51,266 --> 02:30:53,694
SPEAKER_1:  It's important for us to separate.

02:30:54,338 --> 02:30:55,038
SPEAKER_1:  criticism.

02:30:55,362 --> 02:30:56,734
SPEAKER_1:  of Israel's policies.

02:30:57,666 --> 02:31:00,574
SPEAKER_1:  from antisemitism. In fact, it's an injustice.

02:31:02,402 --> 02:31:03,838
SPEAKER_1:  cheapens anti-Semitism.

02:31:04,322 --> 02:31:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  when you...

02:31:05,986 --> 02:31:06,910
SPEAKER_1:  Throw every.

02:31:07,202 --> 02:31:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  person.

02:31:08,130 --> 02:31:11,326
SPEAKER_1:  who is opposed to Zionism or opposed to Israel's policies.

02:31:11,714 --> 02:31:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  in the bucket of being anti-semites.

02:31:14,594 --> 02:31:17,150
SPEAKER_1:  It's wrong. It cheapens it. It doesn't.

02:31:17,506 --> 02:31:18,590
SPEAKER_1:  do justice to it.

02:31:19,426 --> 02:31:19,870
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:31:20,418 --> 02:31:23,358
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's important for us to have a meaningful conversation about.

02:31:24,162 --> 02:31:25,598
SPEAKER_1:  America's support for Israel.

02:31:26,178 --> 02:31:27,902
SPEAKER_1:  Listen, there are terms.

02:31:28,962 --> 02:31:31,710
SPEAKER_1:  that are important here. I'ma throw out these big terms, right?

02:31:32,002 --> 02:31:32,670
SPEAKER_1:  Apartheid.

02:31:33,378 --> 02:31:34,110
SPEAKER_1:  Occupation.

02:31:35,042 --> 02:31:35,422
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

02:31:35,682 --> 02:31:37,630
SPEAKER_1:  Ethnic cleansing. These are terms.

02:31:38,082 --> 02:31:39,518
SPEAKER_1:  that are legal terms.

02:31:40,482 --> 02:31:42,750
SPEAKER_1:  There are objective thresholds here.

02:31:43,938 --> 02:31:44,734
SPEAKER_1:  for apartheid.

02:31:45,090 --> 02:31:45,950
SPEAKER_1:  occupation.

02:31:46,498 --> 02:31:47,326
SPEAKER_1:  ethnic cleansing.

02:31:49,218 --> 02:31:50,814
SPEAKER_1:  The Threshold of Apartheid

02:31:51,138 --> 02:31:52,958
SPEAKER_1:  has been crossed according to

02:31:54,306 --> 02:32:01,118
SPEAKER_1:  multiple, the most respectable human rights organizations in the world. These are the organizations that you will champion and that you will use.

02:32:01,538 --> 02:32:05,182
SPEAKER_1:  and every single other conflict to justify your own policies.

02:32:05,794 --> 02:32:12,030
SPEAKER_1:  but that threshold of apartheid has been passed. According to Human Rights Watch, according to Amnesty International, according to the Harvard Law Review.

02:32:12,578 --> 02:32:16,318
SPEAKER_1:  The threshold of apartheid has been crossed. There's a legal terminology there.

02:32:16,578 --> 02:32:18,558
SPEAKER_1:  sets of laws for two separate people.

02:32:18,882 --> 02:32:20,606
SPEAKER_1:  you have a displaced people.

02:32:20,962 --> 02:32:22,206
SPEAKER_1:  that are forcibly

02:32:22,978 --> 02:32:25,854
SPEAKER_1:  being removed that are being treated differently that are.

02:32:26,114 --> 02:32:26,846
SPEAKER_1:  stateless.

02:32:27,426 --> 02:32:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  that are.

02:32:28,866 --> 02:32:30,174
SPEAKER_1:  uh, undergoing.

02:32:30,402 --> 02:32:31,646
SPEAKER_1:  daily humiliation.

02:32:32,002 --> 02:32:33,758
SPEAKER_1:  that live behind an apartheid wall.

02:32:34,146 --> 02:32:37,598
SPEAKER_1:  that live under a different set of policies that are routinely bombarded.

02:32:38,082 --> 02:32:45,086
SPEAKER_1:  that have lost their ability to free movement, that have lost their ability to access to basic necessities of human life.

02:32:45,570 --> 02:32:47,230
SPEAKER_1:  There are legal definitions here.

02:32:47,554 --> 02:32:57,854
SPEAKER_1:  I don't see how any objective human being can read those reports on apartheid and the threshold crossed for apartheid and walk away from that and say that this is just Jews and Muslims that don't like each other.

02:32:58,626 --> 02:33:00,862
SPEAKER_1:  There's a legal definition here, occupation.

02:33:02,818 --> 02:33:04,862
SPEAKER_1:  when Israel was created in 1948.

02:33:05,794 --> 02:33:09,854
SPEAKER_1:  you will find many Jews who are opposed to Zionism, and I think this is important.

02:33:10,594 --> 02:33:11,006
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

02:33:11,554 --> 02:33:14,750
SPEAKER_1:  to talk to Jews who are opposed to Zionism, and they are many.

02:33:15,458 --> 02:33:15,966
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

02:33:16,706 --> 02:33:20,574
SPEAKER_1:  that will say that we were told that it was a land without a people.

02:33:21,218 --> 02:33:22,654
SPEAKER_1:  for a people without a land.

02:33:23,266 --> 02:33:24,574
SPEAKER_1:  The problem with that was...

02:33:25,058 --> 02:33:26,366
SPEAKER_1:  There were people there.

02:33:26,786 --> 02:33:27,870
SPEAKER_1:  our ancestors.

02:33:28,226 --> 02:33:31,102
SPEAKER_1:  750,000 Palestinians expelled in the Nakba.

02:33:31,682 --> 02:33:32,894
SPEAKER_1:  and many Palestinians.

02:33:33,346 --> 02:33:35,166
SPEAKER_1:  that have been removed and harassed.

02:33:35,650 --> 02:33:36,318
SPEAKER_1:  End

02:33:36,642 --> 02:33:37,662
SPEAKER_1:  that are treated.

02:33:37,890 --> 02:33:44,254
SPEAKER_1:  in horrific ways and the occupation is expanding. It is an illegal occupation. Settlements are still expanding.

02:33:44,994 --> 02:33:46,078
SPEAKER_1:  and the United States.

02:33:46,626 --> 02:33:48,030
SPEAKER_1:  enables that occupation.

02:33:48,546 --> 02:33:49,310
SPEAKER_1:  with its funding.

02:33:49,858 --> 02:33:53,790
SPEAKER_1:  with its unconditional support, unwavering support of Israel.

02:33:54,626 --> 02:33:55,166
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:33:55,682 --> 02:33:56,702
SPEAKER_1:  It does so.

02:33:56,994 --> 02:33:59,262
SPEAKER_1:  in a way that completely undermines.

02:33:59,490 --> 02:34:00,510
SPEAKER_1:  any of its claims.

02:34:01,474 --> 02:34:03,326
SPEAKER_1:  being a beacon of freedom in the world.

02:34:03,906 --> 02:34:05,694
SPEAKER_1:  because it is in plain sight now.

02:34:06,274 --> 02:34:07,550
SPEAKER_1:  that the world can see.

02:34:07,906 --> 02:34:12,414
SPEAKER_1:  What is happening in Sheikh Jarrah? What is happening in Jerusalem? What is happening with these expanding settlements?

02:34:12,930 --> 02:34:16,734
SPEAKER_1:  everything that flies in the face of any claim to wanting a peaceful solution.

02:34:17,314 --> 02:34:19,838
SPEAKER_1:  children in Gaza when I talk about dehumanization.

02:34:20,354 --> 02:34:21,118
SPEAKER_1:  The children?

02:34:21,570 --> 02:34:24,318
SPEAKER_1:  that were on the face of the New York Times, which is historically.

02:34:24,642 --> 02:34:26,206
SPEAKER_1:  one of the most anti-Palestinian

02:34:26,498 --> 02:34:27,774
SPEAKER_1:  newspapers in America.

02:34:28,098 --> 02:34:29,822
SPEAKER_1:  the faces of the children of Gaza.

02:34:32,002 --> 02:34:32,670
SPEAKER_1:  America

02:34:33,314 --> 02:34:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  and many parts of the world are now seeing it.

02:34:36,866 --> 02:34:39,038
SPEAKER_1:  We have been saying for a very long time.

02:34:39,266 --> 02:34:44,830
SPEAKER_1:  This is apartheid. This is an occupation. This is an injustice. The world needs to check it, hold it accountable.

02:34:45,506 --> 02:34:46,398
SPEAKER_1:  South Africa.

02:34:46,882 --> 02:34:52,702
SPEAKER_1:  which experienced apartheid Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu, all of those that fought apartheid in South Africa.

02:34:53,026 --> 02:34:53,758
SPEAKER_1:  said that.

02:34:54,050 --> 02:34:56,190
SPEAKER_1:  Palestinians are living under apartheid.

02:34:56,546 --> 02:34:59,646
SPEAKER_1:  and that the same strategies that check the apartheid in South Africa.

02:34:59,906 --> 02:35:01,886
SPEAKER_1:  need to be used to hold Israel accountable.

02:35:02,338 --> 02:35:03,166
SPEAKER_1:  for apartheid.

02:35:03,586 --> 02:35:05,374
SPEAKER_1:  uh... with the palestinians

02:35:08,226 --> 02:35:09,886
SPEAKER_1:  It's impossible for us.

02:35:11,298 --> 02:35:12,350
SPEAKER_1:  as Palestinians.

02:35:13,282 --> 02:35:14,238
SPEAKER_1:  simply say

02:35:14,914 --> 02:35:15,454
SPEAKER_1:  that

02:35:15,906 --> 02:35:17,534
SPEAKER_1:  We should give up on this cause.

02:35:18,146 --> 02:35:20,222
SPEAKER_1:  because all the odds are stacked against us.

02:35:21,154 --> 02:35:22,078
SPEAKER_1:  But when you have...

02:35:22,626 --> 02:35:25,342
SPEAKER_1:  you know, videos coming out of the Israeli army.

02:35:25,858 --> 02:35:26,174
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

02:35:26,690 --> 02:35:28,222
SPEAKER_1:  spewing skunk water.

02:35:28,962 --> 02:35:29,758
SPEAKER_1:  skunk water.

02:35:30,050 --> 02:35:32,734
SPEAKER_1:  sewage water on worshippers leaving Al-Aqsa.

02:35:33,762 --> 02:35:34,142
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:35:35,394 --> 02:35:36,574
SPEAKER_1:  far-right leaders.

02:35:37,186 --> 02:35:38,622
SPEAKER_1:  Now taking the government.

02:35:39,298 --> 02:35:41,566
SPEAKER_1:  and the so-called only democracy in the Middle East.

02:35:41,922 --> 02:35:44,990
SPEAKER_1:  prohibiting a Palestinian flag being raised anywhere around.

02:35:45,858 --> 02:35:47,998
SPEAKER_1:  American reporter Serena Abouakla

02:35:49,218 --> 02:35:51,518
SPEAKER_1:  Palestinian American Christian Reporter.

02:35:52,162 --> 02:35:55,998
SPEAKER_1:  Palestinian-American Christian Reporter, one of the most prominent journalists in the Middle East.

02:35:56,834 --> 02:35:57,950
SPEAKER_1:  shot in the face.

02:35:58,626 --> 02:35:59,422
SPEAKER_1:  plain sight.

02:36:00,226 --> 02:36:03,134
SPEAKER_1:  and all America could say was, all the American government could say was

02:36:03,714 --> 02:36:04,702
SPEAKER_1:  If it turns out...

02:36:05,122 --> 02:36:06,494
SPEAKER_1:  that it's indeed Israel.

02:36:06,754 --> 02:36:09,566
SPEAKER_1:  that Israel is responsible for the death of an American journalist.

02:36:09,794 --> 02:36:11,454
SPEAKER_1:  then we will hold them accountable.

02:36:12,130 --> 02:36:12,766
SPEAKER_1:  Nothing.

02:36:14,882 --> 02:36:15,710
SPEAKER_1:  It was a shame.

02:36:16,546 --> 02:36:18,814
SPEAKER_1:  to see that happen and it just solidified.

02:36:19,042 --> 02:36:19,582
SPEAKER_1:  to us.

02:36:20,194 --> 02:36:22,078
SPEAKER_1:  that whether it's a democratic president.

02:36:22,594 --> 02:36:23,902
SPEAKER_1:  or a Republican president.

02:36:24,354 --> 02:36:26,878
SPEAKER_1:  Unfortunately, the support for Israel.

02:36:27,586 --> 02:36:28,926
SPEAKER_1:  is enabling it.

02:36:29,506 --> 02:36:30,718
SPEAKER_1:  to continue.

02:36:31,202 --> 02:36:33,662
SPEAKER_1:  to wipe out the Palestinian population.

02:36:34,466 --> 02:36:34,846
SPEAKER_1:  from.

02:36:35,362 --> 02:36:37,342
SPEAKER_1:  its historic lands. And so.

02:36:38,818 --> 02:36:41,566
SPEAKER_1:  We see that happening and I'll say this as well.

02:36:43,010 --> 02:36:44,798
SPEAKER_1:  People ask me about the Abraham Accords.

02:36:45,410 --> 02:36:46,366
SPEAKER_1:  I say, you know...

02:36:47,074 --> 02:36:47,870
SPEAKER_1:  You are.

02:36:48,738 --> 02:36:50,206
SPEAKER_1:  talking about faith between.

02:36:50,562 --> 02:36:56,766
SPEAKER_1:  Are you talking about peace between communities of faith and protecting communities of faith? Why are you opposed to the Abraham Accords? I think that the name of Abraham.

02:36:57,794 --> 02:37:04,350
SPEAKER_1:  should not be used and I wrote an article called Why I Opposed the Abraham Accords. The name of Abraham should not be used to justify arms deals.

02:37:04,898 --> 02:37:08,318
SPEAKER_1:  that only further disenfranchised the abused population of the Palestinians.

02:37:09,026 --> 02:37:09,406
SPEAKER_1:  where

02:37:09,730 --> 02:37:10,302
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

02:37:10,530 --> 02:37:11,006
SPEAKER_1:  You have.

02:37:11,298 --> 02:37:14,782
SPEAKER_1:  quote unquote, Muslim regimes making peace with Israel and that's being used.

02:37:15,170 --> 02:37:15,806
SPEAKER_1:  against.

02:37:16,290 --> 02:37:17,726
SPEAKER_1:  the Palestinian people who are.

02:37:18,210 --> 02:37:19,966
SPEAKER_1:  only further disenfranchised.

02:37:20,386 --> 02:37:22,014
SPEAKER_1:  from having a voice in their own fate.

02:37:23,426 --> 02:37:25,086
SPEAKER_1:  for the sake of American arms deals.

02:37:25,442 --> 02:37:26,398
SPEAKER_1:  and security.

02:37:26,626 --> 02:37:27,934
SPEAKER_1:  and economic benefits.

02:37:28,738 --> 02:37:30,622
SPEAKER_1:  It's despicable. It's repulsive.

02:37:31,298 --> 02:37:32,222
SPEAKER_1:  talk to the people.

02:37:32,866 --> 02:37:34,558
SPEAKER_1:  speak to people on the ground there.

02:37:34,946 --> 02:37:38,494
SPEAKER_1:  see what's happening with your own two eyes and think about the injustice where.

02:37:39,746 --> 02:37:42,430
SPEAKER_1:  our taxpayer dollars are being used.

02:37:43,138 --> 02:37:48,638
SPEAKER_1:  to suppress a people and what legally meets the definition by every objective standard of apartheid.

02:37:48,994 --> 02:37:49,886
SPEAKER_1:  of occupation.

02:37:50,306 --> 02:37:51,326
SPEAKER_1:  of ethnic cleansing.

02:37:51,682 --> 02:37:55,326
SPEAKER_1:  and it's ongoing and it's happening in real time and it's becoming more blatant.

02:37:56,482 --> 02:37:56,990
SPEAKER_1:  with.

02:37:57,826 --> 02:38:00,830
SPEAKER_1:  a redeem now that's unapologetic of even expressing.

02:38:01,794 --> 02:38:03,166
SPEAKER_1:  what the policies.

02:38:03,618 --> 02:38:04,510
SPEAKER_1:  have already done.

02:38:05,346 --> 02:38:07,294
SPEAKER_1:  And that is the removal of a people.

02:38:07,810 --> 02:38:10,014
SPEAKER_1:  forcible removal of a people because

02:38:11,138 --> 02:38:14,494
SPEAKER_1:  The government knows that the United States support is unconditional.

02:38:15,554 --> 02:38:16,126
SPEAKER_1:  I hope you have hope.

02:38:16,418 --> 02:38:20,094
SPEAKER_0:  that Jews, Muslims and Christians on this land will.

02:38:20,994 --> 02:38:22,110
SPEAKER_0:  Live in peace one day.

02:38:22,562 --> 02:38:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  together.

02:38:23,778 --> 02:38:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  basic respect for each other's humanity.

02:38:27,970 --> 02:38:28,318
SPEAKER_1:  Look.

02:38:30,306 --> 02:38:31,710
SPEAKER_1:  This isn't a religious conflict.

02:38:32,002 --> 02:38:32,638
SPEAKER_1:  I think that's.

02:38:32,898 --> 02:38:34,718
SPEAKER_1:  fundamentally one of the problems.

02:38:35,042 --> 02:38:36,167
SPEAKER_1:  So even the question is...

02:38:36,167 --> 02:38:36,917
SPEAKER_0:  not the correct question.

02:38:36,917 --> 02:38:39,262
SPEAKER_1:  It's not the correct question. This videos may have gotten your returns for ios black shoots or fly out of the pan...

02:38:39,682 --> 02:38:43,806
SPEAKER_1:  Not a religious conflict. Yes, religion is invoked. Yes, there.

02:38:44,066 --> 02:38:45,406
SPEAKER_1:  there are religious elements.

02:38:46,338 --> 02:38:46,750
SPEAKER_1:  but

02:38:48,482 --> 02:38:49,630
SPEAKER_1:  There are many dues.

02:38:50,722 --> 02:38:51,710
SPEAKER_1:  that are opposed.

02:38:52,322 --> 02:38:55,358
SPEAKER_1:  to what is happening right now towards the Palestinians, many.

02:38:55,970 --> 02:38:56,702
SPEAKER_1:  recommend.

02:38:57,666 --> 02:39:02,910
SPEAKER_1:  you know, serious discussion with even people whose perspectives have grown. Peter Beinert being an example.

02:39:03,746 --> 02:39:06,110
SPEAKER_1:  Rabbi Simone Zimmerman.

02:39:06,338 --> 02:39:07,454
SPEAKER_1:  started if not now.

02:39:08,194 --> 02:39:09,054
SPEAKER_1:  Beta Slim.

02:39:09,378 --> 02:39:15,646
SPEAKER_1:  an Israeli human rights organization that also classed it as apartheid recently. There are many Jews that are opposed to what is happening right now.

02:39:16,514 --> 02:39:20,574
SPEAKER_1:  Palestinians are also not exclusively a Muslim population. Sharia number, I thought it was Christian.

02:39:21,250 --> 02:39:23,070
SPEAKER_1:  there are many Palestinian Christians.

02:39:23,970 --> 02:39:28,222
SPEAKER_1:  that are also being denied entry into their historic churches and that are completely

02:39:28,770 --> 02:39:29,566
SPEAKER_1:  bewildered.

02:39:30,210 --> 02:39:30,942
SPEAKER_1:  or or

02:39:31,458 --> 02:39:34,238
SPEAKER_1:  uh, absolutely lost in regards to why.

02:39:35,522 --> 02:39:39,454
SPEAKER_1:  American evangelicals have this ironclad support for.

02:39:39,874 --> 02:39:43,038
SPEAKER_1:  the occupation and have ignored the plight of Palestinian Christians.

02:39:44,226 --> 02:39:46,974
SPEAKER_1:  Of course, I believe Muslims, Christians and Jews can coexist.

02:39:47,682 --> 02:39:48,062
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

02:39:49,314 --> 02:39:50,430
SPEAKER_1:  Of course I have hope.

02:39:50,850 --> 02:39:52,702
SPEAKER_1:  because I have to have hope as a person of faith.

02:39:53,794 --> 02:39:55,326
SPEAKER_1:  but as much hope as I have.

02:39:55,714 --> 02:39:58,910
SPEAKER_1:  I think there's a great sense of urgency for people to open their eyes.

02:39:59,650 --> 02:40:03,518
SPEAKER_1:  Learn what's actually happening on the ground. Read the reports.

02:40:04,418 --> 02:40:05,918
SPEAKER_1:  Stop letting these.

02:40:06,178 --> 02:40:09,790
SPEAKER_1:  commentators and these companies that.

02:40:10,594 --> 02:40:12,542
SPEAKER_1:  are able to generate propaganda.

02:40:13,058 --> 02:40:14,366
SPEAKER_1:  own the narrative.

02:40:14,914 --> 02:40:18,078
SPEAKER_1:  There are objective standards here. There are objective standards here.

02:40:18,306 --> 02:40:19,006
SPEAKER_1:  Measures.

02:40:19,330 --> 02:40:20,062
SPEAKER_1:  of oppression.

02:40:20,482 --> 02:40:21,726
SPEAKER_1:  that need to be considered here.

02:40:22,050 --> 02:40:23,262
SPEAKER_1:  What's happening to Gaza?

02:40:24,002 --> 02:40:25,502
SPEAKER_1:  is one of the greatest atrocities.

02:40:25,890 --> 02:40:26,590
SPEAKER_1:  of our time.

02:40:27,362 --> 02:40:28,062
SPEAKER_1:  Learn about it.

02:40:28,354 --> 02:40:29,854
SPEAKER_1:  I'd tell people to just watch.

02:40:30,114 --> 02:40:33,790
SPEAKER_1:  The Vice documentaries, for example, the mini documentaries, I'd sent them to you as well.

02:40:34,114 --> 02:40:35,806
SPEAKER_1:  inside the battle for Jerusalem. I mean

02:40:36,322 --> 02:40:38,558
SPEAKER_1:  Think about it, a guy from Long Island, New York.

02:40:39,522 --> 02:40:40,190
SPEAKER_1:  can fly.

02:40:40,706 --> 02:40:41,374
SPEAKER_1:  to Israel.

02:40:42,498 --> 02:40:42,846
SPEAKER_1:  Right?

02:40:43,810 --> 02:40:44,862
SPEAKER_1:  flying to Tel Aviv.

02:40:45,666 --> 02:40:53,278
SPEAKER_1:  and walk into a home that's been occupied by families for generations and throw the people out under the full protection of the military there.

02:40:53,858 --> 02:40:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  and spit on them.

02:40:55,458 --> 02:40:56,478
SPEAKER_1:  historic homes.

02:40:57,506 --> 02:41:00,734
SPEAKER_1:  And when people come up to me and say we're opposed to Islamophobia.

02:41:01,378 --> 02:41:03,614
SPEAKER_1:  We're opposed to Islamophobia, but they support that.

02:41:04,898 --> 02:41:08,350
SPEAKER_1:  you're not opposed to Islamophobia. How can you be opposed to Islamophobia when you...

02:41:09,154 --> 02:41:11,038
SPEAKER_1:  traffic in the same framings.

02:41:11,554 --> 02:41:12,126
SPEAKER_1:  end.

02:41:12,706 --> 02:41:14,142
SPEAKER_1:  dehumanization.

02:41:15,682 --> 02:41:16,030
SPEAKER_1:  dot.

02:41:16,418 --> 02:41:20,478
SPEAKER_1:  enables the viciousness towards Muslims here and Palestinians over there.

02:41:20,834 --> 02:41:22,078
SPEAKER_1:  they do not deserve.

02:41:22,530 --> 02:41:25,438
SPEAKER_1:  to be treated like equal human beings, like full human beings.

02:41:25,986 --> 02:41:29,534
SPEAKER_1:  and that based on historic claims, a guy can fly from New York.

02:41:30,082 --> 02:41:32,030
SPEAKER_1:  into a historic neighborhood in Jerusalem.

02:41:32,610 --> 02:41:34,430
SPEAKER_1:  and kick out generational families.

02:41:34,914 --> 02:41:37,630
SPEAKER_1:  with military guns next to them. What does that sound like? How's that?

02:41:38,082 --> 02:41:38,846
SPEAKER_1:  How's that normal?

02:41:39,138 --> 02:41:40,958
SPEAKER_1:  Right. And so I think that if people

02:41:41,282 --> 02:41:42,526
SPEAKER_1:  take the time to read.

02:41:42,786 --> 02:41:44,510
SPEAKER_1:  People take the time to investigate.

02:41:45,442 --> 02:41:45,886
SPEAKER_1:  Then

02:41:46,274 --> 02:41:47,742
SPEAKER_1:  They come to this conclusion.

02:41:48,130 --> 02:41:49,982
SPEAKER_1:  themselves that this is unacceptable.

02:41:50,722 --> 02:41:51,710
SPEAKER_1:  and that you can't put...

02:41:52,002 --> 02:41:55,518
SPEAKER_1:  And this is one of the problems with the framing of Israel-Palestine.

02:41:56,098 --> 02:41:58,430
SPEAKER_1:  is that you're equating occupier and occupied.

02:41:58,754 --> 02:42:01,694
SPEAKER_1:  You're equating the two sides of the conflict.

02:42:01,986 --> 02:42:04,286
SPEAKER_1:  And it's not a conflict, it's an occupation.

02:42:04,610 --> 02:42:06,910
SPEAKER_1:  There is such a disparity of power here.

02:42:07,810 --> 02:42:09,662
SPEAKER_1:  that you cannot equate the two sides.

02:42:10,402 --> 02:42:11,582
SPEAKER_1:  how you know you can.

02:42:11,938 --> 02:42:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  You know, Malcolm X would say you clip the bird's wing and then blame it for not flying as high as you do.

02:42:17,442 --> 02:42:20,414
SPEAKER_1:  You can't do that to a people and just equate them.

02:42:21,122 --> 02:42:22,302
SPEAKER_1:  with their occupier.

02:42:22,754 --> 02:42:23,166
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

02:42:23,458 --> 02:42:26,046
SPEAKER_1:  It's an atrocity. It requires us to challenge it.

02:42:26,466 --> 02:42:26,782
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:42:27,042 --> 02:42:27,486
SPEAKER_1:  I am-

02:42:28,098 --> 02:42:28,734
SPEAKER_1:  hopeful.

02:42:29,794 --> 02:42:33,534
SPEAKER_1:  current movement of Muslims, Christians and Jews and people of all faiths.

02:42:33,986 --> 02:42:35,198
SPEAKER_1:  that are saying enough is enough.

02:42:35,874 --> 02:42:37,182
SPEAKER_1:  Thresholds have been crossed here.

02:42:37,730 --> 02:42:40,318
SPEAKER_1:  that this is an atrocity that cannot continue.

02:42:40,930 --> 02:42:41,246
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

02:42:43,490 --> 02:42:47,518
SPEAKER_1:  This is very personal to me because this is happening now.

02:42:49,058 --> 02:42:54,622
SPEAKER_1:  What I anticipate, and this is what America did, this is what Nelson Mandela actually predicted with the United States.

02:42:55,106 --> 02:42:56,318
SPEAKER_1:  What I anticipate is that.

02:42:56,738 --> 02:42:58,302
SPEAKER_1:  10 years from now, 20 years from now.

02:42:58,786 --> 02:43:01,438
SPEAKER_1:  Every American will say, how could we have supported this?

02:43:02,210 --> 02:43:03,102
SPEAKER_1:  And this was terrible.

02:43:03,586 --> 02:43:04,382
SPEAKER_1:  and we'll pay.

02:43:04,610 --> 02:43:05,470
SPEAKER_1:  symbolic.

02:43:06,082 --> 02:43:08,542
SPEAKER_1:  you know, homage to the Palestinian cause.

02:43:10,050 --> 02:43:11,262
SPEAKER_1:  But there are people now.

02:43:11,618 --> 02:43:13,374
SPEAKER_1:  that are clinging on for dear life.

02:43:14,370 --> 02:43:16,286
SPEAKER_1:  Access to their places of worship.

02:43:16,706 --> 02:43:18,462
SPEAKER_1:  access to their generational homes.

02:43:19,298 --> 02:43:22,142
SPEAKER_1:  Right now, there are children that are in detention.

02:43:22,498 --> 02:43:23,870
SPEAKER_1:  and there's a bill in Congress.

02:43:24,322 --> 02:43:25,534
SPEAKER_1:  to just stop, I mean.

02:43:26,818 --> 02:43:28,414
SPEAKER_1:  Wherever you stand on this issue.

02:43:29,090 --> 02:43:30,174
SPEAKER_1:  child detainment.

02:43:31,042 --> 02:43:32,670
SPEAKER_1:  Tile detainment, tile detention.

02:43:33,378 --> 02:43:34,622
SPEAKER_1:  should be a red line, right?

02:43:35,362 --> 02:43:40,254
SPEAKER_1:  Congresswoman Betty McCollum has put this bill on the floor of Congress. She can't even get that passed.

02:43:40,642 --> 02:43:42,782
SPEAKER_1:  All right, just to at least censure.

02:43:43,426 --> 02:43:44,798
SPEAKER_1:  child detainment.

02:43:45,410 --> 02:43:46,814
SPEAKER_1:  by the idea.

02:43:47,810 --> 02:43:48,158
SPEAKER_1:  So.

02:43:49,410 --> 02:43:51,326
SPEAKER_1:  People need to look into this deeper.

02:43:51,778 --> 02:43:52,606
SPEAKER_1:  They need to.

02:43:53,250 --> 02:43:53,694
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

02:43:53,954 --> 02:43:55,678
SPEAKER_1:  Consider the human element of this.

02:43:56,546 --> 02:43:57,086
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:43:57,634 --> 02:44:02,142
SPEAKER_1:  consider the urgency of it as well with this new, with this new regime, it's only going to unfortunately get.

02:44:02,370 --> 02:44:05,278
SPEAKER_1:  get much worse in the immediate term and so we have to do something about it.

02:44:06,466 --> 02:44:09,022
SPEAKER_0:  If I may ask you for some advice.

02:44:09,314 --> 02:44:10,046
SPEAKER_0:  for a reason not.

02:44:10,338 --> 02:44:12,190
SPEAKER_0:  I'll explain maybe in a little bit.

02:44:12,738 --> 02:44:15,998
SPEAKER_0:  uh... maybe i should just explain now which is i think

02:44:17,442 --> 02:44:21,182
SPEAKER_0:  because you've talked about Islamophobia, because you've been at the center of Islamophobia,

02:44:22,050 --> 02:44:25,982
SPEAKER_0:  so many catastrophic events because you sort of jump into the fire.

02:44:26,338 --> 02:44:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  uh, to try to help people.

02:44:28,834 --> 02:44:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  You've been attacked a lot.

02:44:30,658 --> 02:44:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  Just in general, you've been under stress. It's just...

02:44:33,506 --> 02:44:36,414
SPEAKER_0:  You're not immune to stress. So I'll just read some of the comments.

02:44:36,770 --> 02:44:38,014
SPEAKER_0:  Part of me wants to ask.

02:44:40,226 --> 02:44:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  just how psychologically difficult it's been and where you draw strength.

02:44:44,898 --> 02:44:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  And would you advise?

02:44:47,458 --> 02:44:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  If the opportunity is there.

02:44:49,666 --> 02:44:50,846
SPEAKER_0:  for a person like me.

02:44:51,298 --> 02:44:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  for silly kid in a suit.

02:44:53,890 --> 02:44:57,342
SPEAKER_0:  to go to that part of the world and take seriously conversations.

02:44:57,826 --> 02:45:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  I would divide it into two categories. There's leaders and there's people.

02:45:02,402 --> 02:45:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  The leaders are sort of these.

02:45:05,250 --> 02:45:05,886
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:45:06,178 --> 02:45:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  political entities that have their interests, they also have power.

02:45:10,402 --> 02:45:11,934
SPEAKER_0:  and they want to hold on to power.

02:45:12,514 --> 02:45:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  and then people are just...

02:45:14,658 --> 02:45:16,126
SPEAKER_0:  regular people that have.

02:45:16,354 --> 02:45:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  families that just want to

02:45:19,042 --> 02:45:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  Um

02:45:20,322 --> 02:45:25,310
SPEAKER_0:  have basic rights and freedoms and continue to love their families and practice, and pursues

02:45:25,602 --> 02:45:32,094
SPEAKER_0:  jobs and careers and lives that they can flourish and so on. Those are very kind of different dynamics of play.

02:45:32,610 --> 02:45:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  and if given the opportunity to speak to leaders for me.

02:45:37,474 --> 02:45:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  Would you advise I do it or not?

02:45:39,554 --> 02:45:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  or not, and when I say leaders, I mean...

02:45:42,306 --> 02:45:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  leaders that

02:45:44,258 --> 02:45:45,630
SPEAKER_0:  would make the case.

02:45:46,786 --> 02:45:48,222
SPEAKER_0:  pro-Zionist case?

02:45:49,538 --> 02:45:54,046
SPEAKER_0:  and the anti-Zinus case. And in both cases, I would...

02:45:54,594 --> 02:45:57,982
SPEAKER_0:  make it a very challenging conversations for both of them. unlike today.

02:45:58,530 --> 02:46:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  Our conversation today, you're an inspiring, incredible person.

02:46:02,402 --> 02:46:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  I'm a huge fan of yours.

02:46:03,906 --> 02:46:07,358
SPEAKER_0:  You spread so much love to the Muslim community here.

02:46:07,618 --> 02:46:09,630
SPEAKER_0:  to the Jewish community, just everybody loves you.

02:46:09,890 --> 02:46:11,166
SPEAKER_1:  but not everybody.

02:46:11,426 --> 02:46:18,110
SPEAKER_1:  None. Yes, that's true. Not everybody. That's true. But a lot of people love you.

02:46:18,242 --> 02:46:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, but this was kind of inspiring and a positive conversation. Wasn't very challenging.

02:46:24,898 --> 02:46:25,694
SPEAKER_0:  Now although we did

02:46:25,954 --> 02:46:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  tough, touch, challenging topics and he did exceptionally well there. But I would do very challenging conversation with those leaders in that part of the world.

02:46:33,378 --> 02:46:34,526
SPEAKER_0:  Is that a bad idea?

02:46:35,842 --> 02:46:38,494
SPEAKER_1:  All right, well, let me tell you from now, first and foremost.

02:46:38,818 --> 02:46:41,022
SPEAKER_1:  the first part because I don't want to lose the first part of your

02:46:41,346 --> 02:46:42,654
SPEAKER_1:  your conversation. Is it?

02:46:42,946 --> 02:46:43,998
SPEAKER_1:  psychologically.

02:46:44,418 --> 02:46:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  stressful.

02:46:45,314 --> 02:46:45,758
SPEAKER_1:  Very.

02:46:46,338 --> 02:46:46,750
SPEAKER_1:  Very.

02:46:47,490 --> 02:46:47,934
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:46:50,690 --> 02:46:51,198
SPEAKER_1:  But when you're

02:46:54,146 --> 02:46:55,326
SPEAKER_1:  when you're a person of faith.

02:46:56,066 --> 02:46:57,822
SPEAKER_1:  And you believe that.

02:47:00,258 --> 02:47:01,726
SPEAKER_1:  Good work will always be rewarded.

02:47:02,594 --> 02:47:05,022
SPEAKER_1:  And that doing the right thing will always be rewarded eventually.

02:47:05,730 --> 02:47:07,038
SPEAKER_1:  you're able to.

02:47:07,586 --> 02:47:08,094
SPEAKER_1:  weather.

02:47:08,386 --> 02:47:09,086
SPEAKER_1:  That storm.

02:47:09,506 --> 02:47:09,950
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:47:11,266 --> 02:47:11,678
SPEAKER_1:  quite a bit.

02:47:12,770 --> 02:47:13,886
SPEAKER_1:  So your wife told you.

02:47:14,306 --> 02:47:19,518
SPEAKER_1:  Well, that's the second thing. Okay. Right. That's the second thing I was going to mention is honestly supportive.

02:47:19,842 --> 02:47:22,270
SPEAKER_1:  supportive family. You know, my dad's 80 men.

02:47:22,498 --> 02:47:29,086
SPEAKER_1:  And he's been through a lot. He was born in 1943 before his five years before Israel was even created. He was born in Palestine.

02:47:29,826 --> 02:47:31,966
SPEAKER_1:  He's suffered displacement. He has.

02:47:32,194 --> 02:47:35,582
SPEAKER_1:  been around the world and somehow built himself up to be.

02:47:36,194 --> 02:47:39,934
SPEAKER_1:  a distinguished professor of chemistry, an author and inventor.

02:47:40,610 --> 02:47:41,054
SPEAKER_1:  um...

02:47:41,666 --> 02:47:42,494
SPEAKER_1:  you know, grew up.

02:47:42,946 --> 02:47:46,814
SPEAKER_1:  uh, taking on some of the most difficult challenges and was just always a man of.

02:47:47,042 --> 02:47:53,758
SPEAKER_1:  I always admired my dad being a man of principle. And like, he just tells me, man, stay the course, stay the course, stay the course, don't be afraid, don't back down.

02:47:54,530 --> 02:47:57,502
SPEAKER_1:  I have a supportive family. I have a supportive wife. I've got supportive kids.

02:47:57,794 --> 02:47:59,166
SPEAKER_1:  So I have amazing people around me.

02:47:59,714 --> 02:48:01,214
SPEAKER_1:  that keep me grounded for sure.

02:48:01,634 --> 02:48:02,046
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:48:02,498 --> 02:48:03,902
SPEAKER_1:  Ultimately, obviously, faith.

02:48:04,994 --> 02:48:07,454
SPEAKER_1:  And also I'll say this slander doesn't stand.

02:48:08,002 --> 02:48:08,766
SPEAKER_1:  What do you mean by that?

02:48:09,314 --> 02:48:13,470
SPEAKER_1:  when people slander you and it kind of comes with the territory of a public mirror.

02:48:14,242 --> 02:48:15,550
SPEAKER_1:  It's not going to stand.

02:48:15,842 --> 02:48:19,006
SPEAKER_1:  throughout time because eventually any sincere person will find the truth.

02:48:19,682 --> 02:48:24,894
SPEAKER_1:  And the only people that will regurgitate that will continue to do so. So when I get portrayed as.

02:48:25,666 --> 02:48:26,718
SPEAKER_1:  and antisemite.

02:48:27,106 --> 02:48:27,486
SPEAKER_1:  um...

02:48:28,770 --> 02:48:33,566
SPEAKER_1:  because of my strong takes on Israel and challenging Israel. And I will continue to do so.

02:48:34,690 --> 02:48:35,710
SPEAKER_1:  It takes just.

02:48:36,226 --> 02:48:38,302
SPEAKER_1:  people in Dallas, like we know him, what are you talking about?

02:48:38,850 --> 02:48:39,646
SPEAKER_1:  You know?

02:48:39,906 --> 02:48:42,782
SPEAKER_1:  So slander doesn't stand at least with the people that are important to you.

02:48:43,010 --> 02:48:46,910
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, it might reside on the internet. It might have great rankings and.

02:48:47,394 --> 02:48:49,406
SPEAKER_1:  social media bots that give attraction.

02:48:49,826 --> 02:48:52,451
SPEAKER_0:  but is that psychologically difficult to you to have that?

02:48:52,451 --> 02:48:53,790
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, it is difficult.

02:48:54,018 --> 02:48:56,638
SPEAKER_1:  It's very difficult and it's hurtful.

02:48:56,866 --> 02:48:59,390
SPEAKER_1:  especially when it comes from quarters that you.

02:48:59,906 --> 02:49:01,246
SPEAKER_1:  would hope that it doesn't come from.

02:49:03,170 --> 02:49:04,926
SPEAKER_1:  You know, you take a step back, you.

02:49:06,242 --> 02:49:07,198
SPEAKER_1:  Re-evaluate.

02:49:07,810 --> 02:49:11,550
SPEAKER_1:  You lean into your faith and you lean on the people that are closest to you and then you keep going.

02:49:12,386 --> 02:49:13,662
SPEAKER_1:  You learned the lessons.

02:49:13,922 --> 02:49:20,286
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, could I be doing something better? Could I be doing something different? Could I be saying something better? Could I be saying something different?

02:49:20,962 --> 02:49:29,438
SPEAKER_1:  are the noble causes that I want to achieve? Am I, am I doing justice by those causes? Uh, how do I grow out of this? Right. You become wiser.

02:49:29,986 --> 02:49:31,102
SPEAKER_1:  through these things as well.

02:49:32,258 --> 02:49:34,814
SPEAKER_1:  The second part of your question though about what you should do.

02:49:35,394 --> 02:49:37,374
SPEAKER_1:  If you're going to talk to people, talk to people.

02:49:38,242 --> 02:49:40,990
SPEAKER_1:  from a place of inquiry, I would say talk to people.

02:49:41,506 --> 02:49:42,654
SPEAKER_1:  more so than leaders.

02:49:42,914 --> 02:49:49,086
SPEAKER_1:  And especially some of those who have been erased from the media commentary. Benjamin Netanyahu gets a lot of airtime.

02:49:49,826 --> 02:49:53,086
SPEAKER_1:  uh... you know here in the united states uh... he's

02:49:53,314 --> 02:49:53,854
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

02:49:54,722 --> 02:49:55,678
SPEAKER_1:  Well spoken.

02:49:55,906 --> 02:49:58,366
SPEAKER_1:  You know, he speaks perfect English, he's an American as well.

02:49:59,106 --> 02:49:59,582
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:50:00,034 --> 02:50:00,990
SPEAKER_1:  I would challenge him.

02:50:01,250 --> 02:50:04,766
SPEAKER_1:  you know, on, on, on some of the things that he has said and done.

02:50:05,410 --> 02:50:08,414
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, he has an ongoing corruption case. I think that.

02:50:08,674 --> 02:50:16,318
SPEAKER_1:  Um, I think he's a fascist. I think that he's a, uh, a person who has done much evil. I think that he has a lot of blood on his hands. And I think that.

02:50:16,770 --> 02:50:18,910
SPEAKER_1:  One day he will be prosecuted for that.

02:50:19,810 --> 02:50:21,694
SPEAKER_1:  But I'd say talk to people on the ground.

02:50:22,690 --> 02:50:30,206
SPEAKER_1:  and people that have been erased, talk to the families that are being displaced. I don't care about the political leadership. I'd much rather you talk to the people.

02:50:30,434 --> 02:50:32,062
SPEAKER_1:  on the ground in East Jerusalem.

02:50:32,514 --> 02:50:33,470
SPEAKER_1:  that have been displaced.

02:50:33,986 --> 02:50:34,366
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:50:34,594 --> 02:50:41,182
SPEAKER_1:  the families, talk to Palestinian Christians, talk to the sister of Shalina Abu Akla, Lina Abu Akla who has been.

02:50:41,634 --> 02:50:42,046
SPEAKER_1:  Who was.

02:50:42,402 --> 02:50:43,230
SPEAKER_1:  extremely.

02:50:43,586 --> 02:50:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  disappointed and let down.

02:50:45,442 --> 02:50:46,270
SPEAKER_1:  on Joe Biden.

02:50:46,722 --> 02:50:47,358
SPEAKER_1:  went to.

02:50:47,874 --> 02:50:48,414
SPEAKER_1:  the region.

02:50:48,706 --> 02:50:54,110
SPEAKER_1:  and did not take her calls, did not meet her, which was an absolutely disgraceful move. He should have met with her.

02:50:54,786 --> 02:50:58,110
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, she's the sister of an American journalist who was murdered in cold blood.

02:50:58,594 --> 02:51:01,566
SPEAKER_1:  Talk to Lena Abouakla, talk to Mitri Rahib.

02:51:01,890 --> 02:51:04,830
SPEAKER_1:  Mithri, interesting person for example, is a Lutheran.

02:51:05,474 --> 02:51:07,262
SPEAKER_1:  ahead of the Lutheran Church in Palestine.

02:51:07,906 --> 02:51:11,358
SPEAKER_1:  He comes to Dallas sometimes and talks about the plight of Palestinian Christians.

02:51:12,098 --> 02:51:14,398
SPEAKER_1:  I think if you're talking to people in leadership.

02:51:15,010 --> 02:51:16,254
SPEAKER_1:  You know, obviously...

02:51:16,514 --> 02:51:22,366
SPEAKER_1:  There are some that will be able to represent themselves in English. You know, Hanan Ashrawi is a very eloquent person, for example.

02:51:23,074 --> 02:51:32,071
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if you're going to have any luck getting into Gaza, but I'll pray for you if you do. But obviously, you know, if you want to talk to everybody, you got to talk to everybody, man. So I don't know, butessa.

02:51:32,071 --> 02:51:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  say this very important way to say

02:51:34,178 --> 02:51:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  whitewashing because I've heard this a lot so also Ukraine and Russia

02:51:38,498 --> 02:51:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  There's an interesting line between weight washing.

02:51:41,794 --> 02:51:43,806
SPEAKER_0:  which is something you definitely should not do.

02:51:44,482 --> 02:51:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:51:45,218 --> 02:51:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  a deep empathy.

02:51:48,738 --> 02:51:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  for

02:51:50,370 --> 02:51:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  a large number of human beings.

02:51:52,770 --> 02:51:57,758
SPEAKER_0:  It's a really tricky line to walk. And I also disagree with you about, well, I think-

02:51:58,370 --> 02:51:59,710
SPEAKER_0:  and an officer disagreement.

02:52:00,898 --> 02:52:07,262
SPEAKER_0:  I think I disagree about leaders. I think I agree 100% that the most important people are the people on the ground. OK.

02:52:07,650 --> 02:52:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  But...

02:52:09,026 --> 02:52:11,934
SPEAKER_0:  I think those are extremely important people to understand.

02:52:12,482 --> 02:52:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  not just as leaders but as human beings too.

02:52:16,002 --> 02:52:19,294
SPEAKER_0:  and in many cases to have a challenging conversation.

02:52:19,746 --> 02:52:21,438
SPEAKER_0:  but from a place of empathy.

02:52:21,858 --> 02:52:22,983
SPEAKER_0:  from understanding human.

02:52:22,983 --> 02:52:23,390
SPEAKER_1:  of being.

02:52:24,034 --> 02:52:25,854
SPEAKER_1:  So if you plan to talk to right wing.

02:52:26,658 --> 02:52:28,254
SPEAKER_1:  the current leadership of Israel.

02:52:29,026 --> 02:52:30,750
SPEAKER_1:  my only request to you.

02:52:31,778 --> 02:52:32,254
SPEAKER_1:  is

02:52:32,482 --> 02:52:34,814
SPEAKER_1:  talk to the victims themselves.

02:52:35,234 --> 02:52:43,006
SPEAKER_1:  Not the Palestinian authority talks to the victim. I know you want to write. So I, and I appreciate them. Talk to the victims themselves. Talk to those people that are being.

02:52:43,554 --> 02:52:44,606
SPEAKER_1:  thrown out of their homes.

02:52:45,026 --> 02:52:48,222
SPEAKER_1:  and subjected to the daily humiliation, go to a checkpoint.

02:52:48,578 --> 02:52:52,350
SPEAKER_1:  and walk through the checkpoint the way that a Palestinian walks through a checkpoint and tell me that's not apartheid.

02:52:52,834 --> 02:52:53,854
SPEAKER_1:  Walk through that checkpoint.

02:52:54,498 --> 02:52:56,830
SPEAKER_1:  crammed in in cages and tell me it's not apartheid.

02:52:57,442 --> 02:52:57,758
SPEAKER_1:  So.

02:52:58,018 --> 02:53:02,398
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, I think you're a very sincere person. Uh, I think you're gonna, you're gonna do your best.

02:53:03,042 --> 02:53:05,667
SPEAKER_1:  I'll be praying for you.

02:53:05,667 --> 02:53:09,417
SPEAKER_0:  harder than others, but yes, I feel like we're in the middle of a negotiation.

02:53:09,417 --> 02:53:11,902
SPEAKER_1:  and we've come to a point where we're both agree.

02:53:12,290 --> 02:53:14,526
SPEAKER_1:  Everyone deserves to be everyone.

02:53:14,786 --> 02:53:20,574
SPEAKER_1:  Not everyone deserves to be, but I think there's a great value and benefit. Let me say I agree with you in hearing.

02:53:21,058 --> 02:53:21,918
SPEAKER_1:  people even.

02:53:22,530 --> 02:53:23,710
SPEAKER_1:  uh, tyrants.

02:53:24,290 --> 02:53:25,438
SPEAKER_1:  um hearing them.

02:53:25,954 --> 02:53:29,214
SPEAKER_1:  so that you can properly deconstruct and decipher what you're hearing.

02:53:29,890 --> 02:53:37,022
SPEAKER_1:  But just think of the voices that don't get heard. And a lot of times what's been done to the Muslim world is, and what's being done right now in the name of the Abraham Accords.

02:53:37,474 --> 02:53:38,750
SPEAKER_1:  What's wrong with the Palestinians?

02:53:39,490 --> 02:53:41,118
SPEAKER_1:  The other Arabs are making peace with them.

02:53:41,762 --> 02:53:47,230
SPEAKER_1:  Let me tell you something, those regimes that are signing on to the Abraham Accords, the people are not happy, but they're terrified.

02:53:48,002 --> 02:53:49,598
SPEAKER_1:  of challenging those regimes.

02:53:49,826 --> 02:53:54,366
SPEAKER_1:  So if you go talk to the leaders of some of these countries that have signed on to the Abraham Accords,

02:53:55,234 --> 02:53:56,222
SPEAKER_1:  and that are, you know.

02:53:56,482 --> 02:53:57,758
SPEAKER_1:  in some twisted way.

02:53:58,466 --> 02:53:58,782
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

02:53:59,202 --> 02:54:01,566
SPEAKER_1:  making this about religion and peace.

02:54:02,210 --> 02:54:02,622
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

02:54:03,618 --> 02:54:04,926

02:54:05,410 --> 02:54:06,046
SPEAKER_1:  Skew.

02:54:06,946 --> 02:54:07,902
SPEAKER_1:  the narrative.

02:54:08,738 --> 02:54:13,022
SPEAKER_1:  to where Palestinians are just an inherently disagreeable people that don't want peace.

02:54:13,762 --> 02:54:15,198
SPEAKER_1:  They just want to live in their homes.

02:54:15,874 --> 02:54:18,910
SPEAKER_1:  They just want to live as full, equal human beings.

02:54:19,586 --> 02:54:21,790
SPEAKER_1:  They want the things that everybody wants.

02:54:22,562 --> 02:54:23,070
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:54:23,522 --> 02:54:26,430
SPEAKER_1:  they're only being further disenfranchised. In the name of peace now.

02:54:27,106 --> 02:54:28,958
SPEAKER_1:  because voices are being amplified.

02:54:29,634 --> 02:54:33,086
SPEAKER_1:  in the name of peace that are suffocating voices for justice.

02:54:40,482 --> 02:54:41,566
SPEAKER_1:  He said hope.

02:54:42,338 --> 02:54:46,142

02:54:47,618 --> 02:54:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  this part of the world and our world in general.

02:54:50,594 --> 02:54:51,166
SPEAKER_0:  on you.

02:54:51,554 --> 02:54:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  look across and see so much conflict, so much division happening.

02:54:55,554 --> 02:54:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  or gives you hope.

02:54:58,242 --> 02:54:58,782
SPEAKER_1:  I-

02:54:59,618 --> 02:55:01,438
SPEAKER_1:  Think that if you look through history.

02:55:01,730 --> 02:55:04,478
SPEAKER_1:  We have been through points as a world.

02:55:04,770 --> 02:55:05,278
SPEAKER_1:  Where?

02:55:06,082 --> 02:55:07,102
SPEAKER_1:  We almost.

02:55:07,906 --> 02:55:11,006
SPEAKER_1:  were not going to exist anymore. If you lived in the time.

02:55:11,746 --> 02:55:13,342
SPEAKER_1:  of the Crusades a few.

02:55:14,050 --> 02:55:14,654
SPEAKER_1:  lived.

02:55:15,106 --> 02:55:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  uh... in some of these darker moments of history

02:55:18,082 --> 02:55:22,590
SPEAKER_1:  World War I, World War II, you probably thought you weren't going to come out of this as a world.

02:55:23,970 --> 02:55:25,022
SPEAKER_1:  I have hope in God.

02:55:26,914 --> 02:55:28,414
SPEAKER_1:  and I have hope.

02:55:28,930 --> 02:55:30,366
SPEAKER_1:  that godly people.

02:55:30,658 --> 02:55:34,014
SPEAKER_1:  people that are devoted to God and people of righteousness.

02:55:35,234 --> 02:55:36,254
SPEAKER_1:  can shift things.

02:55:36,930 --> 02:55:37,630
SPEAKER_1:  with his help.

02:55:38,562 --> 02:55:39,038
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:55:39,842 --> 02:55:40,638
SPEAKER_1:  I also

02:55:41,282 --> 02:55:43,742
SPEAKER_1:  I believe that younger people, I hope they'll be different.

02:55:44,642 --> 02:55:45,790
SPEAKER_1:  I think younger people.

02:55:46,530 --> 02:55:46,974
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

02:55:48,130 --> 02:55:48,766
SPEAKER_1:  Hopefully.

02:55:48,994 --> 02:55:50,174
SPEAKER_1:  We're using the word hope a lot.

02:55:50,722 --> 02:55:52,766
SPEAKER_1:  You know, you might hear it inshallah, God willing.

02:55:53,506 --> 02:55:53,982
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:55:55,842 --> 02:55:56,606
SPEAKER_1:  We'll see.

02:55:57,186 --> 02:55:58,558
SPEAKER_1:  the path that we're heading.

02:55:59,138 --> 02:55:59,774
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:56:00,802 --> 02:56:02,110
SPEAKER_1:  will seek to disrupt.

02:56:04,098 --> 02:56:04,638
SPEAKER_1:  this.

02:56:05,282 --> 02:56:06,270
SPEAKER_1:  bleak trajectory.

02:56:07,554 --> 02:56:09,086
SPEAKER_1:  and bring it back to something else.

02:56:09,858 --> 02:56:12,030
SPEAKER_1:  So here's the thing, we live in a time of hyper-exposure.

02:56:12,674 --> 02:56:14,718
SPEAKER_1:  that hyperexposure could paralyze you?

02:56:15,106 --> 02:56:16,158
SPEAKER_1:  or it could empower you.

02:56:16,706 --> 02:56:17,278
SPEAKER_1:  It could.

02:56:18,146 --> 02:56:20,798
SPEAKER_1:  make you completely shut down and say, what's the point?

02:56:21,186 --> 02:56:21,662
SPEAKER_1:  of

02:56:21,922 --> 02:56:22,718
SPEAKER_1:  Even trying.

02:56:23,810 --> 02:56:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  to help these people out. Why even talk about the Palestinians?

02:56:27,362 --> 02:56:30,078
SPEAKER_1:  You got these people here, the Uyghurs, the Rohingya, you got...

02:56:30,530 --> 02:56:34,910
SPEAKER_1:  What's happening in Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Brazil.

02:56:35,138 --> 02:56:37,406
SPEAKER_1:  South America, Africa, Ethiopia.

02:56:38,018 --> 02:56:41,918
SPEAKER_1:  Somalia, it's so much and it can be overwhelming.

02:56:42,274 --> 02:56:43,742
SPEAKER_1:  to a person who cares.

02:56:45,282 --> 02:56:47,070
SPEAKER_1:  but you ultimately realize.

02:56:48,226 --> 02:56:48,670
SPEAKER_1:  that

02:56:49,090 --> 02:56:50,878
SPEAKER_1:  the difference that you can make.

02:56:52,130 --> 02:56:52,894
SPEAKER_1:  can become.

02:56:53,250 --> 02:56:55,838
SPEAKER_1:  a much greater difference, even if it's after your lifetime.

02:56:56,162 --> 02:56:57,790
SPEAKER_1:  I'll tell you actually a story that.

02:56:58,242 --> 02:56:59,742
SPEAKER_1:  I remember the first time I went to Syria.

02:57:00,034 --> 02:57:01,118
SPEAKER_1:  Syrian refugee camps.

02:57:02,210 --> 02:57:03,390
SPEAKER_1:  and you deal with people.

02:57:04,898 --> 02:57:06,718
SPEAKER_1:  in this deeply human way.

02:57:07,234 --> 02:57:07,646
SPEAKER_1:  out.

02:57:08,258 --> 02:57:09,982
SPEAKER_1:  for me the most clarifying parts.

02:57:10,402 --> 02:57:11,838
SPEAKER_1:  the world are the refugee camps.

02:57:12,642 --> 02:57:14,238
SPEAKER_1:  where I feel the most clarity in life.

02:57:15,106 --> 02:57:16,478
SPEAKER_1:  about what I'm supposed to be doing.

02:57:16,866 --> 02:57:17,374
SPEAKER_1:  and life.

02:57:18,050 --> 02:57:21,918
SPEAKER_1:  You go to the refugee camps and then after you're interacting with these people.

02:57:22,242 --> 02:57:25,310
SPEAKER_1:  you know, maybe giving a few people some trailer homes and some

02:57:25,666 --> 02:57:26,238
SPEAKER_1:  food and

02:57:26,722 --> 02:57:31,006
SPEAKER_1:  something that sustain themselves, coats and blankets you drive out of the refugee camps.

02:57:31,682 --> 02:57:32,734
SPEAKER_1:  Back to where you're staying.

02:57:33,570 --> 02:57:38,302
SPEAKER_1:  And the camps get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and the people get smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller.

02:57:39,714 --> 02:57:40,830
SPEAKER_1:  But then you realize...

02:57:41,634 --> 02:57:42,046
SPEAKER_1:  that.

02:57:42,370 --> 02:57:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  It might be that that small section that I touched.

02:57:46,114 --> 02:57:48,094
SPEAKER_1:  is going to be the change that affects all of them.

02:57:49,314 --> 02:57:50,430
SPEAKER_1:  What's going to happen to that?

02:57:51,586 --> 02:57:52,670
SPEAKER_1:  12 year old boy.

02:57:53,666 --> 02:57:55,102
SPEAKER_1:  that has seen.

02:57:55,778 --> 02:57:57,310
SPEAKER_1:  the horrors of this world.

02:57:58,210 --> 02:58:00,030
SPEAKER_1:  And that is absolutely committed.

02:58:01,026 --> 02:58:02,014
SPEAKER_1:  to uplifting.

02:58:02,274 --> 02:58:02,910
SPEAKER_1:  his people.

02:58:03,234 --> 02:58:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  and bringing about a change.

02:58:05,346 --> 02:58:07,102
SPEAKER_1:  being responsible for the plight of his people.

02:58:07,682 --> 02:58:09,022
SPEAKER_1:  And so when I look at any.

02:58:09,762 --> 02:58:11,518
SPEAKER_1:  section of devastation in the world.

02:58:12,258 --> 02:58:17,694
SPEAKER_1:  You never know which part of it that you're going to touch that's going to change everything. By the grace of God, by the help of God.

02:58:18,530 --> 02:58:23,902
SPEAKER_1:  So you keep trying to do your part. The Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him said that the most beloved of deeds to God.

02:58:24,322 --> 02:58:26,078
SPEAKER_1:  are the consistent ones, even if they're small.

02:58:26,658 --> 02:58:27,966
SPEAKER_1:  small act of charity.

02:58:28,546 --> 02:58:31,134
SPEAKER_1:  That small smile, that small act of kindness.

02:58:31,714 --> 02:58:32,670
SPEAKER_1:  That small prayer.

02:58:33,218 --> 02:58:34,590
SPEAKER_1:  might go a long way.

02:58:35,170 --> 02:58:35,966
SPEAKER_1:  if he blesses it.

02:58:36,322 --> 02:58:36,734
SPEAKER_1:  So...

02:58:37,282 --> 02:58:39,454
SPEAKER_1:  Keep chipping away, chipping away, chipping away.

02:58:40,034 --> 02:58:43,710
SPEAKER_0:  Do not be paralyzed by the scale of the division, just...

02:58:44,898 --> 02:58:45,790
SPEAKER_0:  chip away at it.

02:58:46,114 --> 02:58:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  chip away at it. Small step at a time. I suppose all of us can do that.

02:58:50,690 --> 02:58:51,902
SPEAKER_0:  Young people can do that.

02:58:52,354 --> 02:58:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  Just one person at a time, try to help. Just one person at a time, try to help.

02:58:54,626 --> 02:58:55,262
SPEAKER_1:  Absolutely.

02:58:55,746 --> 02:58:56,094

02:59:09,410 --> 02:59:13,214

SPEAKER_0:  from Muhammad Ali.

03:02:22,178 --> 03:02:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  Impossible is just a big word.

03:02:24,770 --> 03:02:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  thrown around by small men.

03:02:26,754 --> 03:02:29,438
SPEAKER_0:  who find it easier to live in a world they've been given.

03:02:29,826 --> 03:02:32,030
SPEAKER_0:  and to explore the power they have to change it.

03:02:32,642 --> 03:02:34,110
SPEAKER_0:  Impossible is not a fact.

03:02:34,658 --> 03:02:35,454
SPEAKER_0:  is an opinion.

03:02:36,066 --> 03:02:38,302
SPEAKER_0:  Impossible is not a declaration.

03:02:38,754 --> 03:02:39,614
