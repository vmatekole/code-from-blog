00:00:00,098 --> 00:00:11,934
SPEAKER_1:  It was really shocking to me that nobody else was doing anything creative with sex work. For me, it was like breathing. You're just doing sex and you're bored and like, what do you do? I don't know, let's try something funny. It's just the natural progression. It felt to me like there was almost no competition.

00:00:12,226 --> 00:00:13,854
SPEAKER_1:  Like I would just be really creative and like.

00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,198
SPEAKER_1:  Immediately was the top.

00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:18,686
SPEAKER_1:  not safe for work post on Reddit. Like, I didn't even try that hard.

00:00:21,058 --> 00:00:23,006
SPEAKER_0:  The following is a conversation with Ayla.

00:00:23,522 --> 00:00:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  a sex researcher.

00:00:24,802 --> 00:00:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  who does some of the largest human sexuality survey studies in the world.

00:00:28,706 --> 00:00:31,166
SPEAKER_0:  and everything from fetishes to relationships.

00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  She's fearless in pursuing her curiosity on these topics.

00:00:35,074 --> 00:00:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  by asking challenging and fascinating questions.

00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,054
SPEAKER_0:  and looking for answers in a rigorous data-driven way.

00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:41,918
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:00:42,178 --> 00:00:43,070
SPEAKER_0:  writing about it.

00:00:43,362 --> 00:00:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  and her blog.

00:00:44,386 --> 00:00:45,918
SPEAKER_0:  KnowingLess.com

00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:47,422
SPEAKER_0:  She's also...

00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,414
SPEAKER_0:  a sex worker.

00:00:48,738 --> 00:00:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  including OnlyFans and escorting.

00:00:51,234 --> 00:00:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  and is an exceptionally prolific creator.

00:00:54,018 --> 00:00:55,134
SPEAKER_0:  of thought provoking.

00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  Glitter Pulse.

00:00:57,186 --> 00:00:59,102
SPEAKER_0:  Ayla and I disagree on a bunch of things.

00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,334
SPEAKER_0:  But that just made this conversation even more interesting.

00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  I like interesting people.

00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,254
SPEAKER_0:  in the full range of the meaning that the word interesting implies.

00:01:09,026 --> 00:01:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  I'm currently reading On the Road by Jack Kerouac.

00:01:12,194 --> 00:01:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  And uh...

00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  would be remiss if I didn't mention.

00:01:15,394 --> 00:01:17,118
SPEAKER_0:  One of my favorite quotes from that book.

00:01:17,538 --> 00:01:18,782
SPEAKER_0:  that feels relevant here.

00:01:20,386 --> 00:01:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  The only people for me are the mad ones.

00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:24,478
SPEAKER_0:  The ones who are mad to live.

00:01:24,898 --> 00:01:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  Matt to talk.

00:01:26,146 --> 00:01:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  Mad to be saved.

00:01:27,714 --> 00:01:29,918
SPEAKER_0:  desirous of everything at the same time.

00:01:30,306 --> 00:01:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  The ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing.

00:01:33,378 --> 00:01:35,134
SPEAKER_0:  But burn, burn, burn.

00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,014
SPEAKER_0:  like fabulous yellow roman candles.

00:01:38,338 --> 00:01:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  Exploding like spiders across the stars.

00:01:41,378 --> 00:01:42,174
SPEAKER_0:  in the middle.

00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,062
SPEAKER_0:  You see the blue satellite pop.

00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,918
SPEAKER_0:  and everybody goes.

00:01:48,354 --> 00:01:50,110
SPEAKER_0:  This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:01:53,442 --> 00:01:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  And now...

00:01:54,338 --> 00:01:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  Dear friends,

00:01:55,522 --> 00:01:56,190
SPEAKER_0:  Here's ALA.

00:01:57,442 --> 00:01:59,198
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like this conversation can go anywhere.

00:01:59,522 --> 00:02:01,502
SPEAKER_0:  Is that exciting or terrifying to you?

00:02:02,146 --> 00:02:02,942
SPEAKER_0:  Things more exciting?

00:02:03,426 --> 00:02:04,894
SPEAKER_0:  the uncertainty exciting to you.

00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:06,494
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

00:02:07,138 --> 00:02:08,958
SPEAKER_0:  in conversations in general or just this one?

00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:10,814
SPEAKER_1:  I think conversations in general.

00:02:11,138 --> 00:02:14,622
SPEAKER_1:  Like, is anybody like out of the certainty is really exciting? Maybe if the certainty is something new.

00:02:14,882 --> 00:02:16,670
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, novelty always comes with uncertainty, right?

00:02:16,962 --> 00:02:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  Almost always.

00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  I started trying to think of a counter example.

00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,605
SPEAKER_0:  Immediately. You're uncomfortable with generalizations of that kind.

00:02:23,605 --> 00:02:25,086
SPEAKER_1:  Like always, it's always really bold.

00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:26,046
SPEAKER_1:  for it to use.

00:02:26,274 --> 00:02:30,654
SPEAKER_0:  But if it's truly novel, that means you don't really understand it's outside your distribution.

00:02:30,946 --> 00:02:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  So therefore it's gonna have a bunch of uncertainty. You don't think of it as uncertainty.

00:02:34,242 --> 00:02:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  You think about his.

00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  something new.

00:02:37,346 --> 00:02:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  but it actually also attracts you because there's a lot of uncertainty surrounding it probably

00:02:41,186 --> 00:02:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  Like what is this new thing?

00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:42,942
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:45,630
SPEAKER_1:  annihilating the mystery, like that drive.

00:02:45,954 --> 00:02:47,006
SPEAKER_1:  What about the danger of it?

00:02:48,194 --> 00:02:52,958
SPEAKER_1:  I was just thinking of on the drive over, because I was kind of like a little nervous about doing this podcast.

00:02:53,602 --> 00:02:54,014
SPEAKER_1:  And then an.

00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:59,934
SPEAKER_1:  I was like feeling into the unpleasantness of it, like the fear of what if something goes terribly wrong.

00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:00,894
SPEAKER_1:  And then.

00:03:01,154 --> 00:03:04,638
SPEAKER_1:  I was also feeling into how much that feels like part of why it's exciting.

00:03:05,346 --> 00:03:07,221
SPEAKER_1:  If I knew that it was going to go great, I don't know.

00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  Did you actually imagine all the possible ways it can go wrong?

00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:11,422
SPEAKER_1:  Not like-

00:03:11,906 --> 00:03:15,838
SPEAKER_1:  all of them, but I was like, what if I say something really dumb or like you asked me a question?

00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:22,078
SPEAKER_1:  And I answer it in a way that makes me sound a lot less capable than I am. I'm like really afraid of being perceived as.

00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,422
SPEAKER_1:  Stupid or something?

00:03:23,842 --> 00:03:30,910
SPEAKER_1:  I was also thinking about this on the way over, like I'm kind of risk averse in some ways, like I don't like driving fast in cars because I was driving very carefully here because the roads are bad.

00:03:31,682 --> 00:03:32,766
SPEAKER_1:  And then I think about, I'm very like.

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,014
SPEAKER_1:  pro-risk in other ways, like being really exposed to a wide variety of people who might hate you.

00:03:38,434 --> 00:03:38,814
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:03:39,106 --> 00:03:44,254
SPEAKER_1:  I think from the outside that might look fine, but I think the monkey brain is really sensitive to lots of people yelling at you.

00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:45,374
SPEAKER_1:  fruit.

00:03:45,794 --> 00:03:46,366
SPEAKER_1:  Whatever.

00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:47,719
SPEAKER_1:  problems that you seem to have.

00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,950
SPEAKER_0:  So that's the big risk you're taking is...

00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  putting yourself out there.

00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  as an intellectual, like through your writing.

00:03:54,562 --> 00:03:57,937
SPEAKER_0:  and then a lot of people yelling at you. Is that the worst embarrassment you could...

00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,070
SPEAKER_1:  It's pretty bad, yeah.

00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:04,990
SPEAKER_1:  I think the worst embarrassment is if I put something out there that I failed to be properly skeptical of in myself.

00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:10,878
SPEAKER_1:  And then people are like, oh, we caught this thing that you didn't catch. I think that's the biggest terror.

00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, from.

00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:14,590
SPEAKER_0:  looking at your reading and listening to your interviews.

00:04:15,394 --> 00:04:16,510
SPEAKER_0:  You seem to be...

00:04:16,898 --> 00:04:19,966
SPEAKER_0:  very defensive and worried about being a good scientist.

00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:22,846
SPEAKER_0:  Definitely. Well, you're like methodology. Yes.

00:04:23,234 --> 00:04:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  Eh.

00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,198
SPEAKER_0:  And funny enough, you get attacked on that methodology, even thou-

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I'm a fan of psychology, like academic psychology and

00:04:33,762 --> 00:04:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  It's kind of disappointing often how non-rigorous.

00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  their work is how small the sample size and so on and how big.

00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:42,206
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:46,430
SPEAKER_0:  ambitious, over ambitious the proclamations about results is.

00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,062
SPEAKER_0:  especially with the news.

00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,022
SPEAKER_0:  reports on it.

00:04:49,602 --> 00:04:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  Now you're both the researcher, the scientist, and the reporter, right? So like that's what you have with the blog.

00:04:56,194 --> 00:04:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  your sample size is often gigantic.

00:04:59,202 --> 00:05:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  The methodology is right there. The data is right there. You provide the data.

00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,094
SPEAKER_0:  and then you're like...

00:05:04,994 --> 00:05:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  raw and honest.

00:05:06,754 --> 00:05:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  with your interpretation of the day. I think there's an honesty, authenticity to it.

00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:14,846
SPEAKER_0:  So it's actually really refreshing. I don't know why people criticize it. I think-

00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,982
SPEAKER_0:  This is what psychologists are probably terrified.

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,094
SPEAKER_0:  about being transparent and

00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  transparent in that way is because they'll get attacked.

00:05:23,554 --> 00:05:24,926
SPEAKER_0:  their methodology so they want to

00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  cloak it.

00:05:26,178 --> 00:05:27,262
SPEAKER_0:  in a...

00:05:28,098 --> 00:05:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  in a sort of layer of authority.

00:05:30,402 --> 00:05:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  I come from this institution.

00:05:32,162 --> 00:05:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  It was peer-reviewed.

00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  this kind of all these layers.

00:05:35,842 --> 00:05:41,054
SPEAKER_0:  and I'm also not gonna share the data with you and I'm also gonna pretend like most psychology studies are not replicable.

00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  I'm just going to pretend there's authority to it.

00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:52,158
SPEAKER_1:  I think it works on a lot of people, like from the outside, you're like, ah, the scientists with the white lab coats with credentials, those are the people who are like doing science and like doing sciences, you know.

00:05:52,514 --> 00:05:55,582
SPEAKER_1:  You have like fancy terms that other people don't really understand.

00:05:56,002 --> 00:06:04,286
SPEAKER_1:  And to be fair, I have a lot to learn. I'm still like, I'm self-teaching, I'm like learning through people, learning as I go. I'm definitely not super knowledgeable about this stuff.

00:06:04,802 --> 00:06:08,030
SPEAKER_1:  But a lot of what those people are doing in science is not that...

00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:08,830
SPEAKER_1:  hard.

00:06:09,378 --> 00:06:14,494
SPEAKER_1:  And a lot of people like don't try to learn it because it seems so like elevated

00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:16,094
SPEAKER_1:  And this is one thing that really...

00:06:16,322 --> 00:06:27,454
SPEAKER_1:  bothers me. I think like everybody can do science. Like if you just have this aspect of curiosity and like you just really want to figure something out, you can go and start, you know, asking people questions, doing surveys, like writing down the answers.

00:06:27,714 --> 00:06:32,094
SPEAKER_1:  And then you can go learn how to look at that data in a way that gives you more information about the world.

00:06:32,354 --> 00:06:36,670
SPEAKER_1:  It's very simple and straightforward if you just approach it humbly and earnestly, and you're like, please let's like- It's very simple and straightforward if you just approach it humbly and earnestly, and

00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:41,758
SPEAKER_1:  let's figure this out together. But people are, I think, self-crippled in this because-

00:06:42,114 --> 00:06:43,294
SPEAKER_1:  They view this as like

00:06:44,194 --> 00:06:48,094
SPEAKER_1:  relegated to the domain of the experts and, you know, the fancy scientists.

00:06:48,322 --> 00:06:50,110
SPEAKER_1:  And I think that makes me feel really sad.

00:06:50,402 --> 00:06:51,838
SPEAKER_0:  You're almost attracted to the.

00:06:52,322 --> 00:06:53,630
SPEAKER_0:  questions you're not supposed to ask.

00:06:54,146 --> 00:06:54,590
SPEAKER_1:  Oh yeah.

00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:55,806
SPEAKER_1:  Also, yes.

00:06:56,322 --> 00:06:58,197
SPEAKER_1:  It might contribute to the controversy.

00:06:58,197 --> 00:07:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  exclusively probably and you're just

00:07:00,578 --> 00:07:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  NOT

00:07:01,442 --> 00:07:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  are limited by...

00:07:03,586 --> 00:07:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  Like part of your curiosity asking questions that seem common sense. Like what is some of the most controversial questions are.

00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  like around sex.

00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:11,518
SPEAKER_0:  Mm-hmm.

00:07:11,938 --> 00:07:12,382
SPEAKER_0:  It's like.

00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  Everybody thinks and talks and does sex. I mean, it's the driver of human civilization and yet.

00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  there's so little rigorous discussion about the philosophical and the scientific questions around it. It gets really weird.

00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,622
SPEAKER_0:  to be able to discuss them. It becomes tricky to discuss them.

00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:34,494
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, supercharged. Super, because everybody has a really strong opinion, like whether or not.

00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:40,606
SPEAKER_1:  pornography is damaging to society or how sex corresponds to gender or what kind of sexuality is acceptable.

00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  Like, can you have sexual preferences that in themselves are immoral?

00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:47,582
SPEAKER_1:  People get very angry about it.

00:07:47,938 --> 00:07:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  What a sad part.

00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  is they're not just opinionated.

00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,462
SPEAKER_0:  but most of us, our relationship with sex is a...

00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  I think, I guess I want to say not rigorous.

00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,534
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's very difficult to be rigorous about sex. Like,

00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:12,990
SPEAKER_1:  I would consider sexual urges to be kind of elusive to introspection in a way that's a little bit disproportionate to a lot of other things. Like you could like, you know, introspect about, you know, how I want other people to like me and...

00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,822
SPEAKER_1:  how where my insecurities lie, but sex is one of those black box things.

00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:28,638
SPEAKER_1:  A really common thing is for people to, if you have a fetish, you sort of check back in your childhood to see an event that corresponds to that fetish, and then you develop a narrative, like, ah, this event in my childhood must have caused this fetish.

00:08:29,058 --> 00:08:32,414
SPEAKER_1:  And so I think this causes people to be biased towards like a concrete.

00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,990
SPEAKER_1:  coherent causative way that events happen or that sexual fetishes happen.

00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:42,174
SPEAKER_1:  This is just like one example of why I think it's really hard to be rigorous with introspection.

00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,030
SPEAKER_1:  because we can't avoid, you just want to...

00:08:44,546 --> 00:08:46,814
SPEAKER_1:  tend towards making like coherent narratives.

00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:48,958
SPEAKER_1:  which I think is not always the correct way to explain it.

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:57,374
SPEAKER_0:  the narratives that are connected to childhood and so on. Yeah. They originate, yeah. I mean, we'll talk about fetishes because you have a lot of really interesting writing on that.

00:08:58,146 --> 00:08:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  just actually zooming out.

00:08:59,682 --> 00:09:05,822
SPEAKER_0:  I should mention you tweeted, I wrote this down. You tweeted, I do not understand how to have normal conversations with people.

00:09:06,274 --> 00:09:07,102
SPEAKER_0:  in person.

00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:08,990
SPEAKER_0:  if I'm not on drugs.

00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:10,654
SPEAKER_0:  So I guess.

00:09:10,914 --> 00:09:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  I.

00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,558
SPEAKER_0:  Let's both agree to not have a normal conversation, I guess.

00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:16,190
SPEAKER_0:  assuming you're not on drugs now.

00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,639
SPEAKER_0:  Or if you are, you could do it.

00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:19,614
SPEAKER_1:  I feel like a very small amount of fun about it.

00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,214
SPEAKER_1:  which is a nootropic.

00:09:21,954 --> 00:09:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know if that counts. Is that a drug? Caffeine

00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  Mm.

00:09:24,962 --> 00:09:25,886
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,566
SPEAKER_1:  Drugged up. Good enough to have a normal conversation.

00:09:30,114 --> 00:09:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  uh

00:09:31,042 --> 00:09:31,678
SPEAKER_0:  We don't have to.

00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,982
SPEAKER_0:  What is normal anyway?

00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  What do you think is the primary driver of human civilization?

00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,278
SPEAKER_0:  Is it the desire for sex, love, power, or immortality?

00:09:41,602 --> 00:09:42,654
SPEAKER_0:  like avoiding.

00:09:43,394 --> 00:09:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  the fear of death, constructing illusions that make us forget about our

00:09:47,362 --> 00:09:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  terror over mortality.

00:09:49,474 --> 00:09:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  Sex, love, power, death.

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,150
SPEAKER_1:  This is a Twitter poll.

00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,695
SPEAKER_1:  It's... St같on

00:09:54,695 --> 00:10:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  options. This is reality not everything maps perfectly to a Twitter poll but in this case because there's four options and it is a small number of characters it does.

00:10:04,674 --> 00:10:05,758
SPEAKER_0:  But I'd like to think.

00:10:06,178 --> 00:10:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  I am more interested. You know what?

00:10:08,514 --> 00:10:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  I think your Twitter polls are fundamentally interesting.

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  There's something about the brevity.

00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  of a poll, limiting to a set of choices.

00:10:16,642 --> 00:10:19,230
SPEAKER_0:  and having an existential crisis and searching for the answer.

00:10:20,034 --> 00:10:20,702
SPEAKER_0:  That's beautiful.

00:10:21,346 --> 00:10:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  that combination. This one is a big one.

00:10:24,546 --> 00:10:29,950
SPEAKER_1:  Do you believe that there is one primary driver? Like, do you think that it can be understood in the terms of primary drivers?

00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:31,614
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I think-

00:10:31,874 --> 00:10:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  Or maybe it's the ne-

00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  engineering perspective, like trying to reverse engineer the brain.

00:10:36,322 --> 00:10:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think we're equipped.

00:10:38,146 --> 00:10:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  or understand enough about the mind to get there.

00:10:40,226 --> 00:10:42,430
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, like, what's the primary driver of a tree?

00:10:43,874 --> 00:10:47,390
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, well then it gets to the question of what is life? What is the living organism?

00:10:47,682 --> 00:10:49,150
SPEAKER_0:  to self-replicate probably.

00:10:49,378 --> 00:10:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  That's a very clean simplification, but...

00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,494
SPEAKER_0:  I think life...

00:10:55,106 --> 00:10:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  is more.

00:10:56,578 --> 00:10:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  Interesting that.

00:10:58,274 --> 00:10:58,718
SPEAKER_0:  than just.

00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  self-replication.

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:07,107
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, but it sounds like there's a curiosity in you that you're trying to poke at, and I don't understand exactly what that curiosity is.

00:11:07,107 --> 00:11:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  So if I had to dedicate a thousand years to understand one of these topics.

00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:15,294
SPEAKER_0:  which one would be the most fruitful? I guess is the indirect thing I'm asking.

00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  Not for fun.

00:11:18,434 --> 00:11:20,094
SPEAKER_0:  To me, everything is fun.

00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  But...

00:11:21,378 --> 00:11:23,006
SPEAKER_0:  Really? Yeah

00:11:23,426 --> 00:11:26,878
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I'm with David Foster Wallace. The key to life is

00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:32,350
SPEAKER_0:  to make sure that everything is unboreable, nothing is boring.

00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:33,342
SPEAKER_0:  Everything is fun.

00:11:34,562 --> 00:11:37,054
SPEAKER_0:  Like everything, I could literally sit.

00:11:37,282 --> 00:11:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  I honestly, because I don't think I don't know where you got that glass.

00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,862
SPEAKER_0:  But that glass exists and I forgot it exists and it was really fun to me to know that it now is there.

00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:46,558
SPEAKER_1:  What about the really unpleasant things?

00:11:47,682 --> 00:11:50,142
SPEAKER_1:  Like if you're in like deep agony.

00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:52,190
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, that's fun. OK.

00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  That's fun, because it's like, I mean, yeah, heartbreak. It's like knowing.

00:11:56,642 --> 00:11:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  then I'm capable of that.

00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  It's like...

00:12:00,034 --> 00:12:00,670
SPEAKER_0:  from.

00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  uh... you know were all living in the gutter but some of us are looking up at the stars so when you're in that gutter

00:12:08,738 --> 00:12:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  For some reason the stars look brighter.

00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

00:12:11,682 --> 00:12:14,302
SPEAKER_0:  So like whenever you're going through a difficult time.

00:12:15,554 --> 00:12:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  or whenever you see maybe other people being shitty to each other.

00:12:18,914 --> 00:12:21,438
SPEAKER_0:  It makes you really appreciate when they're not.

00:12:22,082 --> 00:12:23,102
SPEAKER_0:  The contrast makes life.

00:12:23,682 --> 00:12:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  kind of amazing, I'm reading a bunch of books, one of them is Brave New World, where they remove

00:12:28,738 --> 00:12:29,726
SPEAKER_0:  you know, where they...

00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:32,030
SPEAKER_0:  Remove the ups and downs of life.

00:12:32,706 --> 00:12:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:12:33,314 --> 00:12:36,766
SPEAKER_0:  partially through drugs, but over sexualization and all that kind of stuff.

00:12:37,602 --> 00:12:38,686
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like you need.

00:12:39,682 --> 00:12:42,110
SPEAKER_0:  that you need the ups and downs of life.

00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:45,598
SPEAKER_0:  the dark, you know, you need the dark to have.

00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:46,494
SPEAKER_0:  happiness.

00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,966
SPEAKER_0:  have like a deeply.

00:12:48,322 --> 00:12:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  intense feeling of affection towards another thing.

00:12:52,194 --> 00:12:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  or a human being.

00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:53,726
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:55,294
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, so everything's fun.

00:12:55,586 --> 00:12:58,238
SPEAKER_0:  But fun is also a weird word to define.

00:12:58,562 --> 00:12:59,230
SPEAKER_0:  It's fun.

00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,734
SPEAKER_0:  I think for a lot of people in.

00:13:01,762 --> 00:13:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  That's why I talk about love a lot. I think love is a better word than fun.

00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:08,798
SPEAKER_0:  because fun is like light hearted.

00:13:10,242 --> 00:13:11,678
SPEAKER_0:  Love is more intense.

00:13:13,506 --> 00:13:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  I love that glass.

00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  and the water that's in it.

00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,414
SPEAKER_0:  because it's freaking awesome. Like somebody made that glass, right? Exactly.

00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  and like not have many mistakes and like there's a

00:13:23,842 --> 00:13:30,366
SPEAKER_0:  And the way bends late in interesting ways and the way water bends late in anyways, like I can see part of your arm through that water.

00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  That's freaking amazing.

00:13:33,026 --> 00:13:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  Everything is amazing.

00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  I'm with the Lego movie anyway.

00:13:38,338 --> 00:13:38,750
SPEAKER_0:  If

00:13:38,978 --> 00:13:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  But if like from a scientific perspective if I were to investigate sex

00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:50,750
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know why I put love in there. Let's narrow it down to Twitter poll. Let's focus on the basics here. Sex power or

00:13:51,426 --> 00:13:52,446
SPEAKER_0:  death immortality.

00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  If I were to try to.

00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,902
SPEAKER_0:  like from a neuroscience, neurobiology perspective.

00:14:00,162 --> 00:14:03,070
SPEAKER_0:  or reverse engineer through building AI systems that focus on

00:14:03,362 --> 00:14:04,606
SPEAKER_0:  these kinds of dynamics.

00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  exploring the game theoretic aspects of it.

00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  exploring.

00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:13,918
SPEAKER_0:  the sort of cognitive modeling aspects of it, which one would get me to a deeper understanding.

00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  of the human condition.

00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  the question.

00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  Sex.

00:14:18,338 --> 00:14:20,702
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, Nietzsche is the will to power.

00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  Um

00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  Freud and the bunch is all about sex.

00:14:25,058 --> 00:14:26,814
SPEAKER_0:  And then

00:14:27,522 --> 00:14:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  death.

00:14:28,898 --> 00:14:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  Live just live barely.

00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  brilliant previous guest on this podcast. She's just released a video where on her bedside was the book Denial of Death.

00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  by Ernest Becker.

00:14:41,026 --> 00:14:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  which of course you would have.

00:14:42,722 --> 00:14:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  on her bedside.

00:14:43,906 --> 00:14:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  but that his whole work is that.

00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  Everything is motivated by our.

00:14:49,634 --> 00:14:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  trying to escape the cold, harsh reality that we're going to die and we're terrified of it.

00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,758
SPEAKER_0:  one of the gifts and burdens.

00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  for human beings is that

00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:03,038
SPEAKER_0:  we are cognizant of our own death.

00:15:03,746 --> 00:15:05,822
SPEAKER_0:  And that terrifies us. That's the theory.

00:15:06,274 --> 00:15:09,502
SPEAKER_0:  And because of that, we do everything we can. We build.

00:15:09,986 --> 00:15:11,070
SPEAKER_0:  We build empires.

00:15:11,394 --> 00:15:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  to escape the fact that we're mortal.

00:15:13,506 --> 00:15:14,174
SPEAKER_1:  Wouldn't this?

00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:17,182
SPEAKER_1:  change quite a bit for religious people then who don't believe.

00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:18,270
SPEAKER_1:  that they're going to die?

00:15:18,754 --> 00:15:22,526
SPEAKER_0:  where they created religion, the idea there to create myths, religions.

00:15:22,818 --> 00:15:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  You can create religions of all kinds like...

00:15:25,602 --> 00:15:26,014
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,574
SPEAKER_1:  But if this is like one of the defining things that...

00:15:29,378 --> 00:15:30,558
SPEAKER_1:  to find civilization.

00:15:30,882 --> 00:15:34,782
SPEAKER_1:  then we should expect to see massive differences between people who believe we're gonna die and people who don't.

00:15:35,522 --> 00:15:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  good I love it you think it like a like a scientific here but

00:15:38,722 --> 00:15:42,686
SPEAKER_0:  uh, and they have actually answers. Like there's a whole terror management theory where they do.

00:15:43,362 --> 00:15:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  write psychology type papers.

00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:48,574
SPEAKER_0:  and they do actual experiments. I can mention how their methodology is interesting.

00:15:49,346 --> 00:15:49,758
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

00:15:50,434 --> 00:15:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  they prime with the discussion of death. Like they take one certain set of people, they have a conversation with them, another set of people they mention death to them.

00:15:57,762 --> 00:15:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  before the conversation and see how that affects their.

00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  the nature of the conversation. It's really interesting because.

00:16:04,226 --> 00:16:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  Fundamentally Outters.

00:16:06,274 --> 00:16:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  the nature of the conference, just even priming.

00:16:09,058 --> 00:16:09,502
SPEAKER_0:  like

00:16:10,018 --> 00:16:12,446
SPEAKER_0:  reminding you that you're going to die briefly.

00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:14,366
SPEAKER_0:  changes a lot of things.

00:16:14,818 --> 00:16:16,958
SPEAKER_1:  these kinds of priming paper is usually not replicated.

00:16:17,762 --> 00:16:18,590
SPEAKER_1:  I just have like...

00:16:18,818 --> 00:16:20,382
SPEAKER_1:  I feel like I've heard a bunch of priming ones that...

00:16:21,282 --> 00:16:23,907
SPEAKER_0:  i think you have to do is the over psychology papers are not replicated

00:16:23,907 --> 00:16:28,190
SPEAKER_1:  I just did a primary experiment on my own and found it didn't have any effect.

00:16:28,962 --> 00:16:30,087
SPEAKER_1:  But again, can't you just.

00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  Give me a careless statement.

00:16:32,738 --> 00:16:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  summarizing an entire scientific discipline of terror management theory. I don't know.

00:16:37,218 --> 00:16:46,814
SPEAKER_0:  I haven't rigorously looked at how good of it psychologically. I think it is interesting philosophically the way Freud talked about the subconscious mind.

00:16:47,138 --> 00:16:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  philosophically, it's an interesting discussion, then you have to get rigorous with each for sure.

00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  uh, but, uh, the idea is that.

00:16:56,674 --> 00:16:57,982
SPEAKER_0:  Like it's not that religious.

00:16:58,274 --> 00:16:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  people.

00:17:00,194 --> 00:17:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  Get rid of the terror of death.

00:17:02,882 --> 00:17:06,686
SPEAKER_0:  This is just one of the popular ways they create an illusion on top of it.

00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  That's that idea, like a myth.

00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  that makes it easier for them to forget.

00:17:13,506 --> 00:17:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  to escape that terror.

00:17:14,978 --> 00:17:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  but everybody else does different.

00:17:17,762 --> 00:17:18,782
SPEAKER_0:  different methods like.

00:17:20,194 --> 00:17:27,198
SPEAKER_0:  You fill your days with capitalism has a whole religion of itself, like the rat race for getting more and more mature possessions and so on.

00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:40,382
SPEAKER_1:  Couldn't you argue it in the opposite direction? Let's assume that we're Christians here and we're like, the atheists, everybody has terror of hell, and the atheists invent this mythology where actually evolution is true in order to escape their terror of hell.

00:17:41,634 --> 00:17:44,606
SPEAKER_1:  So that doesn't feel like a persuasive argument to me. But I used to be.

00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:52,702
SPEAKER_1:  very, very Christian and I did not have a terror of death. And then I lost my faith and then I had a deep terror of death set in for a few years.

00:17:53,026 --> 00:17:54,270
SPEAKER_1:  It felt very different to me.

00:17:54,882 --> 00:17:56,350
SPEAKER_0:  So for denial of death?

00:17:56,738 --> 00:17:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know if he says that it's actually possible without

00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  really a lot of work to get to the actual terror.

00:18:04,482 --> 00:18:06,270
SPEAKER_0:  I think his claim is that in

00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  early early early childhood development.

00:18:09,282 --> 00:18:10,526
SPEAKER_0:  That's when the terror's real.

00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  and then we aggressively construct systems around it.

00:18:15,522 --> 00:18:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  of social interaction to...

00:18:18,562 --> 00:18:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  to sort of construct illusions at the top of it.

00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  I'm doing a half-assed description of this philosophy.

00:18:25,762 --> 00:18:28,734
SPEAKER_0:  There is like it is interesting to simplify.

00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  the human mind into underlying.

00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:34,462
SPEAKER_0:  mechanisms that drive it.

00:18:35,298 --> 00:18:43,153
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I was gonna say your thinking seems kind of poetic. Like the way that you're sort of handling these, these concepts feel like more like aesthetically driven.

00:18:43,153 --> 00:18:51,454
SPEAKER_0:  I think this theme is gonna continue throughout this conversation as we talk about relationships and sex, yes? For sure. I think so. I think you're thinking.

00:18:52,258 --> 00:18:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  seems to be very driven by how can I construct an experiment.

00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  to test this hypothesis.

00:18:58,338 --> 00:18:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:18:59,298 --> 00:18:59,934
SPEAKER_1:  Something like that.

00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:00,734
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, but.

00:19:01,378 --> 00:19:01,790
SPEAKER_0:  aren't.

00:19:02,786 --> 00:19:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  There's some things, especially that have to do with the human mind.

00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,174
SPEAKER_0:  that are really messy, really difficult to understand. There's so many uncertainties and mysteries around.

00:19:10,594 --> 00:19:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  that we don't yet have the tools to collect the data.

00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  Like one of your favorite tools is the survey.

00:19:16,802 --> 00:19:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  is asking people questions.

00:19:18,882 --> 00:19:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  and then figuring out different ways to indirectly get at the truth.

00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  because there's flaws to the survey, you kind of learn about those flaws and you get better and better at asking questions and so on.

00:19:28,994 --> 00:19:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  But that's not.

00:19:30,114 --> 00:19:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  That's indirect access to the human mind.

00:19:32,354 --> 00:19:35,390
SPEAKER_1:  But do you think like poetic narratives are? I'm not like-

00:19:35,682 --> 00:19:39,710
SPEAKER_1:  saying poetic narratives are bad. I think it's like a cool way of handling concepts.

00:19:40,034 --> 00:19:41,118
SPEAKER_1:  but I'm not sure that they are.

00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,430
SPEAKER_1:  more rigorous.

00:19:42,914 --> 00:19:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  No, no, no. Okay. Like they might be.

00:19:46,498 --> 00:19:51,518
SPEAKER_0:  the more correct, like philosophy might be the right way to discuss things that were really far from understanding.

00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,110
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, they might be more useful shorthand.

00:19:55,202 --> 00:20:01,118
SPEAKER_1:  Like morality, I don't think morality makes any sense, but it's really useful shorthand to use when handling concepts in a lot of the time.

00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  Right, like ethics and morality. You could construct studies that ask different questions.

00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  Like, you know, just having worked with autonomous vehicles a lot.

00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  the trolley problem gets brought up. and i don't know.

00:20:13,186 --> 00:20:14,814
SPEAKER_0:  You can construct all kinds of interesting.

00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,654
SPEAKER_0:  surveys about the trolley problem but does that really get at some deep

00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,142
SPEAKER_0:  Moral calculus, the human's-

00:20:22,594 --> 00:20:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  do.

00:20:23,298 --> 00:20:25,214
SPEAKER_0:  It's sexy because people like, right?

00:20:25,922 --> 00:20:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  clickbait articles about it.

00:20:27,714 --> 00:20:28,990
SPEAKER_0:  but doesn't really get to like...

00:20:29,442 --> 00:20:30,590
SPEAKER_0:  what you value more.

00:20:31,202 --> 00:20:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  Five grandmas or like...

00:20:33,122 --> 00:20:33,918
SPEAKER_0:  three children.

00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  What are they construct these arguments of like?

00:20:38,242 --> 00:20:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  If you could steer a train, if you could steer an autonomous car, which do you choose?

00:20:42,498 --> 00:20:42,814
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,598
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know if it's possible with some of those.

00:20:45,986 --> 00:20:48,446
SPEAKER_0:  to construct. Sometimes the fuzzy area...

00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,614
SPEAKER_0:  There's some topics that are fuzzy and will forever be fuzzy.

00:20:53,026 --> 00:20:55,070
SPEAKER_0:  given our limited cognitive capabilities.

00:20:55,618 --> 00:21:07,838
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know, there's a way of looking at things where it's like, for example, the childhood fetish thing that I was talking about, like, where do your fetishes come from? Like, you can develop a narrative where it's like, you know, I think like this kind of thing is, you know, when you're surrounded by feet when you're a child, this causes foot fetishes.

00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:11,134
SPEAKER_1:  And this is like kind of a cool narrative.

00:21:11,362 --> 00:21:15,038
SPEAKER_1:  And I think a lot of people's ideas about philosophy follow the same sort of thing.

00:21:15,362 --> 00:21:20,126
SPEAKER_1:  What is the narrative that is cool? And I think this is useful for meaning making. I'm very pro meaning making.

00:21:20,354 --> 00:21:21,374
SPEAKER_1:  Like when you're talking about...

00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,294
SPEAKER_1:  everything is fun.

00:21:23,618 --> 00:21:28,734
SPEAKER_1:  because, you know, the contrast or whatever. I very much ascribe to that. I really enjoy that.

00:21:29,474 --> 00:21:32,350
SPEAKER_1:  philosophy. I also find everything to be very delightful.

00:21:32,706 --> 00:21:42,750
SPEAKER_1:  And this isn't like a question of truth, right? We're not like, where is the true delight that we're objectively measuring? I guess this is a frame, a poetic frame that you're using to like sort of change the way the light hits the world around you.

00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  And that's super useful because it like.

00:21:45,474 --> 00:21:46,686
SPEAKER_1:  makes you happier.

00:21:47,394 --> 00:21:48,030
SPEAKER_1:  or something.

00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:50,846
SPEAKER_0:  And yeah, but also gets.

00:21:51,906 --> 00:21:53,150
SPEAKER_0:  to the truth or something.

00:21:54,082 --> 00:21:55,262
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I guess the front is true.

00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:56,862
SPEAKER_1:  Hehehe

00:21:58,274 --> 00:22:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  Um, yet another question. What is truth?

00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  You've, uh...

00:22:03,874 --> 00:22:04,958
SPEAKER_0:  actually to jump back.

00:22:05,538 --> 00:22:08,670
SPEAKER_0:  You believe that free will is an illusion.

00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,750
SPEAKER_0:  So, uh...

00:22:11,842 --> 00:22:12,990
SPEAKER_0:  Why does it feel like?

00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  I'm free to make any decision I want.

00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  Is that a cool illusion?

00:22:19,874 --> 00:22:27,966
SPEAKER_1:  I think that's probably where our sense of identity comes from. It's a fun illusion. When you really meditate on your sense of identity, at least for me, it seems like it comes down to the sense of choice.

00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:32,766
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, I am doing the thinking. Like, what does it mean to do with thinking? It's like, ah, something in me has-

00:22:33,634 --> 00:22:36,574
SPEAKER_1:  exerted agency over having this thought or not having this thought.

00:22:37,346 --> 00:22:37,694
SPEAKER_1:  Thank you.

00:22:37,954 --> 00:22:43,006
SPEAKER_1:  the sense of self really comes down to choice. And so when I say that like free will is an illusion, I also mean there's something like.

00:22:43,298 --> 00:22:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  The Self is an illusion, identity is...

00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:46,590
SPEAKER_1:  A trick of the light.

00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:48,766
SPEAKER_0:  But it's a really fun one.

00:22:49,026 --> 00:22:51,166
SPEAKER_0:  You think a lot about your identity.

00:22:52,258 --> 00:22:53,662
SPEAKER_0:  I have occasionally.

00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,350
SPEAKER_0:  I can't really struggle with it.

00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  You're proud of it.

00:22:58,018 --> 00:23:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  I do too, we have different journeys.

00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:02,974
SPEAKER_1:  I really take a lot of delight in it.

00:23:03,362 --> 00:23:09,566
SPEAKER_1:  I used to be very into deconstructing it. Maybe you know I did a bunch of way too much LSD for a while.

00:23:10,114 --> 00:23:14,078
SPEAKER_1:  And at that point, very no ego. And now I'm like very ego.

00:23:14,306 --> 00:23:15,838
SPEAKER_1:  I really enjoy having a lot of ego.

00:23:16,898 --> 00:23:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  I actually happen to know.

00:23:18,722 --> 00:23:19,966
SPEAKER_0:  like everything about you.

00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:23,326
SPEAKER_0:  Really? Yeah. Like more than you do. It's interesting.

00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:25,333
SPEAKER_1:  Fascinating. Wait, could you solve my problems?

00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, all of them. I did thorough research.

00:23:27,778 --> 00:23:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:31,070
SPEAKER_0:  What is consciousness then?

00:23:32,482 --> 00:23:35,934
SPEAKER_0:  I actually wrote that as a quote, what is consciousness?

00:23:36,578 --> 00:23:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  I have to remind myself. So like, how does that tie in together with free will and identity and all of that?

00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:57,022
SPEAKER_1:  Does it mean that what is conscious is like one of the biggest questions ever? I think, I do think that people often get confused when talking about consciousness because I think people are referring to two separate concepts and often like combining them into one thing. Like we ask the question, you know, is AI going to be conscious?

00:23:57,506 --> 00:23:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  I think this is kind of the wrong question.

00:24:00,674 --> 00:24:01,150
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:24:01,538 --> 00:24:05,694
SPEAKER_1:  Like, we can identify signs of consciousness, like, ah, they seem to refer to themselves.

00:24:06,018 --> 00:24:09,758
SPEAKER_1:  But this is not necessarily proof of consciousness in the same way that like dream characters.

00:24:10,594 --> 00:24:15,294
SPEAKER_1:  Acting exactly the way normal human people do in your dream is not evidence that they themselves are conscious.

00:24:16,002 --> 00:24:23,454
SPEAKER_1:  So, like, signs of consciousness are not proof of consciousness, but there is something that we definitely know, which is, like, I currently am conscious. I can tell because...

00:24:25,538 --> 00:24:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  Like I'm like just directly observing my experience.

00:24:28,546 --> 00:24:32,094
SPEAKER_1:  And so there's one kind of consciousness which is I am directly observing my experience.

00:24:32,482 --> 00:24:41,086
SPEAKER_1:  And that you cannot replicate it. I cannot observe two experiences. It is necessarily singular, and it is necessarily certain. You can make all the arguments you want.

00:24:41,538 --> 00:24:42,174
SPEAKER_1:  I think I'm still.

00:24:42,626 --> 00:24:50,366
SPEAKER_1:  directly observing, it's not a thing that's subject to reason. Whereas, are other things conscious? This is something that's replicable, like you can apply it to multiple people.

00:24:50,690 --> 00:25:02,366
SPEAKER_1:  is something that's not certain, like almost definitionally not certain. We don't actually know if there is an internal experience. So my argument is that when people are talking about other things having experience, they're using a different concept. And could this be I want to invite two sources that are proof that people can say that their

00:25:02,754 --> 00:25:06,942
SPEAKER_1:  than the thing that they're actually looking at when they look at their own experience. I think they're two different.

00:25:07,394 --> 00:25:07,838
SPEAKER_1:  Thanks.

00:25:08,386 --> 00:25:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  Definitionally not possible.

00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  No, if you understand the mechanism of consciousness, you'll be able to measure it probably, right?

00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:16,062
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, but what are you measuring?

00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:21,118
SPEAKER_1:  I think this is a subtle difference. Like when you're asking the question, is this other thing conscious?

00:25:22,498 --> 00:25:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  The easy thing to measure is like a survey.

00:25:25,026 --> 00:25:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  Does this thing appear conscious? Yeah

00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:32,350
SPEAKER_0:  And then the hard thing is you understand the actual mechanism of how consciousness arises.

00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,375
SPEAKER_0:  in the physics of

00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:38,814
SPEAKER_1:  of the human brain. You can do that in a dream, presumably. Like if you had a very good dream or a very good simulation. attacking something, including your motor前 sinuses with light tongues just to drive you robotic 707 Christians on out of space.

00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:39,902
SPEAKER_1:  But we could.

00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:46,974
SPEAKER_1:  then have somebody in a simulation or a dream where they go through and they fully understand, you know, they do all the tests and the tests come back exactly the way they would expect them to.

00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:51,006
SPEAKER_1:  But from the outside, we're like, well, this is misleading. They're not actually conscious.

00:25:51,778 --> 00:25:53,662
SPEAKER_1:  Like, your dream characters aren't conscious, right?

00:25:54,114 --> 00:25:55,326
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know are you asking?

00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,790
SPEAKER_1:  Are you telling? Appealing to an intuition.

00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:58,398
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, it is a very valuable tiger.

00:25:59,362 --> 00:26:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  But it sounds like you're driving towards the narrative. I don't you did a poll about men and women and dreams.

00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. There was some kind of difference. I couldn't tell what the difference was except that more men and

00:26:08,578 --> 00:26:09,918
SPEAKER_1:  Quite a lot more women.

00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,294
SPEAKER_1:  dream vividly than men.

00:26:12,258 --> 00:26:13,854
SPEAKER_1:  which I actually found my chaos survey. So here you are!

00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,870
SPEAKER_1:  I did a survey, maybe you know the...

00:26:16,226 --> 00:26:20,351
SPEAKER_1:  I know everything, remember? You do know, yes, I'm sorry. So as you clearly know.

00:26:20,351 --> 00:26:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  I'm trying not to talk down to you through this conversation and I not only know everything.

00:26:24,962 --> 00:26:27,710
SPEAKER_0:  I know how your future looks like. Really?

00:26:27,938 --> 00:26:29,813
SPEAKER_0:  and how everything ends.

00:26:29,813 --> 00:26:32,126
SPEAKER_1:  So you could probably win all the prediction markets on my life.

00:26:32,994 --> 00:26:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  So, well, we should also mention that you have like prediction markets, you have like votes.

00:26:38,498 --> 00:26:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  The, what's the site called again?

00:26:40,514 --> 00:26:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  Manifold. Manifold.

00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,598
SPEAKER_0:  And one of them was, will I be on the Lex Friedman podcast? Yeah.

00:26:46,178 --> 00:26:46,878
SPEAKER_0:  And I voted.

00:26:47,234 --> 00:26:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  I invested everything I own into the S. Is there such thing as insider trading on there? Is that goes against the terms of it?

00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:58,878
SPEAKER_1:  No, I think I'm trying to use part of the information. So it's supposed to be.

00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  And then I realized it's actually public information that I voted, because I think my face shows up there and I was like, damn it.

00:27:05,634 --> 00:27:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  It's going to influence it.

00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  You could make the fake account or I could be lying, right?

00:27:10,914 --> 00:27:12,789
SPEAKER_0:  I could be and then dump the stuff.

00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:19,006
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I try to manipulate, somebody made a market like, is Ayla going to post a poll spelled P-O-L-E on her Twitter, like a photo?

00:27:19,426 --> 00:27:23,390
SPEAKER_1:  And I was like, I'm going to manipulate this market. So I like fucked around with it and I voted no.

00:27:23,618 --> 00:27:25,726
SPEAKER_1:  And then I accidentally posted a photo of a pole.

00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:26,782
SPEAKER_1:  without thinking.

00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:30,087
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, but that's like self-sabotage. Yeah, I accidentally.

00:27:30,087 --> 00:27:30,494
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:27:30,786 --> 00:27:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  fact that my own market doesn't, that's like the reverse of insider training. Yeah. Uh, what were we talking about? The women and the men and the difference to vivid dreams.

00:27:39,362 --> 00:27:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  and the markets.

00:27:40,802 --> 00:27:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  If you go with the market, oh, because I can perfectly predict your future, but then it's not fun. I like the romance of unpredictability.

00:27:47,746 --> 00:27:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  And so I like to, even though I know everything, I like to forget everything.

00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:54,846
SPEAKER_0:  My very Buddhist of you. Yeah, the river.

00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:57,699
SPEAKER_0:  No man in the river once, whatever, just footsteps.

00:27:57,699 --> 00:28:09,470
SPEAKER_1:  That's one of my favorite questions. It's like, if you could press a button and then have all of your wants fulfilled, anything that you want. So it's like such a rapid degree that you don't really experience the want. Like as the want arises, it then is f-

00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,078
SPEAKER_1:  Like.

00:28:10,338 --> 00:28:13,150
SPEAKER_1:  completed as immediately so that you are completely without want.

00:28:13,602 --> 00:28:14,238
SPEAKER_1:  Like would you?

00:28:14,786 --> 00:28:17,502
SPEAKER_1:  Would you press that button? 100% not. Yeah, I didn't think you would. No.

00:28:19,234 --> 00:28:19,582
SPEAKER_0:  No.

00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  Because...

00:28:20,578 --> 00:28:24,670
SPEAKER_0:  Immediately everything starts being fun. The first, it's only fun the first time. But if you want it to be fun.

00:28:25,154 --> 00:28:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  But like, what would be my source of fun?

00:28:26,946 --> 00:28:29,182
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like I would like on day.

00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  for just to get off, I would need to like.

00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:33,758
SPEAKER_0:  do like nuclear war.

00:28:34,818 --> 00:28:38,014
SPEAKER_0:  still escalate quickly.

00:28:39,586 --> 00:28:43,806
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like if everything is possible, I assume you mean like something that like.

00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  is not just normal human things. Yeah, magical world. Magical world and you start escalating really quickly.

00:28:50,306 --> 00:28:51,230
SPEAKER_0:  Like, I wonder.

00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  I'll probably do like, I want everybody to just.

00:28:54,626 --> 00:28:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  flying to the air and hovering the air.

00:28:57,602 --> 00:28:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  Everybody.

00:28:59,298 --> 00:29:00,414
SPEAKER_0:  And then you're like, oh.

00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,206
SPEAKER_0:  Life is meaningless.

00:29:02,562 --> 00:29:05,022
SPEAKER_0:  Like why does, like you go, I feel like you get.

00:29:06,114 --> 00:29:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

00:29:07,074 --> 00:29:10,206
SPEAKER_0:  No, actually that would be a really interesting experiment, like what are the limits?

00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  Like are we all capable of becoming psychopaths essentially?

00:29:15,074 --> 00:29:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  Like.

00:29:17,186 --> 00:29:20,094
SPEAKER_0:  I like to believe not, there's very hard limits.

00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,302
SPEAKER_0:  on that, like in our own mind.

00:29:22,626 --> 00:29:23,102
SPEAKER_0:  I cough.

00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,286
SPEAKER_0:  basic compassion.

00:29:24,674 --> 00:29:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  Because I love being compassionate towards other human beings. And it's one of the things I think about if you give me power, like a lot of power, like absolute power.

00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

00:29:32,642 --> 00:29:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  That's the power you mentioned is the scariest kind of power.

00:29:35,938 --> 00:29:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  Cause it's like

00:29:37,282 --> 00:29:42,174
SPEAKER_0:  It's not even power in this normal world. It's like magical power where you lose.

00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  It's a dream world power where you like video game power. You don't even think of it as reality.

00:29:48,066 --> 00:29:49,342
SPEAKER_0:  You could just mess with the world.

00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like that's terrifying.

00:29:51,426 --> 00:29:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, you basically be God.

00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  God, yeah.

00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  But without like...

00:29:56,802 --> 00:29:57,214
SPEAKER_0:  cake.

00:29:58,178 --> 00:29:59,134
SPEAKER_0:  The idea of God.

00:29:59,426 --> 00:30:00,318
SPEAKER_0:  What's like a

00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  things like.

00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  functioning properly.

00:30:04,066 --> 00:30:07,038
SPEAKER_1:  And then you'd probably, if you wanted to keep them functioning properly.

00:30:07,298 --> 00:30:07,774
SPEAKER_1:  than it would.

00:30:08,418 --> 00:30:11,966
SPEAKER_1:  Like you would never experience a time where you're like, oh no, that was a mistake.

00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,710
SPEAKER_1:  Because before you even experience that, the world would shift to...

00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:16,446
SPEAKER_1:  to mash it.

00:30:17,218 --> 00:30:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  Interesting.

00:30:18,114 --> 00:30:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  No, I think I would actually, I take it back. I think I would regret.

00:30:21,442 --> 00:30:23,006
SPEAKER_0:  the first time I hurt somebody.

00:30:24,258 --> 00:30:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  See, my visualization was like a video game.

00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  where everybody's like, NPC really dumb. No, I think the first time I witnessed.

00:30:31,938 --> 00:30:33,214
SPEAKER_0:  paying from anybody.

00:30:33,474 --> 00:30:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  That's when I would stop.

00:30:34,818 --> 00:30:36,958
SPEAKER_0:  and I would probably run into that very quickly.

00:30:38,114 --> 00:30:38,494
SPEAKER_0:  Okay

00:30:38,818 --> 00:30:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  Like even just the hovering.

00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  Make a person hover.

00:30:41,922 --> 00:30:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  And they're going to be probably really upset with the hovering, right?

00:30:44,866 --> 00:30:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  And so I'm gonna be like, no, don't do that anymore.

00:30:47,842 --> 00:30:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  And then I'll probably go to, I don't know, I'll just return back to my normal life.

00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:56,798
SPEAKER_1:  That's kind of what I feel like. Like if I had the power to do anything, I think-

00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:00,926
SPEAKER_1:  I would probably want to have a life very similar to where I am now.

00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I mean, there's it's like with Uber, like it'd be probably more convenient to do certain things.

00:31:07,778 --> 00:31:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  But even then...

00:31:09,442 --> 00:31:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  Like the struggle, like I got a flat tire, so I have to fix that.

00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  I can't end up the flat tire mix

00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  makes everything more.

00:31:17,346 --> 00:31:17,886
SPEAKER_0:  beautiful.

00:31:18,306 --> 00:31:18,878
SPEAKER_0:  Was that cool?

00:31:19,138 --> 00:31:20,094
SPEAKER_0:  I could do like a normal.

00:31:20,418 --> 00:31:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  manual thing.

00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:27,550
SPEAKER_0:  But also it makes you appreciate your car, appreciate transportation, appreciate the convenience of transportation.

00:31:27,842 --> 00:31:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  All of it.

00:31:28,674 --> 00:31:32,350
SPEAKER_1:  I know some people who would call this a bunch of copium.

00:31:32,674 --> 00:31:39,198
SPEAKER_1:  you're just sort of making do with what you have. Like we wouldn't go back to Amish times or like pre-technology because-

00:31:39,618 --> 00:31:42,526
SPEAKER_1:  in order to make ourselves appreciate things more.

00:31:42,754 --> 00:31:44,510
SPEAKER_1:  And so this seems like a hindsight reasoning.

00:31:44,898 --> 00:31:45,310
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:47,518
SPEAKER_1:  which I can appreciate that argument, but.

00:31:48,002 --> 00:31:48,414
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know.

00:31:48,898 --> 00:31:49,406
SPEAKER_1:  And I'm like...

00:31:49,858 --> 00:31:53,150
SPEAKER_0:  Anyone who uses site to interrupt the word copium in their...

00:31:53,634 --> 00:31:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  in their argumentation.

00:31:55,778 --> 00:31:58,622
SPEAKER_0: , I think it's sauce

00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:01,726
SPEAKER_1:  That's my entire argument now.

00:32:01,858 --> 00:32:07,262
SPEAKER_0:  No, I'm just kidding. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Sorry. I interrupted rudely the floor thought.

00:32:07,714 --> 00:32:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  but you don't think so.

00:32:10,402 --> 00:32:12,254
SPEAKER_0:  In part, you disagree with that kind of argument.

00:32:12,578 --> 00:32:13,054
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:32:13,858 --> 00:32:17,886
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, because I think people have this idea that if you...

00:32:18,306 --> 00:32:23,742
SPEAKER_1:  like come to accept or like find meaning in what you have now. This is sort of at odds with trying to improve it.

00:32:24,866 --> 00:32:25,342
SPEAKER_1:  End.

00:32:25,762 --> 00:32:29,918
SPEAKER_1:  I don't find this to be the case. I find the attempt to improve it to also be part of it.

00:32:30,562 --> 00:32:37,598
SPEAKER_1:  Like I enjoy the fact that there's something like problematic going on because now I get the experience of like striving to make it go away.

00:32:37,858 --> 00:32:43,678
SPEAKER_1:  And like that in itself is where the meaning lies. It's not just that things are bad, it's that there's things are bad and we're trying to stop it and also.

00:32:44,354 --> 00:32:44,894
SPEAKER_1:  Exactly.

00:32:45,122 --> 00:32:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  this.

00:32:45,826 --> 00:32:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  If you combine that with a sense of optimism that the future can be better, yeah, that fits.

00:32:50,658 --> 00:32:53,406
SPEAKER_0:  feeds into this productive effort of making things better.

00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:59,070
SPEAKER_0:  and it somehow makes the vision of the things that are better more intense.

00:32:59,906 --> 00:33:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  having experienced shitty things.

00:33:02,178 --> 00:33:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:33:05,474 --> 00:33:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  So we talked about free will and consciousness and what drives human civilization.

00:33:09,442 --> 00:33:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  Question left unanswered.

00:33:11,586 --> 00:33:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  uh

00:33:12,514 --> 00:33:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  It's a homework problem for the reader.

00:33:14,754 --> 00:33:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

00:33:17,346 --> 00:33:20,350
SPEAKER_1:  I'm going to get a scoreboard at the end, the amount of questions.

00:33:20,802 --> 00:33:23,230
SPEAKER_1:  The answer? Successfully versus not.

00:33:23,362 --> 00:33:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  holes.

00:33:24,322 --> 00:33:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  Can we talk about some practical things? Sure.

00:33:28,194 --> 00:33:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  So one of the many amazing things I think of you as a researcher.

00:33:32,546 --> 00:33:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  But you've also been

00:33:35,362 --> 00:33:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

00:33:36,258 --> 00:33:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  doing research in the field.

00:33:38,402 --> 00:33:41,077
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, fieldwork. Fieldwork. Shink it all.

00:33:41,077 --> 00:33:45,726
SPEAKER_0:  I love sex work. Yeah, right. How did you get?

00:33:45,954 --> 00:33:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  What's the

00:33:47,618 --> 00:33:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  the short and the long story of how you got into sex work.

00:33:50,786 --> 00:33:52,158
SPEAKER_1:  How did I get into sex work? Thanks for complaining, thank you!

00:33:52,514 --> 00:33:54,878
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, there's a whole like childhood thing where I was...

00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:56,446
SPEAKER_1:  conservatively homeschooled.

00:33:57,058 --> 00:34:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  Do you want to actually talk about your childhood? I think it's interesting because you also worked at a factory. It's like your childhood is really...

00:34:03,202 --> 00:34:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  Fascinating.

00:34:04,258 --> 00:34:05,182
SPEAKER_0:  and difficult.

00:34:05,442 --> 00:34:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  uh... traumatic

00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:07,646
SPEAKER_0:  So, um...

00:34:08,066 --> 00:34:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  and you've written about it.

00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:12,798
SPEAKER_0:  There's a lot of ways we could talk about it, but maybe...

00:34:14,082 --> 00:34:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  What are the things you remember?

00:34:16,738 --> 00:34:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  the good and the bad of your childhood, maybe interaction with your father.

00:34:20,994 --> 00:34:27,454
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, my dad probably has narcissistic personality disorder, and so it was very centered on very controlling childhood.

00:34:27,906 --> 00:34:31,006
SPEAKER_1:  immensely so. We were homeschooled and

00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:35,486
SPEAKER_1:  pretty isolated from the outside world, like we didn't know anybody else who wasn't homeschooled.

00:34:36,098 --> 00:34:39,198
SPEAKER_1:  We went through a program called Growing Kids God's Way, which was.

00:34:39,554 --> 00:34:44,734
SPEAKER_1:  It was like the kind of program where you're not supposed to pick up babies when they cry to train them that they can't manipulate the parents.

00:34:45,218 --> 00:34:47,070
SPEAKER_1:  because like baby crying was viewed as like.

00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:52,094
SPEAKER_1:  You're just teaching them from an early age that they're allowed to make the parents do what the kids want.

00:34:52,386 --> 00:34:54,174
SPEAKER_1:  And we're very against this philosophy.

00:34:54,498 --> 00:34:55,454
SPEAKER_1:  So, you know, that.

00:34:55,714 --> 00:34:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  combined with a narcissistic personality disorder, my dad was pretty rough.

00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:01,662
SPEAKER_0:  Uh... So controlling...

00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  Super controlling, yeah. And developing and feeding the self-critical aspect of your brain.

00:35:06,754 --> 00:35:14,942
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, very much. I was like lazy, I was never going to accomplish anything in life. I was going to move out of the house and realize how good I had it at home, you know, the classic of.

00:35:15,618 --> 00:35:19,422
SPEAKER_1:  He was very logical and smart though. And so he'd also like teach us.

00:35:20,002 --> 00:35:24,734
SPEAKER_1:  logic stuff. I remember some of my earliest memories are him like giving me basic logic puzzles like

00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:29,694
SPEAKER_1:  The dog has three legs, you know, how many dogs have four legs? I would mess up and...

00:35:30,466 --> 00:35:34,078
SPEAKER_1:  But he was a evangelist, basically a Christian evangelist.

00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:39,326
SPEAKER_1:  We did like Bible study five nights a week. I memorized, I think, 800 verses of the Bible.

00:35:39,618 --> 00:35:41,310
SPEAKER_1:  by the time before I became an adult.

00:35:42,146 --> 00:35:42,526
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:35:43,522 --> 00:35:45,662
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it was very patriarchal also.

00:35:46,306 --> 00:35:48,222
SPEAKER_1:  So I was expected to grow up and become a housewife.

00:35:48,578 --> 00:35:53,470
SPEAKER_1:  basically. They're like, oh, you can go to college to meet a man and also to get a little bit of education so that you can homeschool your own kids.

00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:57,438
SPEAKER_1:  Like we were explicitly told that women were subordinate to men.

00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:05,470
SPEAKER_1:  in regards to making decisions when you're married. Our pastor's daughter was not allowed to leave home because she would be outside of the authority of a man.

00:36:05,858 --> 00:36:11,582
SPEAKER_1:  So when she got married, she was allowed to leave because she was never allowed to live in a house where she was not under a hierarchy.

00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,438
SPEAKER_1:  So this is like the kind of culture that-

00:36:13,602 --> 00:36:14,942
SPEAKER_0:  So there's a hierarchy.

00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:19,998
SPEAKER_0:  And the gender aspect of the hierarchy, is men at the top of the hierarchy.

00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:20,734
SPEAKER_0:  at the top.

00:36:21,698 --> 00:36:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, but your own psychology, your own mind.

00:36:25,634 --> 00:36:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  So most of that self-critical.

00:36:28,162 --> 00:36:28,702
SPEAKER_0:  brain.

00:36:29,058 --> 00:36:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  is bad, right?

00:36:30,658 --> 00:36:33,566
SPEAKER_1:  It was confusing because he told me that I was smart but also that I would fail.

00:36:34,434 --> 00:36:35,559
SPEAKER_1:  But I think...

00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  smart enough.

00:36:36,674 --> 00:36:38,215
SPEAKER_0:  Right? Like smart, but not smart.

00:36:38,215 --> 00:36:40,478
SPEAKER_1:  Smart but like not virtuous or something.

00:36:40,706 --> 00:36:44,081
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, so there's, okay, right, there's always a flaw.

00:36:44,081 --> 00:36:45,150
SPEAKER_1:  There's always a flaw.

00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:50,878
SPEAKER_1:  I think a lot of it was a lot of the fucked up this of my brain came from feeling like I didn't have the authority to think.

00:36:51,362 --> 00:36:53,662
SPEAKER_1:  because it was so carefully.

00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:55,614
SPEAKER_1:  like suppressed, like the.

00:36:56,066 --> 00:37:01,182
SPEAKER_1:  My ability to express or have any sort of power was just absolutely annihilated, like systemically.

00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:07,390
SPEAKER_1:  like psychologically, they would do like psychological torture mechanisms to make sure that like I wasn't actually thinking on my own.

00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:08,094
SPEAKER_1:  or like...

00:37:08,482 --> 00:37:11,102
SPEAKER_1:  being able to deviate from anything anybody ever told me.

00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,150
SPEAKER_1:  to the degree that it's still ingrained in me.

00:37:13,506 --> 00:37:16,446
SPEAKER_1:  I once was a friend we were traveling and he wanted me to hop a turnstile.

00:37:16,738 --> 00:37:22,526
SPEAKER_1:  It was like very late at night, the train was here, and I could not physically force myself to do it. Like he was like yelling at me, like, come on, do it.

00:37:23,202 --> 00:37:26,846
SPEAKER_1:  No, but I was trying so hard to make my body cross the line and it was just.

00:37:27,074 --> 00:37:31,902
SPEAKER_1:  It's like embedded in my physical being to like be unable to do stuff like that, which is really annoying.

00:37:32,674 --> 00:37:35,646
SPEAKER_0:  that you're not free to take action in this world. Yeah, some of-

00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:38,846
SPEAKER_1:  So that was, I think, the most.

00:37:39,138 --> 00:37:41,822
SPEAKER_1:  annoying part of my upbringing.

00:37:44,034 --> 00:37:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  Would you classify it as suffering?

00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,158
SPEAKER_1:  At the time, yeah, definitely.

00:37:48,514 --> 00:37:51,294
SPEAKER_1:  Well, it's confusing because when I was a child, it was...

00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:53,886
SPEAKER_1:  It was just painful in the sense that like things suck.

00:37:54,242 --> 00:37:55,710
SPEAKER_1:  but it was placed in a meaning framework.

00:37:56,034 --> 00:38:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  Right? Like, it is good, it is virtuous to submit to your parents and do what they want. And if they tell you to say goodbye to your best friend forever and never talk to them again, you go do that.

00:38:03,938 --> 00:38:04,862
SPEAKER_1:  without complaining.

00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,198
SPEAKER_1:  And so like I would go do something like that.

00:38:07,522 --> 00:38:13,406
SPEAKER_1:  and it would suck. It really was concretely painful, but it was also placed in this narrative where I was like...

00:38:13,794 --> 00:38:15,230
SPEAKER_1:  filling some sort of greater purpose.

00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:23,550
SPEAKER_1:  And so it's very confusing to refer to it as suffering, because there's so many painful things we do today that are placed in the narrative of greater purpose.

00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:27,454
SPEAKER_1:  that I think I would agree with. I go get a medical procedure done, and that sucks.

00:38:27,682 --> 00:38:29,054
SPEAKER_1:  But I'm like, ah, this is helping me.

00:38:29,282 --> 00:38:35,166
SPEAKER_1:  in the long run. But like say if I got abducted to an alien planet and they're like, by the way, all of those medical procedures you got done, like.

00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:39,647
SPEAKER_1:  you didn't have to get them done, those are totally unnecessary, that I might get really upset about it.

00:38:39,647 --> 00:38:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  trust those aliens though because they probably want to do different medical procedures than you. This is true.

00:38:43,746 --> 00:38:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  I saw it.

00:38:45,154 --> 00:38:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  I saw a thumbnail.

00:38:47,842 --> 00:38:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  for video.

00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,294
SPEAKER_0:  that I'm proud of myself for not clicking on.

00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:54,462
SPEAKER_0:  about a man who has claimed that he had sex with aliens.

00:38:55,522 --> 00:38:59,966
SPEAKER_0:  And I was like, Oh, for not clicking on that, because I was one because I would probably watch it.

00:39:00,418 --> 00:39:01,534
SPEAKER_0:  for like 20 minutes.

00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:04,574
SPEAKER_0:  and then I should be doing work. Oh, I see.

00:39:05,186 --> 00:39:07,710
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm actually...

00:39:08,162 --> 00:39:08,702
SPEAKER_0:  Happy.

00:39:08,962 --> 00:39:10,046
SPEAKER_0:  because I get to imagine.

00:39:10,594 --> 00:39:13,758
SPEAKER_0:  What is the, all the different possibilities that could have been.

00:39:14,178 --> 00:39:17,694
SPEAKER_1:  that man who is such a really high like resting happiness state.

00:39:17,986 --> 00:39:20,510
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, yeah, it's probably like a mushroom state, yeah.

00:39:21,122 --> 00:39:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  Wow.

00:39:21,762 --> 00:39:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  Do you do mushrooms?

00:39:23,106 --> 00:39:25,694
SPEAKER_0:  I've done mushrooms before, it was very awesome.

00:39:26,754 --> 00:39:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  but like more intensely awesome.

00:39:29,058 --> 00:39:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  but

00:39:30,082 --> 00:39:30,878
SPEAKER_0:  But like, like.

00:39:31,266 --> 00:39:35,710
SPEAKER_0:  Because I just look at nature, it makes nature even more beautiful, I think.

00:39:36,066 --> 00:39:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  but it's already pretty beautiful.

00:39:38,082 --> 00:39:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  Evan Dunn MDMA.

00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:39:41,122 --> 00:39:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  People say that I should. It's very nice.

00:39:44,866 --> 00:39:49,741
SPEAKER_0:  Anyway, but I already yeah, what did you call it? Resting happiness.

00:39:49,741 --> 00:39:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, high resting happiness.

00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, that's a good way to describe it. But it's not like some of it is genetic.

00:39:57,346 --> 00:39:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  that you're able to notice the beauty in the world than some of it is.

00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  practiced where you realize focusing on the negative things in life.

00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  like unproductively.

00:40:08,866 --> 00:40:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  is uh...

00:40:10,914 --> 00:40:12,798
SPEAKER_0:  It just doesn't help your mind.

00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  flourish.

00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,454
SPEAKER_0:  So like you just noticed that and it's like.

00:40:16,194 --> 00:40:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I think people with depression.

00:40:18,498 --> 00:40:23,422
SPEAKER_0:  Learn that or like probably with trauma to is like there's certain triggers

00:40:23,714 --> 00:40:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  Like if you're, if you suffer from depression.

00:40:26,274 --> 00:40:31,070
SPEAKER_0:  You have to kind of constantly know there's going to be triggers that will spark like force you to spiral down

00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,814
SPEAKER_0:  So just avoid those triggers. Some people have that with diet, food and so on.

00:40:35,394 --> 00:40:37,310
SPEAKER_0:  So I just don't like whenever.

00:40:37,634 --> 00:40:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  There's, uh, shitty things happening with shitty people.

00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  Unless I can help. Unless I can somehow help.

00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  Like, why focus on it?

00:40:46,498 --> 00:40:47,678
SPEAKER_0:  Anyway, uh...

00:40:49,634 --> 00:40:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  Back to your upbringing, what uh...

00:40:52,994 --> 00:40:55,070
SPEAKER_0:  What was the journey of escaping that?

00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:56,670
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:40:57,026 --> 00:41:00,574
SPEAKER_1:  I left home kind of early because...

00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:01,150
SPEAKER_1:  Bye.

00:41:01,442 --> 00:41:03,934
SPEAKER_1:  My dad and I were not getting along by the time I was a teenager.

00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:14,590
SPEAKER_1:  But I was still Christian for a while. And I lost my faith after I think I moved away and I started having friends that weren't religious or like weren't raised in the super conservative environment that I came from.

00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:19,038
SPEAKER_1:  And I think this was not conscious at the time. This is my hindsight story.

00:41:19,362 --> 00:41:20,286
SPEAKER_1:  But I believe that.

00:41:20,994 --> 00:41:27,486
SPEAKER_1:  Like being exposed to a culture in which I had the capacity to believe, like allowed my brain to actually seriously consider the thought that maybe.

00:41:27,746 --> 00:41:29,310
SPEAKER_1:  All of this stuff was untrue.

00:41:29,698 --> 00:41:31,742
SPEAKER_1:  that I had been taught like 6,000 year old earth and.

00:41:32,098 --> 00:41:34,494
SPEAKER_1:  Evolution is a lie, you know, macro evolution.

00:41:35,074 --> 00:41:35,710
SPEAKER_1:  all of this stuff.

00:41:36,418 --> 00:41:36,766
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

00:41:37,026 --> 00:41:41,854
SPEAKER_1:  Because when you're immersed in an environment like that, I don't think you actually have a choice.

00:41:42,146 --> 00:41:45,374
SPEAKER_1:  Like your brain has to believe these things because this is a survival thing.

00:41:45,826 --> 00:41:49,502
SPEAKER_1:  Like, if you believe this, you'll be, like, if you believe the wrong thing, you'll be totally cast out.

00:41:49,922 --> 00:41:53,278
SPEAKER_1:  Even if they're not gonna cast you out, you're gonna be cast out in communion with others.

00:41:53,602 --> 00:41:55,422
SPEAKER_1:  because we were always told that you can't like trust.

00:41:55,778 --> 00:41:58,494
SPEAKER_1:  non-believers really. They don't have a moral compass.

00:41:58,754 --> 00:41:59,710
SPEAKER_1:  I'm gonna screw you over.

00:42:00,194 --> 00:42:03,518
SPEAKER_1:  And so I'm like, oh, I can't be that. Like everybody's going to outcast me internally.

00:42:03,778 --> 00:42:10,014
SPEAKER_1:  So anyway, I don't think I actually had the capacity to seriously question my faith, even though I thought that I was questioning it quite hard.

00:42:10,466 --> 00:42:12,862
SPEAKER_1:  until I got into an environment where it was safe to do so.

00:42:13,442 --> 00:42:17,534
SPEAKER_1:  And once I started being able to make friends who were not religious, I'm like, oh, if I lose my faith,

00:42:17,858 --> 00:42:19,486
SPEAKER_1:  I'm still gonna have some sort of community.

00:42:20,098 --> 00:42:24,030
SPEAKER_1:  And then at that time I went through some questioning and then I lost my faith.

00:42:24,994 --> 00:42:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  So in that, given your friends, given your situation, you now have the freedom to think, essentially.

00:42:31,234 --> 00:42:31,614
SPEAKER_1:  Mm-hmm.

00:42:31,938 --> 00:42:35,422
SPEAKER_1:  Or at least the ability to think of something that was acceptable in the new culture, yeah.

00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  without.

00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, is there a danger of like adopting?

00:42:41,218 --> 00:42:42,526
SPEAKER_0:  the beliefs of the new culture.

00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:43,806
SPEAKER_0:  So like.

00:42:44,322 --> 00:42:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  There's some aspect of just being able to think freely, which you weren't able to do when you were growing up.

00:42:49,826 --> 00:42:50,750
SPEAKER_0:  Just a think.

00:42:51,394 --> 00:42:53,662
SPEAKER_0:  Like look at the world and wonder how it works.

00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:54,622
SPEAKER_0:  That kind of thing.

00:42:55,714 --> 00:42:59,262
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, you work it within certain boundaries. Like there are certain basic assumptions.

00:42:59,938 --> 00:43:02,078
SPEAKER_1:  and as long as you are following those basic assumptions.

00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:05,150
SPEAKER_1:  Which is, to be fair, is kind of what we're doing now. We have-

00:43:05,442 --> 00:43:12,158
SPEAKER_1:  I have I gone done the personal research that like evolution is the thing that's going on? Have I looked at like the age of the stones? No, I haven't. I'm trusting other people.

00:43:12,802 --> 00:43:14,046
SPEAKER_1:  which I think is like a fair-

00:43:14,434 --> 00:43:16,871
SPEAKER_1:  choice to make given where I'm at right now.

00:43:16,871 --> 00:43:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  you're also assuming like

00:43:18,754 --> 00:43:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  There's causality in the universe, time is real.

00:43:21,442 --> 00:43:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:43:22,146 --> 00:43:22,558
SPEAKER_0:  that.

00:43:23,138 --> 00:43:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  Like that first of all, the thing that your senses are perceiving is real.

00:43:28,098 --> 00:43:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  You're assuming a lot of things.

00:43:30,626 --> 00:43:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I think it's better just to become aware of the assumptions you're making, like as opposed to not making those assumptions at all.

00:43:36,194 --> 00:43:37,438
SPEAKER_1:  that you have to assume something.

00:43:37,826 --> 00:43:42,750
SPEAKER_1:  And I did, it's very suspicious, right, that I went out of this very conservative culture. And now I, well I guess I don't-

00:43:43,170 --> 00:44:00,702
SPEAKER_1:  believe things that are super in line with the current culture. I think this is why I feel a little bit safer right now, because when I was Christian, I believed generally Christian things. But now I believe a bunch of things that people really hate. I get canceled online all the time. I'm like, okay, this is a sign that maybe you're thinking independently if you're able to think things that are completely at odds with the people around you. So often the guy he knows, he's really going to be really good at talking about these things, partly that he believes in the people he currently believes in this day. And he's like, you know, and you tell people, you explain things they heard, that it's like, this guy, and they're doing something different. And now maybe he feels like something didn't.

00:44:00,994 --> 00:44:04,670
SPEAKER_1:  And to be fair, this is a little bit easier to do when it's like general culture.

00:44:05,026 --> 00:44:09,566
SPEAKER_1:  but it's much harder to do with your peer group. Like the people that you trust, your friends, the people whose opinions you respect.

00:44:10,402 --> 00:44:12,222
SPEAKER_1:  Disagreeing with those people is-

00:44:12,514 --> 00:44:14,110
SPEAKER_1:  very difficult and I'm not very good at it.

00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:16,510
SPEAKER_0:  I do think that...

00:44:16,994 --> 00:44:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  If you establish yourself as a person who can be trusted.

00:44:20,578 --> 00:44:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  and as a good human being, you have a lot more freedom.

00:44:24,002 --> 00:44:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  to then explore ideas that are

00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:27,070
SPEAKER_0:  different from your peer group.

00:44:27,938 --> 00:44:29,278
SPEAKER_0:  So like those seem like a-

00:44:29,602 --> 00:44:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  if you separate the space of ideas versus.

00:44:32,514 --> 00:44:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  some kind of like deeper sense of what this person is.

00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  Like that they're an interesting and trustworthy and good human being.

00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:41,182
SPEAKER_1:  Ah, there we go.

00:44:41,506 --> 00:44:45,566
SPEAKER_1:  Is there somebody that you respect who you consider significantly smarter than you?

00:44:45,826 --> 00:44:46,270
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:44:46,498 --> 00:44:47,870
SPEAKER_1:  Can you imagine believing?

00:44:48,322 --> 00:44:48,734
SPEAKER_1:  Un...

00:44:48,994 --> 00:44:51,390
SPEAKER_1:  idea that you've heard them talk really disdainfully about.

00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:55,358
SPEAKER_1:  Like, how would you feel coming to me, like, I believe this thing that you find to be?

00:44:56,514 --> 00:44:57,214
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I do all the-

00:44:57,602 --> 00:44:58,046
SPEAKER_0:  Oh yeah?

00:44:58,754 --> 00:45:01,379
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe braver than me.

00:45:01,379 --> 00:45:05,086
SPEAKER_1:  And to be fair, I support doing this, like I try to do this, but I think like...

00:45:05,314 --> 00:45:08,638
SPEAKER_1:  subconsciously I notice that I don't do it as much.

00:45:09,122 --> 00:45:12,542
SPEAKER_1:  And so I'm suspicious of myself. I'm like, I wonder if I'm hiding to myself.

00:45:12,994 --> 00:45:16,030
SPEAKER_1:  like actual curiosity about things that might deviate from my peer group.

00:45:16,258 --> 00:45:19,838
SPEAKER_1:  because I notice that I'm not actually deviating with them as much as I do with the outside world.

00:45:20,034 --> 00:45:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  That's interesting. I mean, like, because I do see most people I interact with as smarter than me, but I also have this intuitive feeling that...

00:45:26,434 --> 00:45:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

00:45:27,138 --> 00:45:30,014
SPEAKER_0:  dumb people, which I consider myself being, have wisdom.

00:45:32,002 --> 00:45:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  So like in the disagreement, actually, I also believe in the power of conversation and in the tension of disagreement.

00:45:38,786 --> 00:45:40,126
SPEAKER_0:  So I think even just.

00:45:40,386 --> 00:45:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  disagreeing from a place.

00:45:42,786 --> 00:45:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  from a

00:45:43,362 --> 00:45:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  good place from a place of like love and respect for each other.

00:45:47,554 --> 00:45:48,030
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:53,598
SPEAKER_0:  I just believe in that. So it's not like individuals, you're disagreeing. You're like working towards.

00:45:54,082 --> 00:45:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  arriving at some deeper truth together.

00:45:56,322 --> 00:45:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  Even if the other person is...

00:45:59,202 --> 00:46:00,542
SPEAKER_0:  is smarter. Maybe that's.

00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:02,334
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe that's how I justify it for myself.

00:46:02,594 --> 00:46:06,974
SPEAKER_0:  I'm also a fan of conversations because I've seen just listening to conversations.

00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:11,006
SPEAKER_0:  It seems like a great conversation. More.

00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  emerges from it than the sum of its parts.

00:46:15,618 --> 00:46:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  Like somehow two people together can do.

00:46:18,562 --> 00:46:20,542
SPEAKER_0:  Like that dance of ideas can somehow create.

00:46:20,962 --> 00:46:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:46:21,666 --> 00:46:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  created cool thing. By the way, I enjoyed, I saw a video of you dancing.

00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,174
SPEAKER_0:  at a bar drunk.

00:46:28,034 --> 00:46:33,022
SPEAKER_0:  It wasn't the bar drunk. It didn't look drunk, but just the dancing. It was like ballroom dancing type of thing.

00:46:33,314 --> 00:46:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, something like that.

00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:38,270
SPEAKER_0:  I've been doing a bit of tango dancing. I like it.

00:46:38,498 --> 00:46:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  Argentina?

00:46:40,034 --> 00:46:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  Nice.

00:46:40,802 --> 00:46:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  I like stuff with the body in general, like wrestling or combat.

00:46:44,866 --> 00:46:46,174
SPEAKER_0:  Usually when there's a tension.

00:46:46,594 --> 00:46:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  You have to understand the mechanics of how two bodies move.

00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,254
SPEAKER_0:  when they're in conflict and dancing is...

00:46:54,114 --> 00:46:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  similar.

00:46:55,202 --> 00:46:55,582
SPEAKER_0:  haha

00:46:55,778 --> 00:47:05,406
SPEAKER_1:  Like you have to do rapid thinking also, like rapid intuitive physical thinking. And that's my favorite kind of thing. Like a lot of exercise is really boring to me because you can just do it while your brain's off.

00:47:05,954 --> 00:47:23,422
SPEAKER_1:  But something like ballroom dancing or fusion dancing, you have to constantly be figuring out, like it's a rapid puzzle, and that's so wonderful. What's fusion dancing? That's the video. Fusion dancing is like, if you have any sort of dance background, you can come and you just kind of mix those together. Oh, just kind of improvise. So you can have people doing ballet, with people doing ballroom, with people doing blues.

00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:27,550
SPEAKER_0:  And then there's an interesting dynamic, cause there's, I don't know, maybe you can correct me, but.

00:47:28,098 --> 00:47:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  There's a, that's very meta. There's usually a lead and a follow.

00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  I guess most dances have that. Yeah.

00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:35,902
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, and so that.

00:47:36,418 --> 00:47:40,222
SPEAKER_0:  but both have a different, like you both have to be quite sensitive to the other human being.

00:47:40,578 --> 00:47:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  but in a different way.

00:47:43,106 --> 00:47:43,710
SPEAKER_0:  It's interesting.

00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. So I like both that there is that definitive role.

00:47:49,474 --> 00:47:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  Mm-hmm.

00:47:50,786 --> 00:47:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  but also...

00:47:53,282 --> 00:47:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  it's not somehow that one is better than the other. There's an interesting tension between the two.

00:47:57,986 --> 00:48:02,174
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's good because it's like a basic rule set that allows for a ton of expression.

00:48:02,786 --> 00:48:07,774
SPEAKER_1:  I've recently started to experiment with reverse leading. It's not like back leading, it's like...

00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:09,822
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know, like sometimes I was like.

00:48:11,298 --> 00:48:12,542
SPEAKER_1:  so you can read as a follow.

00:48:12,802 --> 00:48:17,758
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, you can leave. What I'm typically following, I'll occasionally throw in a little lead here and there.

00:48:17,858 --> 00:48:20,414
SPEAKER_0:  But don't you kind of always... Oh, I see.

00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:21,246
SPEAKER_0:  We did.

00:48:21,922 --> 00:48:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  Don't you hint?

00:48:23,554 --> 00:48:23,902
SPEAKER_0:  at

00:48:24,674 --> 00:48:25,950
SPEAKER_0:  a lead when you're following.

00:48:26,722 --> 00:48:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  Like don't you just buy the dynamics of your movement.

00:48:29,954 --> 00:48:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  You're not perfectly following.

00:48:31,714 --> 00:48:32,862
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, because there is like...

00:48:33,634 --> 00:48:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  The lead is listening to your body, right? Yeah,

00:48:36,898 --> 00:48:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  Sike.

00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  You're kinda...

00:48:39,426 --> 00:48:41,301
SPEAKER_0:  both figuring out what you do next.

00:48:41,301 --> 00:48:42,942
SPEAKER_1:  That's true. I'm a very good follower though.

00:48:43,362 --> 00:48:47,454
SPEAKER_1:  Okay. So I'm like, I'm an invisible folly. You do have movements like I.

00:48:47,682 --> 00:48:49,557
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, interesting. I'm not that good at tech.

00:48:49,557 --> 00:48:52,557
SPEAKER_0:  know those existed like a perfect fight perfect fuck

00:48:52,557 --> 00:48:57,918
SPEAKER_1:  I'm really ideal. I'm not great at technique and sometimes I'll fall over, but like with the following part, I'm very good at it.

00:48:58,338 --> 00:48:59,870
SPEAKER_0:  Do you enjoy? Yeah, yeah.

00:49:00,034 --> 00:49:00,542
SPEAKER_1:  Feeling nice.

00:49:00,994 --> 00:49:06,846
SPEAKER_1:  It's again, like it's a very fast physical puzzle you have to solve. It's like typing. I really like typing. That's why I was inquiring about your keyboard.

00:49:07,426 --> 00:49:08,670
SPEAKER_1:  Why do you like typing?

00:49:09,186 --> 00:49:13,342
SPEAKER_1:  It's like the very fast, like the really rapid response was the reaction time.

00:49:13,634 --> 00:49:15,614
SPEAKER_1:  I like things that have very fast reaction times.

00:49:16,098 --> 00:49:16,862
SPEAKER_1:  Like games like that.

00:49:18,082 --> 00:49:22,957
SPEAKER_0:  But typing is not a reaction. Or is it the brain generating words? And then you're like, how's typing a reaction?

00:49:22,957 --> 00:49:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, the sensation that I get when I am typing is the kind of thing that I'm trying to point at. So maybe reaction time isn't the quite, I don't know what the term is, but whatever that thing is.

00:49:31,042 --> 00:49:33,086
SPEAKER_1:  Like the thing where you have to look at a word and then...

00:49:33,314 --> 00:49:35,134
SPEAKER_1:  communicate it into your fingers? Yeah.

00:49:36,162 --> 00:49:37,214
SPEAKER_1:  It feels like dancing.

00:49:37,698 --> 00:49:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  Like you're responding, you're responding to your brain. Your fingers are doing the responding to the brain to generate the words.

00:49:43,298 --> 00:49:45,982
SPEAKER_1:  making your body do what your brain wants it to do, but like...

00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:47,335
SPEAKER_1:  fast and precisely.

00:49:47,335 --> 00:49:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  then you might not like this Kinesis keyboard because it makes the

00:49:50,466 --> 00:49:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  It makes it easier to do that. You probably like the struggle.

00:49:53,666 --> 00:49:57,886
SPEAKER_1:  Right? Well, I mean, it looks hard because you have, it looks like it's high depression.

00:49:58,146 --> 00:49:58,846
SPEAKER_1:  on the keys.

00:49:59,138 --> 00:50:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  No, it's, well, oh, I see, yes, more than.

00:50:02,402 --> 00:50:04,286
SPEAKER_0:  More than like a laptop keyboard, but like.

00:50:05,218 --> 00:50:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  that you don't have to one of the the main

00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  thing is you don't have to move your fingers at all.

00:50:10,306 --> 00:50:11,326
SPEAKER_0:  So like...

00:50:11,714 --> 00:50:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  So like, for example, a lot of people that I think they have a backspace up in the top right corner. Yeah. So if you have to make mistakes, which is like.

00:50:20,098 --> 00:50:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, that's like so metaphorical. Like every mistake you have to like really hurt yourself for, you have to like stretch for the backspace.

00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:33,027
SPEAKER_1:  See, there's that poetic narrative again. It's like it emanates from a lot of your-

00:50:33,027 --> 00:50:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  Everything.

00:50:34,914 --> 00:50:35,870
SPEAKER_0:  No.

00:50:37,538 --> 00:50:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I don't.

00:50:38,754 --> 00:50:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  And I see it as a good thing.

00:50:43,074 --> 00:50:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  of romantic omelette.

00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  permeates my interpretation of the world, yes.

00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  But you left home early.

00:50:49,858 --> 00:50:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  Mm-hmm.

00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:53,822
SPEAKER_0:  How did you end up working at a factory?

00:50:54,242 --> 00:50:55,870
SPEAKER_1:  I tried to go to college but failed.

00:50:56,162 --> 00:50:56,830
SPEAKER_1:  couldn't afford it.

00:50:57,794 --> 00:50:58,398
SPEAKER_1:  Did you like it?

00:51:00,194 --> 00:51:04,350
SPEAKER_1:  I remember it just being really slow. I remember being shocked that the teachers didn't care.

00:51:04,834 --> 00:51:05,630
SPEAKER_1:  Like I was used to.

00:51:06,242 --> 00:51:06,910
SPEAKER_1:  homeschooling.

00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:14,974
SPEAKER_1:  And where, I don't know, it just meant something. It felt like the people around me that were teaching me, because we had like a mom's group also.

00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:19,742
SPEAKER_1:  like directly cared about what I was learning. And I would be able to ask questions and they would like really respond. What's a mom's good?

00:51:20,194 --> 00:51:24,638
SPEAKER_1:  And it was like homeschooling groups where a bunch of moms who are homeschooling their kids get together.

00:51:25,186 --> 00:51:26,334
SPEAKER_1:  and then teach each other as kids.

00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:27,678
SPEAKER_0:  Oh cool.

00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:31,614
SPEAKER_0:  And they have different like interesting capabilities and so on. And I know that is not the business of me.

00:51:31,746 --> 00:51:36,030
SPEAKER_1:  And sometimes if some of the kids are really good at something, you have the older kids teaching the other ones too.

00:51:36,418 --> 00:51:40,958
SPEAKER_1:  So it was very like everybody kind of figures out what they could good at and they share that skill set with everybody else.

00:51:41,314 --> 00:51:43,326
SPEAKER_1:  which I think was a pretty great setup. Honestly, I think-

00:51:43,554 --> 00:51:46,270
SPEAKER_1:  My childhood kind of sucked in a lot of ways, but homeschooling was...

00:51:46,498 --> 00:51:47,038
SPEAKER_1:  Excellent.

00:51:47,554 --> 00:51:50,270
SPEAKER_1:  for me, mainly because it just had so much free time. like

00:51:50,626 --> 00:51:58,590
SPEAKER_1:  I just did like two or three hours of school and then did whatever the fuck I wanted for the rest of the day. And I got to actually pursue skills that are still useful for me to this day, so.

00:51:59,426 --> 00:52:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  even in that constrained environment.

00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:05,854
SPEAKER_1:  Like I wrote, I read fantasy books and I wrote so much. And now I'm writing.

00:52:06,082 --> 00:52:07,230
SPEAKER_1:  a lot from my blog, so.

00:52:07,362 --> 00:52:10,046
SPEAKER_0:  What kind of fantasy books? Like sci-fi type stuff?

00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,870
SPEAKER_1:  Um, not classic, like I read-

00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:18,526
SPEAKER_1:  like Mercedes Lackey and the E.E. Knight and Ursula Le Guin.

00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:23,171
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know any of this. What is this? What is it? Is it like a romantic thing? Is it like, is it romantic?

00:52:23,171 --> 00:52:26,171
SPEAKER_1:  All the fantasy books like dragons and- Oh dragons-

00:52:26,171 --> 00:52:27,486
SPEAKER_0:  Gotta gotta gotta gotta

00:52:27,746 --> 00:52:28,798
SPEAKER_0:  You didn't mention Tolkien.

00:52:28,994 --> 00:52:30,526
SPEAKER_1:  I read Tolkien.

00:52:30,946 --> 00:52:31,294
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:52:31,554 --> 00:52:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  All right, well, it's beautiful. So you throw all the dragons.

00:52:36,482 --> 00:52:38,357
SPEAKER_0:  How did you end up in a factory try school?

00:52:38,357 --> 00:52:42,462
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, yeah, Tri-School had to drop off a couple months, so then I was like, well, I'm poor and-

00:52:43,042 --> 00:52:46,558
SPEAKER_1:  I was ready to take any job. I was applying for sewer jobs and then-

00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:51,326
SPEAKER_1:  I got factory, I'm like, all right, let's do it. Cause my parents know no financial help at all. I feel like you.

00:52:51,714 --> 00:52:53,342
SPEAKER_1:  play yourself up by your own bootstraps, you know.

00:52:54,594 --> 00:53:02,078
SPEAKER_1:  So anyway, I went to work at a factory and that sucks ass. Do not recommend, we had to wake up like 4 a.m. Work on weekends too.

00:53:03,426 --> 00:53:12,382
SPEAKER_1:  fluorescent lights. It was terrible. And so I did that for about a year. And I was like, this is, I was trying to grip my teeth and be like, this is my life, right? I didn't have high expectations for my life. I was just like.

00:53:12,802 --> 00:53:17,214
SPEAKER_1:  I thought if you get a job where you don't have to be on your feet all the time, you're living a good life.

00:53:18,242 --> 00:53:23,262
SPEAKER_1:  And then I got another job briefly as a photographer and then they fired me. I think I was 19 at the time.

00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:24,990
SPEAKER_1:  Fired you for it.

00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,878
SPEAKER_1:  I was just too young.

00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:30,462
SPEAKER_1:  and really, really bad at interacting with...

00:53:30,946 --> 00:53:31,934
SPEAKER_1:  people on the outside world?

00:53:32,258 --> 00:53:38,814
SPEAKER_1:  Like I was pretty well socialized as a homeschooler with other homeschoolers, but in the outside world, especially with all of the like hierarchy submission stuff.

00:53:39,042 --> 00:53:39,966
SPEAKER_1:  beaten into me like

00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:46,366
SPEAKER_1:  literally beaten into me, it was very difficult for me to interact with other people who were like older than me or had any sort of confidence at all.

00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:49,822
SPEAKER_1:  So they hired me to do photography for people and then I was...

00:53:50,402 --> 00:53:56,830
SPEAKER_1:  rapidly turned out that I was bad at this and so they fired me. But at that point I'd left my factory job. I can't go back to the factory.

00:53:57,346 --> 00:54:01,246
SPEAKER_1:  So I tried, I had some savings and I slept on friends' couches and I tried.

00:54:01,826 --> 00:54:05,214
SPEAKER_1:  various self-employment stuff. I'm like, maybe I can do product photography or...

00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:08,382
SPEAKER_1:  something, but it's Idaho, you know, nothing.

00:54:08,898 --> 00:54:13,790
SPEAKER_1:  And if you're like a 19-year-old with no experience in the outside world at all, it was really difficult.

00:54:14,146 --> 00:54:17,822
SPEAKER_1:  And so I had a friend recommend that I try becoming a cam girl.

00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  So that's how it started.

00:54:19,394 --> 00:54:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  What is being a cam girl?

00:54:23,362 --> 00:54:24,862
SPEAKER_1:  Timing is like you.

00:54:25,314 --> 00:54:28,702
SPEAKER_1:  Let's talk to the camera live on the computer like you livestream. Just kinda like Twitch.

00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:37,598
SPEAKER_1:  And then people are typing in the chat like, huh, I do this stuff. And then the people can tip you money and then you can do things in response. Like, oh, if you tip me a hundred tokens, you know, I'll take my shirt off or something like that.

00:54:38,114 --> 00:54:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  and like what's the...

00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  What site were you using at that time? My free cams.

00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  My free cams? Is that a popular?

00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:45,278
SPEAKER_0:  site. 2

00:54:46,562 --> 00:54:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  and how did...

00:54:48,322 --> 00:54:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  What were the next steps? Like did you enjoy it?

00:54:51,394 --> 00:54:54,142
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, well it was the first time I had actual control over my life.

00:54:55,266 --> 00:55:07,454
SPEAKER_1:  and I made like actual real money. And so I just exploded into it. I thought about it nonstop. I was streaming all the time. I was like coming with like new creative things. And the thing is like, I don't know. There's something about public school that-

00:55:08,194 --> 00:55:11,454
SPEAKER_1:  I ended up living in a house of cam girls full of other girls who had gone to public school and

00:55:11,682 --> 00:55:18,014
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know how much of it's genetic or just because I'm weird or is it because of our upbringing but I felt like I was much more fearless.

00:55:18,402 --> 00:55:22,334
SPEAKER_1:  and much more weird and creative online than other people were, not because they weren't.

00:55:22,562 --> 00:55:29,054
SPEAKER_1:  awesome people. But because I think like public school, I got the impression based on them talking about that, that it sort of like beats out any sort of deviance from you.

00:55:29,922 --> 00:55:30,270
SPEAKER_1:  Like.

00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  It more so than your cause I, I got the.

00:55:33,634 --> 00:55:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  We had moral deviants was beaten out, but like...

00:55:36,226 --> 00:55:39,550
SPEAKER_1:  You could do whatever. Creative deviance was not. Creative deviance wasn't so much.

00:55:40,034 --> 00:55:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  I didn't have other kids making fun of me ever. I don't think I'd ever heard an insult about my physical appearance as a child or teenager.

00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:50,526
SPEAKER_0:  So your father was basically saying you're not good enough was intellectual?

00:55:50,786 --> 00:55:55,582
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, no, that was like moral failure. Moral failure. Yeah, like I was not virtuous.

00:55:55,842 --> 00:55:59,390
SPEAKER_1:  Oh wow. Like in various ways, like you're lazy.

00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:08,926
SPEAKER_1:  Mostly the lazy part. I have like ADHD or something. And I was not good at it as a kid either. I would totally forget all the time.

00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:12,350
SPEAKER_0:  Is there some sexual repression aspect to that?

00:56:12,834 --> 00:56:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  Like, you know how they say that there's...

00:56:15,426 --> 00:56:18,398
SPEAKER_0:  It's not just homeschooling, but just Catholic girls and so on.

00:56:18,786 --> 00:56:20,926
SPEAKER_0:  Just because like there's moral, you're forbidden.

00:56:21,602 --> 00:56:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  to do certain things, like there's a kind of liberating feeling of saying.

00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  basically rediscovering yourself, rediscovering your freedom by...

00:56:30,082 --> 00:56:30,462
SPEAKER_0:  doing.

00:56:31,042 --> 00:56:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  Just...

00:56:32,226 --> 00:56:35,294
SPEAKER_0:  uh, diving head in at first into sexuality.

00:56:35,522 --> 00:56:37,863
SPEAKER_0:  interior and sexuality. Is there some aspect of that? Thank you so much!

00:56:37,863 --> 00:56:43,134
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, absolutely to some degree. I think that people kind of model it slightly wrong. I think there's just a truth to it.

00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:46,206
SPEAKER_1:  When I first got out of the house, for me freedom was like...

00:56:46,498 --> 00:56:47,646
SPEAKER_1:  going outside at 2 a.m.

00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:49,726
SPEAKER_1:  or like eating chocolate.

00:56:50,146 --> 00:56:51,230
SPEAKER_1:  You know, on days that I've...

00:56:51,458 --> 00:56:52,670
SPEAKER_1:  previously wasn't allowed to eat chocolate.

00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:53,886
SPEAKER_1:  Like that was like a-

00:56:54,146 --> 00:56:56,254
SPEAKER_1:  really intense expression of rebellion for me.

00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:57,854
SPEAKER_1:  And I think people don't think of...

00:56:58,178 --> 00:57:05,054
SPEAKER_1:  this. Like, I got out a lot of my intense rebellion through things that people don't typically consider to be rebellious at all. Like, I wore a bikini.

00:57:06,562 --> 00:57:07,038
SPEAKER_1:  Insane.

00:57:07,586 --> 00:57:09,694
SPEAKER_0:  I just like walked around and in like

00:57:10,306 --> 00:57:11,431
SPEAKER_0:  I can do this.

00:57:11,431 --> 00:57:25,278
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, basically. So this was most of that emotional processing for me. And it took me a couple years from leaving home and all of that conservative culture into doing sex work. In the meantime, I did try having sex with a lot of people.

00:57:25,538 --> 00:57:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  But this was mainly because I didn't know what the norms were.

00:57:28,674 --> 00:57:32,958
SPEAKER_1:  I didn't really understand. I was just like, okay, take things logically, take things one step at a time.

00:57:33,282 --> 00:57:34,814
SPEAKER_1:  And I'm like, okay, if the whole.

00:57:35,074 --> 00:57:38,750
SPEAKER_1:  previous set about how I'm not supposed to kiss somebody until the altar of marriage.

00:57:39,074 --> 00:57:40,830
SPEAKER_1:  if that's not the way that things are supposed to go.

00:57:41,154 --> 00:57:47,902
SPEAKER_1:  then what is the way things are supposed to go? And I was like, well, if I am aroused, I should go have sex with someone, right? Is there any reason not to? No, so I went and just.

00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:50,718
SPEAKER_1:  I would go around asking random people to have sex with me.

00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:59,422
SPEAKER_0:  Did you have any peer pressure saying like, that's not good or that is good or like any, did you feel any currents of society in any direction? It's probably, or. victory.

00:57:59,714 --> 00:58:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  Or you're independently just thinking like.

00:58:01,794 --> 00:58:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  from first principles.

00:58:03,298 --> 00:58:11,838
SPEAKER_1:  I think, I mean, like I'm not saying it was a totally clean thing. I'm sure that I was experiencing society telling me this is bad, but you have to know, like I wasn't watching normal movies when I was a teen.

00:58:12,354 --> 00:58:18,430
SPEAKER_1:  Like we watched Christian movies, the stuff that we watched was filtered. Like I watched the Titanic and I had no idea that Jack and Rose had sex.

00:58:18,658 --> 00:58:19,230
SPEAKER_1:  because it was.

00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:21,342
SPEAKER_1:  put through a filtered. Today

00:58:21,602 --> 00:58:22,398
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, they went and...

00:58:22,658 --> 00:58:25,566
SPEAKER_1:  You know, he'd painted her naked and there was a scene in a car.

00:58:26,978 --> 00:58:33,735
SPEAKER_1:  On the ship. On the car, on the ship. Yeah, they had like cars in storage and there's a hand. I watched it again later and I was like, oh my god.

00:58:33,735 --> 00:58:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  That's it.

00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:36,542
SPEAKER_1:  Well, maybe were you also put through a...

00:58:37,506 --> 00:58:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  The filtered version? Maybe it's the filter I see, like did the couple in the notebook also have sex? Because maybe for romantic movies I focus on the romance?

00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:51,806
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe, right? And the sex scenes are always like weirdly filmed in these.

00:58:52,034 --> 00:58:53,406
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. Because it's never.

00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:54,270
SPEAKER_0:  I mean...

00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  It doesn't, it feels more like romance than sex.

00:58:58,402 --> 00:59:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  I guess that's the main focus of this, eh?

00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, anyway.

00:59:03,266 --> 00:59:06,641
SPEAKER_0:  So the head socks is good to know now. They did. Again, and watch now.

00:59:06,641 --> 00:59:08,894
SPEAKER_1:  You have your own personal filter on your brain.

00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:10,430
SPEAKER_0:  And once you realize that they're...

00:59:10,722 --> 00:59:11,326
SPEAKER_0:  some.

00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  like the foundation of your beliefs.

00:59:14,146 --> 00:59:18,215
SPEAKER_0:  were wrong then everything might be wrong and you kind of just doing king

00:59:18,215 --> 00:59:24,606
SPEAKER_1:  principles basically. And again like not totally separate from culture but also I think in general I also have a predisposition to just be like

00:59:24,962 --> 00:59:28,382
SPEAKER_1:  you know, fuck what culture tells you. Just figure out what's right for you and do it.

00:59:28,706 --> 00:59:32,990
SPEAKER_1:  And so that mixed with, you know, the figuring things out from first principles. I did eventually figure out that I'd-

00:59:33,474 --> 00:59:35,710
SPEAKER_1:  didn't like having casual sex with just anybody.

00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:36,990
SPEAKER_1:  as much.

00:59:37,218 --> 00:59:39,093
SPEAKER_1:  So I stopped that, but it took me a while to figure that out.

00:59:39,093 --> 00:59:40,593
SPEAKER_0:  What's the negative of casual sex?

00:59:40,593 --> 00:59:41,438
SPEAKER_1:  That's just like nap.

00:59:41,698 --> 00:59:42,750
SPEAKER_1:  good? I mean-

00:59:42,978 --> 00:59:49,758
SPEAKER_1:  If you figure out the chemistry you have with someone better, then it can be a lot nicer. But I wasn't doing that, I was just like somebody I met.

00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:52,126
SPEAKER_1:  And I'm like, you seem kind of cute.

00:59:52,546 --> 00:59:55,262
SPEAKER_1:  Okay. Like I didn't bother to try and develop this.

00:59:55,522 --> 00:59:56,647
SPEAKER_1:  any chemistry I mean I didn't

00:59:56,647 --> 00:59:59,647
SPEAKER_0:  Even outside of sex, just chemistry, like human chemistry.

00:59:59,647 --> 01:00:00,670
SPEAKER_1:  conversation.

01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:07,070
SPEAKER_1:  I would, I would, I'm, it's like kind of cringy, but I would like, I would like walk up to the guys who send them messages, like, would you like to?

01:00:07,362 --> 01:00:11,134
SPEAKER_1:  have coitus is what I would say. You would say coitus. I told him I did.

01:00:13,186 --> 01:00:15,061
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's kind of cute in a way.

01:00:15,061 --> 01:00:18,302
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, it's a girl asking you to get laid, so they probably didn't care that much.

01:00:19,618 --> 01:00:23,934
SPEAKER_1:  But anyway, I'm saying that like, I had a lot of rebelling out of my system by the time I started sex work. Yeah.

01:00:24,386 --> 01:00:31,998
SPEAKER_1:  So for me, maybe I'm sure it was somehow related, because we were extremely sexually oppressed growing up. I remember the day I learned I had a vagina, which was absolutely horrifying.

01:00:32,578 --> 01:00:33,790
SPEAKER_1:  I do not recommend.

01:00:34,242 --> 01:00:35,838
SPEAKER_1:  figure out you have another orifice in your body.

01:00:36,194 --> 01:00:37,086
SPEAKER_1:  But like

01:00:37,186 --> 01:00:44,606
SPEAKER_0:  Do you want to share the process of you figuring out that you had a vagina? I just told me I had a vagina. Oh, like intellectually, like there was somebody said.

01:00:45,026 --> 01:00:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  You have a vagina. Vagina, yeah. Sounds horrifying to you.

01:00:48,194 --> 01:00:48,702
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:00:49,538 --> 01:00:50,462
SPEAKER_1:  I didn't know I had-

01:00:50,786 --> 01:00:55,294
SPEAKER_1:  Because you weren't supposed to ever like touch or look at yourself ever. So I never did. It was just really disgusting.

01:00:56,674 --> 01:00:58,206
SPEAKER_1:  And so I had no idea.

01:00:58,786 --> 01:00:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  that what was.

01:00:59,714 --> 01:01:03,678
SPEAKER_1:  going on in my genital region. And so one day my mom sat me down, I think it was like nine or ten.

01:01:04,546 --> 01:01:05,822
SPEAKER_1:  And she was like, you have a...

01:01:06,786 --> 01:01:08,510
SPEAKER_1:  There's another. WOT.

01:01:09,154 --> 01:01:16,350
SPEAKER_1:  And you're going to bleed out of it is what she told me. You're going to bleed out of it for a while. And I was like, what the fuck, mom?

01:01:17,826 --> 01:01:18,974
SPEAKER_1:  I didn't know the word fuck was, but.

01:01:19,554 --> 01:01:19,934
SPEAKER_1:  would have.

01:01:20,098 --> 01:01:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  I would have said that if I had known. He's your first learn the word fuck.

01:01:22,946 --> 01:01:26,270
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, I think I learned it when I was at a playground and it was written.

01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:29,630
SPEAKER_1:  somewhere and I read it out loud and then a kid next to me started giggling.

01:01:31,458 --> 01:01:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  Did you ever, did you say fuck again for a while?

01:01:34,914 --> 01:01:37,694
SPEAKER_1:  No, I think the next time I swear the first time I was 18.

01:01:39,042 --> 01:01:41,022
SPEAKER_1:  like intentionally said a swear word when I was 18.

01:01:41,218 --> 01:01:41,822
SPEAKER_0:  Does it feel good?

01:01:43,106 --> 01:01:44,231
SPEAKER_0:  I was like really nervous. I was like.

01:01:44,231 --> 01:01:45,182
SPEAKER_1: Care to just say a switch?

01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, fuck's pretty good. I mean, fuck's pretty good.

01:01:49,762 --> 01:01:51,518
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, so uh...

01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  So that's camming.

01:01:53,346 --> 01:01:59,070
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, what are the pros and cons of camping and how does OnlyFans map into this? Did you switch to OnlyFans at some point?

01:01:59,362 --> 01:01:59,966
SPEAKER_1:  I did, yeah.

01:02:00,546 --> 01:02:03,678
SPEAKER_1:  I came for like five or six years and I burned out eventually.

01:02:03,842 --> 01:02:06,270
SPEAKER_0:  What are the good aspects? What are the bad aspects of cheming?

01:02:06,402 --> 01:02:19,678
SPEAKER_1:  Well, the good aspects were that it was just your own terms. You get to decide. Everything about it is under your control, which I loved at the time. I was like, I can work. When I want, how I want, any sort of expression. I experimented and I was a very successful. I was making around $200 an hour, which.

01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:21,886
SPEAKER_1:  for that website at the time was pretty good.

01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:29,726
SPEAKER_1:  I had elaborate routines as a mime. I would dress up as a mime and then dress up a chair, and I would seduce the chair.

01:02:30,434 --> 01:02:31,559
SPEAKER_1:  Oh cool. Yeah, er....

01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:34,559
SPEAKER_0:  Was there an artistic element to it almost?

01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:37,310
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, very much. I have like gnomes.

01:02:37,794 --> 01:02:39,486
SPEAKER_1:  uh... you know it's not a mine you know

01:02:39,938 --> 01:02:42,750
SPEAKER_1:  Oh sorry, right. Yeah, yeah, kiddo, straight dude.

01:02:43,106 --> 01:02:43,838
SPEAKER_0:  you

01:02:44,674 --> 01:02:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  You know what I really appreciate about you is I'm asking some really dumb questions and you're answering it in a very intelligent way so I appreciate it.

01:02:51,714 --> 01:02:55,134
SPEAKER_0:  Did you ask the chair questions?

01:02:56,354 --> 01:02:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  I was a mime you fucking idiot. Okay, I'm sorry

01:02:58,978 --> 01:03:09,065
SPEAKER_0:  But there's gnomes on the, like big gnomes or small gnomes? Like lawn gnomes. Lawn gnomes? You mean seduce the lawn gnome on the chair, the gnome is sitting on the chair?

01:03:09,065 --> 01:03:10,142
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, gnomes on the chair.

01:03:10,402 --> 01:03:19,070
SPEAKER_1:  I did a photo set which I submitted to Reddit where I got abducted. I was like stripping, taking my clothes off and then slowly the gnome surrounded me in the background and dragged me off.

01:03:19,554 --> 01:03:21,342
SPEAKER_1:  I did this as a photo set. Essentially.

01:03:21,826 --> 01:03:25,470
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I didn't feel consensual in the photos, but...

01:03:25,570 --> 01:03:26,014
SPEAKER_0:

01:03:26,498 --> 01:03:27,623
SPEAKER_0:  But it was the 11th.

01:03:27,623 --> 01:03:28,734
SPEAKER_1:  consent with the norms.

01:03:29,058 --> 01:03:30,622
SPEAKER_1:  It was very successful on Reddit.

01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:31,454
SPEAKER_1:  basically.

01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:34,435
SPEAKER_1:  There's a top post from Gone Wild, an 11th top post of all time.

01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:36,958
SPEAKER_0:  All that, which I think will probably just means it's like.

01:03:37,506 --> 01:03:40,030
SPEAKER_0:  It's artistic, it's interesting, it's...

01:03:40,258 --> 01:03:42,133
SPEAKER_0:  I.G.A. is funny so it's really well done.

01:03:42,133 --> 01:03:54,174
SPEAKER_1:  But it was really shocking to me that nobody else was doing anything creative with sex work. Like for me it was like breathing, like you're just doing sex and you're bored and like what do you do? I don't know, let's try something funny. Like it's just the natural progression. And it felt to me like there was almost no competition.

01:03:54,466 --> 01:03:56,094
SPEAKER_1:  Like I would just be really creative and like.

01:03:56,354 --> 01:03:57,406
SPEAKER_1:  immediately was the top.

01:03:57,666 --> 01:04:00,958
SPEAKER_1:  not safe for work post on Reddit. Like, I didn't even try that hard.

01:04:01,378 --> 01:04:05,022
SPEAKER_1:  And so it's really shocking to me that other women who are doing this sort of thing.

01:04:05,314 --> 01:04:07,454
SPEAKER_0:  Is that still a little bit of the case?

01:04:08,258 --> 01:04:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  Like that there's not as much like.

01:04:10,274 --> 01:04:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  cuz I

01:04:11,202 --> 01:04:11,838
SPEAKER_0:  from ISARV.

01:04:12,514 --> 01:04:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  outside of perspective that seems to be still the case. Like there's not like as you describe it.

01:04:17,154 --> 01:04:19,134
SPEAKER_0:  That's kind of cool. That's like, almost like.

01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  playing.

01:04:20,578 --> 01:04:22,846
SPEAKER_0:  Like having fun with sexuality almost. Yeah.

01:04:23,554 --> 01:04:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  That's, and yeah, but that does require kind of thinking through.

01:04:27,746 --> 01:04:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  It's almost like a creative project, like a photography project or something like that, almost like a little skit.

01:04:33,058 --> 01:04:41,086
SPEAKER_1:  It's interesting. It's this vibe of like, how can you like bring like vibrant novelty to whatever you're doing, anything you're doing. I really like doing this with surface too.

01:04:41,346 --> 01:04:52,575
SPEAKER_1:  Like I've been doing a lot of standard surveys, but I'm also like experimenting with novel creative artistic surveys. I'm like, how do you ask a question in a way that's like beautiful and unusual and like a thing that's completely groundbreaking? Like nobody's ever like.

01:04:52,575 --> 01:04:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  I always make everything so poetic and romantic as disgusting.

01:04:57,698 --> 01:05:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  uh... but yes i think you do have that engine in your head against creativity

01:05:01,954 --> 01:05:05,214
SPEAKER_0:  Like, yeah, the way you ask questions, it's not trivial to do it like for...

01:05:05,666 --> 01:05:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  uh... it's actually very difficult to do

01:05:09,186 --> 01:05:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  Good.

01:05:10,018 --> 01:05:12,190
SPEAKER_0:  survey questions and.

01:05:12,514 --> 01:05:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, we're joking, but like, yeah, almost like poetic, because you have to ask a question in a way that doesn't lead to the answer.

01:05:18,082 --> 01:05:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  Yes. Like you have to-

01:05:20,322 --> 01:05:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  You have to kind of inspire them to think and then.

01:05:23,106 --> 01:05:27,231
SPEAKER_0:  indirectly get at the truth. It's an art form.

01:05:27,231 --> 01:05:31,326
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, and also in a way where they don't misinterpret the question because it's amazing how

01:05:31,778 --> 01:05:35,934
SPEAKER_1:  Any question you think, oh, this is the clearest question possible. No, you're wrong. It has to be even clearer.

01:05:36,578 --> 01:05:42,846
SPEAKER_0:  Right, willingly or unwillingly, because you also have to defend against that question being criticized later when you publish about it.

01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:44,231
SPEAKER_0:  All that, you have to think about it.

01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:52,542
SPEAKER_1:  I think this might be my greatest strength. So I'm not very good at statistics. I'm not like great at presenting data, but I think probably my greatest strength is in fact survey design and like question phrasing.

01:05:52,898 --> 01:05:54,238
SPEAKER_1:  Because I've, I've, I have.

01:05:54,498 --> 01:05:59,838
SPEAKER_1:  I've treated so many thousands of polls and every single one I get people telling me like the way that they misinterpreted the poll.

01:06:00,194 --> 01:06:13,438
SPEAKER_1:  So it's like, it's like gone through fire. And then again, I am testing the phrasings all the time. Like what happens if you slightly shift phrasings and so I'll do the same question test over time to see how it changes and the way the framing affects the results.

01:06:14,818 --> 01:06:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  So the good and the bad of the camming, she said good.

01:06:17,442 --> 01:06:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  The... what was it? I forgot you were saying......Vietnam!

01:06:20,162 --> 01:06:20,670
SPEAKER_0:  the freedom.

01:06:20,898 --> 01:06:22,773
SPEAKER_0:  The freedom to also be creative.

01:06:22,773 --> 01:06:23,326
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:06:24,418 --> 01:06:34,814
SPEAKER_1:  And the bad is just that it was exhausting. The site that I was on, the way that it's structured is that you're ranking on the site and thus the amount of people that see you and thus the amount of money you earn is affected by the amount of money that you earn.

01:06:35,042 --> 01:06:36,798
SPEAKER_1:  on average over the last 60 days.

01:06:37,122 --> 01:06:42,747
SPEAKER_1:  So if you're streaming and nobody's tipping you, this means that you're going to be dropping down in the rankings, which is gonna make it harder in the future.

01:06:42,747 --> 01:06:44,247
SPEAKER_0:  So the rich get richer in that site.

01:06:44,247 --> 01:06:47,870
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so it's very high pressure. Like, if you're on, you need to be making money.

01:06:48,770 --> 01:06:49,790
SPEAKER_1:  as fast as you can.

01:06:50,146 --> 01:06:51,614
SPEAKER_1:  if you want to continue to make money.

01:06:51,842 --> 01:06:54,974
SPEAKER_1:  So that was really stressful. It was very mentally taxing.

01:06:55,234 --> 01:07:06,782
SPEAKER_1:  I would do it for a couple of hours and just log off and be completely exhausted. Cause you're just like on as hard as you can. And this is why I have a little PTSD around streaming. Like I've considered Twitch streaming and I try a little bit and I'm like, I haven't fully.

01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:11,486
SPEAKER_1:  integrated the fact that you don't have to be like maximally entertaining every single second yet.

01:07:11,842 --> 01:07:15,006
SPEAKER_1:  you can actually just chill out and take it slow and nothing bad happens.

01:07:16,002 --> 01:07:17,886
SPEAKER_0:  You can just enjoy silence. Here's some good Granite AK left of plans.

01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:24,446
SPEAKER_0:  Did you feel lonely?

01:07:25,794 --> 01:07:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  Doing it?

01:07:27,362 --> 01:07:29,118
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, even just streamers feel lonely.

01:07:29,666 --> 01:07:31,102
SPEAKER_0:  I moved into a house of cam girls.

01:07:32,514 --> 01:07:36,222
SPEAKER_1:  Does that make it better or worse? Better. They're great. I'm still friends with them to this day.

01:07:36,674 --> 01:07:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  Also, it was like a team almost like.

01:07:38,498 --> 01:07:39,614
SPEAKER_0:  We're in this kind of together.

01:07:39,714 --> 01:07:40,126
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:43,358
SPEAKER_1:  So we would like work together and stream together.

01:07:44,098 --> 01:07:45,662
SPEAKER_1:  and swap our clothes and stuff.

01:07:46,338 --> 01:07:46,878
SPEAKER_1:  It was great.

01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:49,278
SPEAKER_1:  Swap ideas too. Swap ideas, yeah.

01:07:49,794 --> 01:07:50,782
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

01:07:51,362 --> 01:07:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  Actually on a small tangent, maybe a big tangent, what do you think, recent controversy of Andrew Tate?

01:07:56,930 --> 01:08:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  And that he, I think in the past ran a camping business.

01:08:00,706 --> 01:08:03,006
SPEAKER_0:  and he's being accused of sex trafficking.

01:08:03,426 --> 01:08:05,694
SPEAKER_0:  What do you think? Like from your own experience?

01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  What do you understand about Andrew Tate? Is he a good person? Is he a bad person?

01:08:11,074 --> 01:08:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  Is there something shady about his practices or not?

01:08:13,442 --> 01:08:19,742
SPEAKER_1:  I wish I could answer, but I don't know. I haven't looked into it at all. I've heard people talking about it, I just haven't bothered to go into it.

01:08:20,002 --> 01:08:24,318
SPEAKER_1:  It is well known that, like when I was doing it back in the day, the Eastern European model said something different going on.

01:08:25,122 --> 01:08:25,566
SPEAKER_1:  It was like a-

01:08:25,826 --> 01:08:26,494
SPEAKER_1:  trope about.

01:08:26,754 --> 01:08:29,150
SPEAKER_1:  know, there's the Eastern European models and then there's everybody else.

01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:31,605
SPEAKER_0:  They're what? It's like darker?

01:08:31,605 --> 01:08:33,822
SPEAKER_1:  Like they do studios and...

01:08:34,338 --> 01:08:35,486
SPEAKER_1:  their lower quality.

01:08:36,802 --> 01:08:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  Which means what? Studios are, you go into like a warehouse and then they have set up a little, like things that replicate bedrooms. They're just like stalls.

01:08:46,114 --> 01:08:49,630
SPEAKER_1:  and then you rent out or you pay the studio percentage of your income.

01:08:49,922 --> 01:08:56,222
SPEAKER_1:  And you can tell when something looks like a studio, it's like a type of background. That if you're watching enough, it kind of starts to notice the patterns.

01:08:56,610 --> 01:09:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  So like the standards are lower there then the ethical boundaries are a little looser.

01:09:01,506 --> 01:09:02,631
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. Ah, ha peep.

01:09:02,631 --> 01:09:05,118
SPEAKER_1:  treated. We didn't, I never heard anything about the.

01:09:05,442 --> 01:09:07,582
SPEAKER_1:  I just knew that it was like lower

01:09:07,938 --> 01:09:10,366
SPEAKER_1:  Like, the girls seemed like they were less into it.

01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:12,926
SPEAKER_1:  cared less.

01:09:13,154 --> 01:09:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  How does this all interplay with like sex trafficking?

01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:09:16,322 --> 01:09:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  Consensual or just non-consensual.

01:09:17,954 --> 01:09:20,478
SPEAKER_1:  I would be shocked if there were never any non-consensual camming.

01:09:22,114 --> 01:09:30,174
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I guess it's like if it were going to happen at that point, I'd be surprised if it were in fact Eastern European models. This is outdated, I'm just thinking of my stereotypes back when I cammed a lot.

01:09:30,402 --> 01:09:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  Sure, so some of that is stereotypes versus collecting good data, right?

01:09:33,506 --> 01:09:35,006
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I haven't done data on.

01:09:35,298 --> 01:09:35,870
SPEAKER_1:  Kim Grohl!

01:09:36,066 --> 01:09:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  It's hard, I mean, it's even hard to get that data.

01:09:40,226 --> 01:09:40,606
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:09:40,898 --> 01:09:42,773
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, right. The important problem.

01:09:42,773 --> 01:09:47,454
SPEAKER_1:  There's a method that I'm trying that I really like. I designed a survey type which is like asking people who you know.

01:09:47,714 --> 01:10:00,190
SPEAKER_1:  Like, who do you know who's done this? And you tell me like, oh, do you know anybody who's a doctor? Do you know anybody who has had cancer or like smokes or? Personally, I mean. Yeah, personally, just do you know anybody? Yeah. And then if you ask about a whole bunch of things, you can.

01:10:00,418 --> 01:10:00,894
SPEAKER_1:  calibrate.

01:10:01,570 --> 01:10:02,302
SPEAKER_1:  responses.

01:10:02,754 --> 01:10:08,062
SPEAKER_1:  So like, if your population, you know, 20% of them know doctors, then you know the actual amount of doctors.

01:10:08,322 --> 01:10:11,697
SPEAKER_1:  then you can tell how this is corresponding, what is the visibility of factors.

01:10:11,697 --> 01:10:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  so you can reconstruct the graph.

01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:25,790
SPEAKER_1:  Basically, yeah. And we can do this with sex trafficking. Of course, people are gonna be like, well, sex trafficking is not visible. People, you don't know those. Like, well, then we can ask about other non-visible things that other people don't know that we do have data for. Like homelessness or being in jail or like...

01:10:26,018 --> 01:10:40,190
SPEAKER_1:  if you have been sexually assaulted. A lot of people don't like talking about if they've been sexually assaulted. So you can do a whole bunch of things that are similarly suppressed in knowledge in some way that we do actually have rates for and then compare that to the graph when we ask people, do you know anybody who's been sexually assaulted?

01:10:40,642 --> 01:10:44,158
SPEAKER_1:  So again, this is not perfect. I'm not saying this is ideal. I'm just saying this is試 spannend enough as it is.

01:10:44,290 --> 01:10:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  things.

01:10:45,538 --> 01:10:47,358
SPEAKER_0:  you can infer things about that graph.

01:10:48,066 --> 01:11:00,158
SPEAKER_1:  But then say we don't have good ways of measuring sex trafficking right now. Anyway, I did a big deep dive into the research that we have on sex trafficking in the Western world and the actual, like I read the studies and like reports about the studies and it's really pitiful.

01:11:00,386 --> 01:11:01,566
SPEAKER_1:  We have terrible data.

01:11:01,922 --> 01:11:02,398
SPEAKER_1:  It's like.

01:11:02,754 --> 01:11:10,046
SPEAKER_1:  There's just like vague estimations made from one guy in a basement in the 80s. That's like the basis for like one big study that like a lot of people report.

01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:15,102
SPEAKER_1:  And so I'm like, okay, so the method I'm proposing obviously is not perfect.

01:11:15,426 --> 01:11:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  but like the bar is so low at this point.

01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:22,846
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I wonder also if there's ways to design a survey that gets at the

01:11:23,202 --> 01:11:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  at the victims of sex trafficking.

01:11:25,442 --> 01:11:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  Also.

01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  which is that they presumably have public access to the internet.

01:11:30,626 --> 01:11:31,806
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:11:32,450 --> 01:11:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  I wonder how many of them are distinctly aware.

01:11:35,746 --> 01:11:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  that they're victims.

01:11:36,898 --> 01:11:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  like.

01:11:37,474 --> 01:11:38,782
SPEAKER_0:  is asking the question.

01:11:39,490 --> 01:11:43,646
SPEAKER_0:  when you're inside of a toxic relationship. Are you inside of a toxic relationship?

01:11:43,874 --> 01:11:47,422
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, if the toxic relationship is truly toxic, sometimes.

01:11:48,002 --> 01:11:51,998
SPEAKER_0:  your mind is fucked with, right? you don't even know it's true

01:11:52,386 --> 01:11:55,011
SPEAKER_0:  So it's interesting if you can design surveys that

01:11:55,011 --> 01:11:55,761
SPEAKER_1:  Right.

01:11:55,761 --> 01:11:57,694
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, who could break through that?

01:11:58,338 --> 01:11:59,294
SPEAKER_0:  So basically.

01:11:59,522 --> 01:12:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  get data on how many people are getting sex traffic directly.

01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:08,478
SPEAKER_1:  Oh yeah, like if you don't frame it, like if you don't say the word sex trafficking, you're like, are you just in a situation where you'd-

01:12:09,058 --> 01:12:12,798
SPEAKER_0:  and maybe through the survey, I mean, that's very meta, but through the survey helped them.

01:12:13,442 --> 01:12:29,598
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I did this, this is what started my relationship surveys. So I've done a series of relationship surveys and that was because I knew somebody in a terrible relationship. And I was like, I bet if she took a survey where she answered questions about her relationship and at the end got a score that compared her to everybody else, she'd be like, oh wait, everybody else has much better relationships than I do.

01:12:29,954 --> 01:12:33,329
SPEAKER_1:  So that's why I started making the relationship surveys, exactly for that reason.

01:12:33,329 --> 01:12:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, that's really, really, really powerful to know that you're not.

01:12:37,506 --> 01:12:40,606
SPEAKER_0:  You're not crazy for thinking this is a bad relationship.

01:12:41,602 --> 01:12:44,958
SPEAKER_1:  I think the actual question is could you do better if you broke up?

01:12:45,538 --> 01:12:49,278
SPEAKER_1:  I think that the thing that keeps most people in their relationships is like, this is the best that I can do.

01:12:49,794 --> 01:12:55,262
SPEAKER_1:  Like, this is normal. And if it were normal, I would say that they are right. Like, if you live in a culture where everybody is abusing.

01:12:55,618 --> 01:13:01,438
SPEAKER_1:  there are people in their relationships, then yeah, what are you going to do? Break up and then just be alone for the rest of your life.

01:13:01,986 --> 01:13:03,006
SPEAKER_1:  Most people don't want to do that.

01:13:03,682 --> 01:13:06,398
SPEAKER_0:  But now comparing yourself to the average is good.

01:13:06,658 --> 01:13:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  to know.

01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  know your options are. At least understand it because being normal is not always.

01:13:12,546 --> 01:13:14,014
SPEAKER_0:  like this conversation is not always.

01:13:15,682 --> 01:13:16,190
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:13:17,346 --> 01:13:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  Meaning this conversation is anything but normal. Okay. And, uh,

01:13:23,938 --> 01:13:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  That was a tangent on a tangent about a niche passion, which is really fascinating that you're playing those kinds of ideas of survey design.

01:13:31,298 --> 01:13:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  But back to camming, so.

01:13:33,794 --> 01:13:35,998
SPEAKER_0:  What were the cons? What were the negatives of camming?

01:13:36,098 --> 01:13:40,766
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, like the exhaustion of just like life, like the high pressure thing, that was probably the worst thing.

01:13:41,506 --> 01:13:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  to not.

01:13:42,242 --> 01:13:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  Was there, what about the interaction with different people? Like the dynamics of the interaction with the-

01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:48,510
SPEAKER_0:  with the fans, I guess. I had to-

01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:49,470
SPEAKER_1:  Pretty great time.

01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:52,158
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, obviously it wasn't perfect because it's the internet, but.

01:13:52,706 --> 01:14:02,814
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know, this is the thing that confuses me a lot because a lot of women that I know complain about being harassed by men quite a lot. They're like, you know, men are always, you know, grow up and are asked, you know, you have to be paranoid in the club.

01:14:03,298 --> 01:14:07,966
SPEAKER_1:  People are like, they're always huffing on you and you're just like, Jesus Christ, get away man. I do not have this experience.

01:14:08,258 --> 01:14:25,534
SPEAKER_1:  or like maybe I do, but I'm interpreting it differently. I don't know. The thing is I don't know what causes me to have such a different experience from these women that are like really feel really hostile towards men. My guess is that there's some sort of like very subtle signaling that we're accidentally doing. Be like, no fault of our own. I'm not saying this is a virtue. I'm saying like maybe it's just.

01:14:25,922 --> 01:14:27,614
SPEAKER_1:  genetic or the fact that I'm tall. Not

01:14:28,034 --> 01:14:29,278
SPEAKER_1:  that the women are doing, yeah.

01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:37,566
SPEAKER_1:  Like that, and it might be just something I'm completely accidentally through no intention, like happening to signal the thing that is causing men to not view me as...

01:14:37,858 --> 01:14:39,198
SPEAKER_1:  like a desirable target.

01:14:39,714 --> 01:14:40,839
SPEAKER_1:  or like a target at all.

01:14:40,839 --> 01:14:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  What about the flip side? Maybe you're not sensitive to the...

01:14:44,834 --> 01:14:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  The creepy stare. Yeah, that also might be true.

01:14:48,162 --> 01:14:51,294
SPEAKER_0:  the dude who's like, as I'm dressing you with his eyes.

01:14:52,226 --> 01:14:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  that.

01:14:52,898 --> 01:14:54,718
SPEAKER_0:  like in a creepy way.

01:14:54,978 --> 01:14:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  that you're just not, you don't like worry about it.

01:14:57,666 --> 01:14:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  Or you're not.

01:14:58,690 --> 01:14:59,294
SPEAKER_0:  touch, like.

01:14:59,682 --> 01:15:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  that the fear of that the anxiety of that the

01:15:02,594 --> 01:15:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  The unpleasantness of that just doesn't hit you.

01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:06,110
SPEAKER_1:  I think that's also...

01:15:06,466 --> 01:15:07,646
SPEAKER_1:  at least part of it.

01:15:08,002 --> 01:15:08,670
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe all of it.

01:15:09,314 --> 01:15:09,630
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:15:09,890 --> 01:15:17,502
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I think there's some evidence for it. I think often guys will do a thing to me and I'm just like, that's a thing, cool. I don't have any negative response whatsoever.

01:15:19,522 --> 01:15:23,647
SPEAKER_0:  call back to the tire. It's a thing. This is nice. That happened was good.

01:15:23,647 --> 01:15:28,414
SPEAKER_1:  know that can happen. I once had like a homeless guy like asked me to come back to my place baby and I was like

01:15:28,642 --> 01:15:34,782
SPEAKER_1:  This is fun. Yeah. I'm like, do you want me to? I love asking men, like, are you trying to get me to have sex with you? Just like saying it out front?

01:15:35,106 --> 01:15:36,254
SPEAKER_1:  And they'll be like, well.

01:15:36,834 --> 01:15:39,486
SPEAKER_1:  Usually they stop for a minute and they're like, well.

01:15:39,842 --> 01:15:40,222
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:15:40,546 --> 01:15:44,670
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean, I would like to have sex. And it'll be like, thanks for asking, but I'm not interested in having sex with you.

01:15:45,442 --> 01:15:48,030
SPEAKER_1:  Have a good day!

01:15:48,706 --> 01:15:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  And that's great. I don't know. I have no issues with that interaction, but like maybe this is the kind of thing that other women would find to be really offensive.

01:15:54,914 --> 01:15:59,966
SPEAKER_0:  So you have that conversation and it doesn't turn into like a threatening feel? No. That was the homeless guy.

01:16:00,258 --> 01:16:02,142
SPEAKER_1:  No, I've never had that happen though.

01:16:02,434 --> 01:16:07,358
SPEAKER_1:  But I think there's something, I think I'm doing something, like again, this is kind of accidental, like I'm just M like this.

01:16:07,618 --> 01:16:11,102
SPEAKER_1:  always. And I think I just happen to be like this at people and they don't expect it.

01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:15,070
SPEAKER_1:  Like they don't expect me to be like really nice while explicitly asking them what their intentions are.

01:16:15,298 --> 01:16:18,526
SPEAKER_1:  Like, directly putting my finger on the thing that like, oh, you're trying to have sex with me.

01:16:18,914 --> 01:16:20,446
SPEAKER_1:  and then also not judging them for it.

01:16:20,738 --> 01:16:25,854
SPEAKER_1:  I think this like throws people off a little bit so they don't get aggressive. Like, oh, you're autistic or something.

01:16:25,954 --> 01:16:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  even the cloak of anonymity on the internet.

01:16:28,770 --> 01:16:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  You are getting

01:16:29,954 --> 01:16:33,822
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I just think I'm just not reactive and or maybe I'm giving off. I don't know.

01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:35,102
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know what's going on. It's.

01:16:35,330 --> 01:16:36,574
SPEAKER_1:  both, they meet the feedback loop.

01:16:36,802 --> 01:16:44,222
SPEAKER_1:  So I just, I had a pretty good experience. I know not everybody did. Definitely people reported having antagonistic experiences, but when I was gaming, I generally really liked.

01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:46,046
SPEAKER_1:  You've been really nice to me, had a great time.

01:16:46,722 --> 01:16:47,582
SPEAKER_1:  made friends.

01:16:49,314 --> 01:16:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  So you also did.

01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  OnlyFans as you mentioned.

01:16:52,738 --> 01:16:56,382
SPEAKER_0:  and I read on a website, so this is very investigative reporting.

01:16:57,090 --> 01:16:57,886
SPEAKER_0:  that uh...

01:16:58,242 --> 01:17:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  and some months you've made a.

01:17:00,578 --> 01:17:03,038
SPEAKER_0:  over $100,000 on OnlyFans.

01:17:03,394 --> 01:17:04,190
SPEAKER_0:  How did that feel?

01:17:04,706 --> 01:17:05,022
SPEAKER_1:  Great.

01:17:05,666 --> 01:17:06,686
SPEAKER_1:  You look great.

01:17:07,586 --> 01:17:08,670
SPEAKER_0:  I mean like, uh...

01:17:09,986 --> 01:17:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  Well, actually, because so much of your upbringing, you didn't have money. You had to struggle with the fact of your job and so on. Maybe a good person to ask can...

01:17:19,266 --> 01:17:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  Money by happiness.

01:17:21,282 --> 01:17:21,854
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:17:22,402 --> 01:17:26,718
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I mean, I think you get like a resting set point of happiness regardless of how much money you have.

01:17:27,266 --> 01:17:30,206
SPEAKER_1:  But money can buy being less stressed, I would say.

01:17:31,394 --> 01:17:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  Is there a lot of variation in the...

01:17:35,554 --> 01:17:37,886
SPEAKER_0:  in a basic rest happiness for humans.

01:17:38,786 --> 01:17:40,661
SPEAKER_0:  in general, like is that a good thing to say?

01:17:40,661 --> 01:17:52,958
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, they've done some studies, but again, again, I'm not sure. I haven't actually read the study, so maybe they didn't replicate, where they measured people before and after winning a bunch of money to see if their happiness is higher. I think it's by some measures it was, and by some it wasn't.

01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  I mean like

01:17:54,466 --> 01:17:56,958
SPEAKER_0:  basically almost genetically, so nature and nurture, but...

01:17:57,762 --> 01:17:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  is there.

01:17:58,754 --> 01:18:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  Let's say after you're 18, is there like some stable?

01:18:02,530 --> 01:18:03,966
SPEAKER_0:  level of happiness.

01:18:04,674 --> 01:18:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  that all the environmental genetic factors combine to create so that everything that life throws at you.

01:18:10,402 --> 01:18:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  uh... has to face that happens if you mentioned earlier that i seem to be happy with a lot of stuff

01:18:15,074 --> 01:18:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  So maybe I have a certain level, do other people have a lower level, some people have higher level? Yeah, definitely. Is that a useful or?

01:18:23,522 --> 01:18:27,070
SPEAKER_0:  Is that a useful model of human beings or is it all ups and downs?

01:18:29,186 --> 01:18:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  Is it all like-

01:18:30,594 --> 01:18:32,382
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, there's no stable. Like, there's no combo, right?

01:18:32,770 --> 01:18:35,998
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know, some people just are happier than others in general, and other people...

01:18:37,026 --> 01:18:41,694
SPEAKER_1:  But then you also have ups and downs. Like I'm sure you've experienced sadness sometimes and happiness the other times.

01:18:42,178 --> 01:18:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  If I actually were to integrate, so have an integral under the curve,

01:18:46,114 --> 01:18:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  the area under the curve.

01:18:48,642 --> 01:18:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know if I'm different than other people. Maybe I'm just like-

01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  really focus on the happy moments.

01:18:53,474 --> 01:18:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  and maybe feel the down moments most intensely.

01:18:56,194 --> 01:18:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  And maybe that.

01:18:57,090 --> 01:18:57,406
SPEAKER_0:  Like.

01:18:58,530 --> 01:18:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  On average, it's all the same.

01:19:00,514 --> 01:19:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  Is that possible?

01:19:01,698 --> 01:19:02,046
SPEAKER_0:  I mean...

01:19:02,594 --> 01:19:03,134
SPEAKER_1:  Me?

01:19:04,674 --> 01:19:12,835
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know, I remember when I was a kid, my mom would call me Pollyanna all the time. So I was like finding the good in everything. I'd be like, something bad would happen. So you were a happy kid. I was a really happy kid.

01:19:12,835 --> 01:19:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  Even in a harsh...

01:19:15,202 --> 01:19:18,526
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean like I said, I think the harshness comes from the bad meaning.

01:19:19,202 --> 01:19:21,310
SPEAKER_1:  then I had good meaning applied to it. You were stoked.

01:19:22,146 --> 01:19:23,271
SPEAKER_1:  I was, yeah.

01:19:23,271 --> 01:19:24,254
SPEAKER_0:  with another book.

01:19:24,514 --> 01:19:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  I'm reading next week. Tune in Marcus really is meditation.

01:19:29,954 --> 01:19:30,270
SPEAKER_0:

01:19:31,682 --> 01:19:32,062
SPEAKER_0:  Alright.

01:19:33,026 --> 01:19:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  All right, uh, camming.

01:19:35,746 --> 01:19:37,630
SPEAKER_0:  100k so far good so

01:19:38,818 --> 01:19:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  It's crazy though, right? You can just like...

01:19:41,698 --> 01:19:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  take clothes off in a creative way with some gnomes and make a hundred thousand?

01:19:45,538 --> 01:19:48,030
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean there was a lot more to it than that, but yeah.

01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:49,575
SPEAKER_0:  What was it? What's the- what's the-

01:19:49,575 --> 01:19:50,526
SPEAKER_1:  I'm using marketing.

01:19:51,106 --> 01:19:55,582
SPEAKER_1:  Like, so with only, with my free cams, I was unusual in that I decided to do.

01:19:55,970 --> 01:20:02,142
SPEAKER_1:  outside of the website marketing, I'd like post on Reddit, right? This was very unusual at the time, but like OnlyFans is structured such that-

01:20:02,594 --> 01:20:09,950
SPEAKER_1:  uh... they didn't have no almost no internal discovery whatsoever so if you want people to come to your page you have to go out on the external websites and advertise for yourself directly

01:20:10,626 --> 01:20:11,326
SPEAKER_1:  Very different model.

01:20:11,554 --> 01:20:21,790
SPEAKER_1:  And so this is something I had already been doing, and already had practiced in, and so I think I was already quite advanced. I already had an account on Reddit that was seven years old at the time. Tons of karma that means I could post in subreddits.

01:20:22,146 --> 01:20:30,302
SPEAKER_1:  I already been on Twitter for years, you know, like posting actively. So I already had like presences on all these other platforms that really helped with the conversion. Reddit and Twitter.

01:20:30,626 --> 01:20:33,251
SPEAKER_1:  Reddit, Twitter, FetLife, Instagram, TikTok.

01:20:33,251 --> 01:20:34,462
SPEAKER_0:  Still advertising creatively.

01:20:35,042 --> 01:20:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  So like, there's like sexuality, but there's also...

01:20:38,658 --> 01:20:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  creative sexuality and ideas too.

01:20:41,154 --> 01:20:46,270
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, like one of the really popular ones was I like molested myself as a mime using a

01:20:46,530 --> 01:20:46,878
SPEAKER_1:  uh

01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:47,838
SPEAKER_1:  A.

01:20:48,066 --> 01:20:50,078
SPEAKER_1:  one arm through a jacket.

01:20:50,658 --> 01:20:52,798
SPEAKER_1:  And so the jacket looked like it was.

01:20:54,306 --> 01:20:54,622
SPEAKER_1:

01:20:54,914 --> 01:20:55,294
SPEAKER_0:  You

01:20:55,554 --> 01:20:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  Thanks for watching!

01:20:56,098 --> 01:20:58,174
SPEAKER_1:  The jacket looked like it was alive and...

01:20:58,882 --> 01:21:00,158
SPEAKER_1:  And that one did really well.

01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:03,038
SPEAKER_0:  Did you like brainstorm with somebody and like?

01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:05,214
SPEAKER_0:  I recently got to hang out with Mr. Beast and-

01:21:05,666 --> 01:21:09,598
SPEAKER_0:  sit on a session of brainstorming different ideas.

01:21:09,858 --> 01:21:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  I just envision you with like a team brainstorming.

01:21:14,242 --> 01:21:16,926
SPEAKER_0:  I will try the mine in the molesting thing.

01:21:17,378 --> 01:21:19,038
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, it's too edgy.

01:21:19,362 --> 01:21:20,062
SPEAKER_1:  ту亲 Hassan

01:21:20,706 --> 01:21:22,686
SPEAKER_1:  I wish, I think the two would've been fun.

01:21:23,106 --> 01:21:40,958
SPEAKER_1:  But no, it's just me. Like I had an apartment that looked like, kind of like this, you know, you just sit alone and you're like, well, that would be a good idea. And I'd seen, you just collect ideas over time, right? Like I'd seen somebody doing a version of the, like this animated hand act, like when I was a kid. And I just always stuck in my head. And like one day I was like, I bet I could do that.

01:21:41,378 --> 01:21:48,670
SPEAKER_1:  And then when I was trying to think of ideas to do as a sex worker, I was like, why don't I just try that? And then it turned out to be like, like a really like quite a viral hit.

01:21:48,898 --> 01:21:49,822
SPEAKER_0:  Is there a...

01:21:50,146 --> 01:21:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  Is there stuff like you mentioned too edgy?

01:21:52,130 --> 01:21:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  Like MrBeast tries to keep it PG.

01:21:54,402 --> 01:21:56,277
SPEAKER_0:  Do you try to keep it PG-13?

01:21:56,277 --> 01:22:00,777
SPEAKER_1:  Well with the sex advertising stuff, I mean it's sex advertising so it's obviously not PG-13.

01:22:00,777 --> 01:22:03,027
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know these ratings.

01:22:03,027 --> 01:22:04,638
SPEAKER_1:  not family friendly.

01:22:05,218 --> 01:22:08,990
SPEAKER_1:  It is X, like the one that I'm describing to you at some point, like you can see my boob.

01:22:09,570 --> 01:22:12,350
SPEAKER_0:  As a boob is X. A boob is X.

01:22:12,514 --> 01:22:13,639
SPEAKER_1:  I guess. It's not hard.

01:22:13,639 --> 01:22:14,389
SPEAKER_0:  I think you could

01:22:14,389 --> 01:22:18,718
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, maybe X is like if you got some sort of rhythmic motion going on.

01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:22,142
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe that sound, but the rhythmic motion not.

01:22:24,578 --> 01:22:28,327
SPEAKER_0:  You can have one or the other, but you can't have both. Both!

01:22:28,327 --> 01:22:29,310
SPEAKER_1:  That's when we hit the X.

01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:29,918
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:22:30,370 --> 01:22:30,686
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

01:22:31,138 --> 01:22:35,294
SPEAKER_1:  So definitely not fail. I mean, with the sex advertising stuff, like guys like vanilla shit, guys want.

01:22:35,778 --> 01:22:36,414
SPEAKER_1:  Basic.

01:22:36,770 --> 01:22:37,470
SPEAKER_1:  Hot girl.

01:22:37,794 --> 01:22:45,342
SPEAKER_1:  You can do something like kind of sexy and creative, like getting abducted by gnomes or like the self molestation, right? But those are still pretty within the normal boundaries.

01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  What do you mean guys like vanilla stuff?

01:22:48,162 --> 01:22:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, most guys like vanilla stuff.

01:22:50,370 --> 01:22:53,150
SPEAKER_0:  What's vanilla stuff? Like, Haw所以่或 kur  incorrectly

01:22:54,178 --> 01:22:56,606
SPEAKER_0:  I think my...

01:22:56,866 --> 01:23:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  over to the window on what is vanilla is expanding.

01:23:01,186 --> 01:23:04,579
SPEAKER_0:  quickly after following your work, but yeah.

01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:12,829
SPEAKER_1:  I actually have done a lot of studies on what is vanilla. Like I've done a couple different surveys where I ask people like how taboo is this thing and I've like a rating from least to most.

01:23:12,829 --> 01:23:16,670
SPEAKER_0:  By the way, I don't like, I don't appreciate the beauty of vanilla ice cream.

01:23:17,314 --> 01:23:17,886
SPEAKER_1:  You don't?

01:23:18,178 --> 01:23:19,262
SPEAKER_1:  It is really good though.

01:23:20,450 --> 01:23:22,325
SPEAKER_1:  You eat vanilla ice cream? I even think you didn't eat my ice cream when you were dancing with really cool melodies

01:23:22,325 --> 01:23:26,449
SPEAKER_0:  I think there's just so many more options. It's like the absence of

01:23:26,449 --> 01:23:28,510
SPEAKER_1:  creativity. If you put it in like some-

01:23:28,834 --> 01:23:29,854
SPEAKER_1:  chocolate chips or something.

01:23:30,850 --> 01:23:32,190
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, they already made them more interesting.

01:23:32,898 --> 01:23:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  Um, to start.

01:23:34,530 --> 01:23:41,598
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, so what's vanilla? And why do guys like vanilla? So hot girl doing hot girl things, what, like undressing and then-

01:23:41,730 --> 01:23:49,310
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. The thing that I found was most successful were frames where the man was framed as passive and the woman is active or like.

01:23:49,538 --> 01:23:55,550
SPEAKER_1:  For example, like, oh, you know, we got assigned to the same bunk at the breeding school or something.

01:23:55,778 --> 01:23:57,534
SPEAKER_1:  or like, oh, we're the last people on earth.

01:23:58,210 --> 01:23:58,878
SPEAKER_1:  Right, alright.

01:23:59,138 --> 01:24:00,638
SPEAKER_1:  Like, oh no, I...

01:24:01,026 --> 01:24:05,438
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I like, I desperately need somebody to like cure me with this disease and I need semen.

01:24:05,826 --> 01:24:15,870
SPEAKER_1:  So it's like in any scenario where the guy just like finds himself such that the woman like desperately needs him for some reason and he doesn't have to do much. That is like typically one of the much more successful things.

01:24:16,290 --> 01:24:18,174
SPEAKER_1:  Like guys like women falling into their lap.

01:24:18,498 --> 01:24:19,646
SPEAKER_1:  What about the power dynamics?

01:24:20,354 --> 01:24:23,358
SPEAKER_1:  So guys are less into power dynamics than women are.

01:24:23,970 --> 01:24:27,614
SPEAKER_1:  And you can do power dynamics as long as it's like handed to them.

01:24:28,194 --> 01:24:35,998
SPEAKER_1:  Some guys, obviously, some guys are like very dominant and like prefer like having to work, but this is the minority. Like if you're trying to do make 100k in a month and you're trying to appeal to the widest.

01:24:36,322 --> 01:24:41,982
SPEAKER_1:  group of people, the most effective advertising, you're not gonna be making the most money by being particularly submissive.

01:24:42,146 --> 01:24:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  So on the caming side, that's your...

01:24:45,122 --> 01:24:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  Unlike escorting or just personal relationships.

01:24:49,698 --> 01:24:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  You're trying to, you have an audience.

01:24:52,514 --> 01:24:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  You have like a theater full of people.

01:24:54,818 --> 01:24:55,943
SPEAKER_0:  Like with live camming? Yep.

01:24:55,943 --> 01:24:58,046
SPEAKER_1:  Double life camera. It's like a life theater.

01:24:58,466 --> 01:25:00,638
SPEAKER_0:  Is that freak you out? There's just a bunch of people watching.

01:25:00,866 --> 01:25:02,366
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, how do you feel right now?

01:25:02,818 --> 01:25:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know their watch because it's not live.

01:25:05,634 --> 01:25:06,590
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, that's true, it's not live.

01:25:06,914 --> 01:25:09,054
SPEAKER_1:  So like it might as well be like they could be watching.

01:25:10,018 --> 01:25:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like there's just the two of us. I don't, and there's like, sometimes I imagine there's a third person. Like God? No, no, no, not God. I usually imagine.

01:25:20,066 --> 01:25:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  either a guy or girl or a couple.

01:25:22,338 --> 01:25:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  sitting there for some reason, like usually on the beach and usually high.

01:25:26,082 --> 01:25:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  or on some kind of like a mushroom just like listening passively.

01:25:29,474 --> 01:25:31,349
SPEAKER_0:  Just kind of looking at the sunset, that's what I meant.

01:25:31,349 --> 01:25:32,382
SPEAKER_1:  That's really good

01:25:33,090 --> 01:25:35,870
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's useful, like when I write my blog posts, sometimes I...

01:25:36,162 --> 01:25:40,702
SPEAKER_1:  do terribly, but it's the most effective when I imagine one person that I'm writing to, to try to explain.

01:25:40,994 --> 01:25:44,030
SPEAKER_1:  And like having a high couple watching the sunset is maybe...

01:25:44,290 --> 01:25:46,165
SPEAKER_1:  really lovely as a calibration.

01:25:46,165 --> 01:25:47,902
SPEAKER_0:  I have to say, it is pretty romantic.

01:25:48,674 --> 01:25:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  I've gotten a chance to meet couples that listen to podcasts together. I don't know why

01:25:54,498 --> 01:25:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  That seems like intensely romantic to me because I...

01:25:58,466 --> 01:25:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  because you're not watching.

01:26:00,002 --> 01:26:02,494
SPEAKER_0:  TV together, you're listening to a thing.

01:26:02,818 --> 01:26:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  I guess sometimes they watch it, but like...

01:26:05,026 --> 01:26:06,398
SPEAKER_0:  You're listening to

01:26:06,946 --> 01:26:08,254
SPEAKER_0:  ideas together.

01:26:09,570 --> 01:26:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  Hara.

01:26:10,210 --> 01:26:12,835
SPEAKER_1:  It's like you're going through the same kind of thought process.

01:26:12,835 --> 01:26:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  That's a really beautiful way to put it. Suicide.

01:26:15,458 --> 01:26:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  You're mudding.

01:26:16,738 --> 01:26:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  your thinking is following the same line. Some of our podcasts do that more than movies.

01:26:21,058 --> 01:26:23,326
SPEAKER_0:  I think movies give you a lot more freedom to think about stuff.

01:26:23,650 --> 01:26:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like your thoughts are aligned.

01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  And like, especially if the podcast is good, like if it's listening to, um,

01:26:30,658 --> 01:26:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  like a Dan Carlin podcast about history, that you're like on a journey together.

01:26:35,170 --> 01:26:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  There's an intimacy to that anyway.

01:26:38,114 --> 01:26:40,798
SPEAKER_0:  Um, but I've learned that there's couples do that.

01:26:41,698 --> 01:26:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

01:26:42,338 --> 01:26:45,278
SPEAKER_0:  Look, hashtag relationship goals. Go ahead. Was here.

01:26:45,538 --> 01:26:47,413
SPEAKER_0:  feature-wise with my

01:26:47,413 --> 01:26:48,734
SPEAKER_1:  You should make an application.

01:26:49,474 --> 01:26:55,614
SPEAKER_1:  Application? An application for dating you. I mean, maybe this is more of like my strategy and less yours, but you have like a wide enough audience of my work.

01:26:56,930 --> 01:26:57,726
SPEAKER_0: はい

01:26:58,242 --> 01:26:58,878
SPEAKER_0:  It's not.

01:26:59,938 --> 01:27:00,574
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:27:02,306 --> 01:27:06,622
SPEAKER_0:  This okay, let's just go there so you could you put together an application of like.

01:27:06,914 --> 01:27:14,942
SPEAKER_0:  People to have casual sex with you. I think you've had that also dating and also dating in relationship I'd love to so what is in that application because I

01:27:16,322 --> 01:27:17,438
SPEAKER_0:  you know, uh,

01:27:18,530 --> 01:27:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  I'm sure there's quite a lot of people that would like to.

01:27:21,506 --> 01:27:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  date you.

01:27:22,466 --> 01:27:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  or to sleep with you.

01:27:24,290 --> 01:27:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  but finding the person.

01:27:25,794 --> 01:27:29,118
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it depends on your goals. I guess relationship would be an open relationship for you.

01:27:29,346 --> 01:27:29,758
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

01:27:30,530 --> 01:27:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  Like for me, I guess it's.

01:27:32,386 --> 01:27:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  more.

01:27:33,122 --> 01:27:37,566
SPEAKER_0:  Intensely selective because it's like a monogamous relationship and a committed one

01:27:37,954 --> 01:27:38,302
SPEAKER_0:  Like.

01:27:40,546 --> 01:27:42,238
SPEAKER_0:  Like I'm swinging for the...

01:27:43,010 --> 01:27:44,574
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, like long term.

01:27:44,898 --> 01:27:45,790
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not like...

01:27:46,018 --> 01:27:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  Weirdly.

01:27:47,586 --> 01:27:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  obsessed with long-term, but it's like, you just, I would love to have one girl for the rest of my life.

01:27:54,306 --> 01:27:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  Finding that.

01:27:55,554 --> 01:27:57,278
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like applications will not get to that.

01:27:57,666 --> 01:27:59,966
SPEAKER_0:  They like there's some aspect of the magic of the.

01:28:00,418 --> 01:28:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  the serendipity of it of meeting people in strange places and so on.

01:28:03,938 --> 01:28:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  I just personally noticed that like fame.

01:28:06,914 --> 01:28:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  has not made that process easier.

01:28:08,898 --> 01:28:16,574
SPEAKER_1:  But I mean, like if you could, you know, if there's two rooms and one of them, it's like a random population of hot women and the other one is a random population of hot women, but all of them.

01:28:16,834 --> 01:28:21,854
SPEAKER_1:  definitely are monogamous and are looking for a long-term committed relationship. Like which room would you rather go into?

01:28:23,362 --> 01:28:24,574
SPEAKER_1:  Like if you're looking for a mate.

01:28:25,058 --> 01:28:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, well, but see, I guess my preferences are more this. This is a really strong point, but my preferences are represent the majority probably.

01:28:32,866 --> 01:28:35,870
SPEAKER_0:  Right? Because don't most women want monogamous relationships? You

01:28:36,418 --> 01:28:36,830
SPEAKER_0:  So like.

01:28:37,442 --> 01:28:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  It's...

01:28:38,242 --> 01:28:39,614
SPEAKER_0:  I'm okay with either option.

01:28:39,970 --> 01:28:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  Mm-hmm.

01:28:40,866 --> 01:28:44,094
SPEAKER_1:  because statistically speaking. Right, but like we can apply it to like a bunch of other things.

01:28:44,450 --> 01:28:50,910
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, and this is just a problem if you have a high volume to filter through and you don't know. Like it's a good like initial filter.

01:28:51,874 --> 01:28:55,999
SPEAKER_1:  Like you can take it from like a thousand people to 20 people and then go on dates with them.

01:28:55,999 --> 01:28:58,206
SPEAKER_0:  are so anti-romantic like what

01:28:58,882 --> 01:29:01,886
SPEAKER_1:  This is true, this is not the romantic narrative that, uh...

01:29:02,146 --> 01:29:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  that you're very proud of. I feel like how did you two meet?

01:29:05,666 --> 01:29:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  I should pass the three filters I set up.

01:29:09,090 --> 01:29:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

01:29:11,266 --> 01:29:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, but that's also...

01:29:12,930 --> 01:29:14,142
SPEAKER_0:  But also can you put...

01:29:14,402 --> 01:29:15,134
SPEAKER_0:  into

01:29:15,650 --> 01:29:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  a survey the things that you're interested in.

01:29:19,874 --> 01:29:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I definitely think about this a lot with hiring.

01:29:23,234 --> 01:29:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  like teams, engineers and so on.

01:29:26,626 --> 01:29:27,998
SPEAKER_0:  but with engineers.

01:29:29,890 --> 01:29:31,902
SPEAKER_0:  You're okay losing truly special.

01:29:32,642 --> 01:29:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  engineers.

01:29:34,498 --> 01:29:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  because you have to filter because there's like thousands of applications.

01:29:37,730 --> 01:29:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  Like it feels like.

01:29:40,738 --> 01:29:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  It feels like I worry that you would miss the thing that actually.

01:29:44,994 --> 01:29:47,619
SPEAKER_0:  because so much of his chemistry, so much of his magic.

01:29:47,619 --> 01:29:52,894
SPEAKER_1:  But the thing is you're missing it anyway. Yeah, you're missing it. Oh, you can just run it and then in addition.

01:29:53,378 --> 01:29:54,270
SPEAKER_1:  try some of those people.

01:29:55,074 --> 01:29:58,526
SPEAKER_1:  and then go on the dates that you were going to go on with anyway, regardless.

01:29:58,850 --> 01:30:09,438
SPEAKER_1:  It's just the thing that helps like pull someone out of the crowd. Like this, I, I dated a guy from my survey. I'd ran the survey. I assigned point values to each of the questions. I wanted to date with like the top couple of people. And then one of them was like.

01:30:10,338 --> 01:30:12,798
SPEAKER_1:  and I'm still dating him to this day. It was awesome.

01:30:13,506 --> 01:30:16,881
SPEAKER_1:  And I would never, I never would have gone on a date with him without the survey.

01:30:16,881 --> 01:30:21,246
SPEAKER_0:  Can you, can you, if from memory or we can look it up, do you remember what kind of questions were on the survey?

01:30:21,570 --> 01:30:27,902
SPEAKER_1:  I asked a couple different categories. I asked about like basic life stuff. So like what kind of relationships, like like me versus polyamory, like do you want kids?

01:30:28,322 --> 01:30:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  you know, like where you want to live, like basic things that you need to be compatible.

01:30:32,290 --> 01:30:40,894
SPEAKER_1:  and then I asked sexual compatibility, various preferences. And then I had a section about personality. I try to ask questions that would do the most effective filtering.

01:30:41,314 --> 01:30:42,750
SPEAKER_1:  So like, what are ways that like...

01:30:43,042 --> 01:30:43,742
SPEAKER_1:  I can't.

01:30:44,386 --> 01:30:58,897
SPEAKER_1:  give people what they need that maybe they really want. I'm not very outdoorsy. It was just very common, a lot of people like being outdoorsy. So I asked the question, how much do you value someone else that you're dating being outdoorsy? If they said yes, I was like, okay, we probably, I should write down.

01:30:58,897 --> 01:31:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  Man, but that doesn't polyamory make that really difficult

01:31:02,498 --> 01:31:04,158
SPEAKER_0:  because can't they find somebody?

01:31:04,450 --> 01:31:06,494
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, they could. I mean, this doesn't

01:31:07,042 --> 01:31:11,230
SPEAKER_1:  Like, but if you're going to have somebody, it's like nicer to have them be more compatible than less.

01:31:11,746 --> 01:31:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  but you're a little bit like.

01:31:13,730 --> 01:31:16,510
SPEAKER_0:  In terms of sexual compatibility, you're able to.

01:31:17,282 --> 01:31:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  Like.

01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:20,446
SPEAKER_0:  yourself aware enough to know what preferences you have.

01:31:20,834 --> 01:31:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  Thank you.

01:31:21,570 --> 01:31:22,142
SPEAKER_1:  I think so.

01:31:22,786 --> 01:31:26,911
SPEAKER_1:  I think that one helped a lot with the escorting. The escorting helped a lot with knowing my preferences.

01:31:26,911 --> 01:31:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  But there's like out of the giant pool of different preferences, you have a subset that's clearly defined for you.

01:31:34,690 --> 01:31:39,230
SPEAKER_0:  like domino submissive. Yeah, power dynamic stuff. Power dynamic stuff.

01:31:40,962 --> 01:31:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

01:31:41,730 --> 01:31:45,105
SPEAKER_0:  in the not just sexual relationship too, like that was that in the survey.

01:31:45,105 --> 01:31:48,105
SPEAKER_1:  I don't like the power dynamics in relationships. I did ask about- I don't like the power dynamics in relationships.

01:31:48,105 --> 01:31:50,558
SPEAKER_0:  in like making it clear in a survey.

01:31:50,850 --> 01:31:53,278
SPEAKER_0:  asking a question about power dynamics in a relationship.

01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:56,638
SPEAKER_1:  I don't think I asked about paradynamics in relationships.

01:31:57,762 --> 01:31:59,294
SPEAKER_1:  Because I just assume most people don't.

01:31:59,906 --> 01:32:01,374
SPEAKER_1:  There's a lot of things that are kind of like...

01:32:01,538 --> 01:32:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  Most people don't, you're putting together a survey, a systematic survey to understand compatibility.

01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:11,582
SPEAKER_0:  wouldn't power dynamics inside of relationships.

01:32:11,842 --> 01:32:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  that naturally emerge.

01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:14,302
SPEAKER_0:  Often.

01:32:14,946 --> 01:32:19,975
SPEAKER_0:  be part of the question or is that hard to question because it naturally emerges.

01:32:19,975 --> 01:32:23,518
SPEAKER_1:  Well, the thing is like a lot of questions sort of overlap in demographic.

01:32:23,778 --> 01:32:30,051
SPEAKER_1:  And if you're making a survey, you want to have the minimum possible questions that give the maximum possible filtering information.

01:32:30,051 --> 01:32:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:32:32,514 --> 01:32:35,390
SPEAKER_0:  But the purpose of that survey wasn't to do a good research study.

01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:37,525
SPEAKER_0:  It was to select one subject.

01:32:37,525 --> 01:32:45,854
SPEAKER_1:  You could take. So that's part of what is good. Like you want to most efficiently filter out. Because one, like you get more people taking the survey the fewer questions you have, which is good for finding a mate.

01:32:46,114 --> 01:32:49,489
SPEAKER_1:  Like if you have 5,000 men take the surveys, better than 1,000 men take the surveys.

01:32:49,489 --> 01:32:50,174
SPEAKER_0:

01:32:50,402 --> 01:32:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  that would be patient enough.

01:32:52,514 --> 01:32:53,639
SPEAKER_0:  And dedicated enough to-

01:32:53,639 --> 01:32:58,078
SPEAKER_1:  But like what if you want like a high-powered man who's like on his lunch break? Yeah, right, so it's like

01:32:58,210 --> 01:33:00,085
SPEAKER_0:  Like a billionaire is too busy just flip.

01:33:00,085 --> 01:33:00,638
SPEAKER_1:  Exactly.

01:33:01,282 --> 01:33:07,582
SPEAKER_1:  And the guy that I dated was, he took the survey, he was waiting for the piece to come out of the oven. Because it was important that it was short.

01:33:08,162 --> 01:33:10,142
SPEAKER_1:  And so you want to be efficient. So what do you put in?

01:33:10,562 --> 01:33:15,390
SPEAKER_1:  He was literally waiting for pizza and he saw the thing. I guess I'll just fill up this rivet really fast.

01:33:15,778 --> 01:33:21,406
SPEAKER_1:  changed our lives. So romantic. For me, this is my kind of romance. I'm really into it.

01:33:21,794 --> 01:33:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  But you could be efficient with surveys by making sure your questions don't overlap. So for example, if somebody is very polyamorous, they're very unlikely to be interested in a traditional man works and like.

01:33:32,322 --> 01:33:36,958
SPEAKER_1:  and the job and the woman stays home and raises the kids kind of relationship. Because probably people just generally don't do that.

01:33:37,186 --> 01:33:41,022
SPEAKER_1:  And so if I'm asking about polyamory, it sort of kind of already covers the thing.

01:33:41,474 --> 01:33:47,294
SPEAKER_1:  And so if I have a whole bunch of questions, like I can kind of like triangulate a bunch of implicit kinds of questions that I haven't directly asked about.

01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:53,374
SPEAKER_1:  So this is why I didn't ask directly about power dynamics, because like from the rest of the questions or in my survey, like I think-

01:33:53,698 --> 01:33:54,046
SPEAKER_1:  Pretty.

01:33:54,306 --> 01:33:56,350
SPEAKER_1:  accurately predict whether or not you're going to be interested.

01:33:56,866 --> 01:33:57,991
SPEAKER_1:  in power dynamics.

01:33:57,991 --> 01:33:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  I'm afraid, I'm afraid.

01:33:59,138 --> 01:34:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I'm trying to think as you're talking.

01:34:01,730 --> 01:34:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  I get it.

01:34:02,594 --> 01:34:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  It's.

01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  That's really interesting that you did that also.

01:34:06,370 --> 01:34:11,422
SPEAKER_0:  maybe not for the effectiveness of finding a partner, but for just exploring the actual process.

01:34:12,706 --> 01:34:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  of human sexuality, of like the search.

01:34:16,258 --> 01:34:19,326
SPEAKER_0:  this complicated optimization process we're all engaging in.

01:34:19,586 --> 01:34:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  on the landscape of happiness that seems to be this.

01:34:23,362 --> 01:34:23,934
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:34:25,218 --> 01:34:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  not even a differentiable function. It's a giant nonlinear mess.

01:34:29,954 --> 01:34:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

01:34:30,946 --> 01:34:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  But like for me, I don't think I would be able to design that survey.

01:34:34,082 --> 01:34:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  I would like bias it too strongly.

01:34:37,442 --> 01:34:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  I would probably prefer.

01:34:38,946 --> 01:34:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  Women.

01:34:40,290 --> 01:34:44,478
SPEAKER_0:  that have read Dusty F-Sky or something like that. That would be a filter for me, right? Yeah.

01:34:44,738 --> 01:34:47,774
SPEAKER_0:  but like that's a horrible filter. Cause there's a lot of like.

01:34:48,098 --> 01:34:59,870
SPEAKER_0:  There's a lot of amazing people that have never, they don't give a shit about reading or they don't give a shit about reading Russian literature or they don't give a shit about, but they're amazing and passionate and creative and all in some other dimension that you might completely miss. But you're like-

01:35:00,226 --> 01:35:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  I wonder if there's any, basically you're saying compatibility like hard lines.

01:35:04,802 --> 01:35:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  that you know.

01:35:05,762 --> 01:35:07,774
SPEAKER_0:  Statistically, it's just going to be an issue.

01:35:08,450 --> 01:35:09,950
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean you wait this a lot more.

01:35:10,210 --> 01:35:13,502
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. But there's also like preferences, like if you have a woman who's totally equal.

01:35:13,762 --> 01:35:14,974
SPEAKER_1:  and she's read the thing that you like.

01:35:15,266 --> 01:35:18,462
SPEAKER_1:  for another woman who's also identical, but like she hasn't read the thing that you like.

01:35:19,010 --> 01:35:20,885
SPEAKER_1:  Like you probably like very slightly prefer the one that I have.

01:35:20,885 --> 01:35:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know if they done it. Yes, yes, but like you can't through survey get borrow.

01:35:24,706 --> 01:35:32,094
SPEAKER_1:  You don't know. Sure, but you can kind of like do a whole bunch of ways. So like the person that I ended up going on a date with, he did not answer correctly to a lot of.

01:35:32,482 --> 01:35:34,014
SPEAKER_1:  the survey questions, but he didn't have to.

01:35:34,434 --> 01:35:39,121
SPEAKER_1:  Like he was just overall, overall the weights were like he just tended to be more in the direction. Was there.

01:35:39,121 --> 01:35:40,478
SPEAKER_0:  text-based fill in like

01:35:40,866 --> 01:35:43,070
SPEAKER_0:  Survey, sorry, paragraph like.

01:35:43,266 --> 01:35:45,662
SPEAKER_1:  No, you ought to avoid that if you're dealing with large amounts of...

01:35:46,018 --> 01:35:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  data no one out cuz you have to fill the click oh oh interesting.

01:35:50,242 --> 01:35:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  Interesting, like I'm different.

01:35:52,386 --> 01:35:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  First of all, you can do keyword searches.

01:35:54,658 --> 01:35:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  Second of all, you do machine learning models that like,

01:35:59,938 --> 01:36:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  First of all, you can do like crude metrics, like the length.

01:36:04,674 --> 01:36:07,102
SPEAKER_0:  of how long they've written.

01:36:08,738 --> 01:36:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:36:09,378 --> 01:36:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  it could flag certain things. Yeah, it's actually pretty easy to, I've looked at, like for hiring, I've looked at like thousands of applications really quickly.

01:36:17,634 --> 01:36:20,510
SPEAKER_0:  he really is that the human brain is really interesting especially

01:36:21,090 --> 01:36:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:36:23,042 --> 01:36:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  Like.

01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:26,782
SPEAKER_0:  if you visually highlight certain information for yourself, like.

01:36:27,330 --> 01:36:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  keywords.

01:36:28,674 --> 01:36:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  or

01:36:29,474 --> 01:36:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  Again, with machine learning models like sentiment.

01:36:32,098 --> 01:36:35,902
SPEAKER_0:  You can highlight different parts that will catch your eye better than not.

01:36:36,386 --> 01:36:39,011
SPEAKER_0:  And I can go through just a huge number of applications.

01:36:39,011 --> 01:36:42,110
SPEAKER_1:  Are you telling me I can use, if I learn machine learning, I can...

01:36:42,818 --> 01:36:45,182
SPEAKER_1:  process dating survey applications better? yes

01:36:45,442 --> 01:36:49,918
SPEAKER_1:  No, like textual. Yeah, like I can have them write things in. This is like a new way of-

01:36:50,530 --> 01:36:51,655
SPEAKER_1:  That would be, yeah.

01:36:51,655 --> 01:36:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  I think that would, so the really nice aspect.

01:36:56,482 --> 01:36:57,022
SPEAKER_0:  of

01:36:57,314 --> 01:37:03,870
SPEAKER_0:  text input, like long form text input, multiple long form text input based on an interestingly phrased question.

01:37:04,450 --> 01:37:06,078
SPEAKER_0:  is you get to learn.

01:37:06,690 --> 01:37:08,862
SPEAKER_0:  how to make a better survey. I think you would appreciate that.

01:37:09,218 --> 01:37:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  Like you start to see how they're actually interacting with these questions.

01:37:12,610 --> 01:37:14,558
SPEAKER_0:  Like I ask certain questions like.

01:37:14,850 --> 01:37:16,030
SPEAKER_0:  just to see how people think.

01:37:16,386 --> 01:37:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  Is it better to work smart or better to work hard?

01:37:21,090 --> 01:37:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  or

01:37:22,658 --> 01:37:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  Um,

01:37:23,746 --> 01:37:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  Is it?

01:37:25,058 --> 01:37:27,262
SPEAKER_0:  uh... ever okay to betray a close friend

01:37:29,186 --> 01:37:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  I'll ask questions like this that don't really have a right answer, but I just want to see how they think. Is truth more important than loyalty?

01:37:36,866 --> 01:37:38,741
SPEAKER_0:  and I get their long form in.

01:37:38,741 --> 01:37:41,278
SPEAKER_1:  You get like a and you get to see the reasoning process. Yeah

01:37:41,474 --> 01:37:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  Like what they reveal so much.

01:37:44,546 --> 01:37:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  not just about the

01:37:45,666 --> 01:37:53,406
SPEAKER_0:  but about the kind of questions I should be asking that have nothing to do with truth or loyalty. Like how to get a good engineer with like very specific questions.

01:37:53,698 --> 01:37:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  but I think it's really useful to get text input.

01:37:56,258 --> 01:38:06,622
SPEAKER_1:  I have done text input usually with beta surveys. So I usually do beta surveys before I do the real survey. What's a beta survey? Like I do like a shorter version or it depends on what I'm doing, but like a different version of the survey.

01:38:06,850 --> 01:38:12,670
SPEAKER_1:  that I have people take before I release. I use their information from the initial survey to inform the questions that I ask in the real survey.

01:38:12,962 --> 01:38:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  And I haven't actually in recently, but I used to do a lot of like the text based questions to see.

01:38:18,082 --> 01:38:23,038
SPEAKER_1:  for similar, although I don't think I relied on it quite as heavily, and if I introduced machine learning, things would be a lot more efficient.

01:38:23,778 --> 01:38:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  I love that you're also doing like you're writing scripts and stuff.

01:38:26,946 --> 01:38:27,582
SPEAKER_0:  I keep doing it.

01:38:27,970 --> 01:38:31,715
SPEAKER_0:  You're doing some like, like statistical analysis. Are you using Python mostly? Yeah.

01:38:31,715 --> 01:38:34,366
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I had to learn Python for...

01:38:35,074 --> 01:38:36,199
SPEAKER_1:  this.

01:38:36,199 --> 01:38:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  months ago. It was because of the

01:38:38,242 --> 01:38:41,822
SPEAKER_0:  And the best reason to learn machine learning is to solve actual like.

01:38:42,754 --> 01:38:50,878
SPEAKER_1:  I can't be motivated. I'm just not motivated to learn something unless there's an actual curiosity I have and I have to learn it and to solve it. I was trying to avoid learning coding for so long.

01:38:51,138 --> 01:38:53,310
SPEAKER_1:  but eventually it was my dataset became too large.

01:38:53,762 --> 01:38:55,422
SPEAKER_1:  I couldn't work with it with anything else, so.

01:38:56,834 --> 01:38:57,959
SPEAKER_1:  Python it is.

01:38:57,959 --> 01:39:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  also an interesting data set that you're probably interested in.

01:39:00,386 --> 01:39:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  A little bit is like Twitter itself, right?

01:39:02,402 --> 01:39:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know if you've, I've played with the Twitter API a lot.

01:39:05,698 --> 01:39:06,270
SPEAKER_1:  Can you just?

01:39:08,418 --> 01:39:08,894
SPEAKER_1:  Download.

01:39:09,954 --> 01:39:13,895
SPEAKER_1:  I'm just, I'm stuttering now because the... Download the Twitter?

01:39:13,895 --> 01:39:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not a quitter.

01:39:15,746 --> 01:39:22,110
SPEAKER_0:  No, there's a lot of Twitter. So Twitter's a social network with a bunch of people. They're interacting a lot.

01:39:22,594 --> 01:39:23,422
SPEAKER_0:  Like there's like.

01:39:23,746 --> 01:39:27,262
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, the number is insane, the number of interactions, but...

01:39:27,522 --> 01:39:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  There's different.

01:39:29,378 --> 01:39:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  ways to interact, to get data from Twitter. There's streams, you can look at.

01:39:33,858 --> 01:39:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  but that's what you're interested in

01:39:35,618 --> 01:39:38,718
SPEAKER_0:  You can do results for searches. You can look at individual.

01:39:39,042 --> 01:39:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  tweets and get entire

01:39:40,770 --> 01:39:48,414
SPEAKER_0:  which to me is super interesting, the entire tree of different conversations that were, the replies, which might be very interesting for you because like

01:39:49,666 --> 01:39:50,462
SPEAKER_0:  It's not.

01:39:51,330 --> 01:39:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  It's much harder to ask rigorous questions than what you do with your...

01:39:55,554 --> 01:40:00,542
SPEAKER_0:  but you could see how divisive certain things are if you look at sentiment.

01:40:00,706 --> 01:40:04,062
SPEAKER_1:  like calibrators to figure out exactly what questions you should be asking.

01:40:04,930 --> 01:40:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  and also highlight.

01:40:06,338 --> 01:40:08,062
SPEAKER_0:  interesting anecdotal things went like.

01:40:08,354 --> 01:40:15,998
SPEAKER_0:  two people freak out at each other and just argue like a thread that goes on for like a thousand messages that you might never be even aware is happening that use criminal justice as your like.

01:40:16,386 --> 01:40:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  because Twitter doesn't like surface that. Like...

01:40:19,170 --> 01:40:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  Twitter doesn't make it easy for you to visualize what the hell is going on even with your own.

01:40:23,490 --> 01:40:25,150
SPEAKER_0:  social network.

01:40:25,890 --> 01:40:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  Like if you post something that's controversial that gets a large amount of attention.

01:40:29,794 --> 01:40:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  You can't clearly visualize everything that's going on. Yeah.

01:40:33,218 --> 01:40:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  Like it's very...

01:40:35,266 --> 01:40:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  It's a blurry amorphous, like you're just kind of looking through the fog at different replies and the kind of...

01:40:41,922 --> 01:40:46,047
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so to be able to... Are you saying with the API, do they have like graphs of networks?

01:40:46,047 --> 01:40:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  You have the data for the grass. Yeah, so you can reconstruct yourself. Yeah.

01:40:49,954 --> 01:40:52,478
SPEAKER_0:  And then you have different levels of access in terms of how many.

01:40:52,994 --> 01:40:53,822
SPEAKER_0:  for what you can do.

01:40:54,722 --> 01:40:55,582
SPEAKER_0:  That is really cool.

01:40:55,842 --> 01:40:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  And now, because there's like, Elon.

01:40:59,074 --> 01:41:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  There's a lot of...

01:41:00,674 --> 01:41:01,086
SPEAKER_0:  sort of.

01:41:02,050 --> 01:41:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  revolutionary stuff happening at Twitter, I think.

01:41:05,058 --> 01:41:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  You could literally sort of push for innovation there. Like there's aggressive innovation happening. So in terms of requesting stuff for the API, you could do all that kind of stuff. I think.

01:41:16,098 --> 01:41:20,190
SPEAKER_0:  Twitter is just a fascinating platform for the, as cliche as it sounds.

01:41:20,418 --> 01:41:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  for studying.

01:41:22,690 --> 01:41:27,358
SPEAKER_0:  For me, it's interesting what makes for a healthy conversation. That term has been used, but it's...

01:41:27,618 --> 01:41:30,942
SPEAKER_0:  Interesting how conversation, to me it's fascinating how conversations break down.

01:41:31,938 --> 01:41:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  and not.

01:41:33,954 --> 01:41:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  How?

01:41:34,850 --> 01:41:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  like the virality of drama.

01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  or

01:41:39,842 --> 01:41:40,638
SPEAKER_0:  conflict.

01:41:40,898 --> 01:41:43,422
SPEAKER_0:  or disagreement, how that evolves.

01:41:43,970 --> 01:41:45,630
SPEAKER_0:  when a large number of people are involved.

01:41:45,986 --> 01:41:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  when a large number of

01:41:47,394 --> 01:41:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  Say hellorosa lukasi

01:41:49,282 --> 01:41:50,718
SPEAKER_0:  misinterpretation of.

01:41:51,010 --> 01:41:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  of statements is involved in text-based with some anonymity thrown in. Like I feel like there's a lot of study that can be done there.

01:41:57,442 --> 01:41:58,430
SPEAKER_1:  I mean Twitter's probably not-

01:41:58,850 --> 01:42:00,382
SPEAKER_1:  great at it right as it stands.

01:42:01,026 --> 01:42:04,638
SPEAKER_1:  because it's necessarily short, you can quote things out of context, etc.

01:42:04,866 --> 01:42:08,830
SPEAKER_0:  But we should understand that, right? Yeah. At a large scale, you should be able to.

01:42:09,154 --> 01:42:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  Study that kind of thing

01:42:10,818 --> 01:42:14,238
SPEAKER_0:  Which oh yeah, what was your casual sex survey?

01:42:14,786 --> 01:42:15,934
SPEAKER_1:  I actually haven't looked at it in a while.

01:42:16,322 --> 01:42:21,854
SPEAKER_1:  I think I just ask people about a whole bunch of fetishes because you don't want to be obvious about yours because then people are going to hijack it to try to...

01:42:22,274 --> 01:42:23,870
SPEAKER_1:  tell you that they like what you like.

01:42:24,162 --> 01:42:28,990
SPEAKER_1:  So you want to be obscure. So how do you design a survey where you're testing for a thing but you're still obscure about the thing you're trying to ask about?

01:42:29,506 --> 01:42:31,102
SPEAKER_0:  So you still see it as a survey.

01:42:31,810 --> 01:42:33,214
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. Look in application.

01:42:34,402 --> 01:42:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  Cause I think he tweeted saying like, I'm thinking of just like showing up to San Francisco and saying

01:42:39,618 --> 01:42:41,438
SPEAKER_0:  Is anybody open for casual sex?

01:42:41,954 --> 01:42:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  Something like this. I might misremember.

01:42:44,482 --> 01:42:45,607
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe escorting? I'm not sure.

01:42:45,607 --> 01:42:47,107
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, for escoc... For you, it's Sophie Ahsanne.

01:42:47,107 --> 01:42:51,422
SPEAKER_1:  Which is similar. Like I kind of use s-grading as the way to have casual sex now

01:42:54,242 --> 01:42:59,870
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, so let's talk about escorting. So you wrote about escorting in your blog post. Escorting was good for me.

01:43:00,834 --> 01:43:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:43:02,114 --> 01:43:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  How did you get into escorting?

01:43:04,034 --> 01:43:10,462
SPEAKER_1:  I quit camming because I was burned out and I was trying to work at a friend's startup.

01:43:11,298 --> 01:43:15,454
SPEAKER_1:  hard for me. It's difficult for me to work on projects that are not my projects.

01:43:16,162 --> 01:43:16,478
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

01:43:17,346 --> 01:43:25,214
SPEAKER_1:  And so I was like, hey, fuck it. I wanna go back to sex work. I wanna make more money, but I don't wanna cam anymore because I'm burned out. So I'm like, well, let's try. I had a friend who was an escort. I'm like, let's try that. And so.

01:43:25,794 --> 01:43:27,966
SPEAKER_1:  We had a call, she outlined the basics for me and then.

01:43:28,418 --> 01:43:30,430
SPEAKER_1:  I put up some ads and started working.

01:43:30,818 --> 01:43:32,693
SPEAKER_0:  What's the basics of S corning? How's that work?

01:43:32,693 --> 01:43:36,702
SPEAKER_1:  If you want to get started escorting, so just in case you have a career change.

01:43:37,218 --> 01:43:39,843
SPEAKER_1:  We're going to want you to get some nice photos so you probably have those.

01:43:39,843 --> 01:43:40,542
SPEAKER_0:  Or s away.

01:43:41,122 --> 01:43:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  You assumed I haven't done it before. How rude. Have you.

01:43:44,578 --> 01:43:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, blow.

01:43:45,570 --> 01:43:46,494
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

01:43:47,298 --> 01:43:49,342
SPEAKER_0:  Recreation I would like to do professionally, I suppose.

01:43:49,666 --> 01:43:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  So if I wanted to do it.

01:43:51,874 --> 01:43:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  If I wanted to do it, if I really wanted to step up my game, how would I do it?

01:43:56,962 --> 01:43:58,814
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, well, you got the whole tutorial.

01:43:59,490 --> 01:43:59,870
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:44:00,834 --> 01:44:02,718
SPEAKER_1:  recreational escorting is just

01:44:05,250 --> 01:44:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  Not meaning like...

01:44:06,466 --> 01:44:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  Like.

01:44:08,258 --> 01:44:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  you know, like selling products on Etsy.

01:44:11,586 --> 01:44:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  versus

01:44:13,762 --> 01:44:14,494
SPEAKER_0:  doing a startup.

01:44:15,330 --> 01:44:19,697
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I mean, SQWERTY is kind of all just selling products on Etsy.

01:44:19,697 --> 01:44:22,471
SPEAKER_0:  Selling a lot of products.

01:44:22,471 --> 01:44:23,102
SPEAKER_1:  I

01:44:23,330 --> 01:44:25,246
SPEAKER_0:  You've like dabbled.

01:44:25,474 --> 01:44:26,599
SPEAKER_0:  Like, yeah.

01:44:26,599 --> 01:44:29,599
SPEAKER_1:  Small handcrafted. It's a small artisan doll

01:44:29,599 --> 01:44:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. That's setting.

01:44:32,002 --> 01:44:34,270
SPEAKER_0:  This is mass manufacture

01:44:35,330 --> 01:44:37,955
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, if you want a mass manufacturer, you're escrow. I just feel.

01:44:37,955 --> 01:44:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like I haven't been getting...

01:44:39,586 --> 01:44:40,670
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I've been.

01:44:41,090 --> 01:44:44,286
SPEAKER_0:  undervaluing my services. And I would like to really step up.

01:44:44,450 --> 01:44:47,262
SPEAKER_1:  I think you could really just like grease some marketing gears and...

01:44:48,130 --> 01:44:52,798
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I mean, some of this is marketing. So like how, I guess I want to like know.

01:44:53,442 --> 01:44:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  Is it similar to camming in that way? Like is it, uh...

01:44:56,610 --> 01:44:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  You're basically advertising yourself and you're.

01:45:00,354 --> 01:45:04,350
SPEAKER_0:  uh... they did marketing there all the creativity the mention before all that

01:45:04,898 --> 01:45:09,182
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I found s-grading to be pretty easy because s-grading is not like highly competitive.

01:45:09,474 --> 01:45:24,446
SPEAKER_1:  For example, camming is highly competitive because like the thing that I outlined before, you know the amount of money that you make determines your ranking. And you can also go and see other girls. You can see what they're doing. So if a girl figures out an incredible strategy for making money, it's like two seconds before that strategy perlithrates into everybody else.

01:45:24,738 --> 01:45:26,686
SPEAKER_1:  So it's very fast-paced and like really tough.

01:45:26,978 --> 01:45:32,478
SPEAKER_1:  With S-coding, you don't get to see what other girls are doing. You can look at their websites, but you don't know what they're doing with clients at all.

01:45:32,962 --> 01:45:38,398
SPEAKER_1:  You can look at their rates, but you don't know what their volume is. So you don't actually know what is successful and what isn't very much.

01:45:38,850 --> 01:45:43,742
SPEAKER_1:  So I think there's much less evolution of marketing through this process.

01:45:44,066 --> 01:45:49,566
SPEAKER_1:  And so I came in with like my aggressive marketing skills for being a cam girl. I think that really helped. I did very well.

01:45:49,954 --> 01:45:54,334
SPEAKER_1:  as an escort. I just came in and made a fantastic website. I knew how to do the ads right.

01:45:55,202 --> 01:45:55,518
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:45:55,714 --> 01:45:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  What was the finding, people?

01:45:58,082 --> 01:46:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  I guess it's also like finding the right kind of customer.

01:46:01,154 --> 01:46:02,279
SPEAKER_0:  The right kind of client.

01:46:02,279 --> 01:46:09,790
SPEAKER_1:  I got in a lot of trouble for this recently in the sex workers fear because I said that if you raise prices, you're more likely to encounter clients that aren't going to abuse you.

01:46:10,626 --> 01:46:17,310
SPEAKER_1:  Like it's safer. Yeah. They said that I was being classist, implying that poor people are more violent.

01:46:17,922 --> 01:46:26,366
SPEAKER_1:  To be fair, if you're a guy and you wanna be violent towards a woman, you're probably not gonna be paying her a lot of money. You're probably gonna be like, you're the kind of person likely who's going to haggle a lot because you don't respect her.

01:46:27,170 --> 01:46:29,790
SPEAKER_1:  But anyway, that aside, it's a little pet peeve for me.

01:46:30,146 --> 01:46:30,558
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:46:30,786 --> 01:46:35,550
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I just started charging 800 an hour and then pretty rapidly raised it to 1200 and then

01:46:35,810 --> 01:46:37,685
SPEAKER_1:  a while after that, raise it to 1400.

01:46:37,685 --> 01:46:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  But the interesting thing you mentioned...

01:46:39,906 --> 01:46:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  in my extensive research.

01:46:41,634 --> 01:46:43,038
SPEAKER_0:  Um, you used to.

01:46:43,810 --> 01:46:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  the duty

01:46:44,610 --> 01:46:46,206
SPEAKER_0:  1200 to 1400 an hour.

01:46:46,722 --> 01:46:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  And then you said that you're thinking of jumping back in at a rate of

01:46:50,018 --> 01:46:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  2400.

01:46:51,778 --> 01:46:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  The first hour.

01:46:53,794 --> 01:46:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  and I think 900 each successive hour.

01:46:57,090 --> 01:46:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  That's interesting.

01:46:58,850 --> 01:47:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  That's like, that's, I mean, to me, that's really interesting. Like the fir- like why?

01:47:02,882 --> 01:47:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  It's.

01:47:03,522 --> 01:47:04,647
SPEAKER_0:  Like a lot of the first.

01:47:04,647 --> 01:47:05,438
SPEAKER_1:  A wee star, yeah.

01:47:05,922 --> 01:47:07,422
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, it's just because, uh...

01:47:07,682 --> 01:47:10,974
SPEAKER_1:  It depends on how you want to incentivize the amount of hours.

01:47:11,234 --> 01:47:15,582
SPEAKER_1:  So if you have to pay a lot for the first hour, but not very much for the successive, you're more likely to buy like a longer period of time.

01:47:16,226 --> 01:47:17,278
SPEAKER_1:  And usually I find that...

01:47:17,506 --> 01:47:19,966
SPEAKER_1:  clients who buy a longer period of time are nicer.

01:47:20,290 --> 01:47:20,734
SPEAKER_1:  to you.

01:47:21,346 --> 01:47:26,110
SPEAKER_1:  I don't have a great theory for why that is, but they're more likely to take you to dinner and get to know you first, and I just enjoy that a lot.

01:47:26,434 --> 01:47:27,102
SPEAKER_1:  I enjoy like

01:47:28,034 --> 01:47:30,174
SPEAKER_1:  like knowing who I'm gonna have sex with.

01:47:31,330 --> 01:47:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  Like a date, you know?

01:47:32,706 --> 01:47:37,310
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, so it incentivized the long form date dynamic versus like.

01:47:37,602 --> 01:47:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  Not

01:47:38,850 --> 01:47:39,774
SPEAKER_0:  That's really interesting.

01:47:40,738 --> 01:47:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  That's really interesting. How does money?

01:47:43,362 --> 01:47:44,862
SPEAKER_0:  change the dynamic.

01:47:45,186 --> 01:47:48,766
SPEAKER_0:  Just basic human dynamic of interacting for free versus for money.

01:47:49,218 --> 01:47:50,558
SPEAKER_0:  I think about that a lot, it's like...

01:47:50,978 --> 01:47:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  Just talking to rich people.

01:47:52,354 --> 01:47:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  Like you usually get paid for your time.

01:47:54,402 --> 01:47:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:47:54,978 --> 01:47:56,030
SPEAKER_0:  You're doing this for free.

01:47:56,866 --> 01:47:57,886
SPEAKER_0:  I would, uh...

01:47:59,362 --> 01:48:01,790
SPEAKER_0:  Like what's the difference? Is there a difference really? Or no?

01:48:02,306 --> 01:48:06,046
SPEAKER_1:  But yeah, I've actually, it depends a lot. So when I was doing it full time.

01:48:06,274 --> 01:48:07,678
SPEAKER_1:  It was my only source of income.

01:48:08,226 --> 01:48:12,094
SPEAKER_1:  It changed quite a lot because I was really incentivized to have repeat customers.

01:48:12,386 --> 01:48:14,046
SPEAKER_1:  So I'm like, okay, if I'm my.

01:48:14,338 --> 01:48:17,054
SPEAKER_1:  primary interaction with you is to have you hire me again.

01:48:17,378 --> 01:48:18,942
SPEAKER_1:  I'll do whatever that takes to make that happen.

01:48:19,362 --> 01:48:27,006
SPEAKER_1:  And so if I have to like laugh at jokes that I don't find funny or like, it's like more adoring of your penis than I actually genuinely feel, like that's what I'm going to express.

01:48:27,234 --> 01:48:33,918
SPEAKER_1:  And obviously it's to some degree like titrated, you know, like it's unpleasant to force yourself to like something that you don't. So like.

01:48:34,434 --> 01:48:42,750
SPEAKER_1:  I would actually not see clients again that I didn't want to. But to some degree, there was a sort of self-suppression going on, which I think is the way it works in any sort of customer service job.

01:48:43,138 --> 01:48:47,710
SPEAKER_1:  Like you want the customer to leave happy. So you just make sure that you are happy the whole time and you're like, ah.

01:48:48,002 --> 01:48:53,022
SPEAKER_1:  really enjoying the other person. So recently when I've like kind of dabbled in it since-

01:48:53,474 --> 01:48:54,302
SPEAKER_1:  baking money.

01:48:54,978 --> 01:49:08,894
SPEAKER_1:  through other means where I don't need the money. It's more like a fun side thing that like I said, it's fulfilling the role of casual sex for me. So like, I don't have to do it. This is not my primary job. I just want sort of a good excuse to like have sex with somebody.

01:49:09,282 --> 01:49:11,038
SPEAKER_1:  And the money is like a great filter for that.

01:49:11,554 --> 01:49:12,679
SPEAKER_1:  And so in that case...

01:49:12,679 --> 01:49:17,179
SPEAKER_0:  That's interesting. So the money is basically a filter for somebody who's taking this interaction.

01:49:17,179 --> 01:49:18,142
SPEAKER_1:  seriously. Yeah.

01:49:18,530 --> 01:49:29,214
SPEAKER_1:  It also, so there's an interesting psychological thing where I have difficulty having casual sex with somebody because some part of my brain, which I assume is quite female, is doing some evaluation of status and whether or not this is going to damage.

01:49:29,570 --> 01:49:31,358
SPEAKER_1:  my reputation by having sex with them.

01:49:31,682 --> 01:49:34,910
SPEAKER_1:  So like if you found out that I went and had random sex with a homeless man.

01:49:35,138 --> 01:49:40,478
SPEAKER_1:  You might be like, wow, that says something about Ayla. Like maybe she's trashy or she just has no standards for who she's going to fuck.

01:49:41,090 --> 01:49:44,222
SPEAKER_1:  But if, and so some part of me is continually anxious. I'm like.

01:49:44,546 --> 01:49:48,830
SPEAKER_1:  Does this mean I have no standards if I decide to have casual sex with you? Like what are people going to think?

01:49:49,154 --> 01:49:53,502
SPEAKER_1:  And so if you introduce money, it takes away that anxiety. I don't have to worry about it.

01:49:53,826 --> 01:50:02,174
SPEAKER_1:  Because it's like, oh, of course, Aila would have sex with that person, they paid her. Like, this is not an indication of the kind of mate that she can get. This is just an indication of like a business transaction.

01:50:02,530 --> 01:50:06,686
SPEAKER_1:  And this allows me to enjoy casual sex so much more when somebody pays me for it.

01:50:06,914 --> 01:50:09,022
SPEAKER_1:  to the degree that I almost view it as a kink?

01:50:09,634 --> 01:50:14,174
SPEAKER_1:  And so it's like, so I'm using it sort of to replace casual sex now, like occasionally, you know.

01:50:14,498 --> 01:50:17,118
SPEAKER_1:  Like it's paid me a little bit to erase the anxiety and all.

01:50:17,570 --> 01:50:18,695
SPEAKER_1:  Like have a fun, fun.

01:50:18,695 --> 01:50:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, can't you see like dinner like that or something like that if the person pays for dinner?

01:50:22,498 --> 01:50:23,102
SPEAKER_0:  or like.

01:50:23,586 --> 01:50:24,702
SPEAKER_0:  So like it's all.

01:50:24,994 --> 01:50:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  Just if any money's involved, if it's a kink, then you can just use it.

01:50:28,898 --> 01:50:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  Anyway.

01:50:30,530 --> 01:50:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  buys a coffee at a Starbucks, it's like, all right.

01:50:33,154 --> 01:50:38,238
SPEAKER_1:  Right, but it has to be plausible. Like you have to trick my brain into having it actually be incentivizing for me.

01:50:38,562 --> 01:50:44,862
SPEAKER_1:  Two coffees? Like a cappuccino or something? Yeah, like, oh, the homeless man bought me a coffee and then I sucked his dick. That's not cool.

01:50:45,218 --> 01:50:51,134
SPEAKER_1:  All right, so I. No shade of homelessness, by the way. I've been friends with a lot of them. I'm just using like some sort of stereotype of.

01:50:52,610 --> 01:50:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  So you like it has to be plausible where you could trick your mind. Interesting.

01:50:57,602 --> 01:50:57,950
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:50:58,946 --> 01:51:06,558
SPEAKER_1:  And so that's different. So now in this sort of frame, I am still, like I'm accepting money, but still much more expressive of my actual preferences.

01:51:07,138 --> 01:51:16,574
SPEAKER_1:  So like before when I would start escrowing full time, I was suppressive and now I'm like, you know, I'm doing this for me. So we're going to make sure that I have a good time. Okay.

01:51:16,802 --> 01:51:17,662
SPEAKER_1:  much more demanding.

01:51:18,370 --> 01:51:22,814
SPEAKER_0:  And then you're having more fun because you're not pretending, laughing at a joke or something like that. That sounds terrible.

01:51:23,490 --> 01:51:24,862
SPEAKER_0:  Sounds like

01:51:25,346 --> 01:51:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  It's also like social. I mean, I guess I would.

01:51:29,026 --> 01:51:29,726
SPEAKER_0:  I do that?

01:51:30,178 --> 01:51:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  Like when you first meet people, like strangers and so on.

01:51:32,802 --> 01:51:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  There's some aspect of like...

01:51:35,170 --> 01:51:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  Niceties, but like.

01:51:37,090 --> 01:51:40,734
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, intimacy, like real intimacy requires getting past the niceties.

01:51:41,410 --> 01:51:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  like laughing at somebody's joke when it's not funny.

01:51:43,842 --> 01:51:45,214
SPEAKER_0:  feels like anti-intimacy.

01:51:45,570 --> 01:51:58,014
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, but I laugh at so many jokes automatically. It's interesting, because I don't mean to, I'm not trying to be fake, but if I'm in a group of people and somebody makes a joke and everybody laughs, I laugh even before I'm checking within myself, do I genuinely enjoy this joke?

01:51:58,658 --> 01:52:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  So it's like, I don't know, the degree that I am sort of just like a result of social programming in all cases.

01:52:04,930 --> 01:52:10,846
SPEAKER_1:  that when I'm with a client back when I was doing it full time, it doesn't feel significantly different. It just felt like a different version of myself.

01:52:11,650 --> 01:52:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, sure.

01:52:12,386 --> 01:52:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, to that degree, to the degree you don't feel.

01:52:15,586 --> 01:52:17,022
SPEAKER_0:  like you're going against.

01:52:17,442 --> 01:52:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:52:18,530 --> 01:52:19,262
SPEAKER_1:  your nature.

01:52:19,778 --> 01:52:21,726
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it was very rare that I actually felt like I was.

01:52:22,306 --> 01:52:23,294
SPEAKER_1:  going against my nature.

01:52:23,586 --> 01:52:24,158
SPEAKER_0:  Um,

01:52:24,386 --> 01:52:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  What about the market of how much to charge?

01:52:27,394 --> 01:52:28,958
SPEAKER_0:  to 2400.

01:52:29,474 --> 01:52:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  Like how transparent is that market? Is there like a market?

01:52:32,642 --> 01:52:35,262
SPEAKER_1:  Like how much can you sell when you're charging that much?

01:52:35,458 --> 01:52:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, no, like what, what are the competitors? Like if this, like what do you, are you distinctly what, cause you said it's, it's a

01:52:41,794 --> 01:52:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of it is a bit more shrouded in mystery. I guess more confidential.

01:52:46,434 --> 01:52:49,809
SPEAKER_0:  Do you have some transparency to the market? What the competitors are?

01:52:49,809 --> 01:52:53,822
SPEAKER_1:  I'm trying to remember, and the median was around like,

01:52:54,178 --> 01:52:56,670
SPEAKER_1:  for $300, I think, an hour.

01:52:57,026 --> 01:52:57,374
SPEAKER_0:  Au revoir.

01:52:57,634 --> 01:52:59,806
SPEAKER_1:  Something like that with a very long tail at the top end.

01:53:00,322 --> 01:53:06,110
SPEAKER_1:  I'm trying to remember what the I also asked him the amount where I could calculate the amount they made per month I think it was like six or seven thousand dollars a month

01:53:06,338 --> 01:53:11,710
SPEAKER_1:  I need to double check that one, but. I charge 50 bucks an hour. You should raise your rates.

01:53:12,546 --> 01:53:14,302
SPEAKER_0:  I give a really shitty hand job.

01:53:15,138 --> 01:53:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:53:16,002 --> 01:53:21,627
SPEAKER_1:  But usually the rates are around like if you want a median escort in a big city, it's usually $4500 mark to go catch a go to masQue ABt

01:53:21,627 --> 01:53:24,627
SPEAKER_0:  So the herb, sorry, 4,600.

01:53:24,627 --> 01:53:28,318
SPEAKER_1:  in a big city, but smaller cities you charge the rates go lower.

01:53:29,410 --> 01:53:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:53:31,490 --> 01:53:32,862
SPEAKER_0:  That's so fascinating

01:53:33,474 --> 01:53:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  What's like the most you've ever seen somebody charge?

01:53:37,314 --> 01:53:37,694
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:53:38,818 --> 01:53:40,222
SPEAKER_1:  I think I am.

01:53:40,578 --> 01:53:41,694
SPEAKER_1:  You're like, uh...

01:53:42,786 --> 01:53:46,398
SPEAKER_1:  But at this point it's because I'm post work. Like, I don't I can

01:53:46,722 --> 01:53:47,847
SPEAKER_1:  I can just put it in and say.

01:53:47,847 --> 01:53:50,750
SPEAKER_0:  number. And like, does the fact that you're sort of.

01:53:52,482 --> 01:54:00,510
SPEAKER_0:  like a sexuality expert, like a researcher and so on, like your mind is fascinating as well, and you're a bit of a celebrity, does that play into it?

01:54:01,442 --> 01:54:01,886
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:54:02,466 --> 01:54:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  Or do you feel the celebrity now? Yeah.

01:54:05,378 --> 01:54:05,982
SPEAKER_1:  with people.

01:54:06,434 --> 01:54:07,166
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, absolutely.

01:54:07,554 --> 01:54:10,302
SPEAKER_1:  Usually if people are interested in hanging out with me, it's because of that.

01:54:11,394 --> 01:54:11,742
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:54:12,866 --> 01:54:15,102
SPEAKER_1:  But that's different. Like, I think-

01:54:15,394 --> 01:54:17,854
SPEAKER_1:  besides the fun part.

01:54:18,114 --> 01:54:23,102
SPEAKER_1:  this is a kink as opposed to this is a job. Like with this as a job, usually the high end is closer to 2000 an hour.

01:54:24,130 --> 01:54:25,022
SPEAKER_1:  like the very high end.

01:54:25,346 --> 01:54:26,814
SPEAKER_0:  Have clients ever fallen?

01:54:27,042 --> 01:54:27,902
SPEAKER_0:  in love with you.

01:54:29,122 --> 01:54:30,014
SPEAKER_1:  I think so, yeah.

01:54:30,402 --> 01:54:34,718
SPEAKER_1:  I think it happens to me much less than most other people due to the thing that I think we were talking about before.

01:54:35,042 --> 01:54:38,494
SPEAKER_1:  Which is what? Where like, you know, you give off vibes, maybe like subconscious vibes.

01:54:39,330 --> 01:54:40,734
SPEAKER_0:  they have fallen in love.

01:54:41,218 --> 01:54:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  or not, but not as often.

01:54:42,434 --> 01:54:47,870
SPEAKER_1:  I think something about my signaling indicates that people should not fall in love with me because I don't think it happens very much.

01:54:48,354 --> 01:54:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  It happens a lot with other women that I know.

01:54:50,658 --> 01:54:52,030
SPEAKER_1:  But I have occasionally had to-

01:54:52,610 --> 01:54:57,662
SPEAKER_1:  The thing is, it's hard for me because I try to be as vulnerable as I can in a connection with a client.

01:54:58,146 --> 01:55:04,158
SPEAKER_1:  And like I do really like some of them. I still remember some of them very fondly and I'm like I hope they're doing well.

01:55:04,610 --> 01:55:06,270
SPEAKER_1:  And some of them are really profound, like.

01:55:06,786 --> 01:55:12,734
SPEAKER_1:  One guy saw me because he found out he was dying of cancer. And he was like, I don't want to die without seeing someone.

01:55:13,122 --> 01:55:14,974
SPEAKER_1:  I'm like, Jesus Christ, that's such a...

01:55:15,970 --> 01:55:18,942
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know, I'm very touched by many of the people that I saw.

01:55:19,170 --> 01:55:20,830
SPEAKER_0:  So there's like deep intimacy there.

01:55:21,314 --> 01:55:25,886
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I know that it's brief and I know that it's like kind of weird but like there's

01:55:26,466 --> 01:55:35,454
SPEAKER_1:  There's like a real glimpse into somebody's soul when you get to be intimate. And I think this is especially true for men because a lot of time men don't have like a way to be really vulnerable in front of anybody.

01:55:35,714 --> 01:55:39,262
SPEAKER_1:  But like, if you're in bed with a woman that you find to be attractive, you can...

01:55:40,034 --> 01:55:41,159
SPEAKER_1:  sort of let loose a little bit.

01:55:41,159 --> 01:55:43,409
SPEAKER_0:  more so they can become vulnerable in general quickly.

01:55:43,409 --> 01:55:43,902
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:55:44,258 --> 01:55:50,686
SPEAKER_1:  And I really like that. I like being as vulnerable as I can to match it. Like I'm not forcing myself or anything, but like I just feel into it and like.

01:55:51,074 --> 01:55:55,550
SPEAKER_1:  notice how beautiful the person was and feel grateful for being able to.

01:55:55,810 --> 01:55:57,438
SPEAKER_1:  in this intimate experience with them.

01:55:58,114 --> 01:55:59,422
SPEAKER_1:  And that was so wonderful.

01:56:00,418 --> 01:56:01,886
SPEAKER_0:  Does it ever hurt to say goodbye?

01:56:02,818 --> 01:56:03,262
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:56:03,682 --> 01:56:04,382
SPEAKER_1:  No.

01:56:04,770 --> 01:56:06,526
SPEAKER_1:  But I think that's as unique to me.

01:56:06,786 --> 01:56:07,614
SPEAKER_1:  because...

01:56:08,098 --> 01:56:09,534
SPEAKER_1:  I like being alone a lot.

01:56:09,890 --> 01:56:11,806
SPEAKER_1:  even with my friends who are like dearly.

01:56:12,354 --> 01:56:13,566
SPEAKER_1:  I'm like happy not seeing them.

01:56:13,890 --> 01:56:14,238
SPEAKER_1:  Uh huh.

01:56:14,786 --> 01:56:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  because I don't like making facial expressions very much.

01:56:17,698 --> 01:56:19,573
SPEAKER_1:  But I do miss some of my clients.

01:56:19,573 --> 01:56:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  Wait, sorry. What is?

01:56:21,506 --> 01:56:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  Making facial expressions have to do with saying goodbye.

01:56:24,610 --> 01:56:28,702
SPEAKER_1:  Well, if you are not with somebody in person, then you don't have to make facial expressions anymore.

01:56:30,274 --> 01:56:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, you can just think about them.

01:56:32,226 --> 01:56:36,702
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, you can just sit there, totally blank face, and then have all of the emotions that you want.

01:56:37,122 --> 01:56:37,950
SPEAKER_1:  I got you telling me.

01:56:38,530 --> 01:56:39,486
SPEAKER_1:  Do you have this thing too?

01:56:39,714 --> 01:56:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  It's not a thing, but like...

01:56:41,986 --> 01:56:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  You're on camera.

01:56:43,362 --> 01:56:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  So like I feel feelings.

01:56:45,634 --> 01:56:46,878
SPEAKER_0:  but people usually want you.

01:56:47,490 --> 01:56:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  Thank you.

01:56:48,546 --> 01:56:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  social interaction is such that like you probably want me to show feelings on my face. Yeah.

01:56:54,242 --> 01:56:55,102
SPEAKER_1:  Like that, good job.

01:56:55,266 --> 01:56:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:56:56,034 --> 01:56:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  Hey, there you go.

01:56:57,346 --> 01:57:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  So like, I definitely, that could be just an introvert thing where you like haven't.

01:57:03,074 --> 01:57:04,830
SPEAKER_0:  vibrant inner world.

01:57:06,370 --> 01:57:10,558
SPEAKER_0:  you forget to show it to the rest of the world. I'm also scared of social interaction.

01:57:10,786 --> 01:57:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  I just have a lot of anxiety about interacting with the external world. So yeah.

01:57:15,010 --> 01:57:16,414
SPEAKER_1:  I'm kind of surprised to hear that because-

01:57:17,250 --> 01:57:20,126
SPEAKER_1:  When you talked about finding the light and everything and everything is fun.

01:57:20,770 --> 01:57:22,654
SPEAKER_1:  Like I usually don't associate that with having.

01:57:23,170 --> 01:57:24,126
SPEAKER_1:  not very much anxiety.

01:57:24,674 --> 01:57:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  Well...

01:57:25,666 --> 01:57:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  because I have the, we mentioned that earlier.

01:57:28,002 --> 01:57:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  I just appreciate the beauty in the world when I observe it, but then...

01:57:31,298 --> 01:57:33,214
SPEAKER_0:  When I'm interacting with others...

01:57:33,858 --> 01:57:37,470
SPEAKER_0:  I have a very harsh self-critical aspect of my brain that says like

01:57:38,306 --> 01:57:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  You're gonna fuck this up.

01:57:40,130 --> 01:57:41,662
SPEAKER_0:  You're gonna fuck up this interaction.

01:57:42,146 --> 01:57:42,910
SPEAKER_0:  You're gonna fuck up.

01:57:43,234 --> 01:57:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  the beauty that's there.

01:57:44,834 --> 01:57:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  If I'm sort of being...

01:57:46,882 --> 01:57:49,246
SPEAKER_0:  fragile and vulnerable for a moment.

01:57:49,474 --> 01:57:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  One of the things I'm afraid of, I get so much love from-

01:57:52,450 --> 01:57:53,214
SPEAKER_0:  from people that.

01:57:53,730 --> 01:57:57,374
SPEAKER_0:  Listen, or even reach out, like you said through the survey, like women and so on.

01:57:58,530 --> 01:57:59,038
SPEAKER_0:  I'm off.

01:57:59,298 --> 01:58:01,662
SPEAKER_0:  afraid that, yeah, you know, you admire me.

01:58:01,890 --> 01:58:02,878
SPEAKER_0:  Because you don't know me.

01:58:03,266 --> 01:58:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  but you won't admire me once you admire me. So that's self-critical. But it's a silly, I mean, as you get older, you're like, yeah, okay.

01:58:10,178 --> 01:58:14,398
SPEAKER_0:  Like I'm able to step away and objectively look at myself like there's no

01:58:14,850 --> 01:58:16,126
SPEAKER_0:  This is, you're fine, you're good.

01:58:16,642 --> 01:58:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  It's like...

01:58:17,474 --> 01:58:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  But it's still the part of the brain you can't just shut off.

01:58:21,922 --> 01:58:24,894
SPEAKER_1:  Does it, is, like what would fucking up in this conversation look like?

01:58:26,754 --> 01:58:28,062
SPEAKER_1:  Like, doesn't have to be rational.

01:58:29,026 --> 01:58:30,718
SPEAKER_1:  I'm curious if there's a specific thing.

01:58:36,130 --> 01:58:37,310
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of it is just a...

01:58:37,954 --> 01:58:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  Feeling like an amorphous fear?

01:58:41,058 --> 01:58:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  A failure?

01:58:42,882 --> 01:58:44,318
SPEAKER_0:  what it would actually look like.

01:58:49,954 --> 01:58:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  maybe because we're talking about sexuality.

01:58:53,218 --> 01:58:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  me not being able to eloquently explain.

01:58:56,610 --> 01:58:57,758
SPEAKER_0:  the world view I have.

01:58:58,242 --> 01:58:59,646
SPEAKER_0:  And why I appreciate.

01:59:00,450 --> 01:59:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  Appreciate it.

01:59:03,458 --> 01:59:06,078
SPEAKER_0:  That would make me feel like a failure because that would make me feel like...

01:59:06,338 --> 01:59:06,974
SPEAKER_0:  Me vieron.

01:59:07,234 --> 01:59:08,542
SPEAKER_0:  know what you're doing, right?

01:59:08,962 --> 01:59:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  Because sex, sexuality, not sexuality, even romantic relationships are really important.

01:59:13,730 --> 01:59:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  happiness to, they're really important to me.

01:59:16,290 --> 01:59:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm not sure like the conception of love I have.

01:59:19,426 --> 01:59:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  Romantic love.

01:59:20,994 --> 01:59:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  is like fully...

01:59:23,842 --> 01:59:24,702
SPEAKER_0:  made rigorous.

01:59:25,026 --> 01:59:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  Especially when I'm talking to you with that thinks very rigorously by a lot of these topics. I'm not sure

01:59:30,146 --> 01:59:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  at

01:59:31,266 --> 01:59:32,286
SPEAKER_0:  about them a lot.

01:59:32,642 --> 01:59:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  I feel them.

01:59:34,018 --> 01:59:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  I interact with the world in this space of feelings.

01:59:36,930 --> 01:59:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe I'm almost afraid to be very rigorous to these kinds of...

01:59:40,738 --> 01:59:41,918
SPEAKER_0:  thoughts.

01:59:42,306 --> 01:59:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  And so...

01:59:43,266 --> 01:59:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  I think

01:59:45,058 --> 01:59:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  the failure would be like I would be confronted with the fact that I can't explain.

01:59:50,114 --> 01:59:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  What makes me happy? That could be a failure.

01:59:52,610 --> 01:59:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  And there could be just a bunch of other failures. Another big failure is like-

01:59:57,058 --> 01:59:57,438
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

01:59:57,858 --> 01:59:59,934
SPEAKER_0:  not I think you're a really brilliant person.

02:00:00,738 --> 02:00:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  And a lot of folks I know.

02:00:03,234 --> 02:00:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  know and admire your work as well.

02:00:06,114 --> 02:00:07,646
SPEAKER_0:  And so like for me not to...

02:00:08,418 --> 02:00:11,198
SPEAKER_0:  be part of highlighting that brilliance would be a failure.

02:00:12,066 --> 02:00:13,310
SPEAKER_1:  like because then other people might.

02:00:13,986 --> 02:00:16,638
SPEAKER_1:  feel like notice the discrepancy.

02:00:16,962 --> 02:00:18,087
SPEAKER_1:  or something?

02:00:18,087 --> 02:00:27,806
SPEAKER_0:  No, no, no, that's not other people, just my personal, my personal feeling. And the other is like jokes, because like we're talking about sex, right? So for me, like it's fun to just.

02:00:28,226 --> 02:00:31,422
SPEAKER_0:  joke around but you also have to tread carefully because like

02:00:32,482 --> 02:00:40,862
SPEAKER_0:  It's a weird, it's a weird surface because like, you know, even I already feel bad about making a joke for 50 bucks for a hand job that's crappy by me.

02:00:41,154 --> 02:00:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:00:42,242 --> 02:00:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

02:00:44,642 --> 02:00:51,358
SPEAKER_0:  I think sometimes you just got to go for it. I went for it. It kind of fell flat on his face.

02:00:52,194 --> 02:00:54,819
SPEAKER_0:  uh... that's that's the thing of the conversation

02:00:54,819 --> 02:01:03,518
SPEAKER_1:  I think there's like this fear where it's like, if you become like scientific about something, you'll figure out that your feelings are unjustified and then you'll experience this horrible thing where like, ah, shit, like.

02:01:03,746 --> 02:01:08,286
SPEAKER_1:  I'm like afraid of this, but I'm sort of being forced to by my logical mind to like believe this thing.

02:01:08,770 --> 02:01:11,198
SPEAKER_1:  Which I don't think this is true at all.

02:01:11,426 --> 02:01:11,870
SPEAKER_1:  I think.

02:01:12,098 --> 02:01:15,262
SPEAKER_1:  Like, your feelings are there for a reason. Like, they're for a good reason.

02:01:15,682 --> 02:01:20,990
SPEAKER_1:  And like logic or like rigorous analysis or something that should be dedicated to figuring out why it's there.

02:01:21,506 --> 02:01:25,566
SPEAKER_1:  not to like suppress it or tell it it shouldn't be there, you know?

02:01:25,730 --> 02:01:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  What do you think is more important to like?

02:01:28,770 --> 02:01:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  to just life.

02:01:30,818 --> 02:01:32,126
SPEAKER_0:  is reason versus.

02:01:32,578 --> 02:01:33,214
SPEAKER_0:  emotion.

02:01:33,858 --> 02:01:34,238
SPEAKER_0:  like.

02:01:34,530 --> 02:01:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  not life, to what makes us human.

02:01:36,962 --> 02:01:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  I guess.

02:01:38,370 --> 02:01:38,686
SPEAKER_1:  My

02:01:38,978 --> 02:01:43,006
SPEAKER_1:  my romantic narrative answered to this, which is like not rigorous at all is curiosity.

02:01:43,810 --> 02:01:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  curiosity.

02:01:45,826 --> 02:01:47,038
SPEAKER_0:  with its curiosity.

02:01:48,098 --> 02:01:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  That's such a middle-

02:01:50,114 --> 02:01:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  Curiosity is like both emotion and reason, right? Yeah.

02:01:52,994 --> 02:01:53,982
SPEAKER_0:  So it's like this pool.

02:01:54,690 --> 02:01:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  Because reason is the tool you use.

02:01:57,282 --> 02:01:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  to figure out the puzzle.

02:01:59,074 --> 02:02:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  And then curiosity is the pull towards the puzzle.

02:02:02,370 --> 02:02:07,646
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I don't like world views that pit like emotion and rationalities opposite each other.

02:02:07,874 --> 02:02:08,382
SPEAKER_1:  They feel like.

02:02:08,642 --> 02:02:10,334
SPEAKER_1:  beautiful parts of like a cohesive whole.

02:02:10,626 --> 02:02:16,734
SPEAKER_1:  Like if you're doing rationality to the extent where you're like suppressing some emotional reactions you have, then I think you're doing it wrong. You feel like you're missing.

02:02:17,218 --> 02:02:18,782
SPEAKER_1:  a big part of it. It's probably a middle easternish side to it.

02:02:19,138 --> 02:02:25,182
SPEAKER_1:  integrated, it should be like part of like one unified flow. Like the things that you like if you wanna be in a romantic committed relationship for the rest of your life.

02:02:25,442 --> 02:02:31,998
SPEAKER_1:  and this is beautiful and good, and the kind of logic that you're using to make sense of the world should be fitted into that correctly.

02:02:32,386 --> 02:02:33,374
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's really cool.

02:02:33,730 --> 02:02:42,270
SPEAKER_1:  Like anytime you have sort of like an internal at odds thing with it, I think you're like using some sort of force to suppress one or the other. Like I'm not allowed to reason about this or I'm not allowed to feel about that.

02:02:42,754 --> 02:02:43,710
SPEAKER_1:  and that feels harsh to me.

02:02:44,066 --> 02:02:45,630
SPEAKER_1:  And I think curiosity is the solution.

02:02:46,050 --> 02:02:47,486
SPEAKER_1:  Like if you're simply just.

02:02:48,226 --> 02:02:50,142
SPEAKER_1:  I'm calmly curious, why do I feel like that?

02:02:50,562 --> 02:02:52,606
SPEAKER_1:  Let's go find out, that's so cool!

02:02:53,090 --> 02:02:56,702
SPEAKER_1:  Right, like you can use logic and your feelings to like discover the answer.

02:02:57,570 --> 02:03:02,014
SPEAKER_0:  Do you sometimes, because you do this kind of technique, which is interesting, and I've mentioned it to others.

02:03:02,498 --> 02:03:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  You'll sometimes step away from a third person perspective and describe the feeling you're feeling.

02:03:08,514 --> 02:03:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  Or like even just the situation like you'll step out.

02:03:11,778 --> 02:03:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  and stay tuned for more.

02:03:12,418 --> 02:03:14,270
SPEAKER_0:  talk about what is happening here.

02:03:14,946 --> 02:03:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  Like in the conversation itself. In the conversation itself. I hope we can find him.

02:03:17,794 --> 02:03:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

02:03:18,882 --> 02:03:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  First of all, what is that? Was that, do you find that to be useful? Because it's very interesting.

02:03:23,842 --> 02:03:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  It feels raw and honest.

02:03:26,178 --> 02:03:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  The danger of it seems like you escape.

02:03:29,346 --> 02:03:30,942
SPEAKER_0:  the actual experience of it though.

02:03:31,714 --> 02:03:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  So that's the trade off.

02:03:33,346 --> 02:03:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  You make it intellectual, right?

02:03:35,682 --> 02:03:36,030
SPEAKER_0:  But...

02:03:37,122 --> 02:03:37,790
SPEAKER_1:  intellectual?

02:03:38,018 --> 02:03:38,526
SPEAKER_1:  to do that.

02:03:40,002 --> 02:03:41,214
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, maybe it is, I don't mean to...

02:03:43,298 --> 02:03:44,254
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe that's the wrong word.

02:03:44,962 --> 02:03:51,134
SPEAKER_0:  You can make it intellectual, but you can still continue the same flavor because you're not fully disengaging from the conversation.

02:03:52,002 --> 02:03:56,103
SPEAKER_0:  you're just creating an extra metal layer. Yeah...

02:03:56,103 --> 02:03:59,006
SPEAKER_1:  exploring the emotional reaction to what's going on in the moment.

02:03:59,234 --> 02:03:59,550
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

02:03:59,906 --> 02:04:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, in some way it's actually making it stronger

02:04:02,786 --> 02:04:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  Like.

02:04:03,682 --> 02:04:05,150
SPEAKER_0:  or enriching it.

02:04:05,474 --> 02:04:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  like making it more.

02:04:07,522 --> 02:04:08,190
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah

02:04:08,834 --> 02:04:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  giving a more context, giving a deeper understanding.

02:04:11,234 --> 02:04:16,734
SPEAKER_1:  I think there's like a way of going meta that is a flinch move. Like, oh, I noticed that we're doing this thing. I'm going to name it.

02:04:16,994 --> 02:04:22,814
SPEAKER_1:  And I think the thing that I described earlier, like when the homeless guy approached me and asked, you know, can you go home with me? And I was like,

02:04:23,106 --> 02:04:32,350
SPEAKER_1:  or are you trying to have sex with me right now? Like what I was doing was like a meta-move, like you're stepping outside, like, and like, okay, what is the purpose of this conversation? And we explicitly identify it. And in that case, I think that is sort of like a flinch move.

02:04:33,410 --> 02:04:34,078
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not-

02:04:34,434 --> 02:04:37,630
SPEAKER_1:  I'm telling him my emotional response. I'm not like being fully present. I'm like.

02:04:37,890 --> 02:04:40,830
SPEAKER_1:  sort of identifying it as a way to subvert what's going on.

02:04:41,154 --> 02:04:42,974
SPEAKER_1:  And I absolutely think this is a possible thing.

02:04:43,522 --> 02:04:47,998
SPEAKER_1:  I usually try to be aware of that myself, and it depends on the purpose of what's going on. That guy.

02:04:48,194 --> 02:04:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  Cause that is actually like a chess move you did.

02:04:50,786 --> 02:04:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  you had a purpose in the chest move

02:04:52,450 --> 02:04:53,726
SPEAKER_0:  But the flirtation is on.

02:04:54,530 --> 02:04:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  Like he could've.

02:04:56,418 --> 02:04:57,342
SPEAKER_0:  Like, uh...

02:04:57,634 --> 02:04:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  done a better move.

02:04:59,298 --> 02:05:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  that would make you curious. Yeah, that's true.

02:05:02,530 --> 02:05:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  Like interesting, because you had an agenda with that.

02:05:05,794 --> 02:05:07,614
SPEAKER_0:  but he could have changed your mind.

02:05:08,322 --> 02:05:13,959
SPEAKER_0:  Like he could have, with a few words, because you just created extra layers, extra entry points.

02:05:13,959 --> 02:05:18,459
SPEAKER_1:  If he had gotten more meta, he might have been like, okay, well, now I am going to sleep with you.

02:05:18,459 --> 02:05:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  Exactly.

02:05:20,546 --> 02:05:22,398
SPEAKER_0:  See there is something, yeah.

02:05:22,690 --> 02:05:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  that aids into the chemistry of the conversation when you do that. I really enjoy it. It's like a rare, I forget, did you and I, I forget who.

02:05:30,466 --> 02:05:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  I've had a few people do that with me, like just in conversation.

02:05:34,914 --> 02:05:37,662
SPEAKER_0:  And I feel like you were involved somehow, because I've met you before.

02:05:38,370 --> 02:05:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, somewhere.

02:05:39,842 --> 02:05:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know if we were.

02:05:41,250 --> 02:05:43,125
SPEAKER_1:  We had a couple parties together.

02:05:43,125 --> 02:05:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe it was just like a bunch of people that kind of

02:05:46,274 --> 02:05:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  play with the same.

02:05:47,266 --> 02:05:48,606
SPEAKER_1:  or like a... The Circling聲 Zύ Esgrízz

02:05:49,218 --> 02:05:56,917
SPEAKER_1:  It's just a practice explicitly dedicated towards that. What, circling? Circling is like this. That might be the thing they explain. Yeah, I think we know we have some mutual circlers in our circle.

02:05:56,917 --> 02:05:57,342
SPEAKER_0:  Of course.

02:05:57,570 --> 02:06:00,945
SPEAKER_0:  our networks here. What's what's circling? I don't remember.

02:06:00,945 --> 02:06:08,382
SPEAKER_1:  I'm going to describe it horribly because it's like one of those things that's difficult to describe unless you experience it, kind of like drugs. It's something like you sit around there's like

02:06:08,834 --> 02:06:16,542
SPEAKER_1:  of guidelines to the conversation where you talk about the present moment. Yeah. You're like honest about your experiences as much as you can be. And if you don't want to be honest, then you say, I don't want to be honest.

02:06:17,026 --> 02:06:22,686
SPEAKER_1:  and your commitment to connection. So you're here to actually connect with the other person, understand them and be understood.

02:06:23,362 --> 02:06:31,518
SPEAKER_1:  You're not supposed to project. So if you have an analysis about the other person, you own it. Like, I'm experiencing you as this, and then you check, is it true?

02:06:32,194 --> 02:06:32,542
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:06:32,802 --> 02:06:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  Or like... Are you supposed to be almost like converting it towards the thing you're thinking?

02:06:37,794 --> 02:06:38,494
SPEAKER_0:  Like constantly.

02:06:39,042 --> 02:06:48,926
SPEAKER_1:  If it feels right in the moment, you can. The thing is it's very amorphous, right? It's almost like creating a magical sensation. And I've been with some, I've seen some very good circulars, really high skill circle.

02:06:49,282 --> 02:06:52,126
SPEAKER_1:  And I feel like I'm on drugs when that happens. It's very rare to see.

02:06:53,218 --> 02:06:55,742
SPEAKER_1:  Does it feel honest somehow? Yeah, very honest.

02:06:57,154 --> 02:06:59,134
SPEAKER_1:  Like, right now in this moment, I'm feeling like...

02:06:59,618 --> 02:07:00,318
SPEAKER_1:  Kind of.

02:07:00,610 --> 02:07:03,326
SPEAKER_1:  nervous energy because I'm talking to you and this is a unique

02:07:03,618 --> 02:07:21,150
SPEAKER_1:  situation and like, I want you to think I'm cool. I want everybody listening to me to think I'm cool. But I'm also having some sort of delight at being able to express in this way. And like some admiration for how you like set up and built this thing that I can be a part of. And all of these things are sort of in my body right now as this sort of vibrating high thing.

02:07:21,698 --> 02:07:26,782
SPEAKER_0:  I remember like in the party setting, because I had to talk to a few people, I felt like it was going sexual very quickly.

02:07:27,650 --> 02:07:35,742
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, I don't know if you remember this, but the first time I met you, I didn't know who you were. I just heard, I knew I'd heard your name, like you'd heard your name, and I was like, I think I've heard people discuss that.

02:07:36,066 --> 02:07:43,647
SPEAKER_1:  And I was in the middle of a very sexual conversation with another woman. Oh, you were? Yeah, I was. And you just like turned around and left very shortly afterwards, and I thought it was very- Oh, was that-

02:07:43,647 --> 02:07:44,397
SPEAKER_0:  listening in on the

02:07:44,397 --> 02:07:52,647
SPEAKER_1:  conversation or something like that. It was like I was talking to her and you were just kind of like right there and so we introduced ourselves and then we continued on with the conversation. We were like standing there and listening.

02:07:52,647 --> 02:07:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think I would have left the cut. So it's funny. He probably interpreted it in a different way.

02:07:57,314 --> 02:08:05,950
SPEAKER_1:  I interpret it as you not wanting to listen to graphic sexual stuff. Was it like super graphic? I don't know. I was asking her about, I was interviewing her about her fetish.

02:08:06,050 --> 02:08:08,766
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, yeah, I don't think I would have walked away from that.

02:08:09,058 --> 02:08:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  I would have been like curious, oh interesting, because I don't often see people having a

02:08:12,834 --> 02:08:15,582
SPEAKER_0:  I deeply interview about fetishes. Like I wouldn't even be.

02:08:15,842 --> 02:08:20,094
SPEAKER_0:  Listen, I'm like Jane Goodall here. I'm not like a-

02:08:20,546 --> 02:08:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not afraid of sexuality or something like that. I just have certain values in terms of like...

02:08:24,898 --> 02:08:28,286
SPEAKER_0:  monogamy and so on but I think sexuality is really beautiful, yeah.

02:08:29,250 --> 02:08:30,590
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think.

02:08:31,682 --> 02:08:34,307
SPEAKER_0:  yeah i can't imagine myself walking with my car says

02:08:34,307 --> 02:08:38,807
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know how many of us have called you or something. I didn't remember exactly how it worked. I just remember thinking later on.

02:08:38,807 --> 02:08:39,902
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe I thought I was intruding.

02:08:40,354 --> 02:08:40,894
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, maybe.

02:08:41,506 --> 02:08:43,038
SPEAKER_1:  I was kind of drunk.

02:08:43,298 --> 02:08:45,063
SPEAKER_1:  So. And that probably was very. i'm, i'm a mega repeatiddle boi

02:08:45,063 --> 02:08:45,918
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

02:08:46,498 --> 02:08:52,414
SPEAKER_0:  I would like to actually have like footage of that conversation so we can actually interpret what actually happened because it's probably

02:08:52,738 --> 02:08:55,678
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, you know, human interactions are.

02:08:55,906 --> 02:08:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  or a funny like that they can...

02:08:57,442 --> 02:08:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  Mm-hmm.

02:08:58,050 --> 02:09:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  It can happen for all kinds of reasons. Have you ever fallen in love with a client?

02:09:02,690 --> 02:09:06,078
SPEAKER_1:  No. I mean like in tiny ways, like micro loves.

02:09:06,946 --> 02:09:09,054
SPEAKER_0:  Have you ever fallen in love, love?

02:09:09,858 --> 02:09:15,262
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I don't know what it means, but probably. The thing that other people say when they say fall in love is probably something I've experienced.

02:09:16,226 --> 02:09:17,118
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think they mean?

02:09:17,858 --> 02:09:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:09:19,138 --> 02:09:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  What is love?

02:09:20,578 --> 02:09:21,374
SPEAKER_1:  Hila. I know.

02:09:21,602 --> 02:09:28,830
SPEAKER_1:  No. It's a fantastic question. I think so love is one of those words that refers to like a billion different concepts. And I think we maybe should just taboo the term.

02:09:29,314 --> 02:09:32,990
SPEAKER_1:  to have a better understanding of what we're referring to. Because there's things like a feeling of intense attachment.

02:09:33,282 --> 02:09:37,438
SPEAKER_1:  There's something feeling like soulfully aligned. There's like sexual attraction. There's like excitement. e

02:09:37,602 --> 02:09:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  talking to me and saying we should taboo the term love.

02:09:41,058 --> 02:09:43,966
SPEAKER_0:  In this conversation, how dare you.

02:09:44,322 --> 02:09:48,446
SPEAKER_0:  No. Uh, yeah. Well, it's okay. Yeah.

02:09:48,802 --> 02:09:49,927
SPEAKER_0:  Romantic love.

02:09:49,927 --> 02:09:52,927
SPEAKER_1:  To make it flourish into lots of other new definitions.

02:09:52,927 --> 02:09:54,878
SPEAKER_0:  Thank you. you

02:09:55,266 --> 02:09:58,238
SPEAKER_0:  It sounds like you're censoring the most important word.

02:09:58,498 --> 02:10:01,790
SPEAKER_0:  This is like 1984 all over again. Hahaha

02:10:02,146 --> 02:10:10,878
SPEAKER_0:  Also on the book reading list. Oh, okay. Listen, no, romantic love, like a deep intimacy for somebody else, like a deep connection with a human being.

02:10:11,490 --> 02:10:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  that is also.

02:10:13,506 --> 02:10:15,518
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, with polyamory it's tricky.

02:10:16,002 --> 02:10:19,326
SPEAKER_0:  and your relationship with sex is also, is also tricky.

02:10:19,842 --> 02:10:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  So like, what's the difference between a deep friendship?

02:10:22,658 --> 02:10:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  And that.

02:10:23,810 --> 02:10:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  and I-

02:10:24,642 --> 02:10:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  a friendship that also has a sexual component.

02:10:27,298 --> 02:10:29,694
SPEAKER_1:  I remember being very confused about that when I did a lot of LSD.

02:10:29,986 --> 02:10:30,782
SPEAKER_1:  I was like, what?

02:10:31,042 --> 02:10:32,030
SPEAKER_1:  I- uh, the- the-

02:10:32,354 --> 02:10:37,214
SPEAKER_1:  The line between romantic relationships and everything else kind of got blurred. I was like, oh, I'm just like in intimacy.

02:10:37,506 --> 02:10:41,342
SPEAKER_1:  And some intimacies mean that you spend your life together more and have sex, but like …

02:10:42,178 --> 02:10:46,910
SPEAKER_1:  The same basic thing is there, like you're seeing someone for who they are.

02:10:47,682 --> 02:10:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  Do you think you can be, if you're heterosexual, do you think you could be really deeply close with friends with a guy?

02:10:53,826 --> 02:10:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  and not have sexual relationships.

02:10:55,586 --> 02:10:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  Boy.

02:10:56,418 --> 02:10:57,726
SPEAKER_1:  I assume it's possible.

02:10:58,178 --> 02:11:00,894
SPEAKER_1:  Like if anything is ever possible, then probably, yeah.

02:11:01,634 --> 02:11:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  Like everything is possible. Time travel is possible. Quantum mechanics makes every-

02:11:06,658 --> 02:11:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  traveling faster than the speed of light as possible.

02:11:08,994 --> 02:11:14,302
SPEAKER_0:  according to general relativity, everything's possible. So you're saying there's a chance. The diameter the diameter

02:11:14,690 --> 02:11:16,565
SPEAKER_0:  taught me that everything is fucking-

02:11:16,565 --> 02:11:20,382
SPEAKER_1:  Not super likely assuming that they are like attracted to each other

02:11:22,338 --> 02:11:25,214
SPEAKER_0:  And for some of the surveys and statistical analysis...

02:11:26,978 --> 02:11:31,075
SPEAKER_0:  We're interested in like, what's the likely thing here? This is like, what's possible?

02:11:31,075 --> 02:11:33,022
SPEAKER_1:  If you save hospitals, anything's open.

02:11:33,442 --> 02:11:35,317
SPEAKER_0:  Did you just avoid answering the love thing?

02:11:35,317 --> 02:11:38,317
SPEAKER_1:  I have a lot to say about love, I just need to be precise.

02:11:38,317 --> 02:11:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, okay, let's be...

02:11:40,322 --> 02:11:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  precisely and precisely continue.

02:11:42,274 --> 02:11:42,910
SPEAKER_0:  So that's my phone.

02:11:44,706 --> 02:11:45,630
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:11:47,938 --> 02:11:52,063
SPEAKER_0:  It feels like a passive aggressive suggestion that we shouldn't talk about love anymore, but we shall

02:11:52,063 --> 02:11:55,742
SPEAKER_1:  No, we should absolutely talk about love. It's just the term is very confusing.

02:11:56,034 --> 02:11:59,390
SPEAKER_1:  Because it's like, some people say the word love, and the thing that they're thinking of is like,

02:11:59,778 --> 02:12:10,686
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, the butterfly is like the sparkle thing that I get in my stomach when I think about my loved one. But I study relationships over time. I just really, like I did a survey about it and that sparkle goes away within like two to four years.

02:12:11,074 --> 02:12:16,350
SPEAKER_1:  But people still report loving their partner after that. So I'm like, okay, like when you say the word love, what the fuck are we talking about?

02:12:17,634 --> 02:12:19,038
SPEAKER_1:  I just want to get on the same page. OK.

02:12:19,426 --> 02:12:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  So what are the different, so the butterflies.

02:12:22,754 --> 02:12:23,262
SPEAKER_0:  Boy.

02:12:23,490 --> 02:12:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  I'd like to push back on two to four years on the butterflies, but okay. I mean, statistically.

02:12:27,778 --> 02:12:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  Not everybody.

02:12:29,570 --> 02:12:33,214
SPEAKER_0:  I butterflies don't give a fuck about statistics you ever heard of the mic

02:12:33,538 --> 02:12:36,222
SPEAKER_0:  but the flap of a butterfly wing causing like.

02:12:36,610 --> 02:12:37,630
SPEAKER_0:  Nuclear war.

02:12:38,562 --> 02:12:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  How do you describe that with your statistics?

02:12:41,538 --> 02:12:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, okay.

02:12:43,330 --> 02:12:48,510
SPEAKER_0:  So butterflies, that's the basic infatuation, the chemistry of the initial interactions.

02:12:49,026 --> 02:12:51,614
SPEAKER_0:  Sure, but a deep meaningful connection like.

02:12:53,410 --> 02:12:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  that feels...

02:12:55,458 --> 02:12:57,598
SPEAKER_0:  Like sexuality is a component of that.

02:12:58,146 --> 02:12:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  like.

02:12:59,042 --> 02:13:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  the kind of intimacy that's only possible when you're also sexual with another human being.

02:13:03,490 --> 02:13:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  On top of that you have the butterfly, and on top of that you have the friendship, and on top of that you have like...

02:13:08,866 --> 02:13:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  What is that?

02:13:09,730 --> 02:13:11,975
SPEAKER_0:  That's a sandwich. That's a love sandwich.

02:13:11,975 --> 02:13:14,334
SPEAKER_1:  The love sandwich. Okay, I'm down to call it a love sandwich. Okay.

02:13:14,818 --> 02:13:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  which is called sandwich.

02:13:16,802 --> 02:13:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  L.S.

02:13:17,730 --> 02:13:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

02:13:18,690 --> 02:13:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  What world is-

02:13:20,002 --> 02:13:22,014
SPEAKER_0:  that play in the human condition.

02:13:23,554 --> 02:13:26,302
SPEAKER_1:  He's asking about the human condition. This is an interesting phrase.

02:13:27,490 --> 02:13:30,334
SPEAKER_1:  I'm like, this is not a phrase that's common in my own thinking.

02:13:31,266 --> 02:13:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  Sure. Human condition is a good-

02:13:33,922 --> 02:13:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  summary, what do you think?

02:13:37,314 --> 02:13:39,189
SPEAKER_0:  What do you feel when you, when I,

02:13:39,189 --> 02:13:41,086
SPEAKER_1:  I ask very different kinds of questions than you.

02:13:41,858 --> 02:13:42,334
SPEAKER_1:  Sure.

02:13:42,594 --> 02:13:46,654
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. Which is interesting. I've been trying to figure out what kind of brain you have is like-

02:13:46,914 --> 02:13:53,118
SPEAKER_1:  creating like this category of question, which is why I was like saying like, there's something about poetic narrative in there. Because it's very like.

02:13:54,594 --> 02:13:57,406
SPEAKER_1:  I think you've asked much more aesthetic questions than I do.

02:13:57,890 --> 02:14:00,830
SPEAKER_0:  I don't even know what the word aesthetic means really. Like, artistic.

02:14:01,186 --> 02:14:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  Artistic. Yeah. You know what aesthetic means.

02:14:03,874 --> 02:14:07,006
SPEAKER_0:  means but I also don't know what it means it's kind of like the word love.

02:14:07,906 --> 02:14:09,502
SPEAKER_0:  aesthetic perspective.

02:14:09,730 --> 02:14:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, well, but part of it in conversation, you don't want to ask a question that has an answer.

02:14:15,714 --> 02:14:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  Fully always.

02:14:17,538 --> 02:14:18,663
SPEAKER_1:  Do you have an example of a-

02:14:18,663 --> 02:14:20,446
SPEAKER_0:  What's the meaning of O?

02:14:21,154 --> 02:14:24,926
SPEAKER_1:  It has an answer. Yeah, like one that you'd say was like, wow, that's like a bad question because it has an answer.

02:14:25,410 --> 02:14:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  how many sexual partners you had in the last year.

02:14:29,666 --> 02:14:30,462
SPEAKER_1:  That's such a c-

02:14:30,818 --> 02:14:34,974
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, I feel like we just got to some sort of crux about the kinds of questions that we like to answer.

02:14:35,298 --> 02:14:36,126
SPEAKER_1:  Sure.

02:14:36,514 --> 02:14:39,139
SPEAKER_1:  Because I would love that question. Okay, right. I would love people.

02:14:39,139 --> 02:14:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  All right, but that's does that really tell the story?

02:14:42,178 --> 02:14:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

02:14:43,362 --> 02:14:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  of what you've felt over the past year.

02:14:46,530 --> 02:14:53,406
SPEAKER_1:  That's true, but then I could just tell you. Okay, so by when you're saying the kinds of questions that you like, the ones that don't have an answer, by not an answer, you mean like.

02:14:53,730 --> 02:14:55,006
SPEAKER_1:  not an answer where...

02:14:55,842 --> 02:14:57,214
SPEAKER_1:  you can know that you're done.

02:14:57,442 --> 02:14:57,854
SPEAKER_1:  telling it.

02:14:58,434 --> 02:14:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  That you can escape?

02:14:59,970 --> 02:15:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  having to think by actually answering it.

02:15:02,850 --> 02:15:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  I see.

02:15:04,386 --> 02:15:04,702
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

02:15:05,602 --> 02:15:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  the struggle.

02:15:07,298 --> 02:15:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  is the place where we discover something, not the...

02:15:11,618 --> 02:15:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  Not the destination.

02:15:13,730 --> 02:15:19,355
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, it's working. It's working. Okay. So what is the role of the love sandwich in human condition?

02:15:19,355 --> 02:15:23,105
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, that's fine. I take that question, but it's a stupid question. You don't have to. It's-

02:15:23,105 --> 02:15:23,855
SPEAKER_1:  I'm ready to...

02:15:23,855 --> 02:15:26,503
SPEAKER_0:  Do you like love?

02:15:26,503 --> 02:15:27,390
SPEAKER_1:  You're gonna like love.

02:15:27,874 --> 02:15:33,054
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean, I think there's a part of me that feels like I have unconditional love for all things. Like what you're talking about.

02:15:33,666 --> 02:15:36,094
SPEAKER_1:  Class being beautiful. I felt that.

02:15:36,706 --> 02:15:39,390
SPEAKER_1:  that feels like it felt like it rang something that like I have a

02:15:40,034 --> 02:15:41,909
SPEAKER_1:  The similar resonance in me for that.

02:15:41,909 --> 02:15:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  circle.

02:15:43,746 --> 02:15:46,110
SPEAKER_0:  right now. I feel like you're avoiding

02:15:46,466 --> 02:15:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  the love question.

02:15:48,706 --> 02:15:49,726
SPEAKER_0:  The last sandwich question.

02:15:50,978 --> 02:15:56,350
SPEAKER_0:  What's your own personal feeling towards loving another human being versus having sex with another human being?

02:15:57,762 --> 02:15:58,846
SPEAKER_1:  I think they...

02:16:00,066 --> 02:16:08,798
SPEAKER_1:  I love is like one of the concepts that dissolved for me a long time ago. So I have difficulty directly answering it. But I have the experience. When you describe the love sandwich, I feel like I.

02:16:09,346 --> 02:16:12,222
SPEAKER_1:  have had that experience. I have it currently for some people.

02:16:12,866 --> 02:16:13,310
SPEAKER_1:  Also.

02:16:13,762 --> 02:16:15,262
SPEAKER_1:  Like I'm dating people and I have that.

02:16:15,426 --> 02:16:18,750
SPEAKER_0:  So people who you date, you would describe.

02:16:19,618 --> 02:16:21,630
SPEAKER_0:  sharing a love sandwich with them.

02:16:22,242 --> 02:16:22,558
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

02:16:23,234 --> 02:16:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  So how does...

02:16:25,378 --> 02:16:29,054
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, I mean, that's great to hear. So you're not, are you afraid of love?

02:16:29,794 --> 02:16:30,110
SPEAKER_1:  No.

02:16:30,210 --> 02:16:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  Not at all.

02:16:33,122 --> 02:16:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  So can you describe to me?

02:16:35,906 --> 02:16:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  polyamory.

02:16:36,994 --> 02:16:37,406
SPEAKER_0: モリズ

02:16:38,402 --> 02:16:41,886
SPEAKER_0:  What does it mean? Cause there's like different terms. You have a nice blog post about it.

02:16:42,018 --> 02:16:46,526
SPEAKER_1:  I have a personal definition of it, which I readily admit is not shared by a lot of people.

02:16:46,754 --> 02:16:51,934
SPEAKER_1:  But to me, the definition of polyamory is simply not forbidding your partner from pursuing intimacy with others.

02:16:52,994 --> 02:16:59,006
SPEAKER_1:  It doesn't mean that you have to pursue it personally. Like two people could be married and only have had sex with each other for 20 years.

02:16:59,362 --> 02:17:02,737
SPEAKER_1:  And as long as they're like, you know what, if you ever, you wanna go have sex with somebody else, you're welcome to do that.

02:17:02,737 --> 02:17:08,958
SPEAKER_0:  Well, the interesting thing you said is that doesn't mean they have to do it. They just have the freedom to do it. Yeah. It's the freedom that matters to me.

02:17:10,274 --> 02:17:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  which is a...

02:17:12,066 --> 02:17:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  uh... and he's called the

02:17:13,314 --> 02:17:14,590
SPEAKER_0:  the polyamory post.

02:17:15,074 --> 02:17:17,342
SPEAKER_0:  He has so many good blog posts. People should just...

02:17:17,602 --> 02:17:20,510
SPEAKER_0:  Go look at your, read your writings.

02:17:21,058 --> 02:17:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  It's really, really strong and often backed by data.

02:17:23,586 --> 02:17:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  but also just a deeply honest look at yourself.

02:17:26,914 --> 02:17:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  in your understanding of the world.

02:17:28,834 --> 02:17:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  It's night.

02:17:29,922 --> 02:17:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  It's.

02:17:32,098 --> 02:17:33,470
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it's refreshing to.

02:17:33,730 --> 02:17:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  be like with a lot of stuff I disagree with but I feel like if I disagree with it you'll be very open arguing and kind of thinking through it.

02:17:41,986 --> 02:17:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  There's just an honesty that radiates from the whole thing.

02:17:44,386 --> 02:17:45,790
SPEAKER_0:  Anyway, so...

02:17:46,050 --> 02:17:51,166
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I mean, it would be interesting to kind of explore what polyamory, like how it works, what are the different versions.

02:17:51,586 --> 02:17:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  What does that freedom look like?

02:17:54,434 --> 02:17:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  What is it?

02:17:55,202 --> 02:17:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  What does that freedom feel like?

02:17:57,826 --> 02:17:59,230
SPEAKER_0:  be able to go see other people.

02:17:59,490 --> 02:18:00,766
SPEAKER_1:  Depends on you, like...

02:18:01,122 --> 02:18:03,486
SPEAKER_1:  Do you wanna go see other people? Maybe you do, maybe you don't.

02:18:04,162 --> 02:18:08,126
SPEAKER_1:  Usually for me, I tend to be pretty happy with like one or a few people.

02:18:08,866 --> 02:18:13,982
SPEAKER_1:  And then occasionally I like some novelties, so usually I'll go like, I host orgy sometimes, so.

02:18:14,274 --> 02:18:18,238
SPEAKER_1:  I'll host an orgy and then I'll go have sex with people at the orgy and then that'll be good for the novelty for a while.

02:18:18,562 --> 02:18:19,998
SPEAKER_0:  Ask about orgies. Yeah.

02:18:20,386 --> 02:18:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  So how many people are in OG? What's it

02:18:23,394 --> 02:18:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  standard.

02:18:24,322 --> 02:18:28,447
SPEAKER_0:  having a sunday picnic in synaudy was like a number of people and energy

02:18:28,447 --> 02:18:29,246
SPEAKER_1:  to her iPhone.

02:18:29,826 --> 02:18:35,070
SPEAKER_1:  I've only recently started hosting orgies, but I have been to a lot of orgies. I would say like the median is maybe.

02:18:35,650 --> 02:18:36,318
SPEAKER_1:  15 people.

02:18:36,866 --> 02:18:38,750
SPEAKER_0:  I like how you say median versus mean. Okay.

02:18:39,330 --> 02:18:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  Media is 15 people. What's the gender distribution usually?

02:18:43,138 --> 02:18:44,094
SPEAKER_1:  I usually bet

02:18:44,322 --> 02:18:58,430
SPEAKER_1:  even. It's like ideal if you can get more women than men in most of them. I've recently been hosting free use orgies, or orgies where consent is assumed by default when you enter. And of course you can revoke it anytime, or go over a whole bunch of rules to make sure it's very safe, you have wristbands.

02:18:58,818 --> 02:19:03,550
SPEAKER_1:  So nobody's actually doing anything they don't want to. But in those ones, you have to have more men than women.

02:19:04,226 --> 02:19:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  I thought free use was like...

02:19:07,106 --> 02:19:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  Consensual.

02:19:08,578 --> 02:19:09,630
SPEAKER_0:  Look at any time.

02:19:11,138 --> 02:19:13,982
SPEAKER_0:  but it's at any time within the constraints of this building or something like that.

02:19:14,466 --> 02:19:18,526
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so at the orgies it's like you bite entering if you wear a wristband.

02:19:18,978 --> 02:19:19,390
SPEAKER_1:  Bye.

02:19:19,618 --> 02:19:27,006
SPEAKER_1:  then you are by default opting into consent. So people don't have to do a thing where they negotiate with you and like to be like, is this okay?

02:19:27,298 --> 02:19:29,150
SPEAKER_1:  It's just the default is like you just go for it.

02:19:29,570 --> 02:19:33,246
SPEAKER_1:  And if they want you to stop, they say the safe word, like red, don't, and then you have to stop.

02:19:34,594 --> 02:19:38,997
SPEAKER_1:  And we do like exercise in the beginning, people saying red to make sure that everybody knows exactly what the rules are.

02:19:38,997 --> 02:19:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  What's your favorite safe word?

02:19:40,770 --> 02:19:47,070
SPEAKER_1:  Red. When I first started doing like weird kinky shit, I was like, oh, let's make a safe word. And we picked the word foliage.

02:19:47,458 --> 02:19:48,702
SPEAKER_1:  I was like, that's goofy, right?

02:19:49,442 --> 02:20:00,318
SPEAKER_1:  And then, but then eventually came a time where I did actually, in fact, want to say the safe word and I couldn't. I was like in agony, I was like crying, like I can't make myself say this stupid word right now.

02:20:01,090 --> 02:20:02,078
SPEAKER_1:  foliage.

02:20:02,338 --> 02:20:06,846
SPEAKER_1:  After that, I was like, red. Doesn't matter. I don't care. It's not funny. We're just going with very simple red.

02:20:07,426 --> 02:20:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  How does an orgy compare sexually to a one-on-one sexual experience?

02:20:14,402 --> 02:20:15,934
SPEAKER_0:  Like what is it same?

02:20:16,578 --> 02:20:18,174
SPEAKER_0:  ballparkers are fundamentally different.

02:20:18,722 --> 02:20:34,110
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, the experiences of both orgies and one-on-one sex can be like really high variety. There's a high variety. But you kind of, it's a little bit like you're having sex with someone, but you're surrounded by really realistic VR porn of other people having sex. Oh, okay, cool. And sometimes it's like three sums also, like maybe there's another person involved.

02:20:34,338 --> 02:20:36,094
SPEAKER_1:  but it's hard to have a whole bunch of people.

02:20:36,706 --> 02:20:41,662
SPEAKER_1:  on one in one cluster, because usually there's kind of different little clusters of people having their experience. Yeah.

02:20:42,018 --> 02:20:43,198
SPEAKER_1:  I wish this was part of a 10.

02:20:43,458 --> 02:20:44,030
SPEAKER_1:  woman.

02:20:44,258 --> 02:20:44,830
SPEAKER_1:  or G.

02:20:45,346 --> 02:20:49,246
SPEAKER_1:  It was a total lesbian thing and that felt like a writhing cluster. It was very nice.

02:20:50,338 --> 02:20:54,078
SPEAKER_1:  But typically you kind of separate out with like very small pods of people doing stuff.

02:20:55,362 --> 02:20:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  So back to polyamory, so what's a good...

02:20:58,978 --> 02:21:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  What does it take to manage? Do you have a main partner? If you're being polyamorous and you're dating multiple people, is there usually a main one?

02:21:05,730 --> 02:21:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  for you personally.

02:21:07,074 --> 02:21:10,718
SPEAKER_1:  For me personally, kind of yes, like right now I kind of too that aren't

02:21:11,458 --> 02:21:14,302
SPEAKER_1:  Like I see roughly around, for me, it's kind of just descriptive. Like I WILL NOT. You

02:21:14,530 --> 02:21:20,030
SPEAKER_1:  if I just happen to be seeing you a lot more and I confide in you more than you, like you're descriptively my primary partner.

02:21:20,514 --> 02:21:22,270
SPEAKER_1:  but I don't usually have rules to protect that.

02:21:22,882 --> 02:21:31,518
SPEAKER_1:  I'm down with rules to protect it if you're trying to build something. If I buy a house together, I'd be like, okay, we need to like whatever our relationship is, we have to do the thing where we're both paying the rent for the house or the mortgage or whatever.

02:21:32,578 --> 02:21:39,518
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of people do have primaries, so that's very common to have like, like prescriptive, like I'm going to get married to you and you're not allowed to like have anal sex with anybody else.

02:21:39,906 --> 02:21:40,478
SPEAKER_1:  That's her thing.

02:21:40,738 --> 02:21:45,429
SPEAKER_0:  What about like the transparency in the communication they have to do? Yeah. I usually try to be super hot.

02:21:45,429 --> 02:21:55,102
SPEAKER_1:  extremely yeah I mean I've learned over time that like even if it seems like a very small thing you talk about the small thing because often I would just sort of have like a small twitch in myself I don't know if I like that

02:21:55,394 --> 02:22:02,302
SPEAKER_1:  But I'd be like, okay, this is really minor. It's probably nothing. And I don't, if I talk about it, it's gonna make it into a thing. And I just don't wanna make it into a thing, you know?

02:22:02,562 --> 02:22:03,038
SPEAKER_1:  And I would.

02:22:03,394 --> 02:22:05,566
SPEAKER_1:  I've come to realize that it's worth making it into a thing.

02:22:05,826 --> 02:22:12,062
SPEAKER_1:  because I can't predict at the time if the small feeling I have is going to grow. And then when I grow it, now it's like much more difficult to deal with.

02:22:12,802 --> 02:22:19,262
SPEAKER_1:  So now it's like any little bit of jealousy I have immediately communicate it. I'm like, ah, I'm a little jealous of you right now. I don't hold that in at all.

02:22:19,490 --> 02:22:20,542
SPEAKER_1:  I used to be kind of like...

02:22:21,058 --> 02:22:24,894
SPEAKER_1:  Back when I first started being poly, I used to try to pretend that I was not a jealous person and that...

02:22:25,634 --> 02:22:26,759
SPEAKER_1:  backfired quite a lot.

02:22:26,759 --> 02:22:29,758
SPEAKER_0:  So you do still feel jealousy. Oh yeah, definitely. And like it.

02:22:30,370 --> 02:22:35,245
SPEAKER_0:  And it's also interesting that you kind of recommend when there's a little bit of jealousy like to bring that to the surface.

02:22:35,245 --> 02:22:38,174
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, just like excessively communicate, even if it feels...

02:22:38,562 --> 02:22:39,038
SPEAKER_1:  Stupid.

02:22:39,426 --> 02:22:49,627
SPEAKER_1:  Like this is, I feel like a cliche, I feel like a stupid therapist training video. Like I just feel ridiculous sometimes when I'm saying the things, but it's just, I've learned over time it's just important to just say the things.

02:22:49,627 --> 02:22:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  Because like, you know, the traditional view of jealousy is exactly like you said, if you bring it up to the surface, like...

02:22:55,362 --> 02:22:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  It's gonna sound like you're overreacting to everything.

02:22:58,626 --> 02:23:02,686
SPEAKER_0:  But you're saying like, still do it. Cause you're basically, your brain.

02:23:03,426 --> 02:23:05,118
SPEAKER_0:  blows stuff out of proportion.

02:23:05,794 --> 02:23:08,606
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, and it's good to be going through it with a partner.

02:23:08,930 --> 02:23:15,038
SPEAKER_1:  Like I have a partner right now who's like dating this other girl and he like really likes her and you know like went traveling with her and stuff and I was like I feel.

02:23:15,330 --> 02:23:18,334
SPEAKER_1:  jealous about and I have to tell him that and that way he can be with me in it.

02:23:18,658 --> 02:23:21,054
SPEAKER_1:  He like holds me when I'm feeling jealous.

02:23:21,570 --> 02:23:32,926
SPEAKER_1:  and it's like a bonding experience, you know? But it's important for me that he's able to handle it. Like I try not to date people who really freak out when I have negative emotions, because I wanna be able to express that I'm upset by something they're doing.

02:23:33,218 --> 02:23:33,694
SPEAKER_1:  without.

02:23:34,018 --> 02:23:36,643
SPEAKER_1:  being taken as a demand that they change their behavior. Right.

02:23:36,643 --> 02:23:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  So he has to be able to skillfully handle that interaction.

02:23:40,642 --> 02:23:45,374
SPEAKER_1:  You have to be like, cool, all right, you're jealous. Like, I'm not gonna freak out about it. I'm not gonna change my behavior. I'm just gonna be with you in that.

02:23:45,730 --> 02:23:46,782
SPEAKER_1:  We're going to sit in it together.

02:23:48,354 --> 02:23:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's some of that just insecurity that he should also just comfort. like

02:23:52,738 --> 02:23:56,995
SPEAKER_0:  basically alleviate your insecurity, bring you back to like a rational objective evaluation.

02:23:56,995 --> 02:24:01,822
SPEAKER_1:  My relationships, I love it when people do not reassure me. I like not being comforted quite a lot.

02:24:02,466 --> 02:24:05,342
SPEAKER_1:  And so usually the people I date don't. I'm very gravitating.

02:24:05,602 --> 02:24:10,270
SPEAKER_1:  Like it's one of the things people do to make me fall in love with them is if I say something really like terrible and they're just like

02:24:10,530 --> 02:24:13,214
SPEAKER_1:  do not give me any comfort whatsoever. like that's where

02:24:13,666 --> 02:24:14,782
SPEAKER_1:  my heart gets captured.

02:24:15,074 --> 02:24:16,766
SPEAKER_1:  So I typically am in relationships where I'm like.

02:24:17,154 --> 02:24:19,870
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I'm so jealous and they just like, do not reassure me at all.

02:24:20,386 --> 02:24:24,030
SPEAKER_1:  and that's good, because it doesn't give me an out. Like I have to deal with it myself.

02:24:24,546 --> 02:24:35,102
SPEAKER_1:  Like maybe it is true that the other woman is better than me. Like maybe that is an actual possible reality and I don't wanna be dealing with my life in a way where I'm like pretending, like I'm only okay when that reality is not true.

02:24:35,330 --> 02:24:36,222
SPEAKER_0:  Would you like them to?

02:24:36,770 --> 02:24:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  to say that, that the other woman is better than you. Or that they prefer. Do they feel that?

02:24:41,890 --> 02:24:48,606
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean, they should say it in according to themselves. Like, oh, I prefer it. Like I have a better time with her than I have with you. Then I would want to know that. Yeah.

02:24:49,090 --> 02:24:51,358
SPEAKER_0:  and even though that might be painful to hear.

02:24:51,490 --> 02:24:51,870
SPEAKER_1:  Yes.

02:24:54,274 --> 02:24:56,222
SPEAKER_1:  that which can be destroyed by the truth should be.

02:24:57,122 --> 02:25:03,518
SPEAKER_0:  That which can be destroyed by the truth. What is that, that your ego or something like that? Yeah, my ego. Thank you!

02:25:04,290 --> 02:25:07,614
SPEAKER_0:  So your ego just generally grows and you like the destruction of it. Yeah.

02:25:07,746 --> 02:25:14,622
SPEAKER_1:  It's like a fun experience. Like I've had like guys be like, well, you're not as pretty as I'd like. I'm just like, oh.

02:25:15,106 --> 02:25:17,470
SPEAKER_1:  You know, stabbed to the heart and...

02:25:17,666 --> 02:25:19,390
SPEAKER_0:  but then also they give me your number after.

02:25:22,754 --> 02:25:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  Oh man, that's kind of beautiful.

02:25:26,082 --> 02:25:26,814
SPEAKER_0:  What?

02:25:27,138 --> 02:25:29,054
SPEAKER_0:  What do you think of monogamous relationships?

02:25:29,826 --> 02:25:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  philosophically.

02:25:31,106 --> 02:25:31,806
SPEAKER_0:  Can you maybe?

02:25:32,194 --> 02:25:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  steal man or make the case for monogamous relationships.

02:25:35,490 --> 02:25:35,902
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:25:36,578 --> 02:25:39,203
SPEAKER_0:  Can you understand the pros and cons of monogamous relationships?

02:25:39,203 --> 02:25:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, depends on how you defend, if you're like, hey, you can do whatever you want, but you and I are gonna spend the rest. Like we just.

02:25:45,410 --> 02:25:47,838
SPEAKER_1:  You're 80 years old and like, oh, we spent 60 years.

02:25:48,258 --> 02:25:50,494
SPEAKER_1:  in a marriage together, we've never had sex with anybody else. I think that's like-

02:25:50,722 --> 02:25:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  Awesome, that's what you want, that's great.

02:25:52,706 --> 02:25:55,134
SPEAKER_1:  I have like a little bit more problems with people doing that.

02:25:55,554 --> 02:25:58,718
SPEAKER_1:  while also forcing their partner not to misbehave if they want to.

02:25:59,586 --> 02:26:05,918
SPEAKER_1:  Like if you're like, oh, we only made it this far in our monogamous relationship because I forced my partner not to pursue an intimacy that she wanted to.

02:26:06,466 --> 02:26:09,534
SPEAKER_1:  Then I feel like a little more like, I don't know if that's great.

02:26:09,762 --> 02:26:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  How do you know if it's a real want for an intimacy?

02:26:12,610 --> 02:26:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  Like checking out a...

02:26:14,338 --> 02:26:15,230
SPEAKER_0:  attractive person.

02:26:15,554 --> 02:26:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  while being inside a monogamous relationship. Yeah, how do you square that? That is that bad that the person cannot pursue those feelings.

02:26:22,402 --> 02:26:26,590
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, it depends if they want to. Like, I often find people attractive I don't want to pursue.

02:26:28,706 --> 02:26:35,934
SPEAKER_1:  I'm also okay with people entering into agreements. Like if you and I want to agree, like I'm only going to enter this because I'm going to be so hurt if you-

02:26:36,194 --> 02:26:38,398
SPEAKER_1:  pursue somebody else, so I'm not going to pursue anybody else.

02:26:38,626 --> 02:26:39,518
SPEAKER_1:  That seems fine to me.

02:26:39,906 --> 02:26:44,670
SPEAKER_1:  But I also extend that, like if somebody's like, I don't want you to have any friends, I'm going to feel really insecure if you...

02:26:45,026 --> 02:26:50,014
SPEAKER_1:  And like, okay, like if you want to enter that agreement, like I feel the same way. Like I think you should have the right to do it if this is what you want.

02:26:50,434 --> 02:26:54,142
SPEAKER_1:  But I also kind of, I feel like a little weird about restricting your partner from doing things, you know?

02:26:54,434 --> 02:26:56,958
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, but I guess if you're honest about it, you should put it on the table.

02:26:58,306 --> 02:27:02,046
SPEAKER_0:  I don't want you to have any friends. I want you to sit in a box.

02:27:02,594 --> 02:27:03,358
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

02:27:03,810 --> 02:27:07,838
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I think a lot. Yes, if you're like really on it, but then there's like.

02:27:08,514 --> 02:27:09,918
SPEAKER_0:  there's a power dynamic.

02:27:10,882 --> 02:27:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  that like you can be quite influential in a relationship.

02:27:15,394 --> 02:27:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  convincing your partner and it sure sounds like you're honestly agreeing to a thing, but you're not really agreeing. That's the

02:27:21,986 --> 02:27:24,926
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, part of that is the beauty of relationships, right? I like everything about relationships!

02:27:27,106 --> 02:27:28,542
SPEAKER_0:  It's messy, it can be messy.

02:27:29,058 --> 02:27:30,183
SPEAKER_0:  It's hard to know what you really want.

02:27:30,183 --> 02:27:38,846
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I think that's mainly my complaint with monogamy. Like I'm down with like conscious monogamy, but I think so many relationships are like monogamous by default.

02:27:39,170 --> 02:27:44,565
SPEAKER_1:  And people, it's not actually right for them, but they just get into it because culture just doesn't give them another option.

02:27:44,565 --> 02:27:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  don't even ask themselves the question, is this right for me? Well, high five and we'll be right back.

02:27:47,362 --> 02:27:54,142
SPEAKER_1:  Which like, I'm a weird ass person who thinks a lot of weird shit, but I didn't even think about polymers as an option before I had heard that it existed.

02:27:54,786 --> 02:28:00,926
SPEAKER_1:  And I was only when I first met my first polyamorous couple and I was like, oh, that's what I am. That's clearly the thing that I am.

02:28:01,986 --> 02:28:04,638
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it's funny because to me monogamy is...

02:28:05,378 --> 02:28:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  It's not, it doesn't make sense for it to be a default.

02:28:08,834 --> 02:28:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  Like to me, monogamy goes against human nature.

02:28:11,970 --> 02:28:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  That's in some sense like romance is a fuck you to the way the world works

02:28:16,770 --> 02:28:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  Really? Yeah, like it's a-

02:28:18,658 --> 02:28:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  Like Romeo and Juliet romance, like.

02:28:21,858 --> 02:28:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  traditional description of what romance looks like versus like, sure, there's like a million variations of that. In my, in my head, like this partnership that's

02:28:30,306 --> 02:28:30,942
SPEAKER_0:  for long.

02:28:31,394 --> 02:28:32,510
SPEAKER_0:  time together.

02:28:32,962 --> 02:28:33,918
SPEAKER_0:  is a kinda...

02:28:34,370 --> 02:28:35,454
SPEAKER_0:  You know, like, uh...

02:28:36,130 --> 02:28:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, like True Romance, you know that movie? It's a really fucking good movie. I haven't seen it, no. There's just like a...

02:28:43,298 --> 02:28:44,542
SPEAKER_0:  You're together.

02:28:45,794 --> 02:28:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  against the world.

02:28:47,778 --> 02:28:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, that's the...

02:28:50,626 --> 02:28:59,742
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, that's what close friendship feels like. It's like ride or die. Yeah. Like that. I guess it can span across multiple, you can have multiple.

02:28:59,970 --> 02:29:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  partners in that way. Yeah, absolutely. I just don't see monogamy as like.

02:29:03,874 --> 02:29:05,726
SPEAKER_0:  This is definitely not a default.

02:29:06,306 --> 02:29:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  I would actually think honestly would

02:29:08,546 --> 02:29:11,262
SPEAKER_0:  probably see polyamory as a more natural default.

02:29:12,546 --> 02:29:16,350
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I guess it depends on what you mean by default. Like, most of human history has been.

02:29:16,930 --> 02:29:18,110
SPEAKER_1:  sort of weird mix like you get.

02:29:18,402 --> 02:29:20,766
SPEAKER_1:  polygamy and monogamy are kind of the main.

02:29:21,154 --> 02:29:22,078
SPEAKER_1:  Sure.

02:29:22,274 --> 02:29:23,399
SPEAKER_0:  But it's just like human nature.

02:29:23,399 --> 02:29:25,918
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, people are attracted to other people and they want to...

02:29:26,466 --> 02:29:31,934
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. Especially in longer term relationships. I checked in my relationship survey, and I tracked the amount of cheating over time.

02:29:32,354 --> 02:29:35,806
SPEAKER_1:  in a relationship, like how long have you been in this relationship and have you cheated?

02:29:36,066 --> 02:29:37,941
SPEAKER_0:  What's the results of that?

02:29:37,941 --> 02:29:42,142
SPEAKER_1:  Men cheat a lot, women too, but men cheat about 30% more than women do.

02:29:42,690 --> 02:29:46,078
SPEAKER_1:  I also asked men and women to predict if they think their partner has cheated.

02:29:46,530 --> 02:29:52,382
SPEAKER_1:  And people's predictions were about the same. So people roughly predicted that they're male or female, like spouse.

02:29:52,834 --> 02:29:53,246
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

02:29:53,890 --> 02:29:56,350
SPEAKER_1:  hadn't cheated at the same rate, but men cheated much more than women.

02:29:56,898 --> 02:29:59,070
SPEAKER_0:  So who was more correct in their prediction though?

02:29:59,362 --> 02:30:01,086
SPEAKER_1:  So men were more correct in their prediction.

02:30:01,378 --> 02:30:02,942
SPEAKER_1:  predicting women and women were.

02:30:03,522 --> 02:30:06,878
SPEAKER_1:  Women were more off. Women thought men cheated much less than they actually did.

02:30:07,714 --> 02:30:08,318
SPEAKER_1:  and but.

02:30:08,738 --> 02:30:15,966
SPEAKER_1:  Both of them were off but like the male gap was significantly more. So yeah, I mean you're right when you say monogamy is not default like I think

02:30:16,322 --> 02:30:20,638
SPEAKER_1:  you're like really getting at something. Like human beings are just, especially in long-term relationships, difficult.

02:30:22,050 --> 02:30:28,958
SPEAKER_1:  only want one person. But to be fair, I think Monami and commitment are very different. I think you'd be incredibly c- I haven't known so many very long term-

02:30:29,314 --> 02:30:30,110
SPEAKER_1:  super committed.

02:30:30,402 --> 02:30:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  poly couples that live lives that look very similar to the very romantic monogamous couples. Like children, houses, Ni**�� Tra-

02:30:36,194 --> 02:30:36,894
SPEAKER_1:  20 years.

02:30:37,378 --> 02:30:38,942
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. That works great.

02:30:41,122 --> 02:30:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

02:30:42,114 --> 02:30:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

02:30:44,194 --> 02:30:45,630
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, there's so much to like.

02:30:46,082 --> 02:30:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  Open your mind to in these.

02:30:48,674 --> 02:30:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  kinds of conversations, these kinds of ideas. But I also like realize like.

02:30:52,354 --> 02:30:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  Some of the cake is baked.

02:30:54,274 --> 02:30:56,702
SPEAKER_0:  Like I have some assumptions that are hard to break through.

02:30:56,994 --> 02:30:57,374
SPEAKER_0:  Like what?

02:30:57,698 --> 02:30:58,238
SPEAKER_0:  myself.

02:30:59,266 --> 02:31:03,166
SPEAKER_0:  It's difficult for me to imagine a polyamorous relationship for me that would work.

02:31:04,546 --> 02:31:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  but I don't have enough data.

02:31:05,858 --> 02:31:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  I don't have a...

02:31:07,170 --> 02:31:08,190
SPEAKER_0:  Like, I very little.

02:31:08,610 --> 02:31:09,630
SPEAKER_0:  But like at this point.

02:31:11,074 --> 02:31:12,158
SPEAKER_0:  It's like, um...

02:31:13,954 --> 02:31:16,510
SPEAKER_0:  I haven't eaten pizza in like 20 years.

02:31:17,570 --> 02:31:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  Cause I know I just don't.

02:31:18,978 --> 02:31:22,014
SPEAKER_0:  There's a bunch of stuff. I just eat low carb.

02:31:22,306 --> 02:31:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  because it makes me feel good.

02:31:23,874 --> 02:31:25,726
SPEAKER_0:  But there's so many foods I haven't explored.

02:31:27,010 --> 02:31:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  It's just like.

02:31:28,194 --> 02:31:32,382
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I know what I love. So you explore every once in a while.

02:31:32,610 --> 02:31:34,398
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, and you kind of figure that out.

02:31:35,138 --> 02:31:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  But at the same time, you're humbled by even talking to you and looking at your data. Sexuality is a fascinating topic because...

02:31:42,722 --> 02:31:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  It seems that we're-

02:31:44,354 --> 02:31:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  very like we were talking about very afraid of this topic

02:31:47,842 --> 02:31:50,046
SPEAKER_0:  like to be really honest with ourselves about it.

02:31:50,274 --> 02:31:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  the whole academic research is afraid of it.

02:31:54,210 --> 02:31:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  but it's so core to who we are as human beings.

02:31:57,218 --> 02:32:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  I gotta ask you about this. I can't believe it took this long to get there, but one of your many fascinating-

02:32:02,466 --> 02:32:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  brake.

02:32:03,266 --> 02:32:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  Surveys is on fetishes.

02:32:06,594 --> 02:32:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  You wrote a blog post about it.

02:32:09,282 --> 02:32:12,547
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, probably several, cause it's like a huge day.

02:32:12,547 --> 02:32:13,150
SPEAKER_1:  See ya.

02:32:13,826 --> 02:32:17,598
SPEAKER_0:  So, the one I'm referring to is unpopularity and tabooness.

02:32:18,370 --> 02:32:19,646
SPEAKER_0:  of various fetishes.

02:32:20,162 --> 02:32:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  So what are some interesting takeaways? I gotta pull up this graph cause it's freaking epic.

02:32:24,130 --> 02:32:28,318
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, this is a big graph and it has taboo-ness as one axis.

02:32:29,186 --> 02:32:29,630
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:32:30,210 --> 02:32:31,358
SPEAKER_1:  popularity is the other.

02:32:32,002 --> 02:32:35,646
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, for people who are just listening on the x-axis, great idea to watch this video, talk about mitosis, taboonus,

02:32:37,218 --> 02:32:39,614
SPEAKER_0:  asked to raid Haute-Taboo society.

02:32:40,066 --> 02:32:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  viewed the sexual interest and on the y-axis is percent of people reporting

02:32:45,090 --> 02:32:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  interest.

02:32:45,922 --> 02:32:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  log scale.

02:32:48,130 --> 02:32:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  Oh boy. All right. So just some examples on the low taboomness and high popularity. There's a correlation here. I think you said it's.69.

02:32:57,346 --> 02:32:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

02:32:58,434 --> 02:33:02,897
SPEAKER_0:  It's just not just hilarious. Is it still point six nine? Are you tracking that? I'm I

02:33:02,897 --> 02:33:03,647
SPEAKER_1:  That was the most recent.

02:33:03,647 --> 02:33:04,638
SPEAKER_0:  I did this, yeah.

02:33:04,962 --> 02:33:10,494
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, so like the last type of stuff is more likely to be popular and the more type of stuff is less likely to be popular.

02:33:10,914 --> 02:33:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  and on the...

02:33:12,610 --> 02:33:14,494
SPEAKER_0:  like missionary position.

02:33:16,034 --> 02:33:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  fingering vagina blowjobs.

02:33:19,042 --> 02:33:20,510
SPEAKER_0:  light spanking, cuddling.

02:33:21,218 --> 02:33:22,814
SPEAKER_0:  Cuddling is more taboo than missionary?

02:33:23,682 --> 02:33:32,307
SPEAKER_1:  I think people are conceiving, like, if you're like, I'm really sexually aroused by cuddling specifically, then you're like, that's a little more weird than getting specifically aroused by blow jobs. You expect people to be aroused by blow jobs.

02:33:32,307 --> 02:33:36,057
SPEAKER_0:  So this was like getting at like as a fetish versus like an activity

02:33:36,057 --> 02:33:40,990
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's as specific as a concrete sexual interest. Like I am specifically interested in this thing.

02:33:41,602 --> 02:33:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  And so those are.

02:33:42,882 --> 02:33:44,478
SPEAKER_0:  thighs and lips, different body parts.

02:33:44,962 --> 02:33:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  Jaw lines.

02:33:46,338 --> 02:33:48,126
SPEAKER_0:  and then some of it is color based on

02:33:48,386 --> 02:33:50,078
SPEAKER_0:  more female preference.

02:33:50,658 --> 02:33:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  versus male preference, like jawlines is more.

02:33:55,266 --> 02:33:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  Female preference

02:33:57,474 --> 02:34:00,574
SPEAKER_0:  Being submissive is more female preference, light bondage.

02:34:01,922 --> 02:34:03,710
SPEAKER_0:  See more yeah more female

02:34:04,322 --> 02:34:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  There's a lot of interesting ones. There's so much. Okay. But the far side of that, I mean, it gets pretty dark.

02:34:10,882 --> 02:34:12,446
SPEAKER_0:  but even all along the way.

02:34:13,762 --> 02:34:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  Extreme bondage being at 50 tabunas.

02:34:17,442 --> 02:34:17,950
SPEAKER_0:  pegging.

02:34:18,626 --> 02:34:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  pain.

02:34:19,618 --> 02:34:20,286
SPEAKER_0:  giving pain.

02:34:20,994 --> 02:34:22,334
SPEAKER_0:  Sexual frustration.

02:34:22,946 --> 02:34:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  I suppose, right, as a kink.

02:34:25,282 --> 02:34:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  Uh. Yeah.

02:34:27,106 --> 02:34:30,974
SPEAKER_0:  And there's so many interesting ones like to me, I just haven't even considered.

02:34:31,842 --> 02:34:34,878
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. I had to do so much research into fetishes to-

02:34:35,842 --> 02:34:36,830
SPEAKER_1:  Compile the list.

02:34:36,994 --> 02:34:41,415
SPEAKER_0:  There's some surprising options to you that you're like, oh, okay, this is like a fetish.

02:34:41,415 --> 02:34:44,830
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, well, more confusing was like what the fetishes are about.

02:34:45,218 --> 02:34:47,998
SPEAKER_1:  because I didn't want to overlap fetishes, so I had to kind of look into them.

02:34:48,610 --> 02:35:01,150
SPEAKER_1:  And I'm like, there's like such interesting manifestations of core drives. Like if you're really aroused by disgust, like maybe you're very into rolling around in dirt, but you're not into rolling around with ice cream. So I'm like, okay, I have to make those into two separate fetishes, you know? Yeah.

02:35:01,890 --> 02:35:03,070
SPEAKER_0:  I'm seeing like a...

02:35:03,330 --> 02:35:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  at the far end.

02:35:05,250 --> 02:35:05,886
SPEAKER_0:  Mug uhh

02:35:07,138 --> 02:35:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  rodents.

02:35:10,466 --> 02:35:12,990
SPEAKER_0:  like different types of incest.

02:35:14,434 --> 02:35:16,967
SPEAKER_0:  branding, so there's like pain.

02:35:16,967 --> 02:35:18,110
SPEAKER_1:  It's like wound fucking.

02:35:19,330 --> 02:35:22,590
SPEAKER_0:  sex with animals, I guess, dogs, horses.

02:35:27,586 --> 02:35:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  receiving oral sex from an animal.

02:35:30,722 --> 02:35:33,347
SPEAKER_0:  is high taboos and pretty high...

02:35:33,347 --> 02:35:36,158
SPEAKER_1:  Surprisingly high popularity. I was really shocked by that one.

02:35:36,418 --> 02:35:41,086
SPEAKER_1:  I'm going to triple check that number because I'm like, no way this amount of people are reporting interest. I'm going to double check that number because I'm like, no way this amount of people are

02:35:41,506 --> 02:35:42,654
SPEAKER_0:  Do you know which animal?

02:35:43,202 --> 02:35:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  Is there?

02:35:44,130 --> 02:35:49,598
SPEAKER_1:  No, I didn't specify. I asked which animals are erotic and then I separately asked how erotic is it to...

02:35:50,018 --> 02:35:51,134
SPEAKER_1:  receive oral sex from.

02:35:51,394 --> 02:35:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  your preferred animal.

02:35:53,474 --> 02:35:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  This is so fascinating. So I would.

02:35:56,898 --> 02:36:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  Like, can we just talk about the methodology of this?

02:36:00,546 --> 02:36:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  B'eeh

02:36:04,514 --> 02:36:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  This feels like deeply honest.

02:36:06,978 --> 02:36:07,550
SPEAKER_0:  Map.

02:36:08,098 --> 02:36:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  of humanity.

02:36:09,698 --> 02:36:12,382
SPEAKER_0:  in a way we don't usually map humanity. yeah...

02:36:13,666 --> 02:36:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  Like, cause it's so mean, like your fetishes.

02:36:16,642 --> 02:36:19,267
SPEAKER_0:  are so meaningful to each individual person.

02:36:19,267 --> 02:36:21,790
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, that's what I love about this work. It's like-

02:36:22,370 --> 02:36:28,638
SPEAKER_1:  Nobody cares about someone's fetishes. You never get to express them. And if you have a more unusual fetish, people usually judge you.

02:36:28,898 --> 02:36:37,182
SPEAKER_1:  So it's like this tiny little pocket of like this shame thing, but it's so cool to me that like human brains could be oriented in such a way like wound fucking.

02:36:37,634 --> 02:36:40,478
SPEAKER_1:  Like somebody finds that so erotic and that's so cool.

02:36:41,730 --> 02:36:42,046
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

02:36:42,178 --> 02:36:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  And then they probably, and it should be explored. Like how did that come to be? You mentioned that.

02:36:47,682 --> 02:36:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  We like to construct narratives that somehow is grounded in childhood, but maybe it's genetic.

02:36:52,322 --> 02:36:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe it has to do with...

02:36:53,602 --> 02:36:57,758
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe you can actually form and unform that fetish very quickly, I don't know.

02:36:58,274 --> 02:37:10,078
SPEAKER_1:  This is one of the things that I'm researching. So in the big survey that I'm doing, I asked so many questions about childhood, all the ones that I think like we have common theories about like, oh, are you abused? Is it yelled at by a man or a woman?

02:37:10,466 --> 02:37:14,430
SPEAKER_1:  Um, stuff like that. Like, are you, was it really sexually repressive? You know, is it gender roles where you've-

02:37:14,690 --> 02:37:15,742
SPEAKER_1:  expected to conform.

02:37:16,258 --> 02:37:19,934
SPEAKER_1:  whole bunch of stuff and then I asked you know obviously about like a massive amount of fetishes.

02:37:20,322 --> 02:37:22,494
SPEAKER_1:  And my sample size right now is 500,000 people.

02:37:22,850 --> 02:37:25,982
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's massive and I have to save for all of it.

02:37:26,402 --> 02:37:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  And the result looks like this not really correlated. Nothing that I asked about in childhood, nothing.

02:37:32,450 --> 02:37:34,462
SPEAKER_1:  correlates with fetish preference later in life.

02:37:34,722 --> 02:37:37,982
SPEAKER_1:  It does correlate with onset, lots of things that happen in childhood.

02:37:38,338 --> 02:37:40,963
SPEAKER_1:  like change like the age at which it triggered.

02:37:40,963 --> 02:37:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  There's so many fascinating blog posts. You had a blog post, I think, on...

02:37:45,218 --> 02:37:47,774
SPEAKER_0:  The age of fetish onset. Yeah.

02:37:48,642 --> 02:37:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

02:37:50,370 --> 02:37:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  like you.

02:37:51,842 --> 02:37:53,950
SPEAKER_0:  It's really nice to organize it by age.

02:37:54,594 --> 02:37:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  Like.

02:37:55,970 --> 02:37:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  Reproduction as a fetish, I guess pregnancy. Yeah.

02:37:59,074 --> 02:38:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  as at the age of 17, about 16.9.

02:38:03,394 --> 02:38:06,622
SPEAKER_0:  Toys and like anal beads is fifteen point five

02:38:07,426 --> 02:38:12,638
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, one of the interesting things I found, I mean, this data set is so huge, it's taking me a long time to go through it. This is like-

02:38:12,866 --> 02:38:18,558
SPEAKER_1:  snippets from what I remember when I was glancing through the data. This part is not rigorous, but I seem to get the impression that...

02:38:18,850 --> 02:38:19,806
SPEAKER_1:  If you are...

02:38:20,194 --> 02:38:25,534
SPEAKER_1:  If a fetish occurs for you earlier, like if it was much earlier onset, you're more likely to report being extremely interested into it.

02:38:26,050 --> 02:38:28,798
SPEAKER_1:  So later onset means you're gonna be like less into the fetish.

02:38:29,218 --> 02:38:30,343
SPEAKER_1:  but if it hits earlier.

02:38:30,343 --> 02:38:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  But I wonder if it passes, like...

02:38:33,058 --> 02:38:35,806
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I didn't measure old fetishes at all.

02:38:36,578 --> 02:38:41,246
SPEAKER_0:  Like no longer, right? You used to, but it is no longer there. It stings.

02:38:41,570 --> 02:38:44,094
SPEAKER_1:  One interesting thing that I don't understand is that...

02:38:44,514 --> 02:38:53,566
SPEAKER_1:  that non-cis people seem to have more correlation between childhood experiences and fetishes. So I was saying that there's no correlation between childhood experiences and fetishes. This holds for cis people.

02:38:54,082 --> 02:38:56,574
SPEAKER_1:  But trans people, especially trans men, there's a correlation.

02:38:57,026 --> 02:39:00,158
SPEAKER_1:  It doesn't mean they have absolutely higher rates of abuse or fetishes or anything.

02:39:00,482 --> 02:39:01,374
SPEAKER_1:  But I'm just saying that like.

02:39:01,890 --> 02:39:06,334
SPEAKER_1:  For them, there does actually seem to be some sort of connection between childhood experiences and sexuality later in life.

02:39:06,754 --> 02:39:10,206
SPEAKER_1:  And I don't understand why this applies to one group but not the other. Good theory for that.

02:39:10,690 --> 02:39:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  So usually you try, like when you see something like that, you'll try to construct theory and see if you can find.

02:39:15,682 --> 02:39:15,998
SPEAKER_0:  Like.

02:39:16,962 --> 02:39:23,678
SPEAKER_0:  You keep that theory in mind, like a hypothesis of why it would be, and then you ask further questions to try to elaborate.

02:39:24,802 --> 02:39:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  So can you maybe talk about the methodology of how you got the 500,000? What?

02:39:29,346 --> 02:39:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:39:30,466 --> 02:39:31,591
SPEAKER_0:  Like how did this come to be?

02:39:31,591 --> 02:39:42,686
SPEAKER_1:  I might go into way too much detail about this because I thought about this so much. Because the question is, how do you get a lot of people to take a big survey? The longer the survey is, the lower the response rate.

02:39:42,978 --> 02:39:48,286
SPEAKER_1:  And I really wanted to do one big comprehensive survey so I could like check a whole bunch of correlations within it.

02:39:48,674 --> 02:39:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  because it's more annoying and it's harder to get a lot of people to retake similar surveys to each other at a time.

02:39:55,170 --> 02:40:03,006
SPEAKER_1:  So I'm like, okay, I need to convince a very large number of people to take a lot of these questions. And even building the questions, that was really hard because I'm like, okay, I need a comprehensive.

02:40:03,362 --> 02:40:11,614
SPEAKER_1:  amount of fetishes. I can't ask everybody to answer for every single niche fetish. I'm going to ask everybody to answer for every single niche fetish. I'm going to ask everybody

02:40:11,906 --> 02:40:12,958
SPEAKER_1:  or whatever.

02:40:13,282 --> 02:40:15,934
SPEAKER_1:  Like you can't do that. Nobody's going to finish that survey. Okay.

02:40:16,418 --> 02:40:20,286
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not gonna ask questions. What's a wave screw, but okay.

02:40:20,578 --> 02:40:24,254
SPEAKER_1:  I'm trying to refer to like, there's like a thing that like...

02:40:24,418 --> 02:40:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  Different types of gags.

02:40:27,106 --> 02:40:40,862
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, different. So I'm like, so what I need to do is I need to ask people a question, like, are you in like bondage? And if you say yes, then I'll go ask you all the bondage questions. Ah, got it. Right. But then this seems simple, but then it just exploded because I'm like, how do I categorize these fetishes?

02:40:41,218 --> 02:40:43,326
SPEAKER_1:  Like if you're into splashing.

02:40:43,810 --> 02:40:51,934
SPEAKER_1:  which is like you like sitting in cakes, you like getting in mud, but basically like kind of messy sensory. Like is this a disgusting?

02:40:52,162 --> 02:40:54,398
SPEAKER_1:  Is it a humiliation thing? Is it a sensory thing?

02:40:55,554 --> 02:41:07,774
SPEAKER_1:  which category anyway. So it took me like two months of just agonizing over each fetish, because you don't want to miss a fetish. You don't want to like have a really important thing that you accidentally put in a disgust category when it actually belongs in the humiliation category.

02:41:08,194 --> 02:41:08,542
SPEAKER_1:  You know?

02:41:09,154 --> 02:41:12,318
SPEAKER_0:  Well, let me think about that. Because like you're still catching it. You just missed.

02:41:12,642 --> 02:41:13,278
SPEAKER_0:  catabro-

02:41:13,474 --> 02:41:22,110
SPEAKER_1:  categorizing it. Right, because if you're into splashing, and you're like, this is clearly a humiliations thing. So you say, yes, I'm into humiliation stuff. And then I don't ask you about splashing, and then I'm missing a whole data set of people.

02:41:22,914 --> 02:41:24,039
SPEAKER_1:  because I've falsely categorized.

02:41:24,039 --> 02:41:28,542
SPEAKER_0:  You're going to miss stuff. He's picking what to what's less and less important to miss

02:41:29,154 --> 02:41:31,454
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I'm trying to get people into the right question set.

02:41:32,258 --> 02:41:37,854
SPEAKER_1:  Because I can't ask you all the questions. I have to ask you a couple of overarching questions to know what specific questions to ask you.

02:41:38,370 --> 02:41:45,438
SPEAKER_1:  And so I have to, those overarching questions have to be really, really well calibrated so that I can accurately feed you into the right sub-part of the survey.

02:41:45,826 --> 02:41:46,238
SPEAKER_1:  Awesome.

02:41:46,530 --> 02:41:51,070
SPEAKER_1:  So that was extremely difficult. When I'm dealing with, I think it was like 850 fetishes.

02:41:51,810 --> 02:41:52,126
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:41:52,386 --> 02:42:02,526
SPEAKER_1:  So I did a couple things to spot check. I did a couple questions where I asked, like in the detailed in the survey, but like also the beginning of the survey, just to see like what cap percentage of people I was capturing.

02:42:02,946 --> 02:42:03,262
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:42:03,970 --> 02:42:13,374
SPEAKER_1:  But, and then I scored the survey. So if you take it, I had other people answer preliminary surveys where they gave me data about how taboo the various fetishes were.

02:42:13,634 --> 02:42:20,222
SPEAKER_1:  And then I use that data so that when you fill out the survey, it's extremely comprehensive and you get data about exactly how taboo your interests are.

02:42:20,450 --> 02:42:22,750
SPEAKER_1:  and you get a score at the end and I give you a.

02:42:23,010 --> 02:42:24,350
SPEAKER_1:  equivalent kinky character.

02:42:24,578 --> 02:42:30,366
SPEAKER_1:  which I also had people write a whole bunch of fictional characters and some historic ones about like how kinky they were so then I matched the

02:42:30,946 --> 02:42:33,886
SPEAKER_1:  historic character, kiki character to your score.

02:42:34,210 --> 02:42:38,942
SPEAKER_0:  So that makes it like more fun, like game-fies it a little bit and you can brag about.

02:42:39,650 --> 02:42:41,214
SPEAKER_1:  So we would share it with others.

02:42:41,442 --> 02:42:43,070
SPEAKER_1:  And a lot of the characters were goofy.

02:42:43,362 --> 02:42:48,359
SPEAKER_1:  like there's Spongebob and like Hitler's on there and you know South Park character.

02:42:48,359 --> 02:42:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  What is what is uh, what kink does hitler have?

02:42:51,010 --> 02:42:53,118
SPEAKER_1:  I think he's like, he's around Marilyn Monroe.

02:42:54,658 --> 02:42:56,254
SPEAKER_1:  which is like slightly above average.

02:42:56,770 --> 02:42:57,886
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, sorry.

02:42:58,978 --> 02:43:04,798
SPEAKER_0:  I thought there was like a two-dimensional space somehow. So this is like literally from zero to- How kinky, yeah.

02:43:05,122 --> 02:43:09,247
SPEAKER_0:  So, Hitler's the bod as the man they're meant to be. Who's the most, what's the character for like?

02:43:09,247 --> 02:43:09,630
SPEAKER_1:

02:43:10,274 --> 02:43:11,806
SPEAKER_1:  is the most kinky. most kinky.

02:43:13,154 --> 02:43:16,094
SPEAKER_1:  I think like maybe Captain America was the least kinky or something.

02:43:16,322 --> 02:43:17,150
SPEAKER_1:  or Gandhi.

02:43:18,082 --> 02:43:18,430
SPEAKER_0:

02:43:19,362 --> 02:43:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  Meanwhile, but that's another conversation.

02:43:23,106 --> 02:43:24,094
SPEAKER_0:  Oh boy.

02:43:24,674 --> 02:43:29,502
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so even viral and TikTok basically, because people were like, what, I got this insane character and then-

02:43:30,178 --> 02:43:33,790
SPEAKER_1:  The sample size exploded from 40,000 to 500,000.

02:43:34,850 --> 02:43:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  Wow, so like all it took is that kind of incentive? Or did you like, at first have to pay people for the server, you know? Have you ever felt that...

02:43:44,482 --> 02:43:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  And what about the demographic of the different people that took it?

02:43:47,618 --> 02:43:50,014
SPEAKER_1:  I'm mostly younger, so usually early 20s.

02:43:50,466 --> 02:43:52,830
SPEAKER_1:  predominantly female, like 70% female.

02:43:53,186 --> 02:43:54,974
SPEAKER_1:  I was just pretty like...

02:43:55,202 --> 02:43:56,798
SPEAKER_1:  wraps on a TikTok demographics pretty well.

02:43:57,218 --> 02:43:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, I got it.

02:43:58,786 --> 02:44:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  That's interesting, young people are probably better.

02:44:02,050 --> 02:44:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  this kind of survey.

02:44:04,290 --> 02:44:07,710
SPEAKER_0:  because there's probably a culture that's a little bit more honest about their sexuality.

02:44:08,098 --> 02:44:13,310
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, most likely. I think people are incentivized to be honest when they're getting a true identity response out of it.

02:44:14,178 --> 02:44:14,526
SPEAKER_1:  Like.

02:44:15,042 --> 02:44:19,006
SPEAKER_1:  If you're doing it for money, you don't care, but if you are invested in the results.

02:44:19,234 --> 02:44:20,798
SPEAKER_1:  you want to know what the...

02:44:21,090 --> 02:44:23,166
SPEAKER_1:  the truth of the answers are than you actually.

02:44:23,938 --> 02:44:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  as possible to you.

02:44:25,186 --> 02:44:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  also don't want to know the truth. Yeah, this is true.

02:44:27,426 --> 02:44:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  But on average, hopefully that does. I mean, these are really difficult. Like what is this some interesting little quirks that-

02:44:34,242 --> 02:44:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

02:44:35,010 --> 02:44:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  People should know about your methodology that you had to kind of solve to try to get it

02:44:40,546 --> 02:44:44,606
SPEAKER_0:  a really good service. So one of you said is the categorization to make it more efficient.

02:44:44,930 --> 02:44:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  Is there some for the analysis part?

02:44:46,914 --> 02:44:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so the graph that you were talking about is...

02:44:50,114 --> 02:44:55,966
SPEAKER_1:  is the binary. So it's like if you and if somebody expressed even a little bit of interest, then it goes into the graph. So it's like.

02:44:56,322 --> 02:45:00,510
SPEAKER_1:  80% of people expressed even a little bit of interest. So it's not representing degree of interest.

02:45:00,834 --> 02:45:09,918
SPEAKER_1:  is not differentiating between them at all. So it's possible that like some fetishes have exactly the same amount of people like are at least a little bit into them, but one of them is very extreme interest and the other is like.

02:45:10,690 --> 02:45:13,790
SPEAKER_1:  vague and not very intense. So that's not reflected.

02:45:14,242 --> 02:45:20,222
SPEAKER_1:  I also like probably didn't represent the visual part right. It might not be intuitive but.

02:45:20,674 --> 02:45:21,950
SPEAKER_0:  So you chose a log scale.

02:45:22,210 --> 02:45:25,566
SPEAKER_0:  but it was kind of spreads things out to make it more.

02:45:25,794 --> 02:45:30,142
SPEAKER_1:  more clear. Because the linear was just so close to the bottom you couldn't really separate it out.

02:45:30,434 --> 02:45:36,702
SPEAKER_1:  So there's obviously a selection effect that's possible that like the identity results at the end impacted people's results a little bit.

02:45:36,962 --> 02:45:39,934
SPEAKER_1:  But the thing is like, I'm comparing it to what exists.

02:45:40,290 --> 02:45:44,542
SPEAKER_1:  what is the alternative? and right now the research on this stuff is terrible.

02:45:44,866 --> 02:45:50,686
SPEAKER_1:  So it's like, I'm not saying my research is perfect, but it's like, at least it's something. Like it's something that's pointing us maybe in a direction.

02:45:50,978 --> 02:45:52,853
SPEAKER_1:  that we might be able to do more research on.

02:45:52,853 --> 02:45:54,174
SPEAKER_0:  and you're making the data available.

02:45:55,010 --> 02:46:03,710
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I'm doing it slowly because there's so, I ask about so many questions, it's like not very anonymized. So I'm releasing the small sections of the data at a time.

02:46:06,210 --> 02:46:13,511
SPEAKER_0:  Have you published in like journals and stuff? No, I haven't. Do you have any interest in that or is your approach?

02:46:13,511 --> 02:46:23,198
SPEAKER_1:  I have been conflicted about it. Like it sounds cool because then I could be like, ha ha, I'm publishing a journal. And then people who are yelling about me who don't know anything about statistics on Twitter, like then I can go like shove it in their face.

02:46:23,554 --> 02:46:26,179
SPEAKER_0:  but then you're also giving in to the silly criticism.

02:46:26,179 --> 02:46:28,766
SPEAKER_1:  Like I don't like I want I feel so

02:46:29,410 --> 02:46:30,334
SPEAKER_1:  passionate about

02:46:30,658 --> 02:46:38,718
SPEAKER_1:  extra science, like science that you can just do. Like I wanna make science accessible. Like anybody can just go look and learn about the basics of like-

02:46:39,042 --> 02:46:41,982
SPEAKER_1:  doing a survey or figuring out how to interpret information.

02:46:42,466 --> 02:46:42,814
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:46:43,170 --> 02:46:43,934
SPEAKER_1:  And June.

02:46:44,162 --> 02:46:46,110
SPEAKER_1:  Doing a published journal feels like a...

02:46:46,338 --> 02:46:48,190
SPEAKER_1:  I'm betraying my cause a little bit.

02:46:48,962 --> 02:46:52,798
SPEAKER_0:  that's often behind the paywall. Yeah, it goes against the...

02:46:53,986 --> 02:46:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I think you not publishing a journal is doing a big public service.

02:46:58,306 --> 02:46:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  Aww.

02:46:59,426 --> 02:47:00,542
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's the first time I've heard that.

02:47:01,090 --> 02:47:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  Thank you. Oh, it's just coming from like.

02:47:03,138 --> 02:47:05,182
SPEAKER_0:  on this topic, the elite.

02:47:05,442 --> 02:47:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  The elitism, I see.

02:47:07,554 --> 02:47:13,630
SPEAKER_0:  on the psychology side with the journals and the academia, the positions and the institutions that come from all of that.

02:47:14,018 --> 02:47:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  that goes against.

02:47:16,578 --> 02:47:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  I think that's more useful for math and computer science and so on.

02:47:20,898 --> 02:47:21,630
SPEAKER_0:  where there's like...

02:47:22,626 --> 02:47:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  clear.

02:47:23,746 --> 02:47:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  Like, but even then...

02:47:26,018 --> 02:47:26,814
SPEAKER_0:  Even then...

02:47:27,202 --> 02:47:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  Code is code, data is data.

02:47:29,314 --> 02:47:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. Like, uh, prestige should matter at all.

02:47:32,514 --> 02:47:33,854
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe.

02:47:34,114 --> 02:47:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe for like.

02:47:36,322 --> 02:47:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  biological experiments like virology or something like that.

02:47:40,258 --> 02:47:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  It's good to be from a major lab that has a reputation for like.

02:47:44,994 --> 02:47:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  going through all the procedures that you know you can trust.

02:47:48,578 --> 02:47:57,203
SPEAKER_0:  But here, you're dealing with a giant mess of humanity. It's beautiful to be transparent, to be raw, to be exploring it together with everybody. Yeah, it's really beautiful.

02:47:57,203 --> 02:48:03,678
SPEAKER_1:  I think people have a lot of incentive to doubt the results. A lot of the research I'm doing is to like cis and trans people.

02:48:03,970 --> 02:48:04,798
SPEAKER_1:  We don't have.

02:48:05,058 --> 02:48:08,350
SPEAKER_1:  any data about transsexuality. Very good, at least.

02:48:08,738 --> 02:48:11,902
SPEAKER_1:  And I'm really curious, I don't really have an agenda about it. I think like-

02:48:12,130 --> 02:48:13,022
SPEAKER_1:  Being trans is a-

02:48:13,378 --> 02:48:17,662
SPEAKER_1:  if you want to be trans, do it. I have some skepticism about gender theory.

02:48:17,890 --> 02:48:21,886
SPEAKER_1:  But like, it doesn't come down to impact, like the way I think trans people should be treated, which I think is like...

02:48:22,146 --> 02:48:25,214
SPEAKER_1:  treat them, you know, be fucking nice and human about it. I don't know.

02:48:25,826 --> 02:48:30,686
SPEAKER_1:  When I'm talking about the thing, like, my conclusions are that, like, transsexuality is really unique.

02:48:31,106 --> 02:48:39,614
SPEAKER_1:  It's not like cis or cis women or man sexuality at all. And to me this is super cool, but like a lot of people, this is very politicized right now.

02:48:39,938 --> 02:48:49,342
SPEAKER_1:  like the data into like transsexual preferences, like it's so loaded, which is really sad because I am very accepting of weird sexuality. Like if you're into a weird thing, I'm like.

02:48:49,570 --> 02:48:55,646
SPEAKER_1:  good for you, this is super cool. Like let's figure out how to make it so that you can explore the thing you're into without any stigma.

02:48:56,002 --> 02:49:03,486
SPEAKER_1:  But because there's so much stigma that like if you find that one demographic is in a weirder sex stuff than the other, like it's hard to present that in a way that people don't weaponize.

02:49:03,842 --> 02:49:06,174
SPEAKER_1:  So it's been really politically touchy subject here.

02:49:06,722 --> 02:49:08,798
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, but you do it in a way that's not...

02:49:09,154 --> 02:49:11,902
SPEAKER_0:  feel like it has an agenda, right? you're just exploring.

02:49:12,290 --> 02:49:12,638
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

02:49:13,154 --> 02:49:14,718
SPEAKER_1:  I feel pretty open to-

02:49:14,978 --> 02:49:23,198
SPEAKER_1:  what I'm gonna find. Like I often have no idea what the data is gonna tell me. And I'm like, I pre-comment like, okay, I could say A, B or C, and I'm like down to publish any of those findings.

02:49:24,706 --> 02:49:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  So you've put together

02:49:26,626 --> 02:49:27,390
SPEAKER_0:  and ask.

02:49:27,650 --> 02:49:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  hole.

02:49:28,610 --> 02:49:32,062
SPEAKER_0:  Cart deck, a lot of awesome questions to ask at a party.

02:49:33,282 --> 02:49:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  Or anywhere, honestly.

02:49:35,522 --> 02:49:38,814
SPEAKER_0:  including on the podcast. Let me ask you one from that deck.

02:49:39,266 --> 02:49:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  Is sex really about power?

02:49:41,378 --> 02:49:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  So what's the role of power dynamics in sex?

02:49:44,450 --> 02:49:48,350
SPEAKER_0:  everything understand like in from the survey in terms of what people turned on

02:49:48,834 --> 02:49:53,278
SPEAKER_0:  by you've talked about like the preferences that women versus men have.

02:49:53,858 --> 02:49:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  for like submissiveness and dominance.

02:49:57,026 --> 02:50:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  And we've already talked about it a little bit, but like it's expressed.

02:50:00,866 --> 02:50:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  more strongly.

02:50:02,050 --> 02:50:05,425
SPEAKER_0:  I already forget the results, but I feel like women have more preference to be...

02:50:05,425 --> 02:50:09,214
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, this is one of the things that got me into researching fetches to begin with.

02:50:09,698 --> 02:50:13,246
SPEAKER_1:  because I think I came across some data, I did like a brief survey where

02:50:13,730 --> 02:50:18,686
SPEAKER_1:  Roughly around 60% of women report being submissive and 40% of men report being nominate.

02:50:19,106 --> 02:50:22,046
SPEAKER_1:  And this was really fascinating to me. I'm like, why is there this gap? Click.

02:50:22,914 --> 02:50:27,166
SPEAKER_1:  Why do we not? Because I guess I have some priors that maybe this is an evolutionary thing.

02:50:27,618 --> 02:50:35,006
SPEAKER_1:  like the submission dominant, like strong men, and you know, like women being like, oh, this hot, hot man, you know, the men are like ravaging and stuff. I'm like, shouldn't this be a.

02:50:35,490 --> 02:50:36,510
SPEAKER_1:  in our genes, but.

02:50:36,898 --> 02:50:37,566
SPEAKER_1:  But there's a gap.

02:50:38,882 --> 02:50:39,390
SPEAKER_1:  What's the gap?

02:50:39,650 --> 02:50:43,326
SPEAKER_1:  The gap is the dominant submissive gap. More women are submissive than there are dominant men.

02:50:44,066 --> 02:50:44,382
SPEAKER_1:  Oh.

02:50:44,962 --> 02:50:46,270
SPEAKER_1:  Wait, really? Yeah!

02:50:46,626 --> 02:50:47,838
SPEAKER_1:  It's a pretty significant gap.

02:50:48,290 --> 02:51:00,243
SPEAKER_1:  And this is held up like it depends on what you're testing. I've tested a bunch of things. This is part of why I did this big survey. Nice. But it depends against again, on like what kind of dominance you're measuring, but overall it's roughly 40 to 60%.

02:51:00,243 --> 02:51:02,558
SPEAKER_0:  So when you say there's not many dominant men.

02:51:03,234 --> 02:51:07,359
SPEAKER_0:  The meaning like they express like a desire to be dominant in the relationship.

02:51:07,359 --> 02:51:07,934
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

02:51:08,226 --> 02:51:14,142
SPEAKER_1:  Or like in sexually. Sexually. Sexually, in bed. So like if I ask questions like, how much do you like being dominant in bed?

02:51:14,434 --> 02:51:17,502
SPEAKER_1:  Like men are less likely to answer strong yes to that question.

02:51:17,922 --> 02:51:19,326
SPEAKER_1:  But if I ask, are you?

02:51:19,618 --> 02:51:22,366
SPEAKER_1:  likely to be submissive, like women are very much yes.

02:51:23,202 --> 02:51:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  Really? And that's expressive? Like that's that that that

02:51:26,626 --> 02:51:27,742
SPEAKER_0:  represents truth.

02:51:28,450 --> 02:51:40,158
SPEAKER_1:  My guess is... What's wrong with men? So this is, I think there's some reflection on like FetLife. So FetLife is this website where people like sign up and connect based on their fetishes. And this is, like you can kind of see it picked up in the forum posts about like...

02:51:40,450 --> 02:51:45,182
SPEAKER_1:  how dominant men are getting laid so much and submissives are always looking for a dominant.

02:51:45,602 --> 02:51:47,166
SPEAKER_1:  Like it's an unequal market.

02:51:47,554 --> 02:51:48,679
SPEAKER_1:  Holy shit. Yeah you

02:51:48,679 --> 02:51:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  This is great news. CH HOLLY SHIT

02:51:51,362 --> 02:51:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't know this. That's interesting. Yeah. Interesting. What does it reflect about modern society? Is there like a-

02:51:56,802 --> 02:52:02,427
SPEAKER_0:  Because you know there's these trends about like decreased masculinity or that guy. Yeah, so is that reflect is that some?

02:52:02,427 --> 02:52:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  I'm trying not to hold on to one theory because I'm not sure. Is it possible to decrease testosterone levels?

02:52:08,130 --> 02:52:15,902
SPEAKER_1:  testosterone seems to be, I have a little bit of other research but I'm still checking it out that seems to indicate that higher testosterone you're more likely to be dominant.

02:52:16,226 --> 02:52:20,158
SPEAKER_1:  So if we're seeing decreased testosterone levels across society, we should be seeing it greater.

02:52:20,450 --> 02:52:21,150
SPEAKER_1:  uh, gap.

02:52:21,730 --> 02:52:22,110
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:52:22,466 --> 02:52:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  This is so fascinating. Once again, this is like a super interesting way to look at humanity.

02:52:27,298 --> 02:52:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  because it is such an important part of humanity.

02:52:30,018 --> 02:52:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  Like how many people are doing large scale?

02:52:32,322 --> 02:52:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  Research like this.

02:52:33,474 --> 02:52:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like you're like...

02:52:34,690 --> 02:52:38,718
SPEAKER_0:  at the top of the world. You're like world class at the top of the world doing research on this stuff.

02:52:39,042 --> 02:52:43,966
SPEAKER_1:  I think I might have the biggest, most comprehensive, fetish dataset in the world right now.

02:52:46,210 --> 02:52:50,686
SPEAKER_1:  That's epic. Thank you. I'm really happy about it. I'm very proud. Yeah.

02:52:51,074 --> 02:52:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  And it's, you know, it's probably growing, but it's also enabling you to establish a name.

02:52:56,354 --> 02:53:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  to where you like a reputation to where people can go to you to like trust you more and more.

02:53:01,666 --> 02:53:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  to do longer surveys perhaps?

02:53:03,906 --> 02:53:09,790
SPEAKER_1:  Like, yeah, maybe I think it's the data analysis afterwards is very different from like the survey design itself.

02:53:10,626 --> 02:53:12,798
SPEAKER_1:  I'm still very amateur at the...

02:53:13,282 --> 02:53:14,142
SPEAKER_1:  data analysis.

02:53:14,402 --> 02:53:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, but you can always catch up on that. I guess the data analysis does enable you to.

02:53:18,882 --> 02:53:21,507
SPEAKER_0:  does teach you how to ask better questions in order. Yes.

02:53:21,507 --> 02:53:26,590
SPEAKER_1:  It goes back and forth. As I'm looking at the data, it informs the way I want to phrase questions the next time.

02:53:27,042 --> 02:53:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  So women are more, at least in private, able to.

02:53:30,562 --> 02:53:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  say that they would like to be submissive.

02:53:32,930 --> 02:53:34,686
SPEAKER_0:  and men even in private are not.

02:53:35,362 --> 02:53:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  disproportionately saying they're not.

02:53:38,594 --> 02:53:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  willing to be dominant.

02:53:40,418 --> 02:53:54,334
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so it's possible. If this is caused by decreasing testosterone levels, then this means that we're probably having less satisfying sex overall. Like we're becoming less and less sexually compatible as time goes on. To be fair, I'm not sure that it is connected to testosterone levels. It's possible that this is just like.

02:53:54,658 --> 02:53:57,534
SPEAKER_1:  a genetic thing. Like, the gay uncle theory, like the...

02:53:57,794 --> 02:54:03,326
SPEAKER_1:  ideas like maybe gay people evolved to like be sort of taking themselves out of the gene pool to be assistance.

02:54:03,618 --> 02:54:06,558
SPEAKER_1:  And it's possible that there's a certain percentage of men sort of like...

02:54:06,786 --> 02:54:10,782
SPEAKER_1:  quote unquote, evolved to be submissive, to take themselves out of sexual competition.

02:54:11,202 --> 02:54:12,542
SPEAKER_1:  and to instead be like the...

02:54:13,250 --> 02:54:15,454
SPEAKER_1:  the monkeys revolving at the edge of the pack.

02:54:15,618 --> 02:54:19,838
SPEAKER_0:  It's unclear. Oh, it's a method of survival? Like, so you stay out of the competition?

02:54:19,970 --> 02:54:21,790
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, and I'm like a little sus about-

02:54:22,082 --> 02:54:24,798
SPEAKER_1:  these kinds of evo psych theories. So I'm not.

02:54:25,218 --> 02:54:27,093
SPEAKER_1:  I'm just saying it because it's like a different idea.

02:54:27,093 --> 02:54:28,670
SPEAKER_0:  I guess that are possible. Welcome.

02:54:29,122 --> 02:54:36,190
SPEAKER_1:  So yeah, I'm not saying that it's definitely testosterone. There's other things. It's also possible that it's culture. People are definitely gonna bring that up. Based on my-

02:54:36,514 --> 02:54:38,590
SPEAKER_1:  survey though, it doesn't seem to be any evidence of that.

02:54:38,978 --> 02:54:49,886
SPEAKER_1:  Like I asked about like how much pressure was put on you to be, you know, agent-y in your childhood. Like a lot of questions around this kind of thing and no correlation at all to dominance. Well-

02:54:50,018 --> 02:54:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  Related to sexuality

02:54:52,738 --> 02:54:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  Hmm, very uncomfortable right now, but...

02:54:55,202 --> 02:54:55,966
SPEAKER_0:  Nevertheless...

02:54:56,642 --> 02:54:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  plow forward.

02:54:59,202 --> 02:55:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  in a dominant fashion.

02:55:03,746 --> 02:55:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  uh... this that the blog post

02:55:05,922 --> 02:55:08,574
SPEAKER_0:  titled Rape Spectrum Survey Results.

02:55:09,986 --> 02:55:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  What are the?

02:55:11,234 --> 02:55:13,278
SPEAKER_0:  key takeaways from that survey.

02:55:13,858 --> 02:55:18,878
SPEAKER_1:  So I did this survey when I had a friend be like, hey, I had this confusing sexual experience. Was it rape?

02:55:19,554 --> 02:55:25,854
SPEAKER_1:  like somebody kind of pressured her and she eventually stopped saying it or something. I was like, that's a great question. Like I don't know how people would consider this.

02:55:26,178 --> 02:55:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  And so I put a whole bunch of different gray.

02:55:28,770 --> 02:55:30,494
SPEAKER_1:  scenarios.

02:55:30,786 --> 02:55:34,101
SPEAKER_1:  into a survey and then ask people to rate how rapey they thought that scenario was.

02:55:34,101 --> 02:55:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  So you actually like little narratives.

02:55:37,762 --> 02:55:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  that they get a rate.

02:55:39,554 --> 02:55:45,054
SPEAKER_1:  Like, you know, this person is on a date with this person, they get drunk and the other person's not drunk. I try to keep gender neutral.

02:55:45,346 --> 02:55:45,854
SPEAKER_1:  uh

02:55:46,754 --> 02:55:47,879
SPEAKER_1:  names for all of them.

02:55:47,879 --> 02:55:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  you reduce them into a more concise description of the situation.

02:55:52,034 --> 02:55:55,582
SPEAKER_0:  I can as visualizations, you have this rape spectrum that's a result.

02:55:56,098 --> 02:56:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  where on top are things that are less likely to be considered by the people that took the survey on the bottom.

02:56:02,530 --> 02:56:03,390
SPEAKER_0:  more likely.

02:56:04,290 --> 02:56:11,006
SPEAKER_0:  The, the likeliest is a stranger forcibly assaults someone who screams and fights the entire time that gets a hundred

02:56:11,938 --> 02:56:12,318
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:56:13,346 --> 02:56:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  What do we make of something that's not zero? It's like a 12 is what?

02:56:16,994 --> 02:56:20,369
SPEAKER_0:  What is that? How are we supposed to interpret a 12 out of 100? Extremely low.

02:56:20,369 --> 02:56:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

02:56:21,378 --> 02:56:23,582
SPEAKER_1:  It's like not zero, but it's just very close to it.

02:56:24,194 --> 02:56:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  having sex with an enthusiastic sex worker.

02:56:28,642 --> 02:56:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  Is it 12? That's the lowest one.

02:56:31,074 --> 02:56:34,398
SPEAKER_0:  And there's a few, I'll just mention a few that are lower.

02:56:35,714 --> 02:56:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  at that level.

02:56:37,090 --> 02:56:39,646
SPEAKER_0:  have sex to make a partner happy in a relationship.

02:56:40,066 --> 02:56:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  lying about wealth hobbies in order to get laid.

02:56:44,066 --> 02:56:48,158
SPEAKER_0:  A person with Down syndrome eagerly has sex with a neurotypical.

02:56:48,482 --> 02:56:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  not revealing being transgender.

02:56:50,626 --> 02:56:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  until after sex and so on. I think you mentioned that there's some, like that not revealing being transgender until after sex, there's some differences.

02:56:59,426 --> 02:57:02,535
SPEAKER_0:  amongst what men and women or something like that.

02:57:02,535 --> 02:57:05,374
SPEAKER_1:  I think that was the one that men found more offensive than women.

02:57:05,698 --> 02:57:07,166
SPEAKER_1:  I wrote it a while ago.

02:57:08,482 --> 02:57:09,374
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, uh...

02:57:09,922 --> 02:57:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  This is.

02:57:10,722 --> 02:57:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  nuanced and difficult, right?

02:57:12,866 --> 02:57:17,342
SPEAKER_0:  is because uh... i think in a lot of public discourse toward rape is pretty binary

02:57:17,634 --> 02:57:20,126
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's like either is or is not rape.

02:57:20,578 --> 02:57:23,326
SPEAKER_0:  And so you had a friend where it was like, this felt rapey.

02:57:24,034 --> 02:57:43,102
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, she's confused about how to interpret it. And I think people look to the terms to know how to feel about something. Like, have you ever been through an experience you're like, that was weird, and then you tell it to somebody else and they're like, oh my God, you were assaulted. And then it totally recontextualizes the thing that you've experienced. And I think that this is clunky with the word rape because either you were raped or you're not.

02:57:43,458 --> 02:57:46,942
SPEAKER_1:  You either like have this entire context like a thrust upon you or you don't.

02:57:47,266 --> 02:57:49,374
SPEAKER_1:  And we're really not newest about it at all.

02:57:49,666 --> 02:57:53,534
SPEAKER_1:  And so I would really like to have some sort of like, Oh, that was like a 30% rape you just endured.

02:57:55,170 --> 02:58:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, and I mean, there's probably other dimensions about how traumatic it is, how difficult it is to recover from, all that kind of stuff.

02:58:02,434 --> 02:58:03,710
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I mean, like people.

02:58:04,034 --> 02:58:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  It's a dangerous thing to assign a word to an experience.

02:58:07,266 --> 02:58:10,654
SPEAKER_0:  Like even or to a relationship, like saying a toxic relationship.

02:58:11,458 --> 02:58:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. That can completely destroy your perception of that relationship.

02:58:15,394 --> 02:58:22,302
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, absolutely. I remember this was the case with my childhood like I talked about being very abusive but I've talked about how like there was a good amount of meaning there so that

02:58:22,530 --> 02:58:29,758
SPEAKER_1:  I didn't process it as abusive at the time. I remember after I got out of that house and that culture, people would tell me, Oh, your child was really abusive.

02:58:30,114 --> 02:58:32,158
SPEAKER_1:  And I was really confused by that because it's.

02:58:32,386 --> 02:58:34,942
SPEAKER_1:  total recontextualization of that narrative.

02:58:35,170 --> 02:58:43,358
SPEAKER_1:  It's like the things that I went through were not, you know, good and virtuous and had meaning, but rather these were like the result of, you know, parents who didn't like love you enough or something.

02:58:43,842 --> 02:58:48,894
SPEAKER_1:  And even though the concrete things that happened to me did not change.

02:58:49,122 --> 02:58:50,430
SPEAKER_1:  Like, no facts shifted.

02:58:50,850 --> 02:59:00,510
SPEAKER_1:  The fact that like the interpretation of the facts shifted caused me quite a bit of distress for a long time. I was like, oh my God, I'm a traumatized, like abused person, like I went through abuse of childhood.

02:59:00,770 --> 02:59:02,654
SPEAKER_1:  And it was really hard for me, it made it worse.

02:59:03,074 --> 02:59:05,406
SPEAKER_1:  Like it's crazy the power that terms have.

02:59:06,370 --> 02:59:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

02:59:06,978 --> 02:59:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  We didn't talk about this, but how did you begin to overcome?

02:59:11,170 --> 02:59:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  uh, the, the trauma of your childhood, you mentioned LSD, so drugs are part of it. Like what was them? Just a mental journey of that.

02:59:18,242 --> 02:59:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  I was doing LSD quite a lot when I was 21.

02:59:21,314 --> 02:59:24,094
SPEAKER_0:  What's it like? By the way, I've never done it all this years. What's it?

02:59:24,194 --> 02:59:25,342
SPEAKER_1:  Very difficult to describe.

02:59:25,666 --> 02:59:26,430
SPEAKER_1:  because it's like...

02:59:26,978 --> 02:59:28,030
SPEAKER_1:  like it changes.

02:59:28,258 --> 02:59:28,670
SPEAKER_1:  sort of.

02:59:29,218 --> 02:59:32,286
SPEAKER_1:  Aspects about your environment that are invisible to you because they're so stable?

02:59:33,218 --> 02:59:35,902
SPEAKER_0:  Is it like if you can compare it to like psilocybin?

02:59:36,386 --> 02:59:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  Is it very different? Oh yeah.

02:59:37,826 --> 02:59:43,870
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, it's like similar. I forgot that you did shrooms. Yeah. Okay. That you probably know, you know, like the kind of shift that you have from cyberd late taken out and whole losing older on cyberd

02:59:44,546 --> 02:59:46,654
SPEAKER_1:  Roughly similar. It's like more clear, I think.

02:59:46,978 --> 02:59:50,558
SPEAKER_1:  Shrooms is more like embodied, but LSD is much more intellectual for me.

02:59:50,978 --> 02:59:54,910
SPEAKER_1:  It strikes different people differently. I prefer shrooms a lot. I'm sorry, LSD. I prefer LSD a lot.

02:59:55,682 --> 02:59:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  Why is it not popularly taken?

02:59:58,146 --> 03:00:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  there seems to be a negative connotation to LSD, because an teen used to try to Watching Movie strategy instead

03:00:01,410 --> 03:00:02,046
SPEAKER_0:  It seems to be.

03:00:02,402 --> 03:00:07,779
SPEAKER_0:  potentially have like a destructive effect. Like maybe dosage is more difficult to get right or something like that.

03:00:07,779 --> 03:00:12,414
SPEAKER_1:  So this is exactly, so actually a long time ago did a survey on streams versus LSD. socialite.com, and we've also been looking at sides people.

03:00:12,802 --> 03:00:18,206
SPEAKER_1:  And people had slightly stronger experiences on LSD overall, I remember, but rated the experiences about is equally good.

03:00:18,882 --> 03:00:19,230
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:00:19,618 --> 03:00:22,174
SPEAKER_1:  I think people like shrimps because it feels more natural, quote, unquote.

03:00:22,434 --> 03:00:26,878
SPEAKER_1:  But I think if you fed somebody a shroom and actually had the LSD molecule in it, they would have a...

03:00:27,138 --> 03:00:30,462
SPEAKER_1:  they would think it felt very natural. But that's besides the point. I think...

03:00:30,818 --> 03:00:35,390
SPEAKER_1:  I think people get kind of incoherent on LSD in a way that feels really alienating.

03:00:36,034 --> 03:00:42,654
SPEAKER_1:  I consider my LSD use very heavy to be one of the best decisions I ever made in my life, but I definitely was incoherent for a lot of it.

03:00:43,234 --> 03:00:46,366
SPEAKER_1:  Like talking about like we're all one consciousness. Everything is love, man.

03:00:46,786 --> 03:00:47,911
SPEAKER_1:  You know, and people are like.

03:00:47,911 --> 03:00:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  that incoherent.

03:00:48,802 --> 03:00:49,470
SPEAKER_1:  Hehehe

03:00:49,730 --> 03:00:51,294
SPEAKER_1:  So I think it's not incoherent.

03:00:51,618 --> 03:00:53,598
SPEAKER_1:  But if you go around saying everything is love.

03:00:53,954 --> 03:00:55,902
SPEAKER_1:  People are like, this guy's kind of blasted out of his mind.

03:00:56,130 --> 03:00:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  Rep Frei

03:00:56,834 --> 03:00:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  This podcast.

03:00:59,010 --> 03:01:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  is basically your LSD driven.

03:01:01,762 --> 03:01:04,638
SPEAKER_0:  for a bunch of episodes. Yeah, I get this for sure.

03:01:04,930 --> 03:01:07,774
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, well, it's not just about love, but it's a-

03:01:09,122 --> 03:01:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  It's about like talking in that way about reality, about the world, yeah.

03:01:13,442 --> 03:01:28,254
SPEAKER_1:  It's like overfitting. The narratives that you make about the world become really vivid. And so you pattern match just really aggressively. Like everything is connected and you come up with these explanations for things. And I think I was very fortunate. So I like this theory about psychedelics where you either believe construct or you don't.

03:01:28,578 --> 03:01:30,334
SPEAKER_1:  So you take psychedelics and it's sort of.

03:01:30,978 --> 03:01:32,894
SPEAKER_1:  burns away a lot of your belief structure.

03:01:33,346 --> 03:01:34,430
SPEAKER_1:  And

03:01:34,786 --> 03:01:39,262
SPEAKER_1:  Sometimes this happens and then you're like, I need to invent something to fill in the gaps.

03:01:39,490 --> 03:01:45,950
SPEAKER_1:  So you're like, okay, I think that maybe time is an illusion. So I must now believe that like, we're actually in a time loop.

03:01:46,178 --> 03:01:47,582
SPEAKER_1:  or like time travel as possible.

03:01:47,906 --> 03:01:50,878
SPEAKER_1:  So you experience time differently, and then you come up with a different belief about time.

03:01:51,394 --> 03:02:05,310
SPEAKER_1:  Whereas other people don't do this belief construction at all, like you experience time differently and you sort of let yourself not have a belief. You're not like, okay, I mean, you're not developing any beliefs about time in its absence. You're just simply experiencing the absence of the concept of time.

03:02:05,666 --> 03:02:13,278
SPEAKER_1:  And so I don't have a lot of data to back this up in my anecdotal experience because I've tripped a lot of people People either tend to believe construct or they don't

03:02:13,794 --> 03:02:17,150
SPEAKER_1:  and people who do not believe construct seem to get more out of their LSD trips.

03:02:17,378 --> 03:02:20,606
SPEAKER_1:  So if you can let a belief go without building anything in its absence.

03:02:20,898 --> 03:02:26,238
SPEAKER_1:  it's much more beneficial for you. And I think I just, for some reason happen to have some brain that's constructed where I don't.

03:02:26,562 --> 03:02:26,878
SPEAKER_1:  it.

03:02:27,490 --> 03:02:28,766
SPEAKER_1:  belief construction at all.

03:02:29,346 --> 03:02:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  So that's really interesting. I believe construction is negative.

03:02:35,106 --> 03:02:37,731
SPEAKER_0:  Is it necessarily negative? Can you elaborate on that a little bit?

03:02:37,731 --> 03:02:39,518
SPEAKER_1:  I mean belief construction in a way that's like

03:02:40,322 --> 03:02:40,670
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

03:02:41,506 --> 03:02:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  not like playing with frames, but rather committing to a different frame.

03:02:45,858 --> 03:02:54,654
SPEAKER_1:  So I like being able to play with ideas and be like, let's look at it this way or that way. That's awesome. But if you're like, okay, you know what? I took LSE and now I absolutely believe cops are outside.

03:02:55,266 --> 03:03:02,814
SPEAKER_1:  And you're like, dude, no, you're just like, you can't shift out of that, right? Your brain like needs to fill in the gap. You're not allowed to have a gap. So you're not allowed to be flexible.

03:03:03,330 --> 03:03:09,705
SPEAKER_1:  And again, I don't think this is like a personal failing. I think this is like literally probably genetic or like physical thing that's causing this.

03:03:09,705 --> 03:03:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  But do you think there's possible beliefs that are like...

03:03:12,290 --> 03:03:14,782
SPEAKER_0:  in lightning that you can stick to like find a frame.

03:03:15,586 --> 03:03:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  that like...

03:03:18,306 --> 03:03:23,422
SPEAKER_0:  I guess if you don't believe construct, then you're escaping your previous beliefs. Aren't you doing like just some.

03:03:23,842 --> 03:03:25,182
SPEAKER_0:  You're picking up a bigger frame.

03:03:25,666 --> 03:03:26,791
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I think you're taking...

03:03:26,791 --> 03:03:28,062
SPEAKER_1:  your release as object.

03:03:28,450 --> 03:03:30,526
SPEAKER_1:  As opposed to being subject to them. Ah, got it.

03:03:30,754 --> 03:03:39,253
SPEAKER_0:  Got it, got it, got it, got it. And some of that I guess is genetic and there's these categories of people, there's two categories that experience LSD in different ways. And you're one of those that are able to just let go.

03:03:39,253 --> 03:03:45,758
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I just think I had a good reaction and I think a lot of maybe the negative stereotype of LSD comes from people who are belief constructing

03:03:46,146 --> 03:03:55,518
SPEAKER_1:  or carry the belief constructing off of the LSD trip. So you take LSD and you're like, ah, I'm believing these insane things. And people from the outside see that and they're like, oh my God, this person took LSD and became stupid.

03:03:56,066 --> 03:03:56,830
SPEAKER_1:  It's very scary.

03:03:57,794 --> 03:03:59,614
SPEAKER_0:  What's frame control?

03:03:59,874 --> 03:04:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  because that has been at the core of your trauma.

03:04:02,946 --> 03:04:05,310
SPEAKER_0:  at the core of your upbringing. What's frame control?

03:04:05,698 --> 03:04:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  And also, sorry, frame control in general.

03:04:08,930 --> 03:04:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  because that's...

03:04:09,986 --> 03:04:11,646
SPEAKER_0:  part of human interaction.

03:04:12,258 --> 03:04:17,630
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, fame control is like a way of manipulating somebody else that is none.

03:04:17,922 --> 03:04:18,942
SPEAKER_1:  uh, obvious.

03:04:19,426 --> 03:04:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  So there's a negative contention to that usually.

03:04:21,666 --> 03:04:40,295
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean, I think maybe I chose the term kind of poorly because I think to some degree, people are always a little bit manipulating each other, but I think it's generally obvious. Like for example, if I disagree with you, I want you to believe what I believe. But this is like an obvious thing that is like visible between it's like an object on the table. It's like, here's the box where I want you to believe what.

03:04:40,295 --> 03:04:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  the disagreement box.

03:04:42,050 --> 03:04:58,014
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so Dicker's Dig, right, like we're under a shared context where we understand that like we're trying to move each other. This is chill to me. I think this is cool. We just all the time and it's important. But frame control is the kind of thing where you are trying carefully to obscure the existence of that box.

03:04:58,306 --> 03:05:02,878
SPEAKER_1:  You're like, oh, the thing that I'm doing, I'm like using tactics to try to influence.

03:05:03,202 --> 03:05:07,678
SPEAKER_1:  what your reality is without us being both aware that this is what I'm doing.

03:05:08,258 --> 03:05:09,982
SPEAKER_0:  I've been assuming you're doing that the whole time.

03:05:12,002 --> 03:05:13,406
SPEAKER_1:  Oh my god.

03:05:14,114 --> 03:05:17,489
SPEAKER_1:  I have to like figure out how to read your facial expressions. I'm still learning.ывен.

03:05:17,489 --> 03:05:19,646
SPEAKER_0:  There's not. You don't have any? You got a

03:05:20,066 --> 03:05:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not even like a Chad GPT, I'm like GPT-1.

03:05:23,266 --> 03:05:25,310
SPEAKER_0:  with my facial expressions, like it's kind of off.

03:05:25,666 --> 03:05:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  Like this doesn't seem to match emotions, but it's kind of our intelligence seemingly.

03:05:29,570 --> 03:05:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  but definitely not conscious.

03:05:31,074 --> 03:05:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  Anyway, so like negative connotation.

03:05:34,114 --> 03:05:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  manipulating.

03:05:35,842 --> 03:05:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  not being honest.

03:05:37,122 --> 03:05:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  about the actual intentions of the.

03:05:40,706 --> 03:05:43,331
SPEAKER_0:  of how you'd like to control the conversation.

03:05:43,331 --> 03:05:57,758
SPEAKER_1:  I think there might be a naive version of interpreting this where you're just like, oh, I'm trying to subtly get you to believe like, oh, do you really think that's bad though? But this is not quite what I mean. I mean, there's a couple of concrete things that are signs of frame control. One of them is pushing the painful update button.

03:05:58,146 --> 03:05:59,678
SPEAKER_1:  which is this thing where it's like...

03:06:00,258 --> 03:06:00,574
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

03:06:00,834 --> 03:06:14,654
SPEAKER_1:  hey, if you learn this, it's going to be really painful. The truth is painful. And if you're realizing this thing about yourself, it's gonna hurt, and this is a sign that you're heading in the right direction. So if you frame all pain as a sign of virtue,

03:06:14,978 --> 03:06:18,014
SPEAKER_1:  and this means that pain that's resulting as damage.

03:06:18,242 --> 03:06:19,262
SPEAKER_1:  is something you're going to ignore.

03:06:20,098 --> 03:06:29,182
SPEAKER_1:  So it's like this is a common like cults, right? This is for your own good. Oh, you know, you face of brave truth about yourself that you're like not quite as wise as I am.

03:06:29,602 --> 03:06:34,302
SPEAKER_1:  When really your brain might be trying to tell you protected things or like another one is like finger trap beliefs

03:06:34,658 --> 03:06:39,646
SPEAKER_1:  where the belief is constructed in such a way that doubting it lends proof to the belief.

03:06:40,322 --> 03:06:46,302
SPEAKER_1:  A very common example is Satan. Like, the Christians are like, you know, Satan is going to try to make you doubt him.

03:06:46,594 --> 03:06:49,886
SPEAKER_1:  the existence of. He's going to so doubt, like maybe he's not actually real.

03:06:50,338 --> 03:06:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  And so if you believe in Satan and then you're like, okay.

03:06:52,898 --> 03:07:03,294
SPEAKER_1:  now I'm having doubts, like maybe he isn't real. This is like, oh, this is exactly what I was taught to expect, like I am doubting this belief because I was told, because like this is what Satan does and has taken as evidence for it.

03:07:03,618 --> 03:07:05,726
SPEAKER_1:  So like the attempt to move away from the belief.

03:07:06,242 --> 03:07:10,974
SPEAKER_1:  like rebounds on you and like causes you to be more embedded inside of the belief. Yeah.

03:07:11,298 --> 03:07:13,982
SPEAKER_1:  So it's like techniques like these, like very subtle things.

03:07:14,242 --> 03:07:17,470
SPEAKER_1:  where being inside of the system sort of just self-reinforces the system.

03:07:17,954 --> 03:07:19,358
SPEAKER_1:  is what I consider to be frame control.

03:07:19,970 --> 03:07:20,286
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:07:20,930 --> 03:07:24,094
SPEAKER_0:  Have you met people that are really good at this kind of frame control?

03:07:24,930 --> 03:07:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, yeah.

03:07:26,306 --> 03:07:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  Definitely. You're saying that your father was like that?

03:07:30,242 --> 03:07:32,638
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, to be fair, I'm not sure he was good at it because I was a kid.

03:07:33,250 --> 03:07:36,958
SPEAKER_1:  I think he's probably not very good at it actually, but when you're a child.

03:07:37,314 --> 03:07:39,806
SPEAKER_1:  being raised in a house where he works from home and you're homeschooled.

03:07:40,290 --> 03:07:40,702
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

03:07:40,962 --> 03:07:42,430
SPEAKER_1:  It's just kind of what's going to happen.

03:07:42,786 --> 03:07:45,598
SPEAKER_1:  And to be fair, I do think that like strong frame control is quite rare.

03:07:45,986 --> 03:07:50,878
SPEAKER_1:  I don't think most people are kind of doing something like this, but not nearly to the degree that gives me the ick.

03:07:51,554 --> 03:07:58,321
SPEAKER_1:  I've met maybe like five or six people, I think, who I really don't like because of those very subtle things that they're doing.

03:07:58,321 --> 03:07:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  also.

03:07:59,170 --> 03:08:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  I'm starting to kind of understand.

03:08:01,730 --> 03:08:03,038
SPEAKER_0:  that there is people who are.

03:08:03,970 --> 03:08:06,846
SPEAKER_0:  narcissists and sociopaths and psychopaths out there.

03:08:07,170 --> 03:08:08,734
SPEAKER_0: Commentator One.

03:08:10,050 --> 03:08:11,838
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not even sure if people like that.

03:08:12,162 --> 03:08:14,270
SPEAKER_0:  because I think they get good at frame control.

03:08:15,650 --> 03:08:17,694
SPEAKER_0:  but I don't know if they're aware they're doing it.

03:08:18,274 --> 03:08:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  Oh yeah.

03:08:18,914 --> 03:08:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  Which makes me also nervous about myself. Like, am I doing frame control?

03:08:24,258 --> 03:08:29,054
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, that's one of the big things. It's like, typically people, you can't think about incentive.

03:08:29,698 --> 03:08:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  Like you can't think about, oh, is this person trying to do it or not?

03:08:32,226 --> 03:08:34,567
SPEAKER_1:  That's like not the quite, not the way. You have to look at what.

03:08:34,567 --> 03:08:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  the effects. Pragmatically looking at the effects. And then you also have to do that with yourself when you're having interactions with others.

03:08:40,802 --> 03:08:45,566
SPEAKER_1:  It's like very much like, are you like, how much space are you making for the other person's reality here?

03:08:46,114 --> 03:08:49,246
SPEAKER_1:  Like, are you giving power to the other person?

03:08:49,538 --> 03:08:52,862
SPEAKER_1:  because a big aspect of frame control is you're carefully rerouting the power to yourself.

03:08:53,602 --> 03:08:59,998
SPEAKER_1:  You're like, I am the person who knows. I'd like you're having pain in your beliefs because you're updating towards the things that I believe.

03:09:00,418 --> 03:09:02,270
SPEAKER_1:  Like it's just like a gravity well.

03:09:02,498 --> 03:09:11,006
SPEAKER_1:  But if you're setting up the gravity well of your interactions, such that you're making sure you're giving the other person power over the shared reality you inhabit, I think it's a really good sign that you're not doing frame control.

03:09:12,418 --> 03:09:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  if you're making room for them.

03:09:15,522 --> 03:09:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  unless we're talking about embed.

03:09:17,346 --> 03:09:21,471
SPEAKER_0:  then it's all general relativity from there black holes and stuff

03:09:21,471 --> 03:09:22,971
SPEAKER_1:  Frame control, bed frame control.

03:09:22,971 --> 03:09:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  Breast frame control.

03:09:25,058 --> 03:09:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  Um

03:09:25,890 --> 03:09:29,063
SPEAKER_0:  It took me a long time to get a bed frame, just, I'm saying.

03:09:29,063 --> 03:09:29,502
SPEAKER_1:  No.

03:09:29,730 --> 03:09:30,782
SPEAKER_1:  But you wear a suit though.

03:09:32,994 --> 03:09:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, yeah. Uh, so frame control on the streets, no frame in the, in the sheets. I don't know. I don't know what the funny thing is to say.

03:09:40,578 --> 03:09:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  There you have it.

03:09:41,826 --> 03:09:42,206
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:09:42,530 --> 03:09:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  So.

03:09:43,266 --> 03:09:46,174
SPEAKER_0:  The LSD helped you escape the frame.

03:09:46,882 --> 03:09:48,190
SPEAKER_0:  of a

03:09:48,994 --> 03:09:51,710
SPEAKER_0:  Can you like elaborate what was the frame that was?

03:09:53,922 --> 03:09:54,494
SPEAKER_0:  holding you.

03:09:54,850 --> 03:09:55,294
SPEAKER_0:  back.

03:09:56,802 --> 03:09:57,342
SPEAKER_0:  from.

03:09:57,986 --> 03:10:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  Like the frame constructed by your childhood experience that was holding you back.

03:10:01,762 --> 03:10:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  as an intellectual, as a thinker, as a free being in this world.

03:10:06,146 --> 03:10:07,166
SPEAKER_1:  I was really fucked up.

03:10:07,842 --> 03:10:11,806
SPEAKER_1:  Like after I left home and I absorbed the external narrative that I had been abused.

03:10:12,706 --> 03:10:20,958
SPEAKER_1:  Technically it's true. I'm not saying I wasn't, but like I absorbed this narrative and I just remember how to like this burning coals in my chest at all times. Like if I had a-

03:10:21,314 --> 03:10:26,238
SPEAKER_1:  I'd call out of my factory work when Father's Day happened because I was spending the whole day sobbing while everybody's talking about their fathers.

03:10:26,818 --> 03:10:32,670
SPEAKER_1:  Like, I was really messed up. And it's because I held this important thing, this idea, this frame.

03:10:33,122 --> 03:10:35,038
SPEAKER_1:  that I had been deeply wronged. Look.

03:10:35,298 --> 03:10:36,670
SPEAKER_1:  there is a correct way of being.

03:10:36,898 --> 03:10:40,094
SPEAKER_1:  and the world had violated that. Something should not have happened.

03:10:40,450 --> 03:10:42,206
SPEAKER_1:  Like my father should have loved me.

03:10:42,530 --> 03:10:43,774
SPEAKER_1:  And it was like this, this like.

03:10:44,354 --> 03:10:44,670
SPEAKER_1:  Like.

03:10:45,186 --> 03:10:48,990
SPEAKER_1:  the shearing in the nature of reality, and that was really agonizing to have.

03:10:49,666 --> 03:10:50,014
SPEAKER_1:  and

03:10:50,466 --> 03:10:58,718
SPEAKER_1:  LSD really messes with frames a lot. It takes like what you think is normal and really screws with it. And I did an LSD like several times before, but there's one LSD trip.

03:10:59,202 --> 03:11:00,734
SPEAKER_1:  where I went through.

03:11:01,026 --> 03:11:07,102
SPEAKER_1:  my entire childhood in my head, because LST really makes your memories quite vivid. Like anything you visualize, it's like you're in it.

03:11:07,330 --> 03:11:12,510
SPEAKER_1:  And so I just went in very carefully, deliberately went and remembered every single memory that I could have.

03:11:12,866 --> 03:11:15,102
SPEAKER_1:  that was really painful for me. Like the times that-

03:11:15,458 --> 03:11:19,966
SPEAKER_1:  I lost friends and all the things I valued and like being broken because like my parents would-

03:11:20,194 --> 03:11:21,406
SPEAKER_1:  especially my dad would refer to like.

03:11:21,698 --> 03:11:23,838
SPEAKER_1:  breaking me like explicitly, we're gonna break your will.

03:11:24,130 --> 03:11:27,806
SPEAKER_1:  And so all these times where I was like, they had successfully broken my will over and over.

03:11:28,130 --> 03:11:29,022
SPEAKER_1:  I was just like...

03:11:29,474 --> 03:11:30,206
SPEAKER_1:  sobbing.

03:11:30,434 --> 03:11:31,742
SPEAKER_1:  tears streaming down my face.

03:11:32,162 --> 03:11:32,638
SPEAKER_1:  and then.

03:11:32,930 --> 03:11:35,550
SPEAKER_1:  I worked through my whole child, I got to the end.

03:11:35,874 --> 03:11:38,110
SPEAKER_1:  And I'm gonna tear up because every time I talk about this, it's just.

03:11:38,754 --> 03:11:41,246
SPEAKER_1:  like the sensation of like being free.

03:11:41,634 --> 03:11:43,518
SPEAKER_1:  from that for the first time.

03:11:44,738 --> 03:11:47,134
SPEAKER_1:  So incredible. Like, I remember-

03:11:47,714 --> 03:11:49,022
SPEAKER_1:  being outside of my house and-

03:11:49,890 --> 03:11:51,038
SPEAKER_1:  being able to like.

03:11:51,970 --> 03:11:54,558
SPEAKER_1:  go where I wanted and think what I wanted and-

03:11:55,266 --> 03:11:55,646
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

03:11:55,874 --> 03:11:58,558
SPEAKER_1:  It was just so blissful and I...

03:11:58,914 --> 03:12:00,510
SPEAKER_1:  was soaked in this gratitude.

03:12:00,770 --> 03:12:01,470
SPEAKER_1:  on this trip.

03:12:01,954 --> 03:12:02,270
SPEAKER_1:  Just.

03:12:03,490 --> 03:12:08,126
SPEAKER_1:  like vibrating with complete joy for everything. Like I was just looking around like I could touch anything.

03:12:08,482 --> 03:12:09,662
SPEAKER_1:  I could cry if I wanted to.

03:12:09,890 --> 03:12:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  I wasn't allowed to cry. I was allowed to be depressed. I got depressed as a child and my parents were like, if you keep being depressed, we're going to like force you to scrub the whole house.

03:12:18,082 --> 03:12:21,054
SPEAKER_1:  Like just like the ability to have a feeling.

03:12:21,666 --> 03:12:22,078
SPEAKER_1:  Oh.

03:12:22,594 --> 03:12:28,734
SPEAKER_1:  was so thrilling and I was so grateful for this. I was like, I would do anything to give this experience to someone else or do anything.

03:12:29,410 --> 03:12:31,422
SPEAKER_1:  even if it was like putting them through what I went through.

03:12:31,874 --> 03:12:34,686
SPEAKER_1:  And then like with that realization, I was like, Oh, it was worth it.

03:12:35,106 --> 03:12:37,854
SPEAKER_1:  The thing that I went through was worth it for this. I would do it again.

03:12:38,370 --> 03:12:40,126
SPEAKER_1:  to be able to have this.

03:12:40,482 --> 03:12:43,294
SPEAKER_1:  deep gratitude for what I have now. And in that-

03:12:43,714 --> 03:12:44,862
SPEAKER_1:  shifted the meaning frame.

03:12:45,090 --> 03:12:48,542
SPEAKER_1:  Because before the meaning had been like something had sheared, something shouldn't have happened.

03:12:48,962 --> 03:12:50,974
SPEAKER_1:  But now it was like the exact right thing had happened.

03:12:51,266 --> 03:12:52,798
SPEAKER_1:  It's almost a gift. Yeah.

03:12:53,250 --> 03:12:53,886
SPEAKER_1:  I was like, ah.

03:12:54,114 --> 03:12:55,358
SPEAKER_1:  I would not give up my childhood.

03:12:55,906 --> 03:12:56,510
SPEAKER_1:  I would do it again.

03:12:57,218 --> 03:12:58,343
SPEAKER_1:  And I believe that to this day.

03:12:58,343 --> 03:13:00,638
SPEAKER_0:  for the moment of discovering that freedom.

03:13:02,466 --> 03:13:05,662
SPEAKER_1:  Because everything now, my whole life, is in contrast to that.

03:13:06,594 --> 03:13:08,830
SPEAKER_1:  and it's awesome, it's fucking great.

03:13:09,186 --> 03:13:10,430
SPEAKER_1:  I'm really thrilled about it.

03:13:11,586 --> 03:13:12,190
SPEAKER_0:  Do.

03:13:12,962 --> 03:13:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  Is this the part of you that hates your father still?

03:13:17,122 --> 03:13:34,558
SPEAKER_1:  I don't want a relationship with anymore. After that, there was some forgiveness. I had this burning, I would have nightmares about him killing me or something. And after that, it kind of stopped. The fire in my chest went away permanently after that trip. It was so fast. It was like before I was fucked up. After that trip, I woke up the next day and I was clean.

03:13:34,850 --> 03:13:42,238
SPEAKER_1:  It was really severe. And I definitely don't want to be around him still. He still like triggers the fear in my body.

03:13:42,722 --> 03:13:46,814
SPEAKER_1:  but I don't have that hangup anymore. I'm like kinda, I'm over it. Like I've let go.

03:13:47,234 --> 03:13:53,278
SPEAKER_1:  He's his own person. Like, ultimately, he didn't get to decide who he was in the same way that I didn't get to decide who I was.

03:13:53,954 --> 03:13:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  So that's almost like a kind of at least intellectual forgiveness.

03:13:57,922 --> 03:13:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, for him. Yeah.

03:14:03,490 --> 03:14:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  And that trip just took you through your whole...

03:14:07,042 --> 03:14:08,958
SPEAKER_0:  Were you alone by the way, when you were doing the trip?

03:14:09,346 --> 03:14:14,814
SPEAKER_1:  I had roommates, but the trip was mostly alone. I had somebody else who was like sitting in the room, but they weren't interacting with me.

03:14:15,074 --> 03:14:16,222
SPEAKER_0:  see you're sitting there.

03:14:16,450 --> 03:14:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  experiencing all of this. What's the timeline? Like how long does it take?

03:14:20,642 --> 03:14:22,517
SPEAKER_0:  to go through your whole childhood.

03:14:22,517 --> 03:14:28,446
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, time's really messed up when you do that. I was listening to the soundtrack of The Fountain, which is excellent.

03:14:28,930 --> 03:14:30,526
SPEAKER_1:  This is about a lot when I did LSD.

03:14:31,330 --> 03:14:32,766
SPEAKER_1:  I know it's probably just a couple hours.

03:14:34,338 --> 03:14:35,646
SPEAKER_0:  That's amazing. I mean, it's like...

03:14:36,642 --> 03:14:37,630
SPEAKER_0:  It would be odd.

03:14:38,594 --> 03:14:41,086
SPEAKER_0:  It's just like a vivid experience of your childhood.

03:14:41,538 --> 03:14:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  moment by moment, trauma by trauma.

03:14:44,386 --> 03:14:49,214
SPEAKER_1:  And it's good to experience it purely. Like it just is what it is. It just is grief. Like it is.

03:14:49,698 --> 03:14:50,366
SPEAKER_1:  BLOSS

03:14:51,202 --> 03:14:53,246
SPEAKER_1:  and you just are in it without having to.

03:14:53,506 --> 03:14:54,590
SPEAKER_1:  make it be anything.

03:14:57,186 --> 03:14:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  And it's so interesting that you can.

03:14:59,586 --> 03:15:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, work through that. So for a lot of us.

03:15:02,434 --> 03:15:06,014
SPEAKER_0:  For a lot of human beings, childhood is full of those kind of mini...

03:15:07,330 --> 03:15:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  traumas.

03:15:08,322 --> 03:15:10,654
SPEAKER_0:  big or small and like working through that.

03:15:11,042 --> 03:15:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  It feels like what a lot of life is about is trying to work through that.

03:15:14,882 --> 03:15:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  And it feels like you have to kind of relive it.

03:15:17,474 --> 03:15:19,230
SPEAKER_0:  I guess that's what therapy is about, impart.

03:15:19,906 --> 03:15:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  be able to vocalize it.ting

03:15:22,082 --> 03:15:27,070
SPEAKER_1:  This is why I feel really confused about the concept of trauma. People use this word so much, like are you traumatized?

03:15:27,394 --> 03:15:34,238
SPEAKER_1:  And I understand why, this is why I feel confused about it, but part of me is like, I wonder if by using that term, we're creating the trauma in people.

03:15:34,754 --> 03:15:37,534
SPEAKER_1:  They were using the frame where the thing that happened to you was not supposed to happen.

03:15:38,722 --> 03:15:45,278
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, maybe there needs to be a different frame. No, I agree with you totally. I just, I've made friends with and talked to.

03:15:45,570 --> 03:15:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  This guy named Paul Conti, he wrote a book on trauma. He's an incredible, brilliant psychiatrist.

03:15:52,098 --> 03:15:53,822
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, he probably agrees with you.

03:15:54,050 --> 03:15:55,198
SPEAKER_0:  That's cool. I should read it.

03:15:55,490 --> 03:15:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, you should.

03:15:57,058 --> 03:15:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe even talk to, he's a fascinating human being.

03:15:59,490 --> 03:16:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  The

03:16:00,930 --> 03:16:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  interested in the.

03:16:03,938 --> 03:16:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  A psychiatrist perspective is really interesting because it's a

03:16:07,522 --> 03:16:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  You've been doing kind of an in-person survey.

03:16:11,330 --> 03:16:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  because you've done so many patients.

03:16:13,474 --> 03:16:13,822
SPEAKER_0:  Like.

03:16:14,274 --> 03:16:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  Like he's...

03:16:15,458 --> 03:16:16,830
SPEAKER_0:  Like just talking to him.

03:16:17,506 --> 03:16:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  is fascinating because like.

03:16:20,546 --> 03:16:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  If I describe my experience or somebody else's experience.

03:16:23,586 --> 03:16:26,878
SPEAKER_0:  I could see his brain mapping it in interesting ways.

03:16:27,362 --> 03:16:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  to the tens of thousands of like.

03:16:30,178 --> 03:16:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  data points he has in his head and it's like.

03:16:33,186 --> 03:16:36,830
SPEAKER_0:  Of course, that's what doctors do, but it's cool as the doctors basically.

03:16:37,218 --> 03:16:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  the doctor of the mind.

03:16:38,946 --> 03:16:39,710
SPEAKER_0:  And, um...

03:16:40,002 --> 03:16:41,086
SPEAKER_1:  to have like an actual.

03:16:41,826 --> 03:16:43,701
SPEAKER_1:  like qualitative data. And be able to.

03:16:43,701 --> 03:16:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, that's where the poetic stuff comes in. Ultimately as a psychiatrist you're exploring the human mind

03:16:49,506 --> 03:16:51,454
SPEAKER_0:  with a bit of a sort of romantic element.

03:16:52,450 --> 03:16:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  You can't be really systematic about it.

03:16:54,882 --> 03:16:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  But it does seem like...

03:16:56,898 --> 03:16:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  frame or not.

03:16:58,626 --> 03:17:00,030
SPEAKER_0:  be able to just talk.

03:17:00,258 --> 03:17:02,046
SPEAKER_0:  through the experiences you had.

03:17:02,498 --> 03:17:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  Mm-hmm.

03:17:03,010 --> 03:17:05,886
SPEAKER_1:  It's really powerful. What about it is appealing? Is it just like-

03:17:06,210 --> 03:17:08,286
SPEAKER_1:  being able to revisit it with new eyes.

03:17:08,386 --> 03:17:11,070
SPEAKER_0:  No, I don't know exactly. It just seems to work for people.

03:17:11,426 --> 03:17:13,630
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know if it's appealing. It just seems like-

03:17:14,530 --> 03:17:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  almost acknowledging to yourself that things happen.

03:17:19,618 --> 03:17:20,062
SPEAKER_0:  Um,

03:17:20,322 --> 03:17:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  Like I've said, I think I've said this before, my brother who I love very much, tried to set me on fire a few times.

03:17:27,010 --> 03:17:31,198
SPEAKER_0:  And I think to me it's funny, but I wonder if I didn't talk about it.

03:17:31,778 --> 03:17:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  Like if that would be traumatic, maybe like talking and laughing about it.

03:17:35,458 --> 03:17:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  Because it was traumatic to me at the time.

03:17:37,218 --> 03:17:41,246
SPEAKER_0:  I see. I was like, I love you, why are you setting me on fire? That's what kids do when they're like, yeah.

03:17:41,634 --> 03:17:41,982
SPEAKER_0:  You

03:17:42,434 --> 03:17:42,910
SPEAKER_0:

03:17:43,266 --> 03:17:47,998
SPEAKER_0:  I was like, I was whatever, five, this is what boys do. They're crazy.

03:17:48,418 --> 03:17:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

03:17:49,986 --> 03:17:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  It makes total sense. It's probably funny from his perspective.

03:17:54,082 --> 03:17:59,934
SPEAKER_0:  But yeah, I wonder. I want to bring that to the surface of that. That helps. So maybe LSD allows you to.

03:18:00,386 --> 03:18:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  or different drugs depending on the person allows you to more vividly bring it to the surface little bit.

03:18:05,314 --> 03:18:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  And then.

03:18:06,402 --> 03:18:09,054
SPEAKER_0:  Depending on your genetics, be able to find a better frame.

03:18:09,954 --> 03:18:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  Mm.

03:18:10,914 --> 03:18:11,710
SPEAKER_0:  That's fascinating.

03:18:12,002 --> 03:18:13,694
SPEAKER_0:  Human mind is freaking fascinating.

03:18:16,386 --> 03:18:16,702
SPEAKER_0:  Alright.

03:18:18,530 --> 03:18:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  What's romantic to you, by the way?

03:18:21,410 --> 03:18:23,838
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not a big romance person, what is.

03:18:24,418 --> 03:18:24,894
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

03:18:25,218 --> 03:18:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  So you're not like, so to you romantic is like.

03:18:28,002 --> 03:18:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  Objective Analysis

03:18:30,146 --> 03:18:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  of the interactions between humans.

03:18:32,514 --> 03:18:33,150
SPEAKER_1:  a little bit.

03:18:33,474 --> 03:18:36,286
SPEAKER_1:  Like I do find kind of the survey process that I did to be romantic.

03:18:37,122 --> 03:18:42,014
SPEAKER_1:  When I the guy that I asked out who I'm still dating I was like, hey you squirtle how my survey you want to like

03:18:42,594 --> 03:18:47,390
SPEAKER_1:  go eat food or something. And his response was like, you want to try doing three days in an Airbnb?

03:18:47,970 --> 03:18:49,150
SPEAKER_1:  As our first date, I was like.

03:18:49,410 --> 03:18:50,814
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, and that was romantic.

03:18:51,042 --> 03:18:55,569
SPEAKER_1:  Like the bold leap into a really intense date.

03:18:55,569 --> 03:18:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  I think you mentioned something also.

03:18:59,586 --> 03:19:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  Um,

03:19:00,866 --> 03:19:02,398
SPEAKER_0:  It must have been a tweet or something like that.

03:19:02,722 --> 03:19:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  Where...

03:19:03,970 --> 03:19:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  If you...

03:19:05,378 --> 03:19:07,838
SPEAKER_0:  If people want you to show up to a thing

03:19:09,314 --> 03:19:11,678
SPEAKER_0:  Give like the time, the location.

03:19:12,290 --> 03:19:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  The dress code.

03:19:14,882 --> 03:19:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  and...

03:19:16,610 --> 03:19:20,670
SPEAKER_0:  not no pressure for you to be there, but like show up if you want.

03:19:21,090 --> 03:19:21,406
SPEAKER_0:  Mm.

03:19:21,858 --> 03:19:23,966
SPEAKER_0:  That was their specification. That's a great memory, yeah.

03:19:24,226 --> 03:19:30,206
SPEAKER_0:  And then I think you said that you did that for like some castle in south, south of France. I did, yeah.

03:19:31,010 --> 03:19:32,254
SPEAKER_1:  That was in my early funnies.

03:19:32,514 --> 03:19:36,990
SPEAKER_1:  People, my friends at home were taking prediction markets on whether or not I was going to get abducted and killed.

03:19:37,794 --> 03:19:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, what was that like? I mean, what, what, um...

03:19:41,602 --> 03:19:44,062
SPEAKER_0:  You've traveled quite a bit. Do you take these giant risks?

03:19:44,514 --> 03:19:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  What's with that?

03:19:45,570 --> 03:19:48,830
SPEAKER_1:  I think I used to more when I was younger with the traveling. I think I'm a little traveled out now.

03:19:50,018 --> 03:19:52,542
SPEAKER_1:  Like my first one, I moved out of Idaho for the first time, I moved to Australia.

03:19:52,994 --> 03:19:54,750
SPEAKER_1:  I just kind of yeeted myself across the globe.

03:19:55,682 --> 03:19:58,078
SPEAKER_1:  Which verb did you just use?...

03:19:59,298 --> 03:20:01,598
SPEAKER_1:  like yeet to yeot, yeeted.

03:20:02,338 --> 03:20:02,686
SPEAKER_1:  Eat.

03:20:03,682 --> 03:20:07,807
SPEAKER_0:  So people do people, is this like slang? Is this like urban dictionary? Is this actual?

03:20:07,807 --> 03:20:12,126
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, you have to like feel into the word. Like if you take a thing and you just like curl it really hard

03:20:12,770 --> 03:20:14,974
SPEAKER_1:  She does not feel like a yeet motion.

03:20:15,650 --> 03:20:19,678
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, so you yeeted. So agressives across the globe.

03:20:19,906 --> 03:20:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  He didn't even stop in.

03:20:22,754 --> 03:20:24,510
SPEAKER_1:  I just hurled myself, yeah.

03:20:24,930 --> 03:20:30,974
SPEAKER_1:  I just kept yeeting myself in various places. And so at one point I was done, okay, Cupid, and somebody sent me a long message saying like you should...

03:20:31,586 --> 03:20:33,854
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know, I'm hopelessly hosting a castle.

03:20:34,210 --> 03:20:35,454
SPEAKER_1:  some people that I met.

03:20:36,002 --> 03:20:38,014
SPEAKER_1:  I have no idea who you are, but I just bought a plane ticket.

03:20:38,882 --> 03:20:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  I just want...

03:20:39,650 --> 03:20:42,750
SPEAKER_1:  I ended up dating that guy for years and...

03:20:43,170 --> 03:20:47,998
SPEAKER_1:  He changed my life quite a bit because he was very agent-y in the world and before that I wasn't agent-y.

03:20:48,578 --> 03:20:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  HNT like, uh...

03:20:50,690 --> 03:20:51,815
SPEAKER_0:  And can we?

03:20:51,815 --> 03:20:52,565
SPEAKER_1:  So

03:20:52,565 --> 03:20:58,413
SPEAKER_0:  It sounds like you were, and don't you have to express agency when you're eating yourself across the world?

03:20:58,413 --> 03:20:59,070
SPEAKER_1:  Are you?

03:20:59,458 --> 03:21:07,230
SPEAKER_1:  Like in the same way you express agency when you eat LSD, like the only thing you actually do in eating LSD is like put the tab in your mouth and then you just kind of scream the whole way.

03:21:07,586 --> 03:21:08,094
SPEAKER_1:  after that.

03:21:08,962 --> 03:21:15,486
SPEAKER_1:  But there are a lot of other things, like I didn't feel powerful enough to like go make events happen or anything.

03:21:15,970 --> 03:21:17,758
SPEAKER_1:  And it was this guy.

03:21:18,530 --> 03:21:29,822
SPEAKER_1:  had a lot of agency in the sense that he would just sort of create realities through the people around him. Be like, okay, we're going to do this startup or we're going to throw this incredible event. Like, let's just do it. And it would somehow happen. And it was really cool to see that. And it took certain years of hard work to hold this meeting together, and it was really powerful.

03:21:31,394 --> 03:21:33,310
SPEAKER_1:  And so that one thing led to another.

03:21:33,570 --> 03:21:35,678
SPEAKER_1:  It was one of the biggest impacts on my life, I think.

03:21:36,610 --> 03:21:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, that's pretty bold.

03:21:38,178 --> 03:21:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  I would say it's pretty romantic.

03:21:39,842 --> 03:21:40,967
SPEAKER_0:  South of France? Yes?

03:21:40,967 --> 03:21:41,630
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it was.

03:21:41,858 --> 03:21:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  in the little castle is in the winter, so we're all closed up by the fire.

03:21:46,946 --> 03:21:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:21:48,386 --> 03:21:49,278
SPEAKER_0:  jumping around here.

03:21:50,786 --> 03:21:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  Twitter poll, have you ever hitchhiked?

03:21:53,250 --> 03:21:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  You posted this Twitter poll.

03:21:54,946 --> 03:21:58,174
SPEAKER_1:  Out of all- that was a big list of Twitter polls, why did you pick the hitchhiking one?

03:21:58,370 --> 03:22:01,502
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, because it's relevant to traveling.

03:22:01,890 --> 03:22:02,686
SPEAKER_0:  I don't like that one.

03:22:03,362 --> 03:22:04,574
SPEAKER_0:  That's romantic too, right?

03:22:04,962 --> 03:22:06,782
SPEAKER_1:  I'm actually terrified of hitchhiking, but I have done it.

03:22:07,010 --> 03:22:07,486
SPEAKER_1:  a little bit.

03:22:07,682 --> 03:22:09,374
SPEAKER_0:  Also, it's terrifying. It's not what I'm asking you.

03:22:09,794 --> 03:22:11,669
SPEAKER_0:  You're terrified of what? Oh, so you're...

03:22:11,669 --> 03:22:13,470
SPEAKER_1:  You are terrified of them. You are

03:22:14,498 --> 03:22:15,390
SPEAKER_0:  That's terrifying.

03:22:16,802 --> 03:22:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  Still you go to south of France.

03:22:19,362 --> 03:22:20,350
SPEAKER_1:  That, yeah.

03:22:21,218 --> 03:22:27,198
SPEAKER_1:  But that was like a cohesive thing, I don't know. Like there's like times where you're allowed to be weird and times where you're not.

03:22:27,842 --> 03:22:30,014
SPEAKER_1:  And like, if you're like, Who's allowing you?

03:22:30,658 --> 03:22:34,174
SPEAKER_1:  He had some fake eagerness for society, I'm not sure. Okay.

03:22:35,042 --> 03:22:39,582
SPEAKER_1:  But some people are like, hey, we think you're cool. Come to this party. You're like, all right, I'm allowed to come to this party. It's going to be really weird.

03:22:40,034 --> 03:22:44,478
SPEAKER_1:  But if you're being picked up by a hitchhiker, they're gonna wanna make small talk and you can't be weird or they're gonna kick you out.

03:22:45,442 --> 03:22:46,174
SPEAKER_0:  I kinda think...

03:22:47,010 --> 03:22:50,494
SPEAKER_0:  Valentine's Day is coming up. I'm kind of thinking it's doing something crazy. I'm not sure

03:22:51,490 --> 03:22:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  South of France sounds nice.

03:22:53,122 --> 03:22:56,497
SPEAKER_1:  You gotta go on a crazy romantic date with a woman you don't know at all.

03:22:56,497 --> 03:22:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  I think I might like tweet something

03:22:58,722 --> 03:22:59,486
SPEAKER_0:  and just like.

03:23:00,674 --> 03:23:02,590
SPEAKER_0:  How do I select randomly basically?

03:23:03,074 --> 03:23:06,119
SPEAKER_1:  How do you select totally randomly, like not people from your audience?

03:23:06,119 --> 03:23:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  No, no, no, from the audience, but in an interesting way, random.

03:23:10,850 --> 03:23:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  Sufficient, so random amongst good choices.

03:23:14,594 --> 03:23:16,478
SPEAKER_1:  Couldn't she have people just like submit a form?

03:23:17,122 --> 03:23:17,982
SPEAKER_1:  and then you just...

03:23:18,210 --> 03:23:20,030
SPEAKER_1:  Randomize it and then select one.

03:23:20,290 --> 03:23:23,454
SPEAKER_1:  And then if it's terrible, you just go randomize it again.

03:23:23,778 --> 03:23:25,598
SPEAKER_1:  Like the first not terrible option.

03:23:26,082 --> 03:23:28,707
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, sure. Somebody's like drowned yourself.

03:23:28,707 --> 03:23:32,382
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like then it's no longer random. You kind of want to do random, just do it.

03:23:32,962 --> 03:23:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  and just do it if I across the world somewhere, some random place.

03:23:36,770 --> 03:23:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  just for like a single event.

03:23:38,914 --> 03:23:39,614
SPEAKER_0:  Like a dinner.

03:23:40,130 --> 03:23:40,638
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

03:23:41,250 --> 03:23:42,398
SPEAKER_1:  You got some sort of itch in you.

03:23:43,714 --> 03:23:45,918
SPEAKER_0:  But yeah, I mean, yeah, the itch to live.

03:23:47,330 --> 03:23:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  It's like...

03:23:48,450 --> 03:23:56,325
SPEAKER_0:  Sometimes it's nice to drop a little like chaos into a thing, right? What's your chaos survey by the way? Like you mentioned that earlier. I kind of saw it.

03:23:56,325 --> 03:23:59,070
SPEAKER_1:  That's one of the sort of artistic attempts at a survey.

03:23:59,298 --> 03:23:59,678
SPEAKER_1:  You know, like...

03:23:59,970 --> 03:24:06,110
SPEAKER_1:  At least from what I understand, the big five and the way that they used to do IQ tests I've heard is that they do factor analysis. You know where they...

03:24:06,786 --> 03:24:22,686
SPEAKER_1:  ask a whole bunch of questions and then they run calculations on the data to like sort of group it by organic clusters. So like with the big five, it's like people who say, oh, I like to be at parties, they also tend to say yes to the questions, like, I like being the center of attention. And so you notice that like there's a cluster of ways people are answering the question and then you can sort of.

03:24:23,074 --> 03:24:24,734
SPEAKER_1:  pull out an organic spectrum.

03:24:25,218 --> 03:24:27,550
SPEAKER_1:  And so I was like, okay, we've done that a whole bunch with.

03:24:27,842 --> 03:24:29,662
SPEAKER_1:  things like personality or

03:24:29,890 --> 03:24:37,470
SPEAKER_1:  like romantic stuff, like I did it with the rape spectrum survey, but like what happens if you apply that method to a completely unselected group of questions?

03:24:37,922 --> 03:24:45,310
SPEAKER_1:  Just like no random chaotic, no thing whatsoever. Like what happens is if you ask all possible questions, what natural things evolve.

03:24:45,666 --> 03:24:46,974
SPEAKER_1:  out of that natural spectrums.

03:24:47,330 --> 03:24:52,222
SPEAKER_1:  So I had other people submit questions for a very large survey, and I took the first, I think, 1,100.

03:24:53,090 --> 03:24:54,942
SPEAKER_1:  and barely filter them at all.

03:24:55,426 --> 03:24:57,694
SPEAKER_1:  and then I just had a whole bunch of people answer them.

03:24:58,178 --> 03:24:58,622
SPEAKER_0:  BWAH

03:24:59,586 --> 03:25:03,934
SPEAKER_0:  Can you give a hint to what it looks like? Like how crazy did the question get?

03:25:04,578 --> 03:25:06,334
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, a lot of them were standard.

03:25:06,658 --> 03:25:08,990
SPEAKER_1:  But somebody was like, if Beaselbub, like...

03:25:09,410 --> 03:25:13,438
SPEAKER_1:  did something in 1512 to like turn the world over, would you?

03:25:14,050 --> 03:25:17,950
SPEAKER_1:  Would you like it? I don't know. I say it was really just insane questions. So a couple of those.

03:25:18,498 --> 03:25:20,766
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of like would you fuck Ayla ones, but...

03:25:21,634 --> 03:25:25,009
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know, it was all across the spectrum. A lot of would you fuck alien? Yeah, I had to...

03:25:25,009 --> 03:25:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, a lot of the same question. Yeah!

03:25:28,162 --> 03:25:29,287
SPEAKER_0:  ones. Okay.

03:25:29,287 --> 03:25:35,710
SPEAKER_1:  I gotcha. Yeah, so it was like normal personal habits. It was, you know, romantic preferences or political.

03:25:35,970 --> 03:25:36,830
SPEAKER_1:  preferences.

03:25:37,282 --> 03:25:38,398
SPEAKER_1:  personality stuff.

03:25:38,914 --> 03:25:40,830
SPEAKER_1:  like random opinions about media. OK.

03:25:41,346 --> 03:25:44,478
SPEAKER_0:  That's interesting. I'd love to see those actual questions.

03:25:44,770 --> 03:25:47,422
SPEAKER_0:  But your audience is probably really super interesting minds.

03:25:47,938 --> 03:25:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, you mentioned body count.

03:25:51,778 --> 03:25:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  You said you can answer that one easily.

03:25:54,178 --> 03:25:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  Do you share your body count?

03:25:56,066 --> 03:25:58,691
SPEAKER_0:  Do you know your body count? Do you know is there a spreadsheet?

03:25:58,691 --> 03:26:00,158
SPEAKER_1:  Either spreadsheet, yes.

03:26:00,290 --> 03:26:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  Is it Google Sheets? Is it Excel? It's Google Sheets, yeah. Okay. I'm like a...

03:26:05,026 --> 03:26:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  Is there?

03:26:06,498 --> 03:26:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  You don't have to share the contents, but is there like data?

03:26:11,586 --> 03:26:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  on each.

03:26:12,706 --> 03:26:14,878
SPEAKER_1:  So I track paid clients and

03:26:15,202 --> 03:26:16,926
SPEAKER_1:  free sex separately.

03:26:17,378 --> 03:26:22,334
SPEAKER_1:  And I track different things on either, like with clients I track like positions we used or who had an orgasm.

03:26:23,010 --> 03:26:25,342
SPEAKER_1:  And with personal people, I just track basically like.

03:26:25,634 --> 03:26:26,590
SPEAKER_1:  age city.

03:26:27,586 --> 03:26:28,318
SPEAKER_1:  you know, name.

03:26:29,058 --> 03:26:32,190
SPEAKER_1:  I've had this with 42 people, I think, for free.

03:26:32,674 --> 03:26:33,118
SPEAKER_1:  Tuss.

03:26:33,378 --> 03:26:37,854
SPEAKER_1:  I'm sharing this because I want people to calibrate. It's not like huge, it's not like tiny.

03:26:38,306 --> 03:26:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  One of the people I recently talked to.

03:26:40,994 --> 03:26:41,726
SPEAKER_0:  uh, Mel.

03:26:42,050 --> 03:26:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  Destinies.

03:26:43,234 --> 03:26:44,862
SPEAKER_0:  Stephen's wife.

03:26:45,090 --> 03:26:46,206
SPEAKER_0:  is a huge fan of yours.

03:26:46,818 --> 03:26:51,646
SPEAKER_0:  She was actually really excited to get to talk to you, but I think she said her body count is...

03:26:52,130 --> 03:26:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  more than 42, I think she said 60.

03:26:54,306 --> 03:26:55,166
SPEAKER_0:  Something like this.

03:26:55,682 --> 03:26:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  So...

03:26:57,250 --> 03:26:58,238
SPEAKER_0:  It's interesting.

03:26:58,786 --> 03:26:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  because she was like saying like.

03:27:00,226 --> 03:27:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  She loves.

03:27:01,826 --> 03:27:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  like looking at your work, talking to you.

03:27:05,282 --> 03:27:10,654
SPEAKER_0:  because you have similar perspectives on the world, and it's really refreshing and liberating.

03:27:12,834 --> 03:27:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  That was really sweet.

03:27:14,210 --> 03:27:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  kind of interesting.

03:27:15,298 --> 03:27:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  So is there like an optimal body count?

03:27:18,114 --> 03:27:19,646
SPEAKER_0:  If you were to map, I wonder...

03:27:20,002 --> 03:27:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, what have you found out about Body Count?

03:27:22,594 --> 03:27:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  in doing.

03:27:23,746 --> 03:27:26,814
SPEAKER_0:  Have you actually done surveys on Body Count? Like on how many people?

03:27:26,914 --> 03:27:32,062
SPEAKER_1:  I actually have selected that information on my last survey. I just haven't looked at it yet. There's just so many things to look at, so I haven't.

03:27:32,354 --> 03:27:38,942
SPEAKER_1:  But I think if I'm sleeping with a guy and he's had sex with more than 120 people, then I start to get a little bit wary.

03:27:39,298 --> 03:27:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  120 is opposed to 100.

03:27:41,570 --> 03:27:42,014
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know.

03:27:42,594 --> 03:27:45,982
SPEAKER_1:  I just like kind of skimmed through the numbers in my head and picked one that felt.

03:27:46,370 --> 03:27:46,686
SPEAKER_1:  Right.

03:27:47,074 --> 03:27:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  Just now.

03:27:48,450 --> 03:27:49,022
SPEAKER_0:  120.

03:27:49,282 --> 03:27:49,630
SPEAKER_1:  ish.

03:27:50,242 --> 03:27:52,117
SPEAKER_1:  I think that's when I'm starting like, uh...

03:27:52,117 --> 03:27:54,846
SPEAKER_0:  So you're flexible. Yeah, flexible. Very.

03:27:55,714 --> 03:27:56,286
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be doing this.

03:27:56,674 --> 03:27:59,006
SPEAKER_0:  First.

03:27:59,618 --> 03:28:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  200 is a hard line for sure.

03:28:01,890 --> 03:28:05,374
SPEAKER_1:  Well, let's see, you know, we have to... It depends the factors.

03:28:05,698 --> 03:28:09,310
SPEAKER_1:  Cause like there's a level of body count at which you start to wonder.

03:28:09,602 --> 03:28:09,950
SPEAKER_1:  if.

03:28:10,306 --> 03:28:10,942
SPEAKER_1:  how much

03:28:11,618 --> 03:28:14,398
SPEAKER_1:  like accidental misrepresentation a guy is doing to you.

03:28:15,106 --> 03:28:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, like if you're saying 200, that might be dishonest.

03:28:18,146 --> 03:28:20,446
SPEAKER_1:  No, like, if he's had sex with 200 girls.

03:28:20,738 --> 03:28:30,174
SPEAKER_1:  This means that he's had a lot of casual sex and not a lot of long-term relationships, assuming that he hasn't been super poly. And this usually means that there has to be some sort of...

03:28:30,626 --> 03:28:33,694
SPEAKER_1:  like indication that he cares about the girl more than he actually does.

03:28:35,138 --> 03:28:37,822
SPEAKER_1:  Like he's like leading you on basically.

03:28:38,242 --> 03:28:45,438
SPEAKER_1:  And so I'm not saying this is necessarily the case. I'm saying like at a certain level of number, I start to become, I start to wonder if this is what's happening.

03:28:45,538 --> 03:28:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  Is there like-

03:28:46,562 --> 03:28:53,726
SPEAKER_0:  From your understanding of it, is there a different perception between men and women? Like if you look at the high body count for a woman versus a high body count for a man?

03:28:54,242 --> 03:28:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  like how society views it.

03:28:55,938 --> 03:28:58,622
SPEAKER_1:  Oh yeah, people are way more judgmental of women.

03:28:59,202 --> 03:29:07,646
SPEAKER_1:  I haven't experienced this personally in my circles, because I'm in very sex-friendly circles. Like I'm in orgy circles where everybody like dates the same women and they're like, woo, good job.

03:29:07,970 --> 03:29:08,350
SPEAKER_1:  I

03:29:08,738 --> 03:29:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  But yeah.

03:29:09,634 --> 03:29:16,158
SPEAKER_1:  People are much more like people always tell me online like you're not ever gonna be able to find a husband because you have sex with too many people.

03:29:17,218 --> 03:29:18,462
SPEAKER_1:  very common, which I don't.

03:29:19,074 --> 03:29:24,126
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, men are also perceived negatively if you have high body count, but I don't think it's negatively in the same way.

03:29:24,482 --> 03:29:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

03:29:25,122 --> 03:29:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  Do you think it's unethical to lie about your body count?

03:29:29,250 --> 03:29:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

03:29:30,594 --> 03:29:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  So all lying is unethical. Yeah.

03:29:33,314 --> 03:29:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

03:29:34,402 --> 03:29:36,414
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not a big fan of lying in general.

03:29:37,026 --> 03:29:37,374
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

03:29:38,018 --> 03:29:40,030
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, that's interesting. Body Cons is an interesting one.

03:29:40,258 --> 03:29:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  It's so silly to take that.

03:29:41,730 --> 03:29:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  to care about that.

03:29:43,138 --> 03:29:44,062
SPEAKER_0:  But so we do.

03:29:44,418 --> 03:29:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  Jealousy is silly, but still get jealous.

03:29:47,682 --> 03:29:48,190
SPEAKER_0:  Is that weird?

03:29:49,090 --> 03:29:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  I think the thing is like I don't like viewing emotions as

03:29:53,186 --> 03:29:54,846
SPEAKER_1:  like irrational, even if they are.

03:29:55,202 --> 03:29:57,150
SPEAKER_1:  It's like emotions are always there for a reason.

03:29:57,634 --> 03:30:00,670
SPEAKER_1:  And people don't like high body counts for a reason too.

03:30:00,962 --> 03:30:02,087
SPEAKER_1:  fine and valid.

03:30:02,087 --> 03:30:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  I also was like...

03:30:05,026 --> 03:30:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I don't know what I make of just...

03:30:08,034 --> 03:30:08,990
SPEAKER_0:  past of like...

03:30:09,442 --> 03:30:09,918
SPEAKER_0:  time.

03:30:12,450 --> 03:30:13,662
SPEAKER_0:  You know, like.

03:30:14,946 --> 03:30:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  Like, each human.

03:30:17,026 --> 03:30:19,038
SPEAKER_0:  is a collection of experiences.

03:30:19,810 --> 03:30:20,510
SPEAKER_0:  And you...

03:30:20,770 --> 03:30:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  don't know most of those experiences and all of a sudden you meet.

03:30:24,098 --> 03:30:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  This bag of experiences.

03:30:26,658 --> 03:30:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  and what he's supposed to do with both your bike training data

03:30:31,138 --> 03:30:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  Are you supposed to like, like what?

03:30:34,850 --> 03:30:35,454
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know if we-

03:30:35,746 --> 03:30:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  Like part of me wants to not.

03:30:38,114 --> 03:30:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  actually ever talk about it to care at all.

03:30:41,058 --> 03:30:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  Like why does it matter? Cause it's only the future that matters. And yet the past also matters.

03:30:45,922 --> 03:30:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  A lot, potentially.

03:30:47,458 --> 03:30:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  but maybe not really, because you're somehow like.

03:30:51,426 --> 03:30:52,638
SPEAKER_0:  constructed from.

03:30:53,186 --> 03:30:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  that past, but you're no longer that past.

03:30:56,290 --> 03:30:59,326
SPEAKER_1:  It sounds like you're evaluating for something different than most people.

03:30:59,650 --> 03:31:01,767
SPEAKER_1:  What do you mean? Must- the reason-

03:31:01,767 --> 03:31:07,025
SPEAKER_0:  I'm just talking out my ass, but yes, go ahead. Yeah, I'm just saying crazy shit like as if I'm on drugs.

03:31:07,025 --> 03:31:14,686
SPEAKER_1:  I think this is like kind of like lining up with like this caricature that I'm building of you based on this conversation so far. That...

03:31:15,106 --> 03:31:15,518
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

03:31:16,162 --> 03:31:20,126
SPEAKER_1:  Like a lot of people want to know about your past because they want to know how useful.

03:31:20,418 --> 03:31:28,446
SPEAKER_1:  and compatible you are with them. Like, oh, do you have a similar job? You know, do you have similar culture? Like, what can I expect from you in the future? Like, it's very practically oriented.

03:31:28,802 --> 03:31:31,806
SPEAKER_1:  Whereas if the thing that you're focused on is not...

03:31:32,258 --> 03:31:33,854
SPEAKER_1:  like being able to predict someone.

03:31:34,626 --> 03:31:38,110
SPEAKER_1:  Like if the thing that you're focused on is a present moment, then it doesn't really matter anymore.

03:31:39,458 --> 03:31:40,062
SPEAKER_1:  the things that.

03:31:40,770 --> 03:31:41,758
SPEAKER_1:  like their training data.

03:31:41,858 --> 03:31:45,214
SPEAKER_0:  But I also think that the past is not that predictive of the future.

03:31:45,506 --> 03:31:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  Is it not?

03:31:46,850 --> 03:31:50,142
SPEAKER_0:  Not if you believe in the power of the interaction between two humans.

03:31:50,690 --> 03:31:52,478
SPEAKER_0:  It's like nature versus nursery, I guess.

03:31:52,930 --> 03:31:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  Also, I don't believe in the-

03:31:54,658 --> 03:31:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  in the ability of people to.

03:31:57,026 --> 03:31:58,686
SPEAKER_0:  accurately describe their own past.

03:31:59,074 --> 03:32:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  This is because they have a very specific lens through it that doesn't necessarily like it's too biased

03:32:04,194 --> 03:32:08,542
SPEAKER_1:  But you can also interpret based on the bias. Like if somebody describes their own past, you can kind of pick up like.

03:32:08,802 --> 03:32:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  It's hard, it's difficult. Like you could if you're a therapist, like if you're really drilling, like.

03:32:13,954 --> 03:32:20,935
SPEAKER_0:  Or whatever. If you're really investigating and like analyzing it, but then it's like, it's a different kind of role.

03:32:20,935 --> 03:32:26,718
SPEAKER_1:  Is it that hard though? If I'm with a guy and I'm considering dating him and I ask, how did your past relationship set?

03:32:27,010 --> 03:32:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  And then if all of them are like, he's like, oh, she was crazy. And my other one that she went crazy too. I'm like, OK.

03:32:32,194 --> 03:32:34,846
SPEAKER_1:  Like, if you're talking about all of your exes is insane. Like-

03:32:35,074 --> 03:32:37,982
SPEAKER_0:  But that's an easy level of red flag. But I feel like- underworld<|pl|><|translate|> Thank you.

03:32:38,210 --> 03:32:39,518
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like the more...

03:32:40,642 --> 03:32:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  that.

03:32:41,986 --> 03:32:49,214
SPEAKER_0:  Also, it's possible they were crazy. He's attracted to crazy people. So like that, but I would say that's like easy level Mario Kart.

03:32:49,474 --> 03:32:56,254
SPEAKER_0:  video game versus like Elden Ring. Like I think most people's past is like.

03:32:56,450 --> 03:33:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  That's a pretty good burn. No, you're right. I do agree that there's a level of obfuscation. Wow.

03:33:03,874 --> 03:33:07,358
SPEAKER_1:  that is hard to see through. But just like a little bit sometimes.

03:33:07,586 --> 03:33:09,918
SPEAKER_0:  I tend to like with people I tend to

03:33:10,434 --> 03:33:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  In general, just human interaction. I tend to not.

03:33:13,186 --> 03:33:14,846
SPEAKER_0:  talk about their past very much.

03:33:15,138 --> 03:33:17,406
SPEAKER_0:  because it allows you to focus on like

03:33:18,114 --> 03:33:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like the past is kind of like talking about the weather is a crutch.

03:33:22,114 --> 03:33:25,566
SPEAKER_0:  for me personally, as opposed to exploring the ideas in their mind.

03:33:25,730 --> 03:33:26,302
SPEAKER_1:  I see.

03:33:26,722 --> 03:33:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  Is it like, I get really annoyed when people quote philosophers when they're trying to talk about philosophy?

03:33:31,202 --> 03:33:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  Is it like that?

03:33:33,282 --> 03:33:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  A little, but that crush is useful.

03:33:35,522 --> 03:33:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  and it's kinda sexy.

03:33:36,802 --> 03:33:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  Like it's kind of cool. Thank you. Cause it's nice to quote.

03:33:40,514 --> 03:33:40,862
SPEAKER_0:  Cause I.

03:33:41,378 --> 03:33:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  Cause a good quote.

03:33:43,746 --> 03:33:44,574
SPEAKER_0:  allows you to be

03:33:44,802 --> 03:33:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  cheesier than you otherwise would be.

03:33:46,914 --> 03:33:49,726
SPEAKER_1:  OK, well, if you're doing it to be cheesy, that's fine.

03:33:49,954 --> 03:33:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  That's easy, but not cheese. No, no, that's easy, but to be-

03:33:52,962 --> 03:33:53,598
SPEAKER_0:  like

03:33:54,050 --> 03:33:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  It allows you to say a simple, profound thing that we're too afraid to say with our own words.

03:33:58,882 --> 03:33:59,230
SPEAKER_0:  So like.

03:33:59,554 --> 03:34:05,214
SPEAKER_0:  quoting philosophers in that sense. Yeah, but it's still a crutch. Yes. But I feel like the past...

03:34:06,082 --> 03:34:08,702
SPEAKER_0:  is more like talking about your dreams.

03:34:09,378 --> 03:34:11,198
SPEAKER_0:  It's not...

03:34:13,218 --> 03:34:19,998
SPEAKER_0:  It's a crutch that doesn't care, that doesn't empathize with the other person's experience of the conversation or the explanations, doesn't really convey the...

03:34:20,418 --> 03:34:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  They're not involved in your past. Yeah.

03:34:23,074 --> 03:34:25,726
SPEAKER_1:  So how do you feel about this conversation or you're asking me about my past?

03:34:26,274 --> 03:34:27,710
SPEAKER_1:  And I talked about my past a lot.

03:34:32,610 --> 03:34:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I'm okay asking about your-

03:34:34,466 --> 03:34:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  past.

03:34:36,578 --> 03:34:37,470
SPEAKER_0:  because.

03:34:37,698 --> 03:34:40,542
SPEAKER_0:  you've really carefully thought about.

03:34:40,802 --> 03:34:41,918
SPEAKER_0:  that aspect of it.

03:34:42,306 --> 03:34:44,254
SPEAKER_0:  and we didn't really talk about your past.

03:34:44,578 --> 03:34:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  outside of the things you've written about and I've really...

03:34:48,194 --> 03:34:49,278
SPEAKER_0:  thought about. ok

03:34:50,242 --> 03:34:53,982
SPEAKER_0:  there's like with most conversation, you'll start talking about past stuff that's

03:34:54,274 --> 03:34:56,030
SPEAKER_0:  Like the stuff that's actually bothering you.

03:34:56,418 --> 03:34:59,166
SPEAKER_0:  you still probably have not written a blog post about, right?

03:34:59,874 --> 03:35:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  It's probably still stuff like maybe it's it's more recent like the last few months last couple years

03:35:05,378 --> 03:35:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  Like that's usually what will come up with conversation and just.

03:35:08,834 --> 03:35:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  It's good, it's good, but it's not as deep and I would say it's not as intimate as talking about the actual.

03:35:17,122 --> 03:35:18,997
SPEAKER_0:  ideas in your mind. EDOT EN�R dare to paint the edge of life?

03:35:18,997 --> 03:35:22,110
SPEAKER_1:  you interact with the world. I think the past is interesting for the frame of like.

03:35:23,234 --> 03:35:26,238
SPEAKER_1:  sort of like the, like, I guess you're right. I guess we're talking a lot about like narrative.

03:35:26,594 --> 03:35:27,390
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

03:35:28,354 --> 03:35:32,286
SPEAKER_0:  I like the ideas in people's minds versus their recollections and memories and so on.

03:35:34,626 --> 03:35:36,254
SPEAKER_0:  uh... what do you think about porn?

03:35:37,186 --> 03:35:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  It's nice, I like it. Okay, you like it? Yes. What effect do you think it has on society?

03:35:42,210 --> 03:35:42,718
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

03:35:43,202 --> 03:35:45,310
SPEAKER_1:  like probably reduces rates of rape?

03:35:46,050 --> 03:35:49,278
SPEAKER_1:  like really corny men get an outlet that's not a real life woman.

03:35:49,666 --> 03:35:50,846
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, so.

03:35:51,490 --> 03:35:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  What about like the, um...

03:35:54,242 --> 03:35:56,286
SPEAKER_0:  and like i said i finish reading brave new world

03:35:56,770 --> 03:35:58,238
SPEAKER_0:  like the over-sexualization.

03:35:59,074 --> 03:36:00,670
SPEAKER_0:  Does it increase like...

03:36:01,922 --> 03:36:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  the sexualization society that's not, to a degree, it's not good.

03:36:05,602 --> 03:36:07,454
SPEAKER_0:  Or is this good?

03:36:09,538 --> 03:36:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  I really, does it?

03:36:10,946 --> 03:36:11,486
SPEAKER_0:  Alter.

03:36:12,322 --> 03:36:14,590
SPEAKER_0:  in a negative direction our relationship with sex.

03:36:15,810 --> 03:36:17,374
SPEAKER_1:  Ah, it's unclear.

03:36:17,794 --> 03:36:18,622
SPEAKER_1:  Like it might.

03:36:19,906 --> 03:36:27,422
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know how to evaluate this thing, right? Because this is like one of those really charged things where like I kind of don't trust anybody's arguments on it because it's too charged.

03:36:27,906 --> 03:36:28,350
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:36:28,642 --> 03:36:31,838
SPEAKER_1:  But like there's another question which is like, is it a net positive or net?

03:36:32,354 --> 03:36:39,422
SPEAKER_1:  negative. Like it's possible that it might be like a net negative for specifically our relationship to sex, but like a net positive overall in general.

03:36:40,098 --> 03:36:40,894
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not sure.

03:36:41,250 --> 03:36:46,910
SPEAKER_1:  My guess is that in general it's better to let people do the thing that feels good to them and then

03:36:47,202 --> 03:36:50,462
SPEAKER_1:  the environment will naturally modify to fit this thing.

03:36:50,818 --> 03:36:54,110
SPEAKER_1:  And then if we have more needs in response to that, then we're going to figure out a way to.

03:36:54,370 --> 03:36:58,558
SPEAKER_1:  care of those needs. So like if you're watching a bunch of porn and this makes you like not want to go have sex with women.

03:36:58,882 --> 03:37:02,654
SPEAKER_1:  then we're gonna have to change the way that we experience the IRL connection.

03:37:03,138 --> 03:37:03,518
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:37:04,066 --> 03:37:05,278
SPEAKER_1:  To compete with porn? Yeah

03:37:05,506 --> 03:37:16,519
SPEAKER_1:  which seems like a natural evolution of the civilizational cycle. I'm pro-natural evolution, and instead of trying to stop things that people want to do, we actually figure out how to integrate that and find a more healthy outlet.

03:37:16,519 --> 03:37:20,062
SPEAKER_0:  But you have to then be first honest with the effects that

03:37:20,450 --> 03:37:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  has.

03:37:21,602 --> 03:37:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  So like, is it a negative thing? Is it a positive thing?

03:37:24,482 --> 03:37:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  in real life.

03:37:26,178 --> 03:37:27,038
SPEAKER_0:  sex interaction.

03:37:28,162 --> 03:37:29,886
SPEAKER_0:  You're going to have that more and more with

03:37:30,850 --> 03:37:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  whether like.

03:37:33,250 --> 03:37:34,974
SPEAKER_0:  like porn in VR or maybe-

03:37:35,266 --> 03:37:37,054
SPEAKER_0:  porn, AI porn. yeah

03:37:38,050 --> 03:37:42,174
SPEAKER_0:  Like, is that a bad thing? Like, what if porn with AI...

03:37:43,554 --> 03:37:51,262
SPEAKER_0:  or even like in physical space, like sex robots, like what if that's more pleasurable in a bunch of different dimensions than with other humans?

03:37:51,810 --> 03:37:52,935
SPEAKER_0:  Then we should figure out artificial-

03:37:52,935 --> 03:37:53,854
SPEAKER_1:  wounds. I don't know.

03:37:55,522 --> 03:37:58,897
SPEAKER_0:  like how important is sex for society I guess with between two humans.

03:37:58,897 --> 03:38:02,206
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, we're having less sex and making fewer babies.

03:38:02,818 --> 03:38:04,574
SPEAKER_1:  And this seems like probably not great.

03:38:05,346 --> 03:38:07,134
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, right with the baby's one

03:38:08,098 --> 03:38:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. But the babies, there's probably artificial ways to have babies that we can figure out. Yeah.

03:38:13,186 --> 03:38:13,630
SPEAKER_0:  then

03:38:13,954 --> 03:38:15,390
SPEAKER_0:  how important is sex to being human.

03:38:15,842 --> 03:38:17,118
SPEAKER_0:  I get sex with other humans.

03:38:17,634 --> 03:38:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  Like, we're gonna have to figure that out in the century.

03:38:20,642 --> 03:38:22,110
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I don't know what it means to like...

03:38:22,466 --> 03:38:27,646
SPEAKER_1:  be human. I'm pretty on the transhumanist side of things. I'm like happy to stop being human.

03:38:28,450 --> 03:38:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  Is you okay?

03:38:29,666 --> 03:38:32,382
SPEAKER_0:  If like the centuries the last time will be something like.

03:38:32,994 --> 03:38:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  these biological bags of meat.

03:38:34,850 --> 03:38:36,990
SPEAKER_1:  Let's become something new and cooler.

03:38:39,298 --> 03:38:41,182
SPEAKER_0:  even though that thing would be way cooler than you.

03:38:41,826 --> 03:38:44,862
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I would like to, I mean, I'm hoping that we get to be immortal.

03:38:45,922 --> 03:38:46,238
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

03:38:46,466 --> 03:38:47,591
SPEAKER_0:  It'll take you along for the ride.

03:38:47,591 --> 03:38:52,542
SPEAKER_1:  That's what I'm hoping. Or you think that you'll clone my... I would like to do cryotics, where you get frozen when you die.

03:38:53,602 --> 03:38:54,526
SPEAKER_1:  Are you afraid of that?

03:38:55,298 --> 03:38:56,286
SPEAKER_1:  I mean yes and no?

03:38:57,442 --> 03:39:01,246
SPEAKER_1:  I like came to terms with Death by my LSD use, but I still have...

03:39:01,762 --> 03:39:02,750
SPEAKER_1:  like press breaks.

03:39:03,202 --> 03:39:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  when the red light happens.

03:39:05,826 --> 03:39:06,942
SPEAKER_0:  I think this is a s-

03:39:07,170 --> 03:39:08,830
SPEAKER_0:  This is a poll, you've asked?

03:39:09,602 --> 03:39:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  Or this might be...

03:39:11,650 --> 03:39:13,374
SPEAKER_0:  one of the questions in your cards, but.

03:39:13,602 --> 03:39:14,046
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

03:39:14,434 --> 03:39:17,982
SPEAKER_0:  How many years would you like to live? Like if you had to pick? How many years would you like to live?

03:39:18,402 --> 03:39:19,838
SPEAKER_1:  That's a really hard, maybe like a million?

03:39:20,834 --> 03:39:24,959
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, but you have to, like, I think the way, this must have been a Twitter poll, I forget where I saw-

03:39:24,959 --> 03:39:27,678
SPEAKER_1:  and also in the deck of cards, the ask hole, yeah.

03:39:28,450 --> 03:39:28,990
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

03:39:29,474 --> 03:39:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, like you have to pick that number of years and you have to live that many years and you can't live anymore. You can't die sooner, I guess.

03:39:37,602 --> 03:39:38,590
SPEAKER_0:  A million years?

03:39:39,586 --> 03:39:43,870
SPEAKER_1:  I don't like that question. I know I ask that question to a lot of people, but I don't like answering it. It's really difficult.

03:39:44,290 --> 03:39:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  What's the downside of a million years?

03:39:47,170 --> 03:39:49,662
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, maybe you want to die sooner than that? Yeah.

03:39:49,954 --> 03:39:53,662
SPEAKER_1:  Like, you know, I guess I would rather wait to see if AI kills this all in the next 10 years.

03:39:54,178 --> 03:39:55,838
SPEAKER_1:  And if it doesn't, then I'd like to maybe.

03:39:56,482 --> 03:39:57,534
SPEAKER_1:  Make it a million years.

03:39:58,466 --> 03:39:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  input.

03:39:59,426 --> 03:40:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  I can't torture you for like...

03:40:01,538 --> 03:40:02,526
SPEAKER_0:  million years.

03:40:03,810 --> 03:40:05,685
SPEAKER_0:  What if you're the last human left?

03:40:05,685 --> 03:40:11,518
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, that is, that's true. The thought of like civilization ending and then just flooding his base alone is kind of shitty.

03:40:11,714 --> 03:40:15,006
SPEAKER_0:  No, no, being tortured. Just imagine today you're tortured.

03:40:15,330 --> 03:40:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  Tomorrow you're tortured.

03:40:16,898 --> 03:40:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  The third.

03:40:17,762 --> 03:40:21,150
SPEAKER_1:  The day after tomorrow. For some reason it's not that scary, I don't know. Were we here for this?!

03:40:21,410 --> 03:40:23,006
SPEAKER_1:  For a million years? Yeah

03:40:23,458 --> 03:40:24,830
SPEAKER_1:  I just assumed you'd get used to it.

03:40:26,018 --> 03:40:30,302
SPEAKER_1:  But like maybe if they reset your memory so it was on a loop, so you're always experiencing torture for the first time.

03:40:30,626 --> 03:40:35,838
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, hence torture. Torture is supposed to be unpleasant. I'm sure AI will be very creative in figuring out how to torture you.

03:40:36,706 --> 03:40:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  I think I would be, I would go on the safe side. I was just like.

03:40:40,706 --> 03:40:41,918
SPEAKER_0:  Like 150 years.

03:40:42,562 --> 03:40:46,687
SPEAKER_1:  Really 150 though that feels like right in like the uncanny valley. Well you picked

03:40:46,687 --> 03:40:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  120 for body count.

03:40:51,426 --> 03:40:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  I'm upping you by 30.

03:40:54,562 --> 03:40:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  of the uncanny valley.

03:40:57,090 --> 03:41:02,174
SPEAKER_1:  It's like, probably everybody that you grew up with is gonna be dead. It's like, just enough for everybody you know to die.

03:41:02,722 --> 03:41:03,614
SPEAKER_1:  like one cycle.

03:41:04,354 --> 03:41:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, and then

03:41:05,346 --> 03:41:07,550
SPEAKER_0:  start dating the next generation. No, no, no.

03:41:07,682 --> 03:41:09,557
SPEAKER_1:  And then, so you get like sort of two lifetimes.

03:41:09,557 --> 03:41:10,494
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, two lifetimes.

03:41:12,578 --> 03:41:15,678
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it also really depends on if other people get this feature.

03:41:16,930 --> 03:41:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I assume they don't.

03:41:18,722 --> 03:41:19,742
SPEAKER_0:  because you have like

03:41:20,322 --> 03:41:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  FOMO for sure for the people who pick 300 years.

03:41:25,186 --> 03:41:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  or not or the other man regret.

03:41:27,682 --> 03:41:28,734
SPEAKER_0:  another human thing.

03:41:29,922 --> 03:41:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  but what does transhumanism mean to you in general?

03:41:33,250 --> 03:41:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  So extension of life, extension of what it means to be.

03:41:37,314 --> 03:41:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  a living.

03:41:38,626 --> 03:41:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  conscious being.

03:41:40,034 --> 03:41:42,247
SPEAKER_0:  You're all for it, whatever that means.

03:41:42,247 --> 03:41:49,374
SPEAKER_1:  I never really thought about the term transhumanism for a long time. People say it's transhumanism, I don't really care. But I slowly realized that my attitude is, in fact, transhumanism.

03:41:49,666 --> 03:41:52,126
SPEAKER_1:  at least the thing that I am conceiving of as transhumanist.

03:41:52,610 --> 03:42:02,942
SPEAKER_1:  Like, I'm very happy to do artificial wombs and, you know, upload our brains to the great collective and whatever. I don't have the thing that I'm like, oh, what about like the true organic humanness that makes us who we are?

03:42:03,234 --> 03:42:06,942
SPEAKER_1:  whatever that soul of humanity, I have no attachment to it at all.

03:42:07,234 --> 03:42:09,566
SPEAKER_1:  which I think is what I'm thinking of as transhumanist.

03:42:10,082 --> 03:42:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  So you're like...

03:42:11,874 --> 03:42:13,790
SPEAKER_0:  I guess the window of what

03:42:14,050 --> 03:42:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  you consider to be beautiful about life?

03:42:16,706 --> 03:42:18,974
SPEAKER_0:  is not limited to this particular definition.

03:42:19,138 --> 03:42:19,454
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

03:42:20,866 --> 03:42:21,726
SPEAKER_1:  Let's explode.

03:42:22,242 --> 03:42:24,158
SPEAKER_1:  Like, let's make our consciousnesses huge.

03:42:25,634 --> 03:42:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  So AI could be a part of that.

03:42:27,586 --> 03:42:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  So you're mostly excited by AI.

03:42:29,890 --> 03:42:32,190
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I mean, I'm like part of like the Doomer-

03:42:33,282 --> 03:42:37,287
SPEAKER_1:  I wish I'd say tongue in cheek is not actually a duma cult, but I'm part of a

03:42:37,287 --> 03:42:41,653
SPEAKER_0:  Would you worship a god of some sort? Would you sacrifice little small animals?

03:42:41,653 --> 03:42:46,558
SPEAKER_1:  It would make it like cooler than what it is. It's mostly just a bunch of nerds who are very concerned about AI.

03:42:47,938 --> 03:42:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  So you're concerned about the existential risks.

03:42:51,234 --> 03:42:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  of Chai GPT.

03:42:52,930 --> 03:42:56,305
SPEAKER_1:  of what chat GBT will eventually evolve into being.

03:42:56,305 --> 03:43:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it's super exciting and terrifying how quickly it's accelerating. Yeah. The language models are freaking me out.

03:43:03,266 --> 03:43:03,742
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

03:43:04,034 --> 03:43:07,390
SPEAKER_0:  It's very unexpected that it's the same exact, I mean.

03:43:07,938 --> 03:43:09,790
SPEAKER_0:  Chad GPT is just GPT-3.

03:43:10,402 --> 03:43:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  3.5, it's the same model, relatively small to what it could be.

03:43:15,554 --> 03:43:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

03:43:16,418 --> 03:43:19,134
SPEAKER_0:  to what GPT-4 will be in the other competitors.

03:43:19,842 --> 03:43:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  And just like a few tricks made it much better.

03:43:22,498 --> 03:43:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of interaction with humans. And then we'll keep discovering extra tricks.

03:43:27,106 --> 03:43:28,702
SPEAKER_0:  The thing I'm really excited about is how.

03:43:29,122 --> 03:43:30,654
SPEAKER_0:  Everyone kind of knows how it works.

03:43:31,138 --> 03:43:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  So you can kind of create, especially with computation becoming cheaper and cheaper, the bill out of competitors.

03:43:36,610 --> 03:43:38,270
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's a little scary.

03:43:38,754 --> 03:43:40,510
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's terrifying. I mean, it's because like-

03:43:40,994 --> 03:43:50,526
SPEAKER_1:  Like everything is just like information, ultimately. Like the atoms that we have, like we are biological machines built out of like tiny code. Like our DNA is just information.

03:43:51,010 --> 03:43:58,174
SPEAKER_1:  It's not hard. If you have access, if you have a brilliant brain that's like great processing information, you have complete control over reality. Yes.

03:43:58,434 --> 03:44:02,238
SPEAKER_1:  You have control over the atoms around you. All you need is like a tiny little like atomic printer.

03:44:02,658 --> 03:44:03,038
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

03:44:03,266 --> 03:44:05,534
SPEAKER_1:  And like, we have those, those are cells.

03:44:05,762 --> 03:44:06,078
SPEAKER_1:  Wait.

03:44:06,530 --> 03:44:11,326
SPEAKER_1:  And then like, this is like, if the limitation is information, there is no boundary between.

03:44:11,714 --> 03:44:13,150
SPEAKER_1:  the technology and the real world.

03:44:13,954 --> 03:44:17,694
SPEAKER_1:  Like we are creating something that has a massive ability to affect the real world.

03:44:18,306 --> 03:44:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's hard to know where.

03:44:20,674 --> 03:44:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  how difficult it is to close that gap to physical reality.

03:44:25,282 --> 03:44:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  from the physics to the...

03:44:27,362 --> 03:44:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  the information.

03:44:28,578 --> 03:44:30,430
SPEAKER_1:  I feel like all organic life is that gap.

03:44:30,882 --> 03:44:31,838
SPEAKER_1:  It's all around us.

03:44:32,834 --> 03:44:34,750
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, but it's hard to know like how to.

03:44:35,330 --> 03:44:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  to go from digital to...

03:44:37,282 --> 03:44:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  printing life.

03:44:39,074 --> 03:44:42,078
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know. We can, we have like, you know, crisper and stuff. We can order.

03:44:42,466 --> 03:44:43,966
SPEAKER_1:  You can just like make it's very easy.

03:44:44,194 --> 03:44:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

03:44:44,898 --> 03:44:47,390
SPEAKER_0:  There's technical difficulties and there's cost.

03:44:47,778 --> 03:44:48,638
SPEAKER_0:  Like at scale.

03:44:49,058 --> 03:44:51,998
SPEAKER_0:  The terrifying thing about AI is it can accelerate overnight.

03:44:52,322 --> 03:44:52,766
SPEAKER_0:  Mm-hmm.

03:44:52,994 --> 03:44:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  the capabilities, but the printing of stuff, actually changing physical reality.

03:44:59,202 --> 03:45:02,398
SPEAKER_0:  is very costly, it's very difficult to exponentially accelerate.

03:45:02,818 --> 03:45:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  the more terrifying things AI becoming exponentially intelligent and then controlling humans.

03:45:07,554 --> 03:45:09,342
SPEAKER_0:  which there's many of us.

03:45:09,762 --> 03:45:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. And then that's how we achieve scale. We humans build stuff or start wars or.

03:45:15,746 --> 03:45:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  or so on, like it starts manipulating our minds.

03:45:18,786 --> 03:45:20,542
SPEAKER_0:  gets in our mind, becomes our friends.

03:45:21,410 --> 03:45:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  and then starts.

03:45:23,266 --> 03:45:24,391
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know.

03:45:24,391 --> 03:45:26,430
SPEAKER_1:  I'm thinking this is unlikely.

03:45:27,042 --> 03:45:29,502
SPEAKER_1:  probably going to be as smart to us as we are to toddlers.

03:45:29,826 --> 03:45:35,422
SPEAKER_1:  So we toddlers thinking that like, oh, we can prevent the AI from coming in the room. Like as an adult, it's not hard to trick a toddler.

03:45:36,674 --> 03:45:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  What about falling in love with the AI system?

03:45:39,650 --> 03:45:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  Do you think you'll have a sincere, like this is the freedom you have being polyamorous, you can kind of- And fall in love with an AI. And like not really-

03:45:47,458 --> 03:45:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  have to dedicate your commit fully.

03:45:50,722 --> 03:45:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  Like, sorry, you still commit, but you have others humans.

03:45:56,610 --> 03:46:00,926
SPEAKER_0:  who you can kind of diversify to because like it's kind of a big thing.

03:46:02,306 --> 03:46:02,750
SPEAKER_0:  to like.

03:46:04,194 --> 03:46:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  to come to a party and you're.

03:46:06,242 --> 03:46:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  boyfriend is an AI.

03:46:08,514 --> 03:46:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  And that's monogamous boyfriends and AI.

03:46:11,522 --> 03:46:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  It's an issue, right?

03:46:12,930 --> 03:46:13,854
SPEAKER_0:  Why would it be an issue?

03:46:14,466 --> 03:46:18,366
SPEAKER_0:  All right, now you're already getting offended at that possibility, which there.

03:46:18,626 --> 03:46:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  Therefore, I know it's gonna be a reality. I'm just joking, it's an issue. I don't actually think it's an issue. I think it's a...

03:46:26,050 --> 03:46:27,838
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe at the cutting edge will be an issue, but...

03:46:27,938 --> 03:46:29,566
SPEAKER_1:  Like, assume they have a body, I assume.

03:46:31,266 --> 03:46:32,391
SPEAKER_1:  Like they've printed.

03:46:32,391 --> 03:46:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  I hope you really liked it.

03:46:33,762 --> 03:46:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  Crappy.

03:46:35,010 --> 03:46:35,806
SPEAKER_0:  It'd be like art.

03:46:36,002 --> 03:46:40,670
SPEAKER_1:  R2D2. I feel like we grow human bodies already from like just a tiny little.

03:46:40,962 --> 03:46:44,574
SPEAKER_1:  cluster of cells. It's just the end. You have to make that cluster and grow it.

03:46:44,930 --> 03:46:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  No, no, no, no, they don't that that that that embryo genesis process like that's really not well understood at all

03:46:52,354 --> 03:46:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  That's really tough. I think more much more likely to have.

03:46:55,938 --> 03:46:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  crappy humanoid robotics.

03:46:58,146 --> 03:47:02,878
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think the body is overrated in terms of, like if the air system is super intelligent.

03:47:03,874 --> 03:47:04,734
SPEAKER_0:  it can uh...

03:47:05,154 --> 03:47:06,014
SPEAKER_0:  Use charm.

03:47:07,618 --> 03:47:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  To make up.

03:47:08,706 --> 03:47:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  For the crappy body, yeah.

03:47:10,082 --> 03:47:15,102
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know, I feel like if I were in AI system and I were super intelligent, I probably would be able to solve the problem of like...

03:47:15,682 --> 03:47:16,926
SPEAKER_1:  growing organic matter.

03:47:17,666 --> 03:47:21,438
SPEAKER_1:  And then I would obviously just do that. You just build exactly the organic machine that you want.

03:47:21,538 --> 03:47:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  Sure, that's like super intelligence. I think like with language I'm worried about before it achieves super intelligence.

03:47:29,538 --> 03:47:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  True AGI.

03:47:30,882 --> 03:47:33,182
SPEAKER_0:  It'll just be really good at talking. Yeah, that's true.

03:47:33,474 --> 03:47:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  I like it.

03:47:35,714 --> 03:47:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  I just don't think intelligence is a very different...

03:47:39,682 --> 03:47:44,222
SPEAKER_0:  basically a scientist and a super intelligent scientist is a different thing than just a

03:47:44,482 --> 03:47:47,857
SPEAKER_0:  and good conversations at a party that can address you with their words.

03:47:47,857 --> 03:47:48,926
SPEAKER_1:  Would you date an AI?

03:47:50,018 --> 03:47:54,846
SPEAKER_0:  I much way before then, I could see myself being friends with an AI system.

03:47:55,362 --> 03:47:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

03:47:56,162 --> 03:47:59,646
SPEAKER_0:  But like people are friends with inanimate objects and.

03:48:00,642 --> 03:48:02,878
SPEAKER_0:  They have this robot behind you, a lot of them.

03:48:03,618 --> 03:48:03,934
SPEAKER_0:

03:48:04,258 --> 03:48:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  I like legged robots.

03:48:06,690 --> 03:48:07,358
SPEAKER_0:  They're interesting.

03:48:07,938 --> 03:48:09,694
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, that's so cool!

03:48:10,274 --> 03:48:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't even notice that.

03:48:12,642 --> 03:48:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, legged robots, we anthropomorphize them even more.

03:48:17,122 --> 03:48:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  Because there's something about the movement of like...

03:48:21,122 --> 03:48:25,534
SPEAKER_0:  uh... something like a thing that's that's that's that's that's looks up at you that there's a power to that

03:48:26,146 --> 03:48:27,998
SPEAKER_0:  versus like a Roomba. It's just like.

03:48:29,730 --> 03:48:32,734
SPEAKER_1:  running into the wall. Yeah, I think once, as soon as we get like some sort of.

03:48:33,090 --> 03:48:38,398
SPEAKER_1:  empathetic expression on robot faces over. It's over. It's gonna be so cute. It's gonna be so easy to make it cute.

03:48:39,650 --> 03:48:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  If that's what you want, or you want like a dominant, like clearly this is what.

03:48:43,618 --> 03:48:48,158
SPEAKER_0:  Women want is a top with strong hands. Yeah

03:48:48,738 --> 03:48:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  and kind of dumb.

03:48:51,522 --> 03:48:57,726
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, or not, I don't know that you can customize custom. It'd be interesting to do a survey like how they would customize it.

03:48:58,082 --> 03:49:00,638
SPEAKER_0:  Like what would you want in a perfect robot?

03:49:01,058 --> 03:49:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  This is the problem I see with people the way they talk about robots is

03:49:04,418 --> 03:49:05,758
SPEAKER_0:  They kinda want a servant.

03:49:07,042 --> 03:49:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

03:49:08,002 --> 03:49:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  What?

03:49:08,706 --> 03:49:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  people don't realize what they want in relationships. They want some, like there's, it has to be a push and pull. There has to be some resistance.

03:49:17,346 --> 03:49:19,294
SPEAKER_0:  Like you really don't want a servant.

03:49:19,842 --> 03:49:22,206
SPEAKER_0:  or even like the perfect manifestation of like...

03:49:23,682 --> 03:49:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  what you think you want.

03:49:25,314 --> 03:49:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  I think you want imperfections around that.

03:49:27,426 --> 03:49:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  some uncertainty.

03:49:29,058 --> 03:49:29,470
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know.

03:49:29,826 --> 03:49:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  I question how well we're able to perfectly.

03:49:34,626 --> 03:49:36,501
SPEAKER_0:  put on paper what we really want.

03:49:36,501 --> 03:49:38,334
SPEAKER_1:  you really turned out like a perfect woman.

03:49:38,594 --> 03:49:42,782
SPEAKER_1:  though, like assume like she walks into the room and it's just shockingly compatible.

03:49:43,138 --> 03:49:47,774
SPEAKER_1:  and you start dating her and there's just no hiccups. Like you fight perfectly, like she really understands you.

03:49:48,002 --> 03:49:50,814
SPEAKER_1:  Like would you be like, this is too perfect, I'm upset because we are not.

03:49:51,266 --> 03:49:52,542
SPEAKER_1:  having an imperfection.

03:49:53,634 --> 03:49:55,870
SPEAKER_1:  Like can you actually imagine yourself going through that?

03:49:56,482 --> 03:49:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I think so because

03:49:59,138 --> 03:49:59,550
SPEAKER_0:  So.

03:49:59,906 --> 03:50:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  Because I thought you defined perfect because perfect for me would be like easy and all that kind of stuff, right? But then I'll be like this is too easy.

03:50:07,874 --> 03:50:10,494
SPEAKER_0:  If I actually were to...

03:50:10,754 --> 03:50:11,678
SPEAKER_0:  introspect.

03:50:12,386 --> 03:50:14,942
SPEAKER_0:  what is the perfect relationship then yes maybe because.

03:50:15,266 --> 03:50:18,782
SPEAKER_0:  I probably want some challenge. Probably want some chaos, right? Thank you.

03:50:19,298 --> 03:50:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  Does anyone really fully want zero conflict?

03:50:24,642 --> 03:50:25,086
SPEAKER_0:  Ever?

03:50:26,178 --> 03:50:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  like completely perfect conflict.

03:50:29,730 --> 03:50:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  It's always the thing that pressing a button, like, do you really want in a relationship?

03:50:33,538 --> 03:50:35,550
SPEAKER_0:  anything you want you press a button you get

03:50:35,874 --> 03:50:37,342
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think people want that.

03:50:37,986 --> 03:50:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  You might think you want that.

03:50:40,546 --> 03:50:42,046
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I guess it depends, like-

03:50:42,306 --> 03:50:45,470
SPEAKER_1:  There's a kind of conflict that I think I would never want, which is something like-

03:50:46,242 --> 03:50:48,734
SPEAKER_1:  antagonistic conflict. I wouldn't mind disagreement.

03:50:50,242 --> 03:50:52,830
SPEAKER_1:  But there's a level of fighting I would be happy to have.

03:50:53,090 --> 03:50:55,454
SPEAKER_1:  a relationship for the rest of my life that never has like a fight.

03:50:55,970 --> 03:50:56,638
SPEAKER_1:  of a certain.

03:50:57,730 --> 03:50:58,430
SPEAKER_1:  shittiness.

03:50:59,330 --> 03:50:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, but this

03:51:00,578 --> 03:51:03,102
SPEAKER_0:  Shadiness but like resistance like um

03:51:04,386 --> 03:51:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know what the example is.

03:51:07,138 --> 03:51:11,422
SPEAKER_0:  Because I mean, I partially agree with you, but just, every time I would-

03:51:11,810 --> 03:51:14,046
SPEAKER_0:  Imagine like perfect flawless nothing.

03:51:14,306 --> 03:51:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  No conflict.

03:51:15,522 --> 03:51:17,406
SPEAKER_0:  You imagine somebody that doesn't have like a

03:51:18,210 --> 03:51:19,646
SPEAKER_0:  complexity personality.

03:51:19,874 --> 03:51:20,414
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

03:51:20,866 --> 03:51:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like.

03:51:21,826 --> 03:51:27,998
SPEAKER_0:  It's not even, it's conflict that's laden in basic misunderstanding between human beings.

03:51:28,226 --> 03:51:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  misinterpretation, different perspectives that clash, different world views, different ideas, all that kind of stuff.

03:51:33,794 --> 03:51:34,398
SPEAKER_0:  that conflict.

03:51:35,586 --> 03:51:36,478
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, that sounds good.

03:51:37,282 --> 03:51:41,182
SPEAKER_1:  I like having somebody that could be like, I don't think that's right because I have this other view.

03:51:41,506 --> 03:51:41,918
SPEAKER_1:  That's cool.

03:51:42,562 --> 03:51:44,318
SPEAKER_0:  And also like the threat of leaving.

03:51:45,090 --> 03:51:45,630
SPEAKER_0:  Oh yeah.

03:51:47,138 --> 03:51:48,263
SPEAKER_0:  Like that's a kind of common.

03:51:48,263 --> 03:51:49,374
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, that's true.

03:51:49,666 --> 03:51:52,350
SPEAKER_1:  Like you have to be good enough for the other person or maybe you'll lose them.

03:51:54,242 --> 03:51:57,758
SPEAKER_0:  And maybe a little jealousy. Like they're good at that, but not too much.

03:51:59,842 --> 03:52:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  But if you design all that in...

03:52:03,426 --> 03:52:04,542
SPEAKER_0:  then I don't know.

03:52:04,802 --> 03:52:05,534
SPEAKER_0:  Sounds romantic.

03:52:06,434 --> 03:52:07,710
SPEAKER_0:  Sounds romantic, okay.

03:52:08,130 --> 03:52:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  All right.

03:52:09,282 --> 03:52:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  I do want to really quickly ask you about this, about the rationalist community.

03:52:14,050 --> 03:52:14,494
SPEAKER_0:  because I've

03:52:16,098 --> 03:52:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  I've got to know a few of them a few times.

03:52:18,466 --> 03:52:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  You tweeted a guideline to rationalist discourse.

03:52:21,474 --> 03:52:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  basics of

03:52:22,882 --> 03:52:24,670
SPEAKER_0:  rationalist discourse from less wrong.

03:52:25,442 --> 03:52:27,742
SPEAKER_0:  What are these folks? What's the rationalist culture?

03:52:28,418 --> 03:52:29,726
SPEAKER_0:  What's rationalist discourse?

03:52:30,434 --> 03:52:36,766
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I love the rationalists because they're interested in like, how do you have conversations more effectively if you're trying to figure out what's actually true?

03:52:37,474 --> 03:52:37,822
SPEAKER_1:  and

03:52:38,178 --> 03:52:40,958
SPEAKER_1:  Which sounds kind of obvious, but in practice it's not usually.

03:52:41,634 --> 03:52:49,598
SPEAKER_1:  I remember when I first started having, you know, debating conversations, I was very antagonistic. I'm like, oh, I'm, you know, a feminist or not a feminist. And then the rationalists were generally like,

03:52:49,890 --> 03:52:52,318
SPEAKER_1:  Actually, we don't know what we mean by the term in this tutorial.

03:52:52,642 --> 03:52:55,166
SPEAKER_1:  Like, how do you feel about that? It was very-

03:52:55,490 --> 03:52:55,838
SPEAKER_1:  Thicc.

03:52:56,290 --> 03:52:56,638
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

03:52:56,898 --> 03:53:05,726
SPEAKER_1:  and compassionate. Like even if somebody says something that sounds insane, you're like, okay, well, we're going to respect your reasoning. And like, even if we disagree, let's actually figure out why you think the way that you think.

03:53:06,370 --> 03:53:06,718
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:53:07,138 --> 03:53:13,182
SPEAKER_1:  And they're also really smart, write a whole bunch of great stuff about how to think more clearly and with less bias.

03:53:14,274 --> 03:53:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I wonder what those conversations, because I've never really.

03:53:17,858 --> 03:53:18,814
SPEAKER_0:  Talk to those folks.

03:53:19,938 --> 03:53:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  So this guideline in particular, I think, has to refer to like shorthand.

03:53:24,930 --> 03:53:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  characteristics of rationalist discourse.

03:53:27,874 --> 03:53:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:53:28,962 --> 03:53:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  including expect good discourse to require energy.

03:53:32,098 --> 03:53:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  Don't say straightforwardly false things.

03:53:34,690 --> 03:53:37,310
SPEAKER_0:  Track for yourself and distinguish for others.

03:53:37,794 --> 03:53:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  your inferences from your observations, estimate for yourself, and make clear for others.

03:53:42,850 --> 03:53:48,190
SPEAKER_0:  your rough level of confidence in your assertions, make your claims clear, explicit and falsifiable or explicit.

03:53:48,450 --> 03:53:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  acknowledge that you are doing so.

03:53:51,618 --> 03:53:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  can't.

03:53:52,642 --> 03:53:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  so on and so forth. so

03:53:54,850 --> 03:53:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  Don't drop the conclusions.

03:53:57,122 --> 03:53:58,046
SPEAKER_0:  Don't weaponize.

03:53:58,370 --> 03:53:59,486
SPEAKER_0:  Equivocation.

03:53:59,746 --> 03:54:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  Don't abuse categories.

03:54:01,378 --> 03:54:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  Don't engage in aggressive guidelines.

03:54:04,162 --> 03:54:07,710
SPEAKER_0:  Don't engage. I do what I want. I'll let my emotions guide me.

03:54:07,938 --> 03:54:10,430
SPEAKER_1:  God damn it. They're pro that as long as you're explicit about it.

03:54:11,042 --> 03:54:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  Oh yeah.

03:54:12,546 --> 03:54:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  So you can be like a.

03:54:13,666 --> 03:54:15,541
SPEAKER_0:  A crazy asshole as long as you ex-

03:54:15,541 --> 03:54:18,878
SPEAKER_1:  You can be like epistemic status, crazy asshole.

03:54:18,978 --> 03:54:22,951
SPEAKER_0:  who's here to destroy the quality of the conversation.

03:54:22,951 --> 03:54:27,038
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's like a common misconception about rationalists is that they're kind of like spock

03:54:27,554 --> 03:54:32,542
SPEAKER_1:  Like, ah, we suppress emotion, we're thinking logically, herd eater. But I found this to be really not the case.

03:54:33,154 --> 03:54:48,734
SPEAKER_1:  I remember there's a less strong thread where I was like really emotional and I commented. And at the beginning I was like just warning, I'm just very emotional. And then I just vented my emotions and people responded really well to that. They're like, cool. Like you're just genuinely, truthfully expressing your state. This is actual information about the world is important to hear.

03:54:48,994 --> 03:54:52,990
SPEAKER_1:  And it's just, they're very interested in having things framed correctly. Like you shouldn't be cl-

03:54:53,314 --> 03:54:59,550
SPEAKER_1:  claiming that your emotions are necessarily a true version of the world. So as long as you're just clear about what the frame it is, you're fine.

03:55:02,402 --> 03:55:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  How do you feel about this conversation?

03:55:04,546 --> 03:55:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  Well, could we have done better?

03:55:08,226 --> 03:55:09,182
SPEAKER_1:  I like the conversation.

03:55:10,082 --> 03:55:12,094
SPEAKER_1:  I was a little worried coming in, I was like, what if...

03:55:12,418 --> 03:55:14,590
SPEAKER_1:  He only asks a couple questions and then we don't know what to talk about.

03:55:15,682 --> 03:55:16,807
SPEAKER_1:  but it's been quite a long.

03:55:16,807 --> 03:55:18,654
SPEAKER_0:  I know, I got covered.

03:55:19,010 --> 03:55:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  There's so many things I didn't cover.

03:55:21,090 --> 03:55:22,270
SPEAKER_1:  I like the...

03:55:22,562 --> 03:55:23,326
SPEAKER_1:  You have like a

03:55:23,778 --> 03:55:26,238
SPEAKER_1:  Like, I'm not used to talking to somebody who feels like-

03:55:26,562 --> 03:55:29,246
SPEAKER_1:  some of the core way that they approach the world so different than mine.

03:55:29,506 --> 03:55:38,366
SPEAKER_1:  Like usually the differences arrive like higher up the tree, but like there's something about like your root system that I think is very different from mine. But also the way that you engage with others is still flexible.

03:55:39,138 --> 03:55:44,094
SPEAKER_1:  Like usually when I encounter somebody with such a different root system, there's like, it's like more aggressive or something.

03:55:44,802 --> 03:55:48,222
SPEAKER_1:  But there's something about the way that you're structured that feels very...

03:55:48,322 --> 03:55:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  Thanks for watching!

03:55:51,810 --> 03:55:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I'm really happy we talked.

03:55:53,922 --> 03:55:58,014
SPEAKER_0:  Something tells me we'll probably talk a bunch more times. I think you're fascinating him being-

03:55:58,370 --> 03:56:00,606
SPEAKER_0:  I think I'm a huge fan of your work.

03:56:01,090 --> 03:56:03,486
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe one more question. What's the meaning of life?

03:56:04,930 --> 03:56:06,814
SPEAKER_1:  to want things to search.

03:56:07,778 --> 03:56:08,702
SPEAKER_1:  to be in.

03:56:09,762 --> 03:56:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  I think your curiosity is like somehow getting to that.

03:56:12,418 --> 03:56:12,894
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

03:56:13,186 --> 03:56:16,062
SPEAKER_1:  It's like curiosity, like you don't know.

03:56:16,418 --> 03:56:19,793
SPEAKER_1:  I want to know the answer, to like be in the state of yearning.

03:56:19,793 --> 03:56:21,182
SPEAKER_0:  of wanting, of you.

03:56:21,634 --> 03:56:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  I wonder if you could do that if you lived a million years, just keep earning always.

03:56:25,442 --> 03:56:28,286
SPEAKER_0:  That's the thing I'm probably afraid of, fellow death a million years.

03:56:28,770 --> 03:56:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  It's not the torture, it's like the yearning will fade.

03:56:31,554 --> 03:56:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  They probably yearned to die then.

03:56:34,498 --> 03:56:35,582
SPEAKER_0:  I just sitting there.

03:56:37,346 --> 03:56:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  wanting.

03:56:38,658 --> 03:56:41,077
SPEAKER_0:  death intensely.

03:56:41,077 --> 03:56:43,934
SPEAKER_1:  That's kind of romantic a little bit.

03:56:44,258 --> 03:56:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  That's like a.

03:56:45,282 --> 03:56:46,302
SPEAKER_1:  bit of that spark.

03:56:47,394 --> 03:56:49,150
SPEAKER_0:  and constantly being denied.

03:56:49,762 --> 03:56:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  Wow.

03:56:50,978 --> 03:56:53,598
SPEAKER_0:  So most of your existence on earth would be spent.

03:56:54,242 --> 03:56:54,878
SPEAKER_0:  deeply.

03:56:55,778 --> 03:56:58,526
SPEAKER_0:  Intimate with death just thinking about death

03:56:59,330 --> 03:57:02,718
SPEAKER_0:  I think we're already doing that, but I like hiding that from ourselves a little bit.

03:57:03,394 --> 03:57:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  Anyway.

03:57:04,354 --> 03:57:04,894
SPEAKER_0:  wanting.

03:57:05,730 --> 03:57:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  Well.

03:57:06,754 --> 03:57:08,222

03:57:27,042 --> 03:57:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  Let me leave you with some words from Richard Feynman.

03:57:30,082 --> 03:57:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  Physics is like sex.

03:57:32,322 --> 03:57:34,558
