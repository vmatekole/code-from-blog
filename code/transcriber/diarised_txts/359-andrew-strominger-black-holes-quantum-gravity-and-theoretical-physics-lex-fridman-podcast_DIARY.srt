00:00:00,194 --> 00:00:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  The black hole is a mirror.

00:00:03,106 --> 00:00:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  And the way it's a mirror is if light...

00:00:05,954 --> 00:00:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  a photon.

00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,830
SPEAKER_0:  bounces off your face.

00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:11,326
SPEAKER_0:  towards the black hole.

00:00:11,618 --> 00:00:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  It goes straight to the black hole.

00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  just falls in and never see it again.

00:00:16,802 --> 00:00:18,782
SPEAKER_0:  But if it just misses the black hole...

00:00:20,706 --> 00:00:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  it'll swing around the back.

00:00:22,978 --> 00:00:23,966
SPEAKER_0:  and come back to you.

00:00:25,122 --> 00:00:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  and you see yourself.

00:00:27,138 --> 00:00:27,486
SPEAKER_0:  from the.

00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  photon that went around the back of the black hole.

00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  But not only can that happen...

00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  the black hole the photon can swing around twice.

00:00:39,138 --> 00:00:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  and come back. So you actually see an infinite number of copies.

00:00:43,618 --> 00:00:44,190
SPEAKER_0:  of yourself.

00:00:46,754 --> 00:00:49,310
SPEAKER_1:  The following is a conversation with Andrew Strominger.

00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,358
SPEAKER_1:  theoretical physicist at Harvard.

00:00:51,682 --> 00:00:56,350
SPEAKER_1:  whose research seeks to shed light on the unification of fundamental laws of nature

00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,174
SPEAKER_1:  The origin of the universe.

00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:02,174
SPEAKER_1:  and the quantum structure of black holes and event horizons.

00:01:02,722 --> 00:01:04,478
SPEAKER_1:  This is the Lux Freebman Podcast.

00:01:04,738 --> 00:01:05,342
SPEAKER_1:  SUPPORT IT!

00:01:05,602 --> 00:01:07,614
SPEAKER_1:  please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,310
SPEAKER_1:  And now, dear friends,

00:01:09,794 --> 00:01:10,654
SPEAKER_1:  Here's Andrew.

00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:11,678
SPEAKER_1:  stronger.

00:01:12,802 --> 00:01:13,598
SPEAKER_1:  You are.

00:01:13,826 --> 00:01:16,318
SPEAKER_1:  part of the Harvard Black Hole Initiative.

00:01:16,738 --> 00:01:20,862
SPEAKER_1:  which has theoretical physicists, experimentalists, and even philosophers.

00:01:21,378 --> 00:01:24,318
SPEAKER_1:  So let me ask the big question, what is a black hole?

00:01:24,642 --> 00:01:25,150
SPEAKER_1:  from A.

00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,302
SPEAKER_1:  theoretical.

00:01:26,626 --> 00:01:27,774
SPEAKER_1:  from an experimental.

00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,005
SPEAKER_1:  maybe even from a philosophical perspective.

00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  perspective.

00:01:30,946 --> 00:01:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  So a black hole.

00:01:32,706 --> 00:01:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  is.

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  Defined.

00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:35,422
SPEAKER_0:  theoretically.

00:01:36,098 --> 00:01:38,494
SPEAKER_0:  as a region of space-time.

00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  from which light can

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,174
SPEAKER_0:  Never escape.

00:01:42,498 --> 00:01:43,070
SPEAKER_0:  Therefore...

00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:43,806
SPEAKER_0:  It's black.

00:01:44,962 --> 00:01:45,278
SPEAKER_0:  Now.

00:01:45,794 --> 00:01:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  That's just the starting point.

00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  many weird things.

00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:50,142
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:01:50,722 --> 00:01:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  follow from that basic definition, but that is.

00:01:54,818 --> 00:01:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  That is the basic definition.

00:01:56,642 --> 00:01:57,406
SPEAKER_1:  What is light?

00:01:58,306 --> 00:01:59,838
SPEAKER_1:  They can't escape from a black hole.

00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  Well, light is the stuff that comes out of the sun, that stuff that goes into your eyes.

00:02:06,498 --> 00:02:06,942
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,190
SPEAKER_0:  Light is one of the...

00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  The stuff that disappears when the lights go off?

00:02:11,394 --> 00:02:12,254
SPEAKER_0:  This is stuff that...

00:02:12,642 --> 00:02:14,046
SPEAKER_0:  when the lights come on.

00:02:14,562 --> 00:02:15,038
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:02:15,362 --> 00:02:18,366
SPEAKER_0:  Of course, I could give you a mathematical definition, but...

00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  or physical mathematical definition.

00:02:21,634 --> 00:02:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's something that we.

00:02:23,714 --> 00:02:24,286
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhh...

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,198
SPEAKER_0:  will understand very intuitively.

00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,406
SPEAKER_0:  what is light.

00:02:29,826 --> 00:02:34,110
SPEAKER_0:  Black holes on the other hand, we don't understand it. They're very weird.

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:35,550
SPEAKER_0:  And

00:02:36,802 --> 00:02:40,318
SPEAKER_0:  What are the questions is about black holes, which I.

00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:42,078
SPEAKER_0:  think you were alluding to.

00:02:42,658 --> 00:02:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  is

00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:45,246
SPEAKER_0:  You know, why?

00:02:45,602 --> 00:02:49,278
SPEAKER_0:  doesn't like get out or how is it that there can be a region of

00:02:49,538 --> 00:02:50,366
SPEAKER_0:  Space time.

00:02:51,362 --> 00:02:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  from which.

00:02:52,546 --> 00:02:53,822
SPEAKER_0:  Light can't escape.

00:02:54,754 --> 00:02:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  It definitely...

00:02:55,938 --> 00:02:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  happens.

00:02:57,058 --> 00:02:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  We've seen those regions.

00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  We have spectacular pictures, especially.

00:03:02,146 --> 00:03:03,710
SPEAKER_0:  in the last several years.

00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  of those regions.

00:03:05,762 --> 00:03:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  Um, they're there.

00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,982
SPEAKER_0:  back there up in the sky.

00:03:10,242 --> 00:03:11,070
SPEAKER_0:  Thousands are

00:03:11,426 --> 00:03:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  Millions of them.

00:03:13,346 --> 00:03:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  We don't yet know how many.

00:03:15,682 --> 00:03:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,886
SPEAKER_0:  But the...

00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  proper explanation.

00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,022
SPEAKER_0:  of.

00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,446
SPEAKER_0:  why light doesn't escape from.

00:03:25,794 --> 00:03:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:03:27,202 --> 00:03:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  A black hole.

00:03:28,546 --> 00:03:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  is still.

00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:30,590
SPEAKER_0:  uh

00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  matter of some debate.

00:03:32,994 --> 00:03:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  And.

00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  One explanation.

00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:39,902
SPEAKER_0:  which perhaps...

00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  Einstein might have given.

00:03:43,042 --> 00:03:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  is

00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  that

00:03:44,898 --> 00:03:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  light

00:03:45,986 --> 00:03:46,910
SPEAKER_0:  cares energy.

00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,030
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  You know it carries energy because...

00:03:50,978 --> 00:03:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we have...

00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,454
SPEAKER_0:  photo cells and we can take the light from the sun and.

00:03:55,746 --> 00:03:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  Collect it.

00:03:56,674 --> 00:03:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  turn it into electricity.

00:03:58,274 --> 00:03:59,486
SPEAKER_0:  So there's energy.

00:03:59,746 --> 00:04:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  in life.

00:04:01,026 --> 00:04:02,974
SPEAKER_0:  and anything that carries energy.

00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  is subject to a gravitational pull.

00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:09,118
SPEAKER_0:  Gravity will pull at anything with energy.

00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  Now it turns out that the gravitational pull...

00:04:15,362 --> 00:04:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  exerted by an object.

00:04:17,826 --> 00:04:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  Alright.

00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,958
SPEAKER_0:  is proportional to its mass.

00:04:22,018 --> 00:04:24,670
SPEAKER_0:  And so if you get enough mass.

00:04:25,346 --> 00:04:25,950
SPEAKER_0:  in

00:04:26,722 --> 00:04:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  a small enough region.

00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  You.

00:04:32,386 --> 00:04:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  you can

00:04:34,082 --> 00:04:35,902
SPEAKER_0:  prevent light from escaping.

00:04:36,162 --> 00:04:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  And let me.

00:04:37,282 --> 00:04:38,494
SPEAKER_0:  flesh that out a little more.

00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  If you're...

00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  on the Earth.

00:04:44,354 --> 00:04:44,798
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:04:46,082 --> 00:04:47,774
SPEAKER_0:  you're on a rocket ship leaving this.

00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:48,574
SPEAKER_0:  The.

00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:51,262
SPEAKER_0:  surface of the Earth and if we ignore the

00:04:51,778 --> 00:04:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  friction from the air.

00:04:53,858 --> 00:04:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:59,230
SPEAKER_0:  if your rocket accelerates up to 11 kilometers per second.

00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  That's escape velocity.

00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  And it can.

00:05:03,106 --> 00:05:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  If there were no friction, it could just continue forever to the next galaxy.

00:05:08,802 --> 00:05:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  On the Moon, which has less mass,

00:05:11,586 --> 00:05:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  It's only seven kilometers.

00:05:13,634 --> 00:05:14,142
SPEAKER_0:  per second.

00:05:16,642 --> 00:05:19,134
SPEAKER_0:  So, but going in the other direction, if you have

00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:20,862
SPEAKER_0:  Enough!

00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  mass in one place, the escape velocity.

00:05:25,282 --> 00:05:26,782
SPEAKER_0:  can become.

00:05:27,074 --> 00:05:28,030
SPEAKER_0:  the speed of light.

00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  If you shine light straight up away from the Earth, it doesn't have too much trouble. It's going way above the escape velocity.

00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  And.

00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:41,086
SPEAKER_0:  but if you have enough mass there...

00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  Even light can't escape.

00:05:43,714 --> 00:05:44,926
SPEAKER_0:  escape velocity.

00:05:45,474 --> 00:05:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  And according to...

00:05:48,226 --> 00:05:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  Einstein's

00:05:49,538 --> 00:05:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  theory of.

00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:51,262
SPEAKER_0:  Relativity.

00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  There is an absolute speed limit.

00:05:54,402 --> 00:05:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  In the universe.

00:05:56,194 --> 00:05:57,278
SPEAKER_0:  The speed of light.

00:05:57,954 --> 00:05:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  and nothing.

00:05:59,586 --> 00:06:02,590
SPEAKER_0:  makes any sense. Nothing could be self-consistent.

00:06:03,138 --> 00:06:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  if there were objects that could exceed.

00:06:05,762 --> 00:06:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  My speed.

00:06:08,162 --> 00:06:09,886
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

00:06:10,114 --> 00:06:14,238
SPEAKER_0:  in these very, very massive regions of space-time, even light.

00:06:14,786 --> 00:06:15,582
SPEAKER_0:  Cannot escape.

00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,070
SPEAKER_1:  And the interesting thing is Einstein himself didn't think that...

00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,054
SPEAKER_1:  uh... these

00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,702
SPEAKER_1:  objects, we call the black holes, could exist.

00:06:25,026 --> 00:06:26,151
SPEAKER_1:  let me actually linger on this

00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:27,651
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, that's incredibly interesting.

00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:30,238
SPEAKER_1:  There's a lot of interesting things here. First, the speed limit.

00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  How wild!

00:06:32,962 --> 00:06:37,406
SPEAKER_1:  is it to you if you put yourself in the mind in the time of Einstein before him?

00:06:37,954 --> 00:06:40,862
SPEAKER_1:  to come up with a speed limit of, that there is a speed limit.

00:06:41,378 --> 00:06:43,646
SPEAKER_1:  that and that speed limit is the speed of light.

00:06:44,226 --> 00:06:52,798
SPEAKER_1:  How difficult of an idea is that? You know, you said from a mathematical physics perspective, everything just kind of falls into place, but...

00:06:53,282 --> 00:06:54,046
SPEAKER_1:  He wasn't.

00:06:55,714 --> 00:07:01,886
SPEAKER_1:  perhaps maybe initially had the luxury to think mathematically he had to come up with it intuitively? Yesота

00:07:02,306 --> 00:07:03,038
SPEAKER_1:  So like what?

00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:05,598
SPEAKER_1:  How common intuitive is this notion to you?

00:07:05,922 --> 00:07:07,797
SPEAKER_1:  Well, is it still crazy?

00:07:07,797 --> 00:07:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  No, no.

00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  It's a very funny thing in physics.

00:07:12,194 --> 00:07:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  best discoveries.

00:07:14,082 --> 00:07:14,942
SPEAKER_0:  Seam.

00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,950
SPEAKER_0:  completely obvious in retrospect.

00:07:19,234 --> 00:07:20,190
SPEAKER_0:  Even my own.

00:07:20,418 --> 00:07:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  discoveries, which of course are far lesser than.

00:07:23,202 --> 00:07:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  Einstein's.

00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  But many of my papers, many of my collaborators...

00:07:27,618 --> 00:07:28,926
SPEAKER_0:  get all confused.

00:07:29,506 --> 00:07:33,534
SPEAKER_0:  We'll try to understand something. We say, we've got to solve this problem. We'll get all confused.

00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,222
SPEAKER_0:  Finally, we'll solve it, we'll get it all together.

00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,078
SPEAKER_0:  And...

00:07:39,298 --> 00:07:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  Then we'll.

00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  Well, all of a sudden everything will fall into place.

00:07:42,978 --> 00:07:43,806
SPEAKER_0:  We'll explain it.

00:07:44,258 --> 00:07:46,494
SPEAKER_0:  And then we'll look back at our discussion.

00:07:46,914 --> 00:07:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  for the proceedings of months.

00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:50,590
SPEAKER_0:  Literally.

00:07:51,266 --> 00:07:52,670
SPEAKER_0:  unable to reconstruct.

00:07:53,954 --> 00:07:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  how confused we were.

00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:07:55,874 --> 00:07:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  and how we could ever have thought of it.

00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,326
SPEAKER_0:  any other way.

00:08:00,162 --> 00:08:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  So not only can I not...

00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:03,742
SPEAKER_0:  Fathom.

00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  How confused.

00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:08,894
SPEAKER_0:  Einstein was.

00:08:09,634 --> 00:08:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  before he went.

00:08:11,234 --> 00:08:13,790
SPEAKER_0:  when he started thinking about the issues.

00:08:14,146 --> 00:08:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  I can't even.

00:08:15,586 --> 00:08:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  reconstruct my own confusion.

00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  from two weeks ago.

00:08:20,706 --> 00:08:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  So, the really beautiful ideas that physics have this.

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  very hard to get yourself back into the mindset.

00:08:28,482 --> 00:08:30,558
SPEAKER_0:  Of course, Einstein was confused.

00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:32,382
SPEAKER_0:  about.

00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  many, many things.

00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:35,454
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:08:36,546 --> 00:08:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  It doesn't matter if you're a physicist. It's not how many things you got wrong.

00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  It's not the ratio.

00:08:41,602 --> 00:08:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  of how many you got wrong.

00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  company got right.

00:08:44,642 --> 00:08:46,014
SPEAKER_0:  It's the number that you got right.

00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,638
SPEAKER_0:  So Einstein...

00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,070
SPEAKER_0:  didn't believe black holes existed?

00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:53,182
SPEAKER_0:  even though he predicted them?

00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  And I went and I read that paper which he wrote, you know...

00:08:56,642 --> 00:08:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  Einstein wrote down his field equations and

00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  1915?

00:09:01,986 --> 00:09:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  and short chilled.

00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  and discovered the black hole solution.

00:09:06,882 --> 00:09:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

00:09:07,586 --> 00:09:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  three or four months later in very early 1916.

00:09:12,002 --> 00:09:12,894
SPEAKER_0:  And, um...

00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,294
SPEAKER_0:  25 years later.

00:09:15,874 --> 00:09:20,190
SPEAKER_0:  Einstein wrote a paper. So with 25 years to think about what this solution.

00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  means.

00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  wrote a paper.

00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  in which he said that black holes.

00:09:25,602 --> 00:09:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  didn't exist.

00:09:28,514 --> 00:09:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm like, whoa.

00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:31,870
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

00:09:32,482 --> 00:09:35,902
SPEAKER_0:  If one of my students in my general relativity course wrote this.

00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I wouldn't pass them.

00:09:38,722 --> 00:09:41,347
SPEAKER_1:  You get a scene mind. Oh, you went past him. Okay.

00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  to C minus..

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,725
SPEAKER_0:  Same thing with gravity waves. We didn't believe it.

00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:46,225
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, he didn't believe in gravitational waves.

00:09:46,225 --> 00:09:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  He went back and forth, but he wrote a paper and I think

00:09:49,634 --> 00:09:50,366
SPEAKER_0:  34?

00:09:50,946 --> 00:09:53,182
SPEAKER_0:  saying that gravity waves didn't exist because...

00:09:53,954 --> 00:09:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  people were very confused about what a coordinate transformation is.

00:09:57,538 --> 00:10:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  And in fact, this confusion about what a coordinate transformation...

00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:02,558
SPEAKER_0:  is.

00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:04,254
SPEAKER_0:  has persisted.

00:10:05,026 --> 00:10:05,598
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:10:06,178 --> 00:10:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  We actually think...

00:10:08,898 --> 00:10:10,878
SPEAKER_0:  We were on the...

00:10:11,746 --> 00:10:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  edge of solving it.

00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  hundred years later.

00:10:16,802 --> 00:10:18,677
SPEAKER_0:  100 years later.

00:10:18,677 --> 00:10:20,254
SPEAKER_1:  What is coordinate transformation?

00:10:20,802 --> 00:10:22,718
SPEAKER_1:  as it was 100 years ago to today.

00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,566
SPEAKER_0:  Let's imagine I want to.

00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:26,814
SPEAKER_0:  Draw a map.

00:10:27,298 --> 00:10:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  with pictures.

00:10:28,866 --> 00:10:31,358
SPEAKER_0:  of all the states and the mountains. And then I want to.

00:10:32,322 --> 00:10:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  draw.

00:10:33,186 --> 00:10:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  the weather forecast, what the temperatures are going to be.

00:10:36,674 --> 00:10:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  all over the...

00:10:38,242 --> 00:10:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  country.

00:10:39,842 --> 00:10:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  And I do that.

00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  using one set of weather stations.

00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  and I number the weather stations.

00:10:48,098 --> 00:10:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  And you have some other set of.

00:10:50,626 --> 00:10:51,710
SPEAKER_0:  weather stations.

00:10:52,482 --> 00:10:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  And you-

00:10:53,922 --> 00:10:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  do the same thing.

00:10:55,394 --> 00:11:00,990
SPEAKER_0:  So the coordinates are the locations of the weather stations. They're how we describe where the things are.

00:11:01,826 --> 00:11:03,006
SPEAKER_0:  At the end of the day...

00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  We should draw the same.

00:11:07,682 --> 00:11:09,278
SPEAKER_0:  That is coordinate invariance.

00:11:10,178 --> 00:11:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  And if we're telling somebody...

00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  We're going to tell somebody at a real physical operation, we want you to...

00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,862
SPEAKER_0:  stay as dry as possible on your drive from here to California.

00:11:21,538 --> 00:11:24,286
SPEAKER_0:  we should give them exactly the same route.

00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,990
SPEAKER_0:  No matter which weather stations we use or how we, you know.

00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:30,910
SPEAKER_0:  It's very trivial.

00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:32,062
SPEAKER_0:  It's, it's...

00:11:32,322 --> 00:11:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  The labeling of points is an artifact.

00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,734
SPEAKER_0:  not in the real physics.

00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  So it turns out that that's.

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  Almost true.

00:11:44,322 --> 00:11:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  But.

00:11:45,282 --> 00:11:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  But not quite.

00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  there's some subtleties to it.

00:11:49,506 --> 00:11:54,558
SPEAKER_1:  statement that you should always have the same give it this the same kind of trajectory the same kind of

00:11:54,786 --> 00:11:55,518
SPEAKER_1:  instructions.

00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:57,191
SPEAKER_1:  No matter the weather station. Yeah.

00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:59,102
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, there's some very...

00:11:59,426 --> 00:12:00,766
SPEAKER_0:  delicate subtleties.

00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  to that.

00:12:01,986 --> 00:12:02,494
SPEAKER_0:  which

00:12:04,322 --> 00:12:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  began to be noticed in the

00:12:06,786 --> 00:12:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  in the 50s.

00:12:08,738 --> 00:12:10,558
SPEAKER_0:  It's mostly true, but...

00:12:10,882 --> 00:12:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  When you

00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:12,510
SPEAKER_0:  have.

00:12:12,738 --> 00:12:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  a space time with.

00:12:14,658 --> 00:12:15,294
SPEAKER_0:  Edges?

00:12:16,514 --> 00:12:19,139
SPEAKER_0:  It gets very tricky how you label the edges.

00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:22,139
SPEAKER_1:  space time in terms of space or in terms of time in terms of everything.

00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  just space either one.

00:12:23,522 --> 00:12:25,246
SPEAKER_0:  That gets very tricky.

00:12:25,474 --> 00:12:27,262
SPEAKER_0:  And Einstein.

00:12:27,906 --> 00:12:28,286
SPEAKER_0:  didn't.

00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  didn't have it right. In fact, he had an earlier…

00:12:34,562 --> 00:12:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  version of general relativity.

00:12:38,082 --> 00:12:39,710
SPEAKER_0:  in 1914?

00:12:40,034 --> 00:12:41,982
SPEAKER_0:  which he was very excited about.

00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  which was...

00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:46,110
SPEAKER_0:  Wrong.

00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:47,678
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:12:47,938 --> 00:12:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  gave it wasn't fully coordinate invariant, it was only partially coordinate invariant.

00:12:53,282 --> 00:12:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  It was wrong?

00:12:55,298 --> 00:12:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  It gave the wrong answer for bending light to the sun.

00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,382
SPEAKER_0:  by a factor of two.

00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  There was an expedition.

00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  sent out to measure it.

00:13:04,994 --> 00:13:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  during World War I.

00:13:06,818 --> 00:13:07,678
SPEAKER_0:  They were captured.

00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  before they could.

00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  measures and that gave Einstein four more years.

00:13:15,746 --> 00:13:20,062
SPEAKER_0:  to clean his act up by which time he'd gotten it right.

00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  So it's a very tricky business, but once it's all laid out.

00:13:24,802 --> 00:13:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  It seems...

00:13:27,618 --> 00:13:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  It's clear.

00:13:29,122 --> 00:13:30,334
SPEAKER_1:  Then why do you think...

00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,838
SPEAKER_1:  Einstein.

00:13:32,674 --> 00:13:35,198
SPEAKER_1:  didn't believe his own equations.

00:13:35,426 --> 00:13:36,958
SPEAKER_1:  and didn't think that black holes are real.

00:13:37,218 --> 00:13:39,102
SPEAKER_1:  Why was that such a difficult idea for him?

00:13:39,874 --> 00:13:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  Well...

00:13:40,898 --> 00:13:43,390
SPEAKER_0:  something very interesting happens.

00:13:43,842 --> 00:13:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:13:45,474 --> 00:13:47,742
SPEAKER_0:  Schwarzschild solution of the Einstein equation.

00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  I think his reasoning was...

00:13:53,794 --> 00:13:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  Ultimately wrong, but let me...

00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:57,790
SPEAKER_0:  Explained to you.

00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  Wow.

00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  what it was.

00:14:01,346 --> 00:14:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:14:03,746 --> 00:14:06,558
SPEAKER_0:  at the center of the black hole behind the horizon.

00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  in a region that nobody can.

00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,990
SPEAKER_0:  see and live to tell about it.

00:14:14,242 --> 00:14:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  As the center of the black hole, there's a singularity. There really are more spirits than there ever were in a few.

00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:21,182
SPEAKER_0:  past the horizon. You go into the singularity, you get crushed.

00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  And that's the end of everything.

00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  Now.

00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,742
SPEAKER_0:  The word singularity.

00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:29,854
SPEAKER_0:  Means

00:14:30,274 --> 00:14:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  that

00:14:32,802 --> 00:14:34,110
SPEAKER_0:  It just means that.

00:14:34,338 --> 00:14:35,934
SPEAKER_0:  Einstein's equations.

00:14:36,514 --> 00:14:37,342
SPEAKER_0:  breakdown.

00:14:38,818 --> 00:14:40,030
SPEAKER_0:  They become infinite.

00:14:40,642 --> 00:14:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  You write them down, you put them on the computer, when the computer hits that singularity.

00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,526
SPEAKER_0:  It crashes.

00:14:47,362 --> 00:14:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  everything becomes infinite, there's two.

00:14:50,786 --> 00:14:52,446
SPEAKER_0:  So the equations are just no good there.

00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:54,846
SPEAKER_0:  Now...

00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,726
SPEAKER_0:  That's actually...

00:14:59,778 --> 00:15:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  Bad thing.

00:15:01,058 --> 00:15:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  It's a really good thing.

00:15:02,562 --> 00:15:03,678
SPEAKER_0:  And let me explain why.

00:15:04,962 --> 00:15:05,534
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:15:06,402 --> 00:15:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:15:09,538 --> 00:15:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  It's-

00:15:10,306 --> 00:15:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  An odd thing.

00:15:12,258 --> 00:15:14,014
SPEAKER_0:  that Maxwell's theory.

00:15:14,946 --> 00:15:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  and Newton's theory.

00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:18,142
SPEAKER_0:  Never.

00:15:18,882 --> 00:15:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  exhibit this phenomenon.

00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:26,686
SPEAKER_0:  You write them down, you can solve them exactly. They're really Newton's theory of gravity. They're really very simple.

00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  Theories.

00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  you can solve them, well, you can't solve the three-body problem but

00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:32,542
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:15:33,698 --> 00:15:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  You can certainly.

00:15:34,818 --> 00:15:36,414
SPEAKER_0:  solve a lot of things about them.

00:15:38,786 --> 00:15:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  Nevertheless...

00:15:41,538 --> 00:15:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  There was never...

00:15:43,074 --> 00:15:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  any reason.

00:15:46,306 --> 00:15:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  Even though...

00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  Maxwell and Newton, perhaps.

00:15:51,106 --> 00:15:52,446
SPEAKER_0:  fell for this trap.

00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  There were never any reason.

00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  to think that these equations...

00:15:57,634 --> 00:15:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  or exact.

00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,398
SPEAKER_0:  And.

00:16:03,202 --> 00:16:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  Every... there's no equation.

00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  There's some equations that we've written down that we still...

00:16:11,106 --> 00:16:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  Think her exact.

00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  Some people still think they're exact.

00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,115
SPEAKER_0:  My view is that there's no exact equation.

00:16:18,115 --> 00:16:22,622
SPEAKER_1:  Everything is an approximation. Everything is an approximation. I'm trying to get as close as possible.

00:16:23,554 --> 00:16:26,014
SPEAKER_1:  see that you saying objective truth doesn't exist

00:16:27,522 --> 00:16:29,397
SPEAKER_1:  The internet's gonna be very mad at you.

00:16:29,397 --> 00:16:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  We could discuss that, but that's a different thing.

00:16:33,346 --> 00:16:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,966
SPEAKER_0:  We wouldn't say Newton's theory was wrong.

00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  It had very, very small corrections.

00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  incredibly small corrections.

00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  It's actually a puzzle why they're so small.

00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  So if you watch the procession of Mercury's perihelion, this was the first indication.

00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:51,838
SPEAKER_0:  of something going.

00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  Wrong.

00:16:53,314 --> 00:16:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  According to Newton's theory...

00:16:55,106 --> 00:16:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  Mercury has an elliptical orbit.

00:16:57,954 --> 00:16:58,558
SPEAKER_0:  The.

00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  Long part of it.

00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  moves around.

00:17:02,434 --> 00:17:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  as other planets come by.

00:17:05,282 --> 00:17:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  and so on.

00:17:06,754 --> 00:17:09,630
SPEAKER_0:  And so this was measured by Le Verrier.

00:17:09,954 --> 00:17:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  1859 and

00:17:11,714 --> 00:17:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  He compared.

00:17:13,506 --> 00:17:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  theory and experiment.

00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:19,998
SPEAKER_0:  and he found out that the perihelion process moves around the...

00:17:20,258 --> 00:17:20,862
SPEAKER_0:  the sun.

00:17:21,762 --> 00:17:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  once every 200 and...

00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:26,110
SPEAKER_0:  33.

00:17:26,466 --> 00:17:29,886
SPEAKER_0:  centuries instead of every 231 centuries.

00:17:30,978 --> 00:17:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  Now this is the wonderful thing about science.

00:17:34,338 --> 00:17:35,582
SPEAKER_0:  Why was this guy?

00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:40,030
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, you don't get any idea how much work this is.

00:17:40,962 --> 00:17:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  But of course he made one of the greatest discoveries of the.

00:17:44,418 --> 00:17:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  History of science without

00:17:46,178 --> 00:17:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

00:17:47,074 --> 00:17:47,998
SPEAKER_0:  even knowing what it-

00:17:48,322 --> 00:17:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  What good are whiskers, babe?

00:17:52,962 --> 00:17:57,374
SPEAKER_0:  So that's how small, that was the first sign that there was something wrong with NUT.

00:18:00,034 --> 00:18:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  No, so the corrections to Newton's law are very, very small, but they're definitely there.

00:18:06,242 --> 00:18:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  The corrections to electromagnetism.

00:18:09,826 --> 00:18:12,478
SPEAKER_0:  They're mostly the ones that we see are mostly.

00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  coming from quantum effects.

00:18:16,226 --> 00:18:17,351
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

00:18:17,351 --> 00:18:20,766
SPEAKER_1:  So the corrections are for Maxwell's.

00:18:21,378 --> 00:18:22,014
SPEAKER_1:  equations.

00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,406
SPEAKER_1:  is when you get super tiny and then the corrections for the.

00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:26,526
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:18:27,138 --> 00:18:27,934
SPEAKER_1:  for Newtons.

00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:28,862
SPEAKER_1:  whaaaaa

00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,582
SPEAKER_1:  lost gravity is when you get super big.

00:18:32,674 --> 00:18:34,549
SPEAKER_1:  That's when you require correction.

00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:38,174
SPEAKER_0:  That's true, but I would phrase it as saying when it's super accurate.

00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:40,478
SPEAKER_0:  If you look at the Bohr atom...

00:18:41,602 --> 00:18:45,438
SPEAKER_0:  Maxwell electromagnetism is not a very good approximation.

00:18:46,018 --> 00:18:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  to the force between the proton.

00:18:49,186 --> 00:18:49,950
SPEAKER_0:  and the electron.

00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  the quantum mechanics.

00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  If you...

00:18:54,114 --> 00:18:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  If you didn't have quantum mechanics, the electron would...

00:18:57,186 --> 00:18:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  would spiral into the proton.

00:18:59,714 --> 00:19:00,254
SPEAKER_0:  And.

00:19:00,546 --> 00:19:04,254
SPEAKER_0:  the atom would collapse. So that's a huge correction there.

00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:08,062
SPEAKER_0:  So every theory gets corrected as we learn more.

00:19:09,346 --> 00:19:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  Dude, just-

00:19:10,658 --> 00:19:12,318
SPEAKER_0:  be no reason to suppose that it

00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,110
SPEAKER_0:  should be otherwise.

00:19:14,594 --> 00:19:17,219
SPEAKER_1:  How's this related to singularity?

00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  So when you hit the singularity...

00:19:19,586 --> 00:19:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

00:19:20,898 --> 00:19:22,302
SPEAKER_0:  that you need.

00:19:22,722 --> 00:19:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  some.

00:19:24,066 --> 00:19:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  Improvement.

00:19:25,922 --> 00:19:26,942
SPEAKER_0:  to Einstein's.

00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  Theory of Gravity.

00:19:28,962 --> 00:19:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  and that improvement, we understand what kind of things that improvement.

00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,686
SPEAKER_0:  should evolve.

00:19:35,394 --> 00:19:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  It should involve quantum mechanics, quantum effects become.

00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  Important there, it's a small thing.

00:19:42,146 --> 00:19:43,518
SPEAKER_0:  And, um...

00:19:45,154 --> 00:19:48,030
SPEAKER_0:  We don't understand exactly what the theory is, but we know.

00:19:48,578 --> 00:19:49,950
SPEAKER_0:  There's no reason to think.

00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  Einstein's theory was invented to describe

00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,542
SPEAKER_0:  weekly curves.

00:19:56,994 --> 00:19:59,454
SPEAKER_0:  things, the solar system, and so on.

00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  It's incredibly robust that we now see that it.

00:20:03,586 --> 00:20:04,606
SPEAKER_0:  works very well.

00:20:05,058 --> 00:20:06,622
SPEAKER_0:  near the horizons of

00:20:07,362 --> 00:20:09,214
SPEAKER_0:  around black holes and so on.

00:20:09,698 --> 00:20:10,046
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:20:10,818 --> 00:20:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  So it's a good thing.

00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,326
SPEAKER_0:  that the theory drives itself.

00:20:16,418 --> 00:20:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  that it predicts its own demise.

00:20:20,482 --> 00:20:22,814
SPEAKER_0:  Newton's gravity had its demise.

00:20:23,426 --> 00:20:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  there were regimes in which it wasn't valid.

00:20:26,754 --> 00:20:29,310
SPEAKER_0:  Maxwell's electromagnetism had its...

00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,366
SPEAKER_0:

00:20:30,914 --> 00:20:31,646
SPEAKER_0:  There was.

00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhh...

00:20:33,474 --> 00:20:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  regimes in which quantum effects greatly modified.

00:20:37,282 --> 00:20:38,782
SPEAKER_0:  the equations.

00:20:39,746 --> 00:20:40,158
SPEAKER_0:  But

00:20:41,218 --> 00:20:43,806
SPEAKER_0:  general relativity all on its own.

00:20:45,986 --> 00:20:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  found.

00:20:47,394 --> 00:20:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  draw a system which originally

00:20:50,306 --> 00:20:51,294
SPEAKER_0:  was fine.

00:20:51,746 --> 00:20:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  would perversely wander off.

00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  into

00:20:56,034 --> 00:20:57,118
SPEAKER_0:  configuration.

00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  in which Einstein's equations no longer applied.

00:21:00,706 --> 00:21:02,814
SPEAKER_1:  So to you, the edges of the theory are wonderful.

00:21:03,266 --> 00:21:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  the failures of theater. The failures are wonderful because that keeps.

00:21:07,074 --> 00:21:08,926
SPEAKER_0:  that keeps us in business.

00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,254
SPEAKER_1:  So one of the things you said, I think, in your Ted talk that...

00:21:13,026 --> 00:21:13,886
SPEAKER_1:  The

00:21:14,786 --> 00:21:17,342
SPEAKER_1:  the fact that quantum mechanics and...

00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,590
SPEAKER_1:  and relativity.

00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,662
SPEAKER_1:  don't describe everything and then they clash.

00:21:21,922 --> 00:21:25,630
SPEAKER_1:  is wonderful. I forget the adjective you used, but it was something like this.

00:21:25,954 --> 00:21:27,710
SPEAKER_1:  So why is that?

00:21:28,322 --> 00:21:31,697
SPEAKER_1:  What why is that interesting to you in that same way that there's all my contradictions that

00:21:31,697 --> 00:21:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  create discovery. There is no question in my mind.

00:21:35,266 --> 00:21:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  Of course, many people would disagree with me.

00:21:38,274 --> 00:21:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  now is the most

00:21:42,274 --> 00:21:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  wonderful time.

00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  be a physicist.

00:21:45,122 --> 00:21:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  So people look back.

00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:48,414
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  at...

00:21:50,562 --> 00:21:52,638
SPEAKER_0:  It's a classical thing to say.

00:21:53,506 --> 00:21:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  among.

00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,038
SPEAKER_0:

00:21:55,618 --> 00:21:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  I wish it were 1920.

00:21:59,298 --> 00:22:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  quantum mechanics had been.

00:22:01,218 --> 00:22:02,526
SPEAKER_0:  Just understood.

00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:03,678
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  There was the periodic table.

00:22:06,338 --> 00:22:06,846
SPEAKER_0:  There was.

00:22:07,298 --> 00:22:09,854
SPEAKER_0:  But in fact, that was such a rich thing.

00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:22:12,322 --> 00:22:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  that.

00:22:15,778 --> 00:22:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  Well...

00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  So that what a lot of exciting stuff happened around 1920. It took the whole, it took a whole century.

00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  to sort out.

00:22:25,282 --> 00:22:27,646
SPEAKER_0:  the new insights that we got.

00:22:27,842 --> 00:22:37,217
SPEAKER_1:  Especially adding some experimental stuff into the, into the bunch, actually making observations and adding experimental thing, computers also help with visualizations and all that kind of stuff. Yeah.

00:22:37,217 --> 00:22:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was all sort of wonderful.

00:22:40,162 --> 00:22:40,798
SPEAKER_0:  century.

00:22:41,154 --> 00:22:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, the seed of.

00:22:43,298 --> 00:22:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  general relativity.

00:22:45,186 --> 00:22:47,678
SPEAKER_0:  was the incompatibility.

00:22:48,354 --> 00:22:49,950
SPEAKER_0:  of Maxwell's theory.

00:22:50,658 --> 00:22:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  of the electromagnetic field.

00:22:53,602 --> 00:22:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  with Newtons.

00:22:54,978 --> 00:22:56,126
SPEAKER_0:  laws of gravity.

00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,974
SPEAKER_0:  they were incompatible because...

00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:01,758
SPEAKER_0:  If you look at Maxwell's theory...

00:23:04,098 --> 00:23:04,574
SPEAKER_0:  There's a-

00:23:05,122 --> 00:23:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  contradiction.

00:23:06,658 --> 00:23:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  if anything goes faster than the speed of light.

00:23:11,586 --> 00:23:13,374
SPEAKER_0:  But Newton's theory of gravity...

00:23:14,082 --> 00:23:14,814
SPEAKER_0:  the

00:23:15,234 --> 00:23:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  gravitational field, the gravitational force is instantaneously

00:23:22,082 --> 00:23:23,966
SPEAKER_0:  transmitted across the entire universe.

00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  So you could, you know.

00:23:26,882 --> 00:23:27,806
SPEAKER_0:  If you had a...

00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:29,726
SPEAKER_0:  uh

00:23:30,018 --> 00:23:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  a friend in another galaxy with a very sensitive...

00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  measuring device that could measure.

00:23:37,442 --> 00:23:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  gravitational field that could just

00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,982
SPEAKER_0:  take this cup of coffee and move it up and down.

00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  Morse code and they could.

00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  get the message instantaneously over another galaxy.

00:23:48,258 --> 00:23:52,254
SPEAKER_0:  That leads to all kinds of contradictions. It's not self-consistent.

00:23:53,282 --> 00:23:57,406
SPEAKER_0:  It was exactly in resolving those contradictions that Einstein

00:23:57,858 --> 00:23:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  came up with the general theory of low.

00:24:00,034 --> 00:24:00,414
SPEAKER_0:  of.

00:24:01,282 --> 00:24:02,558
SPEAKER_0:  relativity and its...

00:24:02,978 --> 00:24:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  Fascinating.

00:24:04,162 --> 00:24:04,830
SPEAKER_0:  how this.

00:24:05,122 --> 00:24:06,014
SPEAKER_0:  contradiction.

00:24:06,562 --> 00:24:08,702
SPEAKER_0:  which seems like maybe it's kind of technical.

00:24:10,274 --> 00:24:13,022
SPEAKER_0:  led to a whole new vision of the...

00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,110
SPEAKER_0:  of the universe.

00:24:15,426 --> 00:24:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  Let's not get fooled because...

00:24:19,266 --> 00:24:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  Lots of contradictions are technical things.

00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  We haven't set up the.

00:24:24,802 --> 00:24:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  we run into other kinds of contradictions.

00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:28,798
SPEAKER_0:  that are technical and they...

00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  They don't seem to.

00:24:30,658 --> 00:24:37,566
SPEAKER_0:  We understood something wrong, we made a mistake, we set up our equations in the wrong way, we didn't translate the formalisms.

00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:40,990
SPEAKER_1:  as opposed to revealing some deep mystery that's yet to be uncovered. Yeah, yeah.

00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  And so we're never very sure which are the really important ones.

00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:50,590
SPEAKER_1:  but to you the difference in quantum mechanics and general relativity.

00:24:51,138 --> 00:24:56,414
SPEAKER_1:  seem the tension, the contradiction there seems to hint at some deeper, deeper thing that's

00:24:56,706 --> 00:24:58,581
SPEAKER_1:  going to be discovered in the century. yes.

00:24:58,581 --> 00:24:59,550
SPEAKER_0:  because...

00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  That one has been understood since...

00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  The 50s? Probably was the...

00:25:05,282 --> 00:25:05,886
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhhhhh

00:25:06,562 --> 00:25:07,646
SPEAKER_0:  First person to.

00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,246
SPEAKER_0:  Notice it and.

00:25:09,762 --> 00:25:13,022
SPEAKER_0:  talking in the early 70s gave it a really much more.

00:25:13,474 --> 00:25:14,590
SPEAKER_0:  Visceral form?

00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:25:16,066 --> 00:25:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  And it'll be smooth.

00:25:17,026 --> 00:25:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  People have been.

00:25:20,578 --> 00:25:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  hurling themselves at it, trying to reduce it to some.

00:25:24,546 --> 00:25:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  technicality, but nobody has succeeded.

00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:28,414
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:31,358
SPEAKER_0:  The efforts to understand it have led to...

00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:32,510
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  all kinds of interesting relations between.

00:25:36,674 --> 00:25:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  quantum systems and.

00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  and applications to other fields and so on.

00:25:42,562 --> 00:25:48,670
SPEAKER_1:  Well, let's actually jump around. We'll return to black holes. We have a million questions there, but let's go into this.

00:25:49,122 --> 00:25:50,206
SPEAKER_1:  Unification.

00:25:51,074 --> 00:25:55,294
SPEAKER_1:  the battle against the contradictions and the tensions between the theories of physics.

00:25:55,586 --> 00:25:57,502
SPEAKER_1:  What is quantum gravity?

00:25:58,114 --> 00:25:59,710
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe what is the standard model?

00:26:00,194 --> 00:26:03,198
SPEAKER_1:  of physics, what is quantum mechanics, what is general relativity.

00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:04,606
SPEAKER_1:  was quantum gravity.

00:26:05,282 --> 00:26:07,710
SPEAKER_1:  What are all the different unification efforts?

00:26:10,498 --> 00:26:12,373
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so. Again, five questions.

00:26:12,373 --> 00:26:13,022
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah

00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  It's a theory that...

00:26:15,298 --> 00:26:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  describes

00:26:17,634 --> 00:26:18,526
SPEAKER_0:  Everything.

00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:19,454
SPEAKER_0:  with.

00:26:19,682 --> 00:26:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  Astonishing accuracy.

00:26:22,434 --> 00:26:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  It's the most...

00:26:24,738 --> 00:26:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  Accurate theory.

00:26:26,402 --> 00:26:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  in the history of human thought.

00:26:28,898 --> 00:26:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  theory and experiment have been.

00:26:31,394 --> 00:26:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  successfully compared to.

00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:35,422
SPEAKER_0:  16 decimal place.

00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:36,766
SPEAKER_0:  We have that.

00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:38,590
SPEAKER_0:  stenciled on the

00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  door.

00:26:39,938 --> 00:26:42,078
SPEAKER_0:  where I work, you know? That's it.

00:26:42,498 --> 00:26:43,518
SPEAKER_0:  It's an amazing.

00:26:44,226 --> 00:26:45,182
SPEAKER_0:  It's an amazing.

00:26:45,634 --> 00:26:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  feet of the human mind.

00:26:48,226 --> 00:26:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  It describes...

00:26:50,914 --> 00:26:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  the electromagnetic interaction.

00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  unifies the electromagnetic interaction with the so-called

00:26:56,994 --> 00:26:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  weak interaction, which...

00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  You need some.

00:27:00,802 --> 00:27:03,358
SPEAKER_0:  good tools to even view the weak interaction?

00:27:03,938 --> 00:27:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  And then there's the strong interaction.

00:27:07,554 --> 00:27:09,502
SPEAKER_0:  which binds the quarks.

00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  into protons.

00:27:11,874 --> 00:27:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:27:13,186 --> 00:27:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  the forces between them.

00:27:15,202 --> 00:27:17,310
SPEAKER_0:  are mediated by something called

00:27:17,698 --> 00:27:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  Yang-Mills theory?

00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,446
SPEAKER_0:  which is a.

00:27:20,674 --> 00:27:22,974
SPEAKER_0:  a beautiful mathematical

00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  generalization of.

00:27:25,346 --> 00:27:26,526
SPEAKER_0:  electromagnetism.

00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  in which

00:27:29,058 --> 00:27:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  the

00:27:30,018 --> 00:27:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  analogs of the photons.

00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  themselves carry charge?

00:27:36,034 --> 00:27:37,374
SPEAKER_0:  And...

00:27:37,826 --> 00:27:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  So this.

00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhh...

00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  The final piece of this.

00:27:42,562 --> 00:27:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  of the standard model. Everything in the standard model has been.

00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,254
SPEAKER_0:  observed, its properties have been measured.

00:27:48,898 --> 00:27:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  The final.

00:27:49,954 --> 00:27:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  particle to be observed was the Higgs particle.

00:27:53,826 --> 00:27:55,966
SPEAKER_0:  served like over a decade ago.

00:27:56,354 --> 00:27:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  Higgs was 30 a decade ago.

00:27:58,146 --> 00:28:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  I think it is, yeah. Wow.

00:28:00,482 --> 00:28:04,263
SPEAKER_0:  But you better check me on that.

00:28:04,263 --> 00:28:06,513
SPEAKER_1:  This trip was so much fun has been happening.

00:28:06,513 --> 00:28:07,838
SPEAKER_0:  It's so much fun has been happening.

00:28:08,514 --> 00:28:11,422
SPEAKER_0:  And so that's all.

00:28:12,642 --> 00:28:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  That's all pretty well understood.

00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,438
SPEAKER_0:  There are some things.

00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  that.

00:28:18,466 --> 00:28:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  might or might not.

00:28:20,194 --> 00:28:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  around the edges of that dark matter, neutrino masses.

00:28:25,378 --> 00:28:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  some sort of

00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  fine points or things we call fine points.

00:28:30,114 --> 00:28:32,798
SPEAKER_0:  haven't quite measured perfectly and so on, but.

00:28:33,474 --> 00:28:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  It's largely a very.

00:28:36,642 --> 00:28:37,150
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:28:37,378 --> 00:28:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  Complete.

00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  and we don't

00:28:40,226 --> 00:28:40,670
SPEAKER_0:  X

00:28:40,994 --> 00:28:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  PECT

00:28:43,074 --> 00:28:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  anything very new.

00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  conceptually.

00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,150
SPEAKER_0:  in the completion of that.

00:28:49,698 --> 00:28:51,134
SPEAKER_1:  Anything contradictory.

00:28:51,394 --> 00:28:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  by me.

00:28:52,194 --> 00:28:54,069
SPEAKER_0:  Anything contradictory.

00:28:54,069 --> 00:28:59,326
SPEAKER_1:  I'll have some wild questions for you on that front. But yeah, anything that, yeah.

00:29:00,002 --> 00:29:04,126
SPEAKER_1:  because there's no gaps. It's so accurate, so precise in its predictions, it's hard to imagine.

00:29:04,354 --> 00:29:05,534
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:06,942
SPEAKER_0:  And...

00:29:07,266 --> 00:29:13,374
SPEAKER_0:  It was all based on something called, let me not explain what it is, let me just throw out the buzzword.

00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:17,246
SPEAKER_0:  Renormalizable quantum field theory.

00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,070
SPEAKER_0:  fall in the...

00:29:19,362 --> 00:29:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  category of renormalizable quantum field theory.

00:29:22,914 --> 00:29:25,278
SPEAKER_1:  I'm going to throw that at a bar later to impress.

00:29:26,466 --> 00:29:26,846
SPEAKER_1:  the girl.

00:29:27,522 --> 00:29:28,222
SPEAKER_0: rupts defeating internet on DearCon blindš

00:29:28,674 --> 00:29:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  Good luck.

00:29:29,538 --> 00:29:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  Thank you.

00:29:30,786 --> 00:29:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  Oh

00:29:32,322 --> 00:29:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  All right. So, uh. They all, they all fall under that rubric.

00:29:37,154 --> 00:29:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  Gravity will not.

00:29:38,658 --> 00:29:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  Will not.

00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,438
SPEAKER_0:  will not put that suit on.

00:29:42,274 --> 00:29:44,190
SPEAKER_0:  So the force of gravity.

00:29:45,186 --> 00:29:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  cannot be tamed by the same.

00:29:47,874 --> 00:29:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  renormalizable quantum field theory.

00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  to which all the other forces…

00:29:54,114 --> 00:29:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  so eagerly submitted.

00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:00,478
SPEAKER_1:  What is the effort of quantum gravity? What are the different efforts to...

00:30:01,698 --> 00:30:05,726
SPEAKER_1:  to have these two dance together effectively to try to unify.

00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,478
SPEAKER_1:  the standard model and

00:30:09,282 --> 00:30:11,806
SPEAKER_1:  and general relativity and you got a model of gravity.

00:30:13,282 --> 00:30:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  Sort of the one, fully.

00:30:16,034 --> 00:30:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhh...

00:30:16,866 --> 00:30:19,582
SPEAKER_0:  consistent model that we have.

00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:20,830
SPEAKER_0:  that

00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  uh, reconciles.

00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  that sort of

00:30:26,274 --> 00:30:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  tames gravity and reconciles it.

00:30:29,154 --> 00:30:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  with quantum mechanics.

00:30:31,106 --> 00:30:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhh...

00:30:32,386 --> 00:30:32,862
SPEAKER_0:  is.

00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,614
SPEAKER_0:  string theory and its cousins.

00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:30:36,866 --> 00:30:37,982
SPEAKER_0:  We don't know.

00:30:38,466 --> 00:30:38,814
SPEAKER_0:  What.

00:30:39,554 --> 00:30:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  or if in any sense string theory describes the world.

00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,318
SPEAKER_0:  the physical world.

00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  but we do know that it...

00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  Umm...

00:30:49,058 --> 00:30:50,078
SPEAKER_0:  is a consistent.

00:30:50,786 --> 00:30:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  reconciliation.

00:30:52,354 --> 00:30:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  of quantum mechanics and general relativity.

00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,350
SPEAKER_0:  and moreover won.

00:30:56,994 --> 00:30:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  Which

00:30:59,618 --> 00:31:01,278
SPEAKER_0:  which is able to.

00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  Incorporate.

00:31:03,714 --> 00:31:06,270
SPEAKER_0:  particles and forces like the ones we see.

00:31:06,978 --> 00:31:07,902
SPEAKER_0:  See you around.

00:31:09,538 --> 00:31:10,206
SPEAKER_0:  It hasn't.

00:31:10,658 --> 00:31:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  been ruled out.

00:31:12,578 --> 00:31:13,790
SPEAKER_0:  as an actual.

00:31:14,018 --> 00:31:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  sort of unified theory of nature.

00:31:18,146 --> 00:31:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  but there also isn't a.

00:31:21,442 --> 00:31:22,334
SPEAKER_0:  In my view.

00:31:22,562 --> 00:31:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  Some people would disagree with me.

00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  but there isn't a reasonable.

00:31:28,418 --> 00:31:28,990
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:31:29,442 --> 00:31:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  that we would be able to do an experiment.

00:31:32,802 --> 00:31:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  in the foreseeable future.

00:31:34,722 --> 00:31:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  which would be sort of a yes or no.

00:31:37,602 --> 00:31:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  to string theory.

00:31:40,226 --> 00:31:43,870
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so you've been there from the early days in the strength theory, you've seen its developments.

00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:45,630
SPEAKER_1:  What are some interesting developments?

00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:48,830
SPEAKER_1:  What do you see as also the future of string theory?

00:31:49,794 --> 00:31:50,814
SPEAKER_1:  And what is strength there?

00:31:53,346 --> 00:31:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  Well, the basic idea which emerged in...

00:31:57,986 --> 00:31:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  the early 70s.

00:32:00,162 --> 00:32:02,206
SPEAKER_0:  was that if you

00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:03,486
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhh...

00:32:05,762 --> 00:32:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  You take.

00:32:07,298 --> 00:32:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhh

00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,918
SPEAKER_0:  the notion of a particle.

00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  And you literally...

00:32:13,026 --> 00:32:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  replace it by a little loop of string.

00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  The strings are sort of softer.

00:32:20,258 --> 00:32:21,438
SPEAKER_0:  than then.

00:32:21,762 --> 00:32:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  What do you mean by softer?

00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:27,198
SPEAKER_0:  Well, you know, if you hit a particle...

00:32:28,994 --> 00:32:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  If there were a particle on this table, a big one, and you hit it, you might bruise yourself.

00:32:34,082 --> 00:32:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  But if there was a string on the table, you would probably just push it around.

00:32:38,306 --> 00:32:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  and the source of the infinities.

00:32:42,242 --> 00:32:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  In quantum field theories, that would particles hit each other. It's a little bit of a

00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:48,030
SPEAKER_0:  It's a little bit of a...

00:32:49,058 --> 00:32:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  jarring effect.

00:32:50,818 --> 00:32:52,478
SPEAKER_0:  and, and, uh...

00:32:53,826 --> 00:32:57,438
SPEAKER_0:  I've never described it this way before, but it's actually scientifically accurate.

00:32:57,698 --> 00:33:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  But if you throw strings at each other, it's a little more friendly.

00:33:00,962 --> 00:33:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  One thing I can't explain.

00:33:03,266 --> 00:33:08,254
SPEAKER_0:  is how wonderfully precise the mathematics is.

00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:13,694
SPEAKER_0:  that goes into describing string theory. We don't just wave our hands and throw strings around.

00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  You know, there's some very...

00:33:16,482 --> 00:33:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:33:18,178 --> 00:33:19,134
SPEAKER_0:  telling Mathematical.

00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  equations that describe it.

00:33:21,986 --> 00:33:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  What was realized in the early 70s is that

00:33:26,018 --> 00:33:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  If you replace particles by strings, these infinities go away.

00:33:31,138 --> 00:33:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  And you get a.

00:33:32,898 --> 00:33:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:33:34,018 --> 00:33:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  consistent.

00:33:35,938 --> 00:33:37,310
SPEAKER_0:  theory of gravity without

00:33:38,242 --> 00:33:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  infinities.

00:33:40,706 --> 00:33:41,598
SPEAKER_0:  And...

00:33:43,394 --> 00:33:43,710
SPEAKER_0:  That's it.

00:33:44,354 --> 00:33:48,030
SPEAKER_0:  may sound a little trivial, but at that point it had already been.

00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  15 years that people had been.

00:33:52,802 --> 00:33:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  searching around for any kind of theory.

00:33:56,194 --> 00:33:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  that could do this.

00:33:57,762 --> 00:33:59,230
SPEAKER_0:  and it was actually found.

00:33:59,490 --> 00:33:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  kind of.

00:34:01,698 --> 00:34:02,558
SPEAKER_0:  By accident.

00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:03,902
SPEAKER_0:  and.

00:34:04,162 --> 00:34:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  There are a lot of accidental discoveries in this subject.

00:34:09,538 --> 00:34:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  Now at the same time, it was believed then that string theory was an interesting sort of toy model.

00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:20,190
SPEAKER_0:  for putting quantum mechanics and general relativity together.

00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  on paper.

00:34:22,818 --> 00:34:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  But.

00:34:25,442 --> 00:34:27,038
SPEAKER_0:  but that it couldn't describe.

00:34:27,522 --> 00:34:30,462
SPEAKER_0:  some of the very idiosyncratic phenomena.

00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  that pertain to our own universe.

00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:37,470
SPEAKER_0:  in particular the form of so-called parity violation.

00:34:38,818 --> 00:34:39,943
SPEAKER_0:  Our world is...

00:34:39,943 --> 00:34:41,598
SPEAKER_1:  for the bar later tonight.

00:34:41,762 --> 00:34:42,526
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, yeah.

00:34:42,978 --> 00:34:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  Parity violation. So if you go to the bar and.

00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:47,943
SPEAKER_1:  I already got the renormal-

00:34:47,943 --> 00:34:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  And you look in the mirror across the bar, the universe that you see in the mirror.

00:34:54,018 --> 00:34:55,230
SPEAKER_0:  is not identical.

00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,878
SPEAKER_0:  you would be able to tell.

00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,958
SPEAKER_0:  If you show your...

00:35:01,218 --> 00:35:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  You're... you're...

00:35:02,722 --> 00:35:06,686
SPEAKER_0:  The lady in the bar, a photograph that shows both the mirror and you.

00:35:07,042 --> 00:35:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  There's a difference. She's smart enough, she'll be able to tell.

00:35:11,138 --> 00:35:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  Which one is the real world?

00:35:13,538 --> 00:35:17,438
SPEAKER_0:  and which one is you. Now she would have to do some very precise measurements.

00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:24,039
SPEAKER_0:  And if the photograph was too grainy, it might not be possible.

00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:27,614
SPEAKER_1:  Why is this interesting? Why is it? Does this mean that there is some?

00:35:28,066 --> 00:35:28,958
SPEAKER_1:  Imp.

00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:32,035
SPEAKER_1:  Not perfect determinism or what does that mean?

00:35:32,035 --> 00:35:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  uncertainty? No, it's a very interesting feature of the real world.

00:35:36,514 --> 00:35:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  that it.

00:35:37,314 --> 00:35:38,718
SPEAKER_0:  isn't parity-invariant.

00:35:39,106 --> 00:35:40,606
SPEAKER_0:  In string theory it was thought

00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,686
SPEAKER_0:  could not tolerate that.

00:35:44,706 --> 00:35:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  And then it was learned.

00:35:47,682 --> 00:35:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  In the mid-80s...

00:35:49,154 --> 00:35:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  that not only could it tolerate that.

00:35:51,746 --> 00:35:52,350
SPEAKER_0:  But if you'd...

00:35:52,578 --> 00:35:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  did things in the right way.

00:35:54,594 --> 00:35:55,486
SPEAKER_0:  you could.

00:35:56,386 --> 00:35:57,694
SPEAKER_0:  construct a world that

00:35:58,754 --> 00:36:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  involving strings that

00:36:00,578 --> 00:36:01,278
SPEAKER_0:  Reconciled.

00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  quantum mechanics and

00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,798
SPEAKER_0:  general relativity, which…

00:36:05,346 --> 00:36:06,558
SPEAKER_0:  looked more or less...

00:36:06,978 --> 00:36:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  like the world that.

00:36:09,058 --> 00:36:09,790
SPEAKER_0:  we live in.

00:36:10,818 --> 00:36:12,190
SPEAKER_0:  And now.

00:36:12,898 --> 00:36:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  That isn't.

00:36:13,762 --> 00:36:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  to say that string theory.

00:36:15,554 --> 00:36:16,606
SPEAKER_0:  Dictate our world.

00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  It just meant that it was consistent.

00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  The hypothesis...

00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  that string theory describes.

00:36:25,378 --> 00:36:26,974
SPEAKER_0:  Our world can't be.

00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:28,542
SPEAKER_0:  ruled out from.

00:36:28,866 --> 00:36:29,630
SPEAKER_0:  the get go.

00:36:30,626 --> 00:36:32,030
SPEAKER_0:  And it is also.

00:36:32,898 --> 00:36:33,982
SPEAKER_0:  The only.

00:36:34,978 --> 00:36:35,742
SPEAKER_0:  proposal.

00:36:36,226 --> 00:36:37,566
SPEAKER_0:  for a complete theory.

00:36:38,018 --> 00:36:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  that would describe.

00:36:39,874 --> 00:36:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  our world.

00:36:41,602 --> 00:36:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  Still.

00:36:43,586 --> 00:36:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  Nobody will.

00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  Believe it.

00:36:46,818 --> 00:36:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  until there's some kind of

00:36:49,186 --> 00:36:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  direct experiment.

00:36:50,786 --> 00:36:52,766
SPEAKER_0:  And I don't even believe it myself.

00:36:53,154 --> 00:36:58,270
SPEAKER_1:  Which is a good place to be mentally as a physicist, right? As always, I mean Einstein didn't believe his own.

00:36:58,626 --> 00:37:01,054
SPEAKER_1:  equations right with the black hole. Okay.

00:37:01,218 --> 00:37:02,974
SPEAKER_0:  Well, that one he was wrong about that.

00:37:03,234 --> 00:37:05,109
SPEAKER_0:  But he was wrong.

00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:07,006
SPEAKER_1:  But you might be wrong too, right?

00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,702
SPEAKER_1:  uh... so what

00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:12,318
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think string theory is dead if you were to bet all your money on?

00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:13,566
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:16,222
SPEAKER_0:  No. The future of string 2. Heard say.

00:37:17,794 --> 00:37:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  a logical error.

00:37:19,906 --> 00:37:20,606
SPEAKER_0:  to think.

00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  that string theory is either right or wrong.

00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:25,822
SPEAKER_0:  or dead or alive.

00:37:27,266 --> 00:37:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  What it is.

00:37:28,482 --> 00:37:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  is a stepping stone.

00:37:31,426 --> 00:37:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:33,022
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:37:33,538 --> 00:37:35,326
SPEAKER_0:  An analogy I like to draw.

00:37:36,098 --> 00:37:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  is.

00:37:36,866 --> 00:37:37,886
SPEAKER_0:  Yang-Mills theory.

00:37:39,586 --> 00:37:40,606
SPEAKER_0:  which I mentioned.

00:37:40,898 --> 00:37:43,518
SPEAKER_0:  a few minutes ago in the context of standard model.

00:37:45,506 --> 00:37:48,926
SPEAKER_0:  Yang-Mills theory was discovered by Yang and Mills in the 50s.

00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  and they thought that the symmetry.

00:37:52,418 --> 00:37:53,726
SPEAKER_0:  of Yang and Mills.

00:37:54,466 --> 00:37:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  theory.

00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  described the relationship between the proton and the neutron.

00:38:00,738 --> 00:38:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  That's why they invented it.

00:38:03,522 --> 00:38:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  That turned out to be completely wrong.

00:38:07,074 --> 00:38:08,062
SPEAKER_0:  It does, however.

00:38:08,642 --> 00:38:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  describe everything else.

00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  in the standard model.

00:38:12,802 --> 00:38:21,694
SPEAKER_0:  And it had a kind of inevitability. They had some of the right pieces, but not the other ones. They didn't have it quite in the right context.

00:38:22,338 --> 00:38:27,070
SPEAKER_0:  and it had an inevitability to it and it eventually sort of found its place.

00:38:28,674 --> 00:38:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  And it's also true of Einstein's

00:38:32,194 --> 00:38:38,078
SPEAKER_0:  theory of general relativity. He had the wrong version of it in 1914, and he was missing some pieces.

00:38:38,562 --> 00:38:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  And you wouldn't say that his early version was right or wrong. He'd understood the equivalence principle. He'd understood spacetime curvature.

00:38:45,858 --> 00:38:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  He just didn't have everything.

00:38:48,226 --> 00:38:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, technically you would have to say it was wrong.

00:38:51,202 --> 00:38:53,662
SPEAKER_0:  And technically you would have to say Yang and Mills were wrong.

00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  And I guess in that sense.

00:38:57,218 --> 00:38:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  I would believe just.

00:38:59,778 --> 00:39:00,670
SPEAKER_0:  Odds are.

00:39:02,018 --> 00:39:09,982
SPEAKER_0:  we always keep finding new wrinkles. Odds are we're going to find new wrinkles in string theory and technically what we call string theory now isn't.

00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  quite right, but...

00:39:11,906 --> 00:39:15,806
SPEAKER_1:  We're always going to be wrong, but hopefully a little bit less wrong every time.

00:39:16,034 --> 00:39:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  Exactly.

00:39:17,282 --> 00:39:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  And I would.

00:39:18,658 --> 00:39:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  you know, bet the farm as they say. Do you have a farm?

00:39:22,242 --> 00:39:27,646
SPEAKER_0:  I say that much more seriously because not only do I have a farm, but we just renovated it.

00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:37,491
SPEAKER_0:  So before I renovated, so before I renovated, bedding at the farm, my wife and I spent five years renovating it before I...

00:39:37,491 --> 00:39:40,491
SPEAKER_1:  You were much, much looser with that statement, but now really.

00:39:40,491 --> 00:39:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  Now it really means something.

00:39:43,042 --> 00:39:44,318
SPEAKER_0:  and, and...

00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:47,038
SPEAKER_0:  I would bet the farm on the...

00:39:49,858 --> 00:39:51,294
SPEAKER_0:  on the uh...

00:39:51,618 --> 00:39:52,382
SPEAKER_0:  Guess.

00:39:52,706 --> 00:39:54,334
SPEAKER_0:  that 100 years from now.

00:39:54,914 --> 00:39:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  string theory.

00:39:56,322 --> 00:40:00,734
SPEAKER_0:  will be viewed as a stepping stone towards a greater understanding of.

00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  of nature.

00:40:02,946 --> 00:40:05,022
SPEAKER_0:  And it would, I mean, another.

00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  thing that I didn't mention about string theory is, of course, we knew that it...

00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:11,614
SPEAKER_0:  Soft.

00:40:12,194 --> 00:40:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  the infinities problem.

00:40:14,082 --> 00:40:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  And then we later learned that it also.

00:40:16,578 --> 00:40:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  solved.

00:40:17,602 --> 00:40:19,134
SPEAKER_0:  Hawking's puzzle about...

00:40:20,898 --> 00:40:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  what's inside of a black hole.

00:40:23,394 --> 00:40:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:40:24,322 --> 00:40:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  B-

00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:37,854
SPEAKER_0:  You put in one assumption, you get five things out, somehow you're doing something right. Probably not everything, but there's some good signposts. And there have been a lot of good signposts like that.

00:40:38,914 --> 00:40:43,614
SPEAKER_1:  It is also a mathematical toolkit and you've used it. You've used it with Kamran Wafa.

00:40:44,098 --> 00:40:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe we can sneak our way back from string theory into black holes. Yeah. Um, what was the idea that you and Kamranvafa developed with a holographic principle in string theory?

00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:58,718
SPEAKER_1:  were we able to discover through this string theory about

00:40:59,074 --> 00:40:59,870
SPEAKER_1:  black holes.

00:41:00,322 --> 00:41:01,086
SPEAKER_1:  or, um...

00:41:02,114 --> 00:41:03,614
SPEAKER_1:  that connects us back to the reality.

00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:04,478
SPEAKER_1:  of Black.

00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:41:06,082 --> 00:41:09,694
SPEAKER_0:  So that is a very interesting story. I was...

00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  interested in black holes before I was interested in...

00:41:13,826 --> 00:41:15,134
SPEAKER_0:  string theory I was

00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:16,222
SPEAKER_0:  sort of.

00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  a reluctance.

00:41:18,402 --> 00:41:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  string theorists in the beginning. I thought I had to learn it because

00:41:21,634 --> 00:41:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  people were talking about it, but once I studied it, I...

00:41:25,058 --> 00:41:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  I go to love it.

00:41:26,178 --> 00:41:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  First I did it in a sort of dutiful way. These people say they've claimed quantum gravity. I ought to read their papers at least.

00:41:33,154 --> 00:41:38,302
SPEAKER_0:  And then the more I read them, the more interested I got, and I began to see, you know, they...

00:41:39,362 --> 00:41:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  They phrased it in a very...

00:41:41,314 --> 00:41:42,206
SPEAKER_0:  clumsy way.

00:41:42,754 --> 00:41:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  description of string theory was very clumsy.

00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  Mathematically clumsy or just the interpretation? Clumsy.

00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  It was all correct, but...

00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  but.

00:41:53,858 --> 00:41:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  mathematically clumsy, but...

00:41:56,034 --> 00:41:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  It often happens.

00:41:58,946 --> 00:41:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  that

00:42:00,034 --> 00:42:02,558
SPEAKER_0:  in all kinds of branches of physics that...

00:42:03,426 --> 00:42:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  people start working on it really hard and they sort of.

00:42:07,874 --> 00:42:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  dream about it and live it and breathe it, and they begin to see inner relationships.

00:42:13,826 --> 00:42:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  They see a beauty that...

00:42:16,418 --> 00:42:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  is really there. They're not deceived. They're really seeing something that exists.

00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  If you just kind of look at it, you can't grasp it all.

00:42:26,402 --> 00:42:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  in the beginning.

00:42:28,002 --> 00:42:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  And, um.

00:42:30,562 --> 00:42:31,070
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:42:32,706 --> 00:42:34,814
SPEAKER_0:  our understanding of string theory in

00:42:35,362 --> 00:42:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhhhhh...

00:42:37,282 --> 00:42:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  In 1985...

00:42:39,586 --> 00:42:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  was almost all.

00:42:41,506 --> 00:42:42,174
SPEAKER_0:  about

00:42:42,754 --> 00:42:43,966
SPEAKER_0:  uh, you know.

00:42:45,218 --> 00:42:48,158
SPEAKER_0:  Weakly coupled waves of strings.

00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:51,806
SPEAKER_0:  and so on. We didn't know how to describe.

00:42:52,706 --> 00:42:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  big thing like a black hole.

00:42:54,754 --> 00:42:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  in string theory. Of course, we could show that strings...

00:42:59,234 --> 00:43:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  in theory and some limit reproduce Einstein's theory of general relativity.

00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:06,014
SPEAKER_0:  and corrected it, but we couldn't.

00:43:06,498 --> 00:43:08,542
SPEAKER_0:  do any better with black holes.

00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,718
SPEAKER_0:  then

00:43:13,474 --> 00:43:17,438
SPEAKER_0:  Before my work with Korman, we couldn't do any better than Einstein and Schwarzschild.

00:43:19,714 --> 00:43:20,286
SPEAKER_0:  Now.

00:43:20,578 --> 00:43:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  Um, one of the puzzles...

00:43:23,938 --> 00:43:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:43:25,122 --> 00:43:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  You know, if you look at the...

00:43:27,618 --> 00:43:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  Hawking's headstone and

00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,870
SPEAKER_0:  Also Boltzmann's headstone and you.

00:43:32,866 --> 00:43:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  put them together, you get a formula.

00:43:36,706 --> 00:43:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  for their really central.

00:43:40,194 --> 00:43:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  equations.

00:43:41,378 --> 00:43:43,134
SPEAKER_0:  in 20th century physics, I don't.

00:43:45,186 --> 00:43:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  I think there are many equations that made it to headstones.

00:43:48,578 --> 00:43:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  You

00:43:50,018 --> 00:43:50,750
SPEAKER_0:

00:43:51,074 --> 00:43:51,902
SPEAKER_0:  And...

00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  and they're really central equations, and you put them together.

00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  and you get a formula for the number of gigabytes.

00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  in a black hole.

00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  Now it's Schwarzschild's.

00:44:03,586 --> 00:44:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  description.

00:44:06,562 --> 00:44:11,198
SPEAKER_0:  The black hole is literally a hole in space and there's no place to store the gigabyte.

00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  And it's not too hard to, and this really was Wheeler.

00:44:18,466 --> 00:44:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  Bekenstein.

00:44:20,418 --> 00:44:22,206
SPEAKER_0:  Wheeler, Bekenstein and Hawking.

00:44:23,298 --> 00:44:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  to come to the conclusion that.

00:44:27,586 --> 00:44:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  If there isn't a sense...

00:44:29,794 --> 00:44:31,902
SPEAKER_0:  in which a black hole can store.

00:44:32,642 --> 00:44:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  some large number of gigabytes.

00:44:35,554 --> 00:44:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  that quantum.

00:44:37,218 --> 00:44:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  mechanics and gravity can't be consistent.

00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:42,942
SPEAKER_1:  We gotta go there a little bit, so.

00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:44,766
SPEAKER_1:  So how is it possible?

00:44:45,218 --> 00:44:50,462
SPEAKER_1:  I won't say gigabyte so there's some information so black holes can store information. How's this thing that sucks up all light?

00:44:50,722 --> 00:44:52,734
SPEAKER_1:  and it's supposed to basically be, you know.

00:44:53,282 --> 00:44:55,422
SPEAKER_1:  be super homogeneous and boring.

00:44:55,746 --> 00:44:58,878
SPEAKER_1:  How is that actually able to store information? Where does it store information?

00:44:59,298 --> 00:45:00,926
SPEAKER_1:  on the inside and the surface.

00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:03,230
SPEAKER_1:  Where? Where's?

00:45:03,746 --> 00:45:05,054
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. Hi.

00:45:06,146 --> 00:45:09,598
SPEAKER_1:  I'm liking this ask five questions to see which one you actually answer.

00:45:10,146 --> 00:45:11,271
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, okay.

00:45:11,271 --> 00:45:15,771
SPEAKER_0:  I should try to memorize them and answer each one in order just to answer that. I don't know I don't

00:45:15,771 --> 00:45:17,271
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know what I'm doing. I'm desperate.

00:45:17,271 --> 00:45:18,021
SPEAKER_0:  Really.

00:45:18,021 --> 00:45:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  desperately trying to figure it out as we go along here.

00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,110
SPEAKER_0:  So, um.

00:45:22,402 --> 00:45:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  Einstein's.

00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  Black holes are short, so it's a black hole. They can't store information.

00:45:27,042 --> 00:45:30,558
SPEAKER_0:  Stuff goes in there and it just keeps flying and it...

00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:32,350
SPEAKER_0:  goes to the Singularity and it's gone.

00:45:34,434 --> 00:45:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  However...

00:45:35,682 --> 00:45:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  Einstein's theory is not exact.

00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  has corrections.

00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  And string theory tells you what those.

00:45:43,394 --> 00:45:44,190
SPEAKER_0:  corrections are.

00:45:46,754 --> 00:45:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  And so you should be able to find some way.

00:45:50,818 --> 00:45:51,454
SPEAKER_0:  of

00:45:52,034 --> 00:45:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  some alternate way of describing the black hole.

00:45:56,066 --> 00:45:57,278
SPEAKER_0:  that enables you.

00:45:59,714 --> 00:46:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  to understand.

00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:04,094
SPEAKER_0:  where the gigabytes are stored.

00:46:05,122 --> 00:46:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  So, would Hawking and-

00:46:06,882 --> 00:46:09,150
SPEAKER_0:  Bekenstein really did was they showed that

00:46:09,986 --> 00:46:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  Physics is inconsistent.

00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  Unless...

00:46:14,594 --> 00:46:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  black hole, constor.

00:46:17,826 --> 00:46:19,262
SPEAKER_0:  number of gigabytes.

00:46:19,874 --> 00:46:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  proportional to.

00:46:21,666 --> 00:46:22,654
SPEAKER_0:  It's area.

00:46:22,882 --> 00:46:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  divided by four times.

00:46:25,954 --> 00:46:27,230
SPEAKER_0:  Newton's constant.

00:46:27,458 --> 00:46:28,638
SPEAKER_1:  times Planck's constant.

00:46:28,866 --> 00:46:31,646
SPEAKER_1:  And that's another wild idea. He said area, not volume.

00:46:32,354 --> 00:46:33,182
SPEAKER_0:  Exactly.

00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  That's the holographic principle.

00:46:35,554 --> 00:46:36,830
SPEAKER_1:  The universe is so weird.

00:46:37,186 --> 00:46:40,606
SPEAKER_1:  That's the holographic principle. That's called the holographic principle that is

00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:41,886
SPEAKER_1:  It's the area.

00:46:42,146 --> 00:46:46,142
SPEAKER_1:  We're just jumping around. What is the holographic principle? What does that mean?

00:46:46,434 --> 00:46:48,734
SPEAKER_1:  What is this some kind of weird projection going on? What?

00:46:49,026 --> 00:46:50,078
SPEAKER_1:  What the heck, uh...

00:46:50,242 --> 00:46:55,134
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I was just before I came here writing an introduction to a paper and the first sentence was,

00:46:56,226 --> 00:46:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  The

00:46:58,562 --> 00:47:01,342
SPEAKER_0:  as yet imprecisely defined.

00:47:01,666 --> 00:47:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  holographic principle.

00:47:04,194 --> 00:47:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So nobody knows exactly what it is.

00:47:08,834 --> 00:47:12,798
SPEAKER_0:  But roughly speaking, it says just what we were alluding to.

00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  that, um…

00:47:15,554 --> 00:47:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  really all the information.

00:47:18,242 --> 00:47:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  that is in some volume of space-time.

00:47:21,122 --> 00:47:22,270
SPEAKER_0:  can be stored.

00:47:22,722 --> 00:47:23,806
SPEAKER_0:  on the boundary.

00:47:24,034 --> 00:47:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  of that region.

00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:29,905
SPEAKER_1:  So this is not just about black holes. It's about any, any area space.

00:47:29,905 --> 00:47:31,198
SPEAKER_0:  any aerospace. However...

00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  We've made sense of the holographic principle for black holes.

00:47:36,418 --> 00:47:40,126
SPEAKER_0:  We've made sense of the holographic principle for something which could be.

00:47:40,578 --> 00:47:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  called the anti-de Sitter space, which

00:47:43,938 --> 00:47:45,790
SPEAKER_0:  could be thought of as a...

00:47:46,242 --> 00:47:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  Giant.

00:47:47,426 --> 00:47:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  as a black hole turned into a whole universe.

00:47:52,354 --> 00:47:56,606
SPEAKER_0:  And we don't really understand how to...

00:47:57,858 --> 00:48:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  talk about the holographic principle for.

00:48:01,282 --> 00:48:03,902
SPEAKER_0:  either flat space which we appear to live in.

00:48:04,738 --> 00:48:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  or...

00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  asymptotically decider space which

00:48:08,738 --> 00:48:12,798
SPEAKER_0:  astronomers tell us we actually live in as the universe continues to.

00:48:13,506 --> 00:48:14,046
SPEAKER_0:  Expand.

00:48:14,882 --> 00:48:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  So it's one of the.

00:48:16,898 --> 00:48:19,134
SPEAKER_0:  one of the huge problems in

00:48:20,034 --> 00:48:22,142
SPEAKER_0:  physics is to

00:48:24,258 --> 00:48:24,702
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

00:48:25,218 --> 00:48:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  or even formulate the holographic principle for.

00:48:29,474 --> 00:48:30,558
SPEAKER_0:  more realistic.

00:48:31,234 --> 00:48:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  Well, black holes are realistic, we see them.

00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:48:36,034 --> 00:48:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, in more general context.

00:48:38,338 --> 00:48:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  give a more general statement of the holographic principle.

00:48:41,474 --> 00:48:43,966
SPEAKER_1:  What's the difference in flat space and.

00:48:44,226 --> 00:48:49,150
SPEAKER_1:  Asymptotic decider space. So flat space is just an approximation of like the world we live in.

00:48:49,506 --> 00:48:51,774
SPEAKER_1:  So like the sitter space.

00:48:52,194 --> 00:48:54,686
SPEAKER_1:  At some time, I wonder what that even means, meaning like.

00:48:55,874 --> 00:48:57,694
SPEAKER_1:  uh... as a product of what

00:48:57,826 --> 00:49:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, so for thousands of years...

00:49:00,866 --> 00:49:04,734
SPEAKER_0:  you know, until the last half of the 20th, well, sorry, until the 20th century.

00:49:05,506 --> 00:49:06,078
SPEAKER_0:  Um,

00:49:06,338 --> 00:49:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  We thought...

00:49:07,714 --> 00:49:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  space-time was flat.

00:49:10,434 --> 00:49:12,094
SPEAKER_1:  Can you elaborate on flat?

00:49:13,026 --> 00:49:14,430
SPEAKER_1:  What do we mean by flat?

00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  Well, like the surface of this table.

00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  is flat.

00:49:20,898 --> 00:49:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  Let me just give an intuitive explanation.

00:49:23,746 --> 00:49:24,478
SPEAKER_0:  Surface of the...

00:49:24,706 --> 00:49:27,550
SPEAKER_0:  The table is flat, but the surface of a basketball...

00:49:28,482 --> 00:49:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  is curved.

00:49:30,818 --> 00:49:32,862
SPEAKER_0:  So the universe itself...

00:49:34,274 --> 00:49:36,766
SPEAKER_0:  could be flat like the surface of a table.

00:49:37,282 --> 00:49:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  or it could be curved like a basketball, which actually has a positive curvature.

00:49:42,434 --> 00:49:45,534
SPEAKER_0:  And then there's another kind of curvature called the negative curvature.

00:49:46,562 --> 00:49:49,822
SPEAKER_0:  And curvature can be even weirder because...

00:49:51,074 --> 00:49:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  That kind of curvature I've just described is the curvature of space.

00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  But Einstein taught us that we really live in a space-time continuum.

00:50:00,194 --> 00:50:03,966
SPEAKER_0:  so we can have curvature in a way that mixes up space and time.

00:50:05,954 --> 00:50:07,550
SPEAKER_0:  and that's kind of hard to visualize.

00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:10,110
SPEAKER_1:  because you have to step what a couple of dimensions up.

00:50:10,626 --> 00:50:11,486
SPEAKER_1:  So it's hard to.

00:50:11,938 --> 00:50:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  You have to step a couple.

00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  But even a...

00:50:16,418 --> 00:50:17,246
SPEAKER_0:  If you have.

00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  flat space and it's expanding in time.

00:50:23,394 --> 00:50:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we could imagine we're sitting here in this room.

00:50:25,762 --> 00:50:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  good approximation is flat, but imagine we suddenly start getting further and further apart rival right that

00:50:31,074 --> 00:50:32,286
SPEAKER_0:  then space is flat.

00:50:34,594 --> 00:50:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  but it's expanding, which means that it's space-time.

00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  is curved.

00:50:39,554 --> 00:50:43,422
SPEAKER_1:  Ultimately it's about space time. Okay, so what's the what's the center and empty to serve space.

00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:46,750
SPEAKER_0:  The three simplest.

00:50:47,074 --> 00:50:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  Space Times.

00:50:48,514 --> 00:50:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  our flat spacetime, which we call Minkowski spacetime.

00:50:52,354 --> 00:50:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  and negatively curved space-time.

00:50:55,202 --> 00:50:56,542
SPEAKER_0:  anti-de Sitter space.

00:50:57,314 --> 00:50:59,486
SPEAKER_0:  and positively curved space-time.

00:50:59,906 --> 00:51:00,766
SPEAKER_0:  The sitter space.

00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:06,270
SPEAKER_0:  And so astronomers...

00:51:07,042 --> 00:51:07,422
SPEAKER_0:  Think.

00:51:07,714 --> 00:51:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  That

00:51:09,346 --> 00:51:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  on large scales, even though for

00:51:11,586 --> 00:51:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  thousands of years we hadn't noticed it.

00:51:14,274 --> 00:51:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  beginning with Hubble.

00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  we started to notice that

00:51:18,114 --> 00:51:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  space time was curved, space is expanding.

00:51:21,826 --> 00:51:22,590
SPEAKER_0:  in time.

00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:24,702
SPEAKER_0:  means that space-time is curved.

00:51:25,922 --> 00:51:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  and the nature of this curvature is affected by the matter in it.

00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:34,238
SPEAKER_0:  because matter itself.

00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:36,990
SPEAKER_0:  causes the curvature of spacetime.

00:51:37,986 --> 00:51:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  But as it expands, the matter gets...

00:51:40,546 --> 00:51:41,726
SPEAKER_0:  more and more diluted.

00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  And one might ask,

00:51:43,842 --> 00:51:45,534
SPEAKER_0:  when it's all diluted away.

00:51:46,306 --> 00:51:47,646
SPEAKER_0:  Is space-time still crazy?

00:51:48,162 --> 00:51:48,574
SPEAKER_0:  curve.

00:51:49,826 --> 00:51:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  and astronomers believe they've.

00:51:52,514 --> 00:51:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  done.

00:51:54,146 --> 00:51:56,702
SPEAKER_0:  precise enough measurements to determine this.

00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:00,030
SPEAKER_0:  and they believe that the answer is yes.

00:52:00,482 --> 00:52:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  The universe is now expanding.

00:52:02,562 --> 00:52:04,030
SPEAKER_0:  eventually all the

00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:06,014
SPEAKER_0:  you matter and it will be.

00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:07,646
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  Expand it away.

00:52:09,378 --> 00:52:11,614
SPEAKER_0:  but it will continue to expand.

00:52:12,866 --> 00:52:18,750
SPEAKER_0:  because they would call it the dark energy, Einstein would call it a cosmological constant.

00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:22,302
SPEAKER_0:  In any case, in the far future…

00:52:23,138 --> 00:52:26,686
SPEAKER_0:  Matter will be expanded away and will be left with empty decider space.

00:52:27,202 --> 00:52:30,526
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so there's this cosmological, Einstein's cosmological constant.

00:52:30,946 --> 00:52:35,966
SPEAKER_1:  that now hides this thing that we don't understand called dark energy what's dark energy

00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:38,238
SPEAKER_1:  What's your best guess at what this thing is?

00:52:39,042 --> 00:52:40,094
SPEAKER_1:  Why do we think it's there?

00:52:40,898 --> 00:52:43,070
SPEAKER_1:  It's because it comes from the astronomers.

00:52:44,514 --> 00:52:48,542
SPEAKER_0:  Dark energy is synonymous with positive cosmological constants.

00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:51,134
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:54,462
SPEAKER_0:  We think it's there.

00:52:55,618 --> 00:52:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  because the astronomers have told us it's there.

00:52:59,266 --> 00:53:00,830
SPEAKER_0:  And, um...

00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  they know what they're doing.

00:53:03,746 --> 00:53:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  And we don't know what the heck. Really, really hard measurement, but they really know what they're doing.

00:53:08,962 --> 00:53:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  And...

00:53:10,498 --> 00:53:12,862
SPEAKER_0:  we have no friggin idea why it's there.

00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:17,694
SPEAKER_0:  another big mystery, another reason it's fun to be a physicist.

00:53:18,306 --> 00:53:21,438
SPEAKER_0:  And if it is there, why should it be so small?

00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  Why should there be so little? Why should it have hid itself?

00:53:26,498 --> 00:53:27,038
SPEAKER_0:  from us.

00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:31,614
SPEAKER_0:  Why shouldn't there be enough of it to substantially consume?

00:53:31,874 --> 00:53:33,950
SPEAKER_0:  curve the space between us and the Moon.

00:53:34,626 --> 00:53:35,742
SPEAKER_0:  Why did there have to be?

00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:36,958
SPEAKER_0:  Such a-

00:53:38,594 --> 00:53:42,686
SPEAKER_0:  small amount that only the crazy best astronomers in the world could find it.

00:53:43,618 --> 00:53:45,822
SPEAKER_1:  What can't the same thing be said about...

00:53:46,402 --> 00:53:47,998
SPEAKER_1:  all the constants.

00:53:48,898 --> 00:53:52,542
SPEAKER_1:  all of the can't that be said about gravity can't they be said about the speed of light

00:53:53,474 --> 00:53:54,942
SPEAKER_1:  Like why is this P2L so slow?

00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:56,862
SPEAKER_1:  so fast.

00:53:57,154 --> 00:53:57,726
SPEAKER_1:  So slow.

00:53:59,074 --> 00:54:01,662
SPEAKER_1:  Relative to the size of the universe, can't it be faster?

00:54:03,938 --> 00:54:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  Or no? Well, the speed of light is a funny one because you could always choose units.

00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:12,766
SPEAKER_0:  in which the speed of light is one.

00:54:13,058 --> 00:54:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we measure it in kilometers per second and it's hundred and...

00:54:17,314 --> 00:54:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  86,000 miles per second is 186,000 miles per second.

00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:25,150
SPEAKER_0:  And, but if we hit use different units.

00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:54:26,274 --> 00:54:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  then we could make it one.

00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,750
SPEAKER_0:  but you can make dimensionless ratios.

00:54:31,746 --> 00:54:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:54:33,474 --> 00:54:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  You could say, why is the time scale set by the expansion of the universe?

00:54:38,754 --> 00:54:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  so large compared to

00:54:41,154 --> 00:54:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  the timescale of a human life are so large compared to the…

00:54:45,474 --> 00:54:47,358
SPEAKER_0:  time scale for a neutron to decay.

00:54:47,714 --> 00:54:52,830
SPEAKER_1:  You know? Yeah, I mean, ultimately, the reference, the temporal reference frame here is a human life.

00:54:53,122 --> 00:54:53,630
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe.

00:54:54,146 --> 00:54:56,894
SPEAKER_1:  Isn't that the important thing for us descendants of apes?

00:54:57,314 --> 00:54:59,294
SPEAKER_1:  Isn't that a really important aspect of physics?

00:55:00,418 --> 00:55:01,374
SPEAKER_1:  Like, uh...

00:55:01,922 --> 00:55:04,990
SPEAKER_1:  because we kind of experience the world, we intuit the world.

00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:06,462
SPEAKER_1:  through the eyes of...

00:55:07,522 --> 00:55:09,822
SPEAKER_1:  these biological organisms.

00:55:10,274 --> 00:55:13,246
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I guess mathematics helps you escape that.

00:55:13,602 --> 00:55:15,134
SPEAKER_1:  for time but ultimately isn't that.

00:55:15,842 --> 00:55:17,374
SPEAKER_1:  how you wonder about the world.

00:55:18,274 --> 00:55:20,350
SPEAKER_1:  Absolutely. Is that like a human life?

00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:22,942
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. Times only a hundred years. Try everything.

00:55:23,714 --> 00:55:27,710
SPEAKER_1:  If you're able to think in, I don't know, in billions of years.

00:55:29,858 --> 00:55:32,094
SPEAKER_1:  then maybe everything looks way different.

00:55:33,826 --> 00:55:36,286
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe universes are born and die and...

00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:40,542
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe all of these physical phenomena become much more intuitive.

00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:43,870
SPEAKER_1:  that we see at the grand scale of general relativity.

00:55:44,514 --> 00:55:46,110
SPEAKER_0:  Well that is one of the...

00:55:46,722 --> 00:55:51,134
SPEAKER_0:  little off the track here, but that certainly is one of the nice things about being a physicist.

00:55:51,842 --> 00:55:58,046
SPEAKER_0:  You spend a lot of time thinking about, you know, insides of black holes and billions of years in the future.

00:55:58,402 --> 00:55:59,710
SPEAKER_0:  And it's sort of a...

00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  gets you away from the day to day.

00:56:04,418 --> 00:56:06,398
SPEAKER_0:  into another fantastic.

00:56:07,042 --> 00:56:07,390
SPEAKER_0:  Realm.

00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:08,574
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  But I was...

00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:12,510
SPEAKER_0:  Answering your question about...

00:56:13,698 --> 00:56:16,126
SPEAKER_0:  how there could be information in a black hole.

00:56:17,154 --> 00:56:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:56:18,882 --> 00:56:20,286
SPEAKER_0:  Einstein only gave us...

00:56:20,898 --> 00:56:22,302
SPEAKER_0:  An approximate description.

00:56:22,594 --> 00:56:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  And we.

00:56:23,682 --> 00:56:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  Now have a theory that corrects it, string theory.

00:56:28,066 --> 00:56:38,014
SPEAKER_0:  and now sort of was the moment of truth. Well, when we first discovered string theory, we knew from the get-go that string theory would correct what Einstein said.

00:56:38,722 --> 00:56:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  just like Einstein corrected what Newton said.

00:56:42,466 --> 00:56:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:56:43,426 --> 00:56:45,598
SPEAKER_0:  We didn't understand it well enough.

00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:49,086
SPEAKER_0:  to actually compute the correction.

00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  compute how many gigabytes there were.

00:56:53,218 --> 00:56:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  And sometime in the early 90s,

00:56:58,626 --> 00:57:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  we began to understand the mathematics of string theory better and better.

00:57:04,898 --> 00:57:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  And it came to the point where it was.

00:57:08,194 --> 00:57:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  clear that.

00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  this was something we might be able to compute.

00:57:13,282 --> 00:57:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  And it was a kind of moment of truth for string theory because...

00:57:17,538 --> 00:57:18,526
SPEAKER_0:  If it hadn't.

00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  given the answer.

00:57:22,114 --> 00:57:22,558
SPEAKER_0:  that

00:57:23,074 --> 00:57:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  Bekenstein and...

00:57:25,218 --> 00:57:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  Hawking said it.

00:57:26,594 --> 00:57:28,286
SPEAKER_0:  had to give for consistency.

00:57:29,442 --> 00:57:31,070
SPEAKER_0:  string theory itself would have.

00:57:31,938 --> 00:57:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  been inconsistent and we wouldn't be doing this interview.

00:57:35,266 --> 00:57:35,614
SPEAKER_0:  Well.

00:57:36,066 --> 00:57:38,691
SPEAKER_1:  That's a very dramatic statement.

00:57:38,691 --> 00:57:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:41,438
SPEAKER_0:  That's not the most...

00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:45,041
SPEAKER_0:  That's not the most dramatic thing.

00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:52,862
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, okay, that's very life and death. You mean like that because string theory was so central to your work at that time.

00:57:53,282 --> 00:57:54,407
SPEAKER_1:  Is that what you mean?

00:57:54,407 --> 00:57:59,657
SPEAKER_0:  Well, string theory would have been inconsistent. Yeah, okay. So that'd be a... String theory would have been inconsistent.

00:57:59,657 --> 00:58:01,907
SPEAKER_1:  But those inconsistencies can give birth to other.

00:58:01,907 --> 00:58:02,974
SPEAKER_0:  theories like you said.

00:58:03,234 --> 00:58:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  The inconsistency, right, something else could have happened. It would have been a major.

00:58:07,842 --> 00:58:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  a major...

00:58:10,146 --> 00:58:12,350
SPEAKER_0:  change in the way we think about string theory if it

00:58:12,898 --> 00:58:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  And it was a good thing that.

00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  You know, one.

00:58:16,354 --> 00:58:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  supposition that

00:58:17,826 --> 00:58:19,294
SPEAKER_0:  the world is made of strings.

00:58:19,778 --> 00:58:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  solves two problems.

00:58:21,762 --> 00:58:22,974
SPEAKER_0:  Not one, it's all a suit.

00:58:23,202 --> 00:58:24,446
SPEAKER_0:  infinity problem in it.

00:58:25,058 --> 00:58:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  solve the Hawking's problem.

00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,438
SPEAKER_0:  and also the way that it did it.

00:58:30,402 --> 00:58:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  was very...

00:58:32,482 --> 00:58:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  was very beautiful.

00:58:34,402 --> 00:58:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:58:35,714 --> 00:58:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  It gave an alternate.

00:58:38,338 --> 00:58:39,550
SPEAKER_0:  description. So,

00:58:40,418 --> 00:58:44,606
SPEAKER_0:  alternate description of things are…

00:58:46,242 --> 00:58:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  are very common. I mean, we could.

00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:50,494
SPEAKER_0:  to take a simple example of this.

00:58:50,786 --> 00:58:52,254
SPEAKER_0:  bottle of water here is.

00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  90 percent.

00:58:54,498 --> 00:58:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  I could say it's 90% full. I could.

00:58:57,314 --> 00:58:58,878
SPEAKER_0:  Also say it's 10% empty.

00:58:59,586 --> 00:59:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  Those are obviously the same statement.

00:59:02,882 --> 00:59:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  And they're.

00:59:03,938 --> 00:59:07,358
SPEAKER_0:  It's trivial to see that they're the same, but there are many statements.

00:59:07,842 --> 00:59:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  that can be made in mathematics and mathematical physics.

00:59:12,002 --> 00:59:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  that are equivalent

00:59:13,794 --> 00:59:17,246
SPEAKER_0:  but might take years to understand that they're equivalent.

00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  and might take the invention or discovery of whole new fields of mathematics to prove their equivalent.

00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  And this was one of those.

00:59:26,882 --> 00:59:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  We found...

00:59:28,322 --> 00:59:30,014
SPEAKER_0:  an alternate description.

00:59:31,202 --> 00:59:31,646
SPEAKER_0:  of the-

00:59:32,162 --> 00:59:33,982
SPEAKER_0:  certain black holes in string theory.

00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:36,414
SPEAKER_0:  which we could prove was a-

00:59:37,058 --> 00:59:37,662
SPEAKER_0:  equivalent.

00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:40,638
SPEAKER_0:  and it was a description of the black hole.

00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  as a hologram.

00:59:42,978 --> 00:59:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  that can be thought of.

00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:45,790
SPEAKER_0:  A holographic plate.

00:59:47,298 --> 00:59:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  that could be thought of.

00:59:48,898 --> 00:59:51,358
SPEAKER_0:  is sitting on the surface of the black hole.

00:59:52,194 --> 00:59:57,246
SPEAKER_0:  and the interior of the black hole itself arises as a projection.

00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  or the near horizon region of the black hole arises as a projection.

01:00:03,202 --> 01:00:04,638
SPEAKER_0:  of that holographic plate.

01:00:05,186 --> 01:00:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  So the two descriptions were the hologram.

01:00:09,538 --> 01:00:12,478
SPEAKER_0:  the three-dimensional image and the holographic plate.

01:00:13,666 --> 01:00:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  and hold it.

01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  Gram is what Einstein discovered in the holographic.

01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:18,110
SPEAKER_0:  plate.

01:00:18,818 --> 01:00:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  is what we discovered.

01:00:21,282 --> 01:00:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  and this idea that

01:00:23,426 --> 01:00:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  You could.

01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  Describe things.

01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  very, very concretely in string theory in these two different languages.

01:00:31,298 --> 01:00:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  of course took off.

01:00:32,834 --> 01:00:35,294
SPEAKER_0:  and was applied to many.

01:00:35,682 --> 01:00:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  many different.

01:00:37,666 --> 01:00:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  many different contexts within string theory.

01:00:40,994 --> 01:00:43,902
SPEAKER_1:  So you mentioned the infinity problem and the Hawking problem.

01:00:44,546 --> 01:00:45,694
SPEAKER_1:  uh... which talking about

01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:46,942
SPEAKER_1:  The, The, The, The...

01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:51,295
SPEAKER_1:  that the black hole destroys information that which hawking problem

01:00:51,295 --> 01:00:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  talking about?

01:00:52,642 --> 01:00:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  There's really two hawking problems.

01:00:55,074 --> 01:00:56,478
SPEAKER_0:  they're very closely related.

01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:57,694
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:00:58,018 --> 01:00:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  One is...

01:00:59,106 --> 01:01:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  How does the black coal?

01:01:00,514 --> 01:01:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  store the information.

01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:01:06,626 --> 01:01:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  That is...

01:01:07,842 --> 01:01:08,990
SPEAKER_0:  The one that we...

01:01:09,602 --> 01:01:10,430
SPEAKER_0:  Solved.

01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  in some cases.

01:01:12,642 --> 01:01:13,854
SPEAKER_0:  So it's sort of like...

01:01:14,466 --> 01:01:15,294
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

01:01:15,554 --> 01:01:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  your smartphone.

01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  How does it store at 64 gigabytes?

01:01:21,186 --> 01:01:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  Well, you rip the cover off and you count the chips and there's 64 of them each with a gigabyte.

01:01:26,562 --> 01:01:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  and you know they're 64 gigabytes.

01:01:29,378 --> 01:01:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  but.

01:01:30,146 --> 01:01:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  That does not solve the problem of how you get information in and out of your smartphone.

01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,494
SPEAKER_0:  You have to understand a lot more about...

01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  the Wi-Fi and the internet and the...

01:01:42,114 --> 01:01:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  Cellular.

01:01:43,298 --> 01:01:43,838
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:01:44,002 --> 01:01:47,377
SPEAKER_1:  And that's where Hawking radiation, this prediction starts to come.

01:01:47,377 --> 01:01:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  That's where Hawking radiation comes in.

01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  And that problem...

01:01:51,906 --> 01:01:53,790
SPEAKER_0:  of how the information gets in and out.

01:01:54,178 --> 01:01:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  You can't, you couldn't have explained.

01:01:57,538 --> 01:02:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  how information gets in and out of an iPhone without first explaining.

01:02:02,466 --> 01:02:04,318
SPEAKER_0:  how it's stored in the first place.

01:02:04,962 --> 01:02:06,750
SPEAKER_1:  So just to clarify the storage.

01:02:07,266 --> 01:02:08,222
SPEAKER_1:  is on the plate.

01:02:08,898 --> 01:02:12,798
SPEAKER_1:  is on the plate on the holographic plate and then it projects somehow inside.

01:02:13,218 --> 01:02:14,343
SPEAKER_1:  The... The...

01:02:14,343 --> 01:02:14,846
SPEAKER_0:  bulk.

01:02:15,074 --> 01:02:17,758
SPEAKER_0:  The space-time is the hologram.

01:02:18,114 --> 01:02:18,782
SPEAKER_1:  hologram.

01:02:19,554 --> 01:02:21,822
SPEAKER_1:  Man, I mean, do you have an intuitive?

01:02:22,082 --> 01:02:28,638
SPEAKER_1:  When you sit late at night and you stare at the stars, do you have an intuitive understanding of what a holographic plate is?

01:02:30,658 --> 01:02:31,230
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:02:31,874 --> 01:02:35,518
SPEAKER_1:  that there's two dimensional projections A

01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  how a black hole

01:02:40,578 --> 01:02:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  could store information on a holographic.

01:02:43,938 --> 01:02:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  plate.

01:02:46,114 --> 01:02:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  I think we do understand.

01:02:47,938 --> 01:02:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  in.

01:02:48,834 --> 01:02:54,302
SPEAKER_0:  in great mathematical detail and also intuitively, and it's very much like an ordinary.

01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  hologram where you have a holographic plate and you shh.

01:02:58,914 --> 01:03:01,662
SPEAKER_0:  contains all the information, you shine a light through it.

01:03:01,922 --> 01:03:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  You get it.

01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:04,094
SPEAKER_0:  image which looks

01:03:04,706 --> 01:03:05,406
SPEAKER_0:  three-dimensional.

01:03:05,858 --> 01:03:07,678
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, but why should there be a holographic?

01:03:11,074 --> 01:03:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  Why should there be? Yeah lab's

01:03:12,866 --> 01:03:13,310
SPEAKER_0:  Why?

01:03:14,626 --> 01:03:15,454
SPEAKER_0:  That is the great.

01:03:16,194 --> 01:03:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  thing about being a theoretical.

01:03:18,338 --> 01:03:19,294
SPEAKER_0:  Her sisters.

01:03:20,482 --> 01:03:25,982
SPEAKER_0:  anybody can very quickly stump you with going to the next level of whys.

01:03:26,434 --> 01:03:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, so if you're asking, you could just keep asking and it won't take you very long to.

01:03:33,634 --> 01:03:35,838
SPEAKER_0:  So the trick in being a theorist...

01:03:36,386 --> 01:03:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  theoretical physics.

01:03:37,794 --> 01:03:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  is finding the questions that.

01:03:40,514 --> 01:03:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  you can answer. Sure.

01:03:42,370 --> 01:03:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  So the questions that we think we might be able to answer now.

01:03:47,202 --> 01:03:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  partially answered.

01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:49,726
SPEAKER_0:  is

01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  that...

01:03:51,906 --> 01:03:53,662
SPEAKER_0:  There is holographic.

01:03:54,242 --> 01:03:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  explanation for certain

01:03:56,546 --> 01:03:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  So-

01:03:57,186 --> 01:03:59,198
SPEAKER_0:  kinds of things in string theory.

01:04:00,322 --> 01:04:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  We've answered that.

01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:04,606
SPEAKER_0:  Now we'd like to take what we've learned and that's…

01:04:04,834 --> 01:04:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  what I've mostly been doing for the last…

01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:07,358
SPEAKER_0:  15.

01:04:08,642 --> 01:04:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  20 years, I haven't.

01:04:09,858 --> 01:04:13,374
SPEAKER_0:  really been working so much on string theory proper. T

01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,998
SPEAKER_0:  taking the lessons that you.

01:04:16,674 --> 01:04:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  We.

01:04:17,410 --> 01:04:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  learned in string theory.

01:04:19,298 --> 01:04:22,238
SPEAKER_0:  and trying to apply them to the real world.

01:04:23,042 --> 01:04:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  using only

01:04:25,346 --> 01:04:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  assuming only what we know for sure about the real world.

01:04:28,578 --> 01:04:33,662
SPEAKER_1:  So on this topic, you co-wrote, co-authored a paper with Stephen Hawking called

01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:42,078
SPEAKER_1:  soft hair on black holes. That makes the argument against Hawking's original prediction that black holes destroy information. Can you explain this paper?

01:04:42,978 --> 01:04:44,446
SPEAKER_1:  Yes. And the title.

01:04:45,346 --> 01:04:47,774
SPEAKER_0:  OK, so first of all,

01:04:48,898 --> 01:04:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  The hair on black holes.

01:04:51,810 --> 01:04:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  is a word that was

01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:54,686
SPEAKER_0:  point.

01:04:55,426 --> 01:04:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  by the greatest.

01:04:57,186 --> 01:04:58,206
SPEAKER_0:  Phrase Master.

01:04:58,850 --> 01:04:59,742
SPEAKER_0:  in the history of.

01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  Physics John Wheeler invented the word black hole.

01:05:03,682 --> 01:05:05,726
SPEAKER_0:  And he also said...

01:05:05,954 --> 01:05:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  that.

01:05:06,882 --> 01:05:08,830
SPEAKER_0:  He made the statement that

01:05:09,218 --> 01:05:09,982
SPEAKER_0:  Black holes.

01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  have no hair.

01:05:11,586 --> 01:05:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  That is.

01:05:13,122 --> 01:05:15,230
SPEAKER_0:  every black hole in the universe.

01:05:16,674 --> 01:05:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  is described.

01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  just by its mass.

01:05:20,162 --> 01:05:20,830
SPEAKER_0:  and spin.

01:05:21,858 --> 01:05:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  They can also rotate, as was later shown by.

01:05:27,042 --> 01:05:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  And, um...

01:05:30,242 --> 01:05:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  and this is very much unlike a star.

01:05:33,794 --> 01:05:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  Every star of the same.

01:05:37,186 --> 01:05:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  Mass.

01:05:38,146 --> 01:05:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  is different.

01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  in a multitude.

01:05:41,634 --> 01:05:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  of different ways.

01:05:43,394 --> 01:05:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  different.

01:05:44,642 --> 01:05:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  chemical compositions, different motions.

01:05:48,098 --> 01:05:49,918
SPEAKER_0:  of the individual molecules.

01:05:50,402 --> 01:05:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  every star in the universe.

01:05:53,026 --> 01:05:54,686
SPEAKER_0:  even of the same mass.

01:05:55,074 --> 01:05:57,598
SPEAKER_0:  is different in many, many different ways.

01:05:58,466 --> 01:06:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  Black holes are all the same.

01:06:01,314 --> 01:06:04,798
SPEAKER_0:  And that means when you throw something, in Einstein's description of them.

01:06:05,954 --> 01:06:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  which we think must be corrected.

01:06:08,962 --> 01:06:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  And, um...

01:06:11,042 --> 01:06:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  If you throw something into a black hole,

01:06:13,506 --> 01:06:14,942
SPEAKER_0:  It gets sucked in.

01:06:15,682 --> 01:06:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  And if you...

01:06:17,058 --> 01:06:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhh...

01:06:18,722 --> 01:06:19,454
SPEAKER_0:  throw in our

01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  red book or a blue book.

01:06:22,754 --> 01:06:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  black hole gets a little bigger, but there's no way.

01:06:25,794 --> 01:06:27,358
SPEAKER_0:  within Einstein's theory.

01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  of telling.

01:06:29,058 --> 01:06:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  how they're different.

01:06:32,386 --> 01:06:35,998
SPEAKER_0:  And that was one of the assumptions.

01:06:36,674 --> 01:06:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  that Hawking made.

01:06:38,466 --> 01:06:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  in his 19.

01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  74, 75.

01:06:42,562 --> 01:06:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  Papers.

01:06:43,778 --> 01:06:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  in which he concluded...

01:06:46,018 --> 01:06:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  that black holes destroy information. You can throw encyclopedias, thesis defenses.

01:06:52,610 --> 01:06:54,046
SPEAKER_0:  the Library of Congress.

01:06:54,466 --> 01:06:58,430
SPEAKER_1:  It doesn't matter, it's going to behave exactly the same uniform way.

01:06:58,530 --> 01:06:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:06:59,298 --> 01:06:59,774
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:07:00,034 --> 01:07:02,814
SPEAKER_0:  What Hawking and I showed...

01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:04,894
SPEAKER_0:  and also Malcolm Perry.

01:07:05,506 --> 01:07:06,014
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:08,798
SPEAKER_0:  is that...

01:07:09,026 --> 01:07:11,902
SPEAKER_0:  one has to be very careful.

01:07:12,386 --> 01:07:14,078
SPEAKER_0:  about what happens.

01:07:15,522 --> 01:07:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  the boundary of the black.

01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:21,246
SPEAKER_0:  And this gets back to something I mentioned earlier.

01:07:21,634 --> 01:07:23,422
SPEAKER_0:  about when two things

01:07:23,682 --> 01:07:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  which are related by a coordinate transformation.

01:07:26,946 --> 01:07:28,286
SPEAKER_0:  are and are not.

01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  equivalent.

01:07:31,042 --> 01:07:32,254
SPEAKER_0:  And...

01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  and what we showed.

01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  is that they're very subtle imprints when you throw something into a black hole.

01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:45,246
SPEAKER_0:  there are very subtle imprints left on the horizon of the black hole

01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  which you can read off.

01:07:48,002 --> 01:07:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  at least partially.

01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:50,526
SPEAKER_0:  what went in.

01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  And.

01:07:53,314 --> 01:07:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  So this...

01:07:54,882 --> 01:07:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  invalidates

01:07:57,122 --> 01:07:58,046
SPEAKER_0:  Stevens.

01:07:58,690 --> 01:07:59,422
SPEAKER_0:  original.

01:07:59,938 --> 01:08:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhh

01:08:00,962 --> 01:08:03,765
SPEAKER_0:  argument that the information is destroyed.

01:08:03,765 --> 01:08:05,265
SPEAKER_1:  and that's a soft hair those that's

01:08:05,265 --> 01:08:06,558
SPEAKER_0:  The soft hair. Right.

01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:10,686
SPEAKER_0:  So, and soft is the word that is used in physics for...

01:08:11,234 --> 01:08:13,374
SPEAKER_0:  things which have very low energy.

01:08:14,018 --> 01:08:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  and these things actually carry no energy.

01:08:17,186 --> 01:08:19,838
SPEAKER_0:  There are things in the universe which carry no energy.

01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:21,374
SPEAKER_1:  You said.

01:08:21,666 --> 01:08:23,070
SPEAKER_1:  I think to Sean Carroll.

01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:28,990
SPEAKER_1:  Um, by the way, everyone should go check out Sean Carroll's mindscape podcast. It's incredible.

01:08:29,602 --> 01:08:33,822
SPEAKER_1:  And Sean Carroll is an incredible person. I think you said there, maybe in a paper, I have a quote.

01:08:34,242 --> 01:08:36,702
SPEAKER_1:  You said that a soft particle is a particle.

01:08:37,666 --> 01:08:39,934
SPEAKER_1:  that has zero energy, just like you said now.

01:08:40,258 --> 01:08:44,318
SPEAKER_1:  And when the energy goes to zero, because the energy is proportionate to the wavelength,

01:08:44,642 --> 01:08:47,806
SPEAKER_1:  It's also spread over an infinitely large distance.

01:08:48,226 --> 01:08:48,926
SPEAKER_1:  If you like

01:08:49,154 --> 01:08:50,686
SPEAKER_1:  It's spread over the whole universe.

01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:53,214
SPEAKER_1:  It somehow runs off to the boundary.

01:08:53,826 --> 01:08:55,294
SPEAKER_1:  What we learned from that.

01:08:55,522 --> 01:08:59,134
SPEAKER_1:  is that if you add a zero energy particle to the vacuum, you get a new state.

01:08:59,554 --> 01:09:00,158
SPEAKER_1:  And so...

01:09:00,482 --> 01:09:03,198
SPEAKER_1:  there are infinitely many vacua.

01:09:04,834 --> 01:09:07,998
SPEAKER_1:  for vacuum which can be thought of as

01:09:08,578 --> 01:09:14,942
SPEAKER_1:  being different from one another by the addition of soft photons or soft gravitons.

01:09:15,266 --> 01:09:17,374
SPEAKER_1:  elaborate on this wild idea.

01:09:18,754 --> 01:09:21,470
SPEAKER_1:  If you like it spreads over the whole universe.

01:09:21,986 --> 01:09:28,318
SPEAKER_1:  When the energy goes to zero, because the energy is proportionate to the wavelength, it also spreads over an infinitely large distance if you like.

01:09:28,866 --> 01:09:32,094
SPEAKER_1:  It's spread over the whole universe. It's spread over the whole universe. What?

01:09:32,322 --> 01:09:32,798
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:09:33,762 --> 01:09:36,510
SPEAKER_1:  Can you explain these soft gravitons and photons?

01:09:37,378 --> 01:09:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, so the soft gravitons and photons

01:09:41,986 --> 01:09:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  have been.

01:09:43,426 --> 01:09:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhh...

01:09:44,578 --> 01:09:45,534
SPEAKER_0:  known about.

01:09:45,954 --> 01:09:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  since the 60s.

01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  but.

01:09:48,866 --> 01:09:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  exactly what we're supposed to do with them or how we're supposed to.

01:09:52,642 --> 01:09:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  Think about them.

01:09:53,954 --> 01:09:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:09:55,074 --> 01:09:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  I think has been an

01:09:57,346 --> 01:09:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  well understood.

01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  Only recently.

01:10:01,922 --> 01:10:02,526
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:10:02,914 --> 01:10:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  In quantum mechanics, the energy of a particle

01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  is proportional to Planck's constant times its wavelength.

01:10:12,322 --> 01:10:16,702
SPEAKER_0:  So when the energy goes to zero, the wavelength goes to infinity.

01:10:17,794 --> 01:10:18,142
SPEAKER_0:  Now.

01:10:18,594 --> 01:10:20,286
SPEAKER_0:  If something has...

01:10:20,866 --> 01:10:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhhhhh...

01:10:22,146 --> 01:10:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  zero energy and it's spread all over the universe.

01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  In what sense is it actually there?

01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:29,726
SPEAKER_0:  That's.

01:10:30,178 --> 01:10:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. That's.

01:10:31,298 --> 01:10:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  been the confusing thing.

01:10:33,442 --> 01:10:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  to make a precise statement.

01:10:36,034 --> 01:10:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  about.

01:10:36,802 --> 01:10:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  when something is and isn't there.

01:10:39,874 --> 01:10:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  Now.

01:10:40,514 --> 01:10:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  The simplest way of seeing

01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  So

01:10:44,994 --> 01:10:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  people might have taken the point of view.

01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  that if it has...

01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:53,406
SPEAKER_0:  zero energy and is spread all over the universe.

01:10:53,762 --> 01:10:55,454
SPEAKER_0:  It's not there, we can ignore it.

01:10:57,666 --> 01:10:58,206
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:10:59,042 --> 01:11:00,670
SPEAKER_0:  But if you do this...

01:11:01,058 --> 01:11:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  you'll get into trouble.

01:11:03,234 --> 01:11:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  And one of the ways that you'll get into trouble...

01:11:05,666 --> 01:11:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  is that even though it has zero energy...

01:11:08,578 --> 01:11:10,654
SPEAKER_0:  It doesn't have zero angular momentum.

01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  If it's a photon, it always has angular momentum one. If it's a graviton, it's...

01:11:17,154 --> 01:11:17,598
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:11:18,018 --> 01:11:19,262
SPEAKER_0:  Angle Momentum II.

01:11:21,826 --> 01:11:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  So you can't say that.

01:11:23,906 --> 01:11:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  This.

01:11:24,706 --> 01:11:25,950
SPEAKER_0:  State of the system.

01:11:26,562 --> 01:11:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  with

01:11:27,458 --> 01:11:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  the zero energy photon.

01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  should be identified with the one

01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  without the zero energy photon that we can just ignore them because then you will conclude.

01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  that angular momentum is not conserved.

01:11:41,954 --> 01:11:45,854
SPEAKER_0:  And if angular momentum is not conserved, things won't be consistent.

01:11:47,682 --> 01:11:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  And, um...

01:11:49,506 --> 01:11:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  And of course, you can have a lot of these things, and typically you do get a lot of them.

01:11:54,818 --> 01:12:00,414
SPEAKER_0:  And when you can actually do a calculation that shows that every time you scatter

01:12:01,698 --> 01:12:04,190
SPEAKER_0:  particles you create an infinite number of them.

01:12:04,642 --> 01:12:08,062
SPEAKER_1:  infinite number of the soft photons and zero energy ones.

01:12:08,994 --> 01:12:11,486
SPEAKER_1:  And so these are, and there's somehow everywhere.

01:12:11,938 --> 01:12:16,063
SPEAKER_1:  but they're also contained information or they're able to store information.

01:12:16,063 --> 01:12:19,646
SPEAKER_0:  and they're able to store information. They're able to store an arbitrary

01:12:20,098 --> 01:12:21,438
SPEAKER_0:  large amount of information.

01:12:22,466 --> 01:12:22,942
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:25,182
SPEAKER_0:  What we pointed out is.

01:12:25,858 --> 01:12:31,070
SPEAKER_0:  So what these things really do, one way of thinking of them is they rush off to the edges of the universe.

01:12:31,586 --> 01:12:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  spreading out all over the space. It's like saying they rush off to the energy edge of the universe.

01:12:37,538 --> 01:12:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  And that includes, if the interior of the black hole is not considered part of the universe, that includes the edge of the black hole.

01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  So we need to set up our description of physics.

01:12:50,978 --> 01:12:52,766
SPEAKER_0:  so that all the things that...

01:12:53,378 --> 01:12:54,462
SPEAKER_0:  are conserved.

01:12:56,002 --> 01:12:58,622
SPEAKER_0:  are still conserved in the way that we're describing.

01:12:59,554 --> 01:13:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  And that will not be true if we ignore these things. We have to keep careful track of these things.

01:13:05,186 --> 01:13:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  and people had been sloppy about that.

01:13:07,842 --> 01:13:10,686
SPEAKER_0:  And we learned how to be very precise and careful about it.

01:13:11,074 --> 01:13:20,615
SPEAKER_1:  And this, and once you're being precise, you can actually, that makes, you can actually answer this kind of very problematic thing that Hawking suggested that black holes destroy.

01:13:20,615 --> 01:13:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  Well

01:13:22,082 --> 01:13:23,422
SPEAKER_0:  what we showed.

01:13:24,098 --> 01:13:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  is that there's an error in the argument.

01:13:27,618 --> 01:13:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  that all black holes are the same because they hadn't kept track of these.

01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  these very subtle things.

01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  and whether or not...

01:13:39,874 --> 01:13:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  This is the key error in the argument.

01:13:43,490 --> 01:13:44,798
SPEAKER_0:  remains to be seen.

01:13:45,410 --> 01:13:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  or whether this is a technical point.

01:13:48,226 --> 01:13:49,150
SPEAKER_1:  But it is an error.

01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:50,270
SPEAKER_1:  It is an error.

01:13:50,914 --> 01:13:53,539
SPEAKER_1:  and Hawking obviously agreed.

01:13:53,539 --> 01:13:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  Hawking agreed with it. He was sure that this was the

01:13:57,410 --> 01:13:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  He was sure that this was.

01:13:59,362 --> 01:14:04,350
SPEAKER_0:  This was a critical error. That this was the critical error and that understanding this would...

01:14:05,314 --> 01:14:08,958
SPEAKER_0:  would get us the whole story and that could well be.

01:14:09,474 --> 01:14:13,918
SPEAKER_1:  What was it like working with Stephen Hawking on this particular problem? Because when we are working together, I think, as StephenCollins said, there has never been any problem

01:14:14,370 --> 01:14:15,678
SPEAKER_1:  It's kind of a whole journey.

01:14:15,874 --> 01:14:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  Well, you know, I love the guy. He's so...

01:14:21,058 --> 01:14:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  passionate about.

01:14:23,714 --> 01:14:24,254
SPEAKER_0:  physics.

01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  He just...

01:14:27,650 --> 01:14:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  His.

01:14:29,890 --> 01:14:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  His oneness with...

01:14:32,994 --> 01:14:34,110
SPEAKER_0:  problem and

01:14:34,658 --> 01:14:35,326
SPEAKER_0:  I mean it's...

01:14:36,482 --> 01:14:40,094
SPEAKER_1:  So his mind is all occupied by the world that's... Yeah...

01:14:40,386 --> 01:14:45,726
SPEAKER_0:  And let me tell you, there's a lot of other things with his illness and with his celebrity.

01:14:46,242 --> 01:14:47,774
SPEAKER_0:  for a lot of other things.

01:14:49,538 --> 01:14:51,230
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of distractions pulling at this.

01:14:51,522 --> 01:14:54,147
SPEAKER_1:  uh... as mine he's still there

01:14:54,147 --> 01:14:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  That's right, that's right. I remember him turning down.

01:14:57,922 --> 01:14:59,646
SPEAKER_0:  with Lady Gaga so we could...

01:14:59,938 --> 01:15:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  spend another hour on our paper.

01:15:02,242 --> 01:15:03,390
SPEAKER_0: �

01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:06,755
SPEAKER_0:  Everyone reads them只是 themselves.

01:15:06,755 --> 01:15:14,078
SPEAKER_1:  My friends is dedication. What did you learn about physics? What did you learn about life from having worked?

01:15:14,274 --> 01:15:20,638
SPEAKER_0:  with Stephen Hawking. Well, he was one of my great teachers. Of course, he's older than me and I was reading his.

01:15:22,082 --> 01:15:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  his textbooks in.

01:15:26,626 --> 01:15:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  in graduate school.

01:15:28,066 --> 01:15:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  and um

01:15:30,050 --> 01:15:30,910
SPEAKER_0:  practise that Matcha�

01:15:31,394 --> 01:15:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I learned a lot about relativity from him. I learned about...

01:15:36,162 --> 01:15:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  passion for a problem. I learned about...

01:15:42,146 --> 01:15:43,518
SPEAKER_0:  not caring what other...

01:15:44,578 --> 01:15:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  people think, you know.

01:15:46,754 --> 01:15:47,582
SPEAKER_0:  Physics isn't.

01:15:48,514 --> 01:15:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  interesting culture, even if you make a...

01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  Great discovery.

01:15:52,514 --> 01:15:53,630
SPEAKER_0:  Like Hawking Dead?

01:15:54,722 --> 01:15:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:15:55,682 --> 01:15:57,886
SPEAKER_0:  People don't believe everything you say.

01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  In fact, people love to disagree.

01:16:02,114 --> 01:16:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  It's a culture that cherishes disagreement. And so, you know, he...

01:16:10,754 --> 01:16:12,862
SPEAKER_0:  kept ahead with what he believed in.

01:16:13,186 --> 01:16:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  Sometimes he was right and sometimes he was wrong.

01:16:15,586 --> 01:16:18,878
SPEAKER_1:  Do you feel pressure from the community? So for example with strength theory

01:16:19,682 --> 01:16:23,422
SPEAKER_1:  It was very popular for a time. There's a bit of criticism.

01:16:23,778 --> 01:16:25,054
SPEAKER_1:  or it's less popular now.

01:16:25,602 --> 01:16:30,910
SPEAKER_1:  Do you feel the forces of the community as it moves in and out of different fields, or do you try to stay?

01:16:31,266 --> 01:16:36,606
SPEAKER_1:  Like how difficult is it to stay intellectually and mathematically independent from the community?

01:16:39,906 --> 01:16:40,862
SPEAKER_0:  Personally...

01:16:43,330 --> 01:16:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  AaAaAaAaAs

01:16:44,322 --> 01:16:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  I'm lucky.

01:16:46,914 --> 01:16:48,382
SPEAKER_0:  I'm well equipped for that.

01:16:49,666 --> 01:16:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  I, when I.

01:16:52,578 --> 01:16:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  started out in graduate school, the problem of quantum gravity was

01:16:58,690 --> 01:17:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  not considered interesting.

01:17:01,282 --> 01:17:07,902
SPEAKER_0:  You still did it anyway. I still did it anyway. I'm a little bit of a contrarian, I guess, and I think that has—

01:17:08,578 --> 01:17:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  has served me well.

01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:10,878
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:17:11,682 --> 01:17:12,926
SPEAKER_0:  And...

01:17:15,234 --> 01:17:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  People are always sort of disagreeing with me.

01:17:18,178 --> 01:17:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  end.

01:17:18,946 --> 01:17:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  They're usually right, but...

01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  I'm right enough.

01:17:22,498 --> 01:17:26,398
SPEAKER_1:  And like you said, the contradiction ultimately paves the path of discovery.

01:17:26,722 --> 01:17:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:17:27,618 --> 01:17:32,126
SPEAKER_1:  Let me ask you just on this tension we've been dancing between physics and mathematics.

01:17:32,514 --> 01:17:33,566
SPEAKER_1:  What to use?

01:17:33,858 --> 01:17:34,526
SPEAKER_1:  and interesting.

01:17:34,786 --> 01:17:41,342
SPEAKER_1:  line you can draw between the two. You have done some very complicated mathematics in your life to explore the laws of nature.

01:17:41,826 --> 01:17:44,990
SPEAKER_1:  What's the difference between physics and mathematics?

01:17:45,954 --> 01:17:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  to you.

01:17:46,786 --> 01:17:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  Well, um...

01:17:49,762 --> 01:17:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  I love math. I think my first love is...

01:17:52,578 --> 01:17:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  is physics and the math that I've done.

01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:58,526
SPEAKER_0:  I've done too because it was needed.

01:17:59,682 --> 01:18:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  In service of physics. But then, of course, in the

01:18:04,866 --> 01:18:07,262
SPEAKER_0:  in the heat of it, it has its own.

01:18:08,098 --> 01:18:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  In the heat of it, I like it.

01:18:11,362 --> 01:18:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  Sure. It has its own appeal and I certainly enjoyed it.

01:18:16,802 --> 01:18:20,606
SPEAKER_0:  Ultimately, I would like to think. I wouldn't say I believe.

01:18:21,442 --> 01:18:22,142
SPEAKER_0:  But I would.

01:18:22,466 --> 01:18:22,878
SPEAKER_0:  like

01:18:23,394 --> 01:18:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  like to think that there's no difference between.

01:18:26,498 --> 01:18:28,030
SPEAKER_0:  physics and mathematics that

01:18:30,114 --> 01:18:31,422
SPEAKER_0:  Or mathematics.

01:18:32,194 --> 01:18:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  is realized in the physical world.

01:18:35,074 --> 01:18:36,222
SPEAKER_0:  All physics has a...

01:18:36,994 --> 01:18:40,126
SPEAKER_0:  for a mathematical basis, that they're really the same thing. I mean...

01:18:40,738 --> 01:18:44,222
SPEAKER_0:  Why would there be math that had no physical?

01:18:46,306 --> 01:18:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  manifestation. It seems a little odd, right?

01:18:49,794 --> 01:18:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  have two kinds of math, some that...

01:18:52,834 --> 01:18:53,959
SPEAKER_0:  are relevant to the real world.

01:18:53,959 --> 01:18:57,470
SPEAKER_1:  Well, they don't have to be contradictory, but you can have, can't you not have.

01:18:57,730 --> 01:19:01,054
SPEAKER_1:  mathematical objects that are not at all connected to the physical world.

01:19:01,506 --> 01:19:04,478
SPEAKER_1:  So I mean, this is to the question of is math discovered or invented?

01:19:05,506 --> 01:19:08,190
SPEAKER_1:  So to you math is discovered.

01:19:08,546 --> 01:19:11,486
SPEAKER_1:  And there's a deep linkage between the two.

01:19:11,714 --> 01:19:12,574
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:19:12,930 --> 01:19:17,630
SPEAKER_1:  Do you find it all compelling these ideas, like something like MaxTagMark?

01:19:18,082 --> 01:19:18,494
SPEAKER_1:  where

01:19:18,978 --> 01:19:21,598
SPEAKER_1:  Our universe is actually fundamentally a mathematical object.

01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:23,518
SPEAKER_1:  that math is.

01:19:23,874 --> 01:19:25,246
SPEAKER_1:  Our universe is mathematical.

01:19:25,794 --> 01:19:27,582
SPEAKER_1:  fundamentally mathematical in nature.

01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  My expertise is a fit.

01:19:31,586 --> 01:19:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  a physicist.

01:19:33,314 --> 01:19:33,854
SPEAKER_0:  doesn't.

01:19:34,402 --> 01:19:35,614
SPEAKER_0:  add anything to that?

01:19:36,066 --> 01:19:37,150
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:19:37,698 --> 01:19:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  It's not really, you know, physics is.

01:19:40,834 --> 01:19:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I was once very interested in.

01:19:45,602 --> 01:19:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  philosophy and

01:19:48,386 --> 01:19:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  you know, physics.

01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  physics

01:19:51,746 --> 01:19:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  I like questions that...

01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  can be answered.

01:19:54,690 --> 01:19:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  that.

01:19:55,298 --> 01:19:57,406
SPEAKER_0:  It's not obvious what the answer is.

01:19:57,922 --> 01:19:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  and that you can find a...

01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  and answer the question.

01:20:02,306 --> 01:20:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  and everybody will agree.

01:20:04,738 --> 01:20:08,862
SPEAKER_0:  what the answer is and that there's an algorithm for getting there.

01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:09,982
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:20:10,242 --> 01:20:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  Not that these other questions aren't interesting.

01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:14,142
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:20:14,498 --> 01:20:18,398
SPEAKER_0:  and they don't somehow have a way of presenting themselves.

01:20:19,202 --> 01:20:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  To me, the interesting thing is to...

01:20:22,850 --> 01:20:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  is motion.

01:20:24,514 --> 01:20:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  in what we know is learning more.

01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  understanding things that we didn't understanding.

01:20:30,594 --> 01:20:31,070
SPEAKER_0:  before.

01:20:31,458 --> 01:20:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  things that seemed.

01:20:32,866 --> 01:20:35,966
SPEAKER_0:  totally confusing, having them seem obvious. That's wonderful.

01:20:36,514 --> 01:20:36,926
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:20:37,922 --> 01:20:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  I think those questions are there.

01:20:40,290 --> 01:20:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  I mean I would

01:20:41,954 --> 01:20:45,150
SPEAKER_0:  even go further, you know, the whole multiverse. I don't.

01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think there's too much we...

01:20:48,354 --> 01:20:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  concrete wherever we're going to be able to.

01:20:50,978 --> 01:20:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  Say about it.

01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:55,582
SPEAKER_1:  This is fascinating because you spent so much time in string theory.

01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:56,766
SPEAKER_1:  which is

01:20:57,058 --> 01:21:00,862
SPEAKER_1:  devoid from a connection to the physical world for a long time.

01:21:01,218 --> 01:21:06,526
SPEAKER_1:  Like it, not the void, but it, it, it, it travels in a mathematical world that seems to be beautiful and consistent.

01:21:06,882 --> 01:21:07,998
SPEAKER_1:  and seems to indicate.

01:21:08,642 --> 01:21:09,854
SPEAKER_1:  uh, that it could be.

01:21:10,434 --> 01:21:10,974
SPEAKER_1:  A

01:21:11,394 --> 01:21:13,726
SPEAKER_1:  a good model of the laws of nature.

01:21:13,986 --> 01:21:14,942
SPEAKER_1:  But there's, it's still.

01:21:15,618 --> 01:21:16,830
SPEAKER_1:  traveling independently.

01:21:17,154 --> 01:21:23,198
SPEAKER_1:  because it's very difficult to experimentally verify. But there's a promise laden in it, in the same way multiverse or...

01:21:23,490 --> 01:21:24,926
SPEAKER_1:  uh... you have a lot of kind of

01:21:25,314 --> 01:21:27,326
SPEAKER_1:  very far out there questions.

01:21:27,586 --> 01:21:33,534
SPEAKER_1:  or your gut instinct intuition says that maybe in fifty hundred two hundred years you'll be able to actually

01:21:33,666 --> 01:21:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  have strong experimental validation.

01:21:38,050 --> 01:21:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  I think that with string theory...

01:21:40,322 --> 01:21:40,862
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think it's likely that we could measure it.

01:21:47,074 --> 01:21:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  but we

01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:49,214
SPEAKER_0:  we could get lucky.

01:21:50,498 --> 01:21:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  In other words, just to take an example, about 10 or 20 years ago,

01:21:55,298 --> 01:21:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  was thought that they had seen a string in the sky.

01:21:59,906 --> 01:22:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  and that it was seen by...

01:22:02,178 --> 01:22:02,878
SPEAKER_0: ...Ummm.

01:22:04,066 --> 01:22:06,398
SPEAKER_0:  you know, doubled stars that were.

01:22:06,722 --> 01:22:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  gravitationally lensed around the

01:22:09,378 --> 01:22:14,558
SPEAKER_0:  gravitational field produced by some long string. There was a line of double instants. Now the signal went away.

01:22:14,882 --> 01:22:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

01:22:17,410 --> 01:22:21,438
SPEAKER_0:  people were hoping that they'd seen a string, could be a fundamental string that

01:22:21,666 --> 01:22:23,262
SPEAKER_0:  It's somehow gotten stretched and...

01:22:23,746 --> 01:22:25,822
SPEAKER_0:  That would be some evidence for string theory.

01:22:26,594 --> 01:22:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  There was also BICEP2.

01:22:28,994 --> 01:22:29,470
SPEAKER_0:  which...

01:22:31,682 --> 01:22:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  It was a...

01:22:32,994 --> 01:22:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  The experiment was wrong.

01:22:35,042 --> 01:22:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  but.

01:22:35,586 --> 01:22:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  It could have happened.

01:22:37,954 --> 01:22:42,846
SPEAKER_0:  It could have happened that we got lucky, and this experiment was able to make direct measurements.

01:22:43,426 --> 01:22:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  certainly would have been measurements of quantum gravity if not strength.

01:22:48,098 --> 01:22:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  So it's a logical, it's a very logical possibility.

01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  that we could get experimental evidence from strings.

01:22:55,074 --> 01:22:57,022
SPEAKER_0:  That is a very different thing.

01:22:57,698 --> 01:23:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  than saying, do this experiment.

01:23:00,514 --> 01:23:01,822
SPEAKER_0:  Here's a billion dollars.

01:23:02,082 --> 01:23:04,638
SPEAKER_0:  and after you do it we'll know whether or not strings are real.

01:23:05,570 --> 01:23:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  But I think it's a crucial difference.

01:23:08,642 --> 01:23:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  It's measurable in principle.

01:23:11,298 --> 01:23:13,278
SPEAKER_0:  And we don't see.

01:23:13,698 --> 01:23:14,558
SPEAKER_0:  how to get.

01:23:16,002 --> 01:23:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  from here to there.

01:23:18,882 --> 01:23:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  If we see how to get from here to there.

01:23:21,858 --> 01:23:23,166
SPEAKER_0:  In my eyes, it's boring.

01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  Right? So when I was a graduate student.

01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  they knew how to measure the Higgs boson.

01:23:32,098 --> 01:23:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  took 40 years.

01:23:35,202 --> 01:23:35,806
SPEAKER_0:  They did it.

01:23:36,962 --> 01:23:39,902
SPEAKER_0:  Not to say that stuff is boring. I don't want to say that stuff is boring.

01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  But would Magellan set out?

01:23:44,738 --> 01:23:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  He didn't know he could get around the-

01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  There was no map.

01:23:48,642 --> 01:23:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:23:49,666 --> 01:23:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  So I don't know how we're gonna...

01:23:52,162 --> 01:23:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:23:54,786 --> 01:23:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  connect in a concrete way.

01:23:57,698 --> 01:24:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  all these ideas of string theory.

01:24:00,514 --> 01:24:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  to the real world.

01:24:02,210 --> 01:24:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  You know, when I started out in graduate school, I said, what is the most interesting problem?

01:24:09,186 --> 01:24:14,110
SPEAKER_0:  that there might be the deepest, most interesting problem, that there might be progress on.

01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  in 60 years.

01:24:17,538 --> 01:24:18,526
SPEAKER_0:  And.

01:24:19,490 --> 01:24:20,254
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

01:24:20,514 --> 01:24:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  It could be, you know, that...

01:24:24,258 --> 01:24:26,526
SPEAKER_0:  you know, in another 30 years that.

01:24:26,786 --> 01:24:28,286
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe we'll learn that...

01:24:29,026 --> 01:24:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  We have understood how black holes store information.

01:24:32,322 --> 01:24:32,702
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

01:24:32,962 --> 01:24:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  That doesn't seem wild.

01:24:35,522 --> 01:24:35,838
SPEAKER_0:  that.

01:24:36,226 --> 01:24:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  that we're able to abstract what we learned from string theory.

01:24:39,746 --> 01:24:41,438
SPEAKER_0:  show that it's operative and.

01:24:42,178 --> 01:24:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  And, you know, I mean, the Bose-Einstein con that they did, you know, when Bose and Einstein...

01:24:51,074 --> 01:24:52,414
SPEAKER_0:  predicted it.

01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:55,550
SPEAKER_0:  When was that? The 30s maybe? Early 30s?

01:24:56,450 --> 01:24:57,022
SPEAKER_0:  It took.

01:24:57,602 --> 01:25:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  There were 20 orders of magnitude that were needed.

01:25:01,762 --> 01:25:04,318
SPEAKER_0:  in order to improvement, in order to measure it.

01:25:04,674 --> 01:25:05,086
SPEAKER_0:

01:25:05,314 --> 01:25:05,982
SPEAKER_0:  And they did.

01:25:06,754 --> 01:25:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  50 years later.

01:25:08,610 --> 01:25:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  So, and then you couldn't have guessed how that had happened, how they could have got.

01:25:14,690 --> 01:25:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  And it could happen that we, I don't think we're gonna light.

01:25:18,754 --> 01:25:22,270
SPEAKER_0:  see the heterotic string spectrum at an accelerator. But

01:25:23,010 --> 01:25:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  But it could be that...

01:25:26,050 --> 01:25:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  things come around and...

01:25:29,730 --> 01:25:31,198
SPEAKER_0:  in an interesting way and

01:25:32,098 --> 01:25:35,582
SPEAKER_0:  somehow it comes together. The fact that we can't see to the end.

01:25:36,962 --> 01:25:38,014
SPEAKER_0:  isn't a reason.

01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  not to do it. Okay?

01:25:40,930 --> 01:25:43,166
SPEAKER_0:  What did they do when they were trying to find the

01:25:43,746 --> 01:25:47,646
SPEAKER_0:  specific, right? They just took every route. They just tried everything.

01:25:47,970 --> 01:25:49,022
SPEAKER_0:  And that's what we're doing.

01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  and we're taking.

01:25:50,690 --> 01:25:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm taking the one.

01:25:53,122 --> 01:25:55,134
SPEAKER_0:  my nose tells me is the best.

01:25:55,394 --> 01:25:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  And other people are taking other ones, and that's good.

01:25:58,786 --> 01:25:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  because we need every

01:26:00,770 --> 01:26:02,334
SPEAKER_0:  every person taking every route.

01:26:03,298 --> 01:26:05,758
SPEAKER_0:  And you know, if somebody on another route...

01:26:06,498 --> 01:26:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhhh...

01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:10,718
SPEAKER_0:  find something that looks really promising, you know, I'm going to...

01:26:11,010 --> 01:26:12,574
SPEAKER_0:  make a portage over the mountain and...

01:26:12,866 --> 01:26:14,302
SPEAKER_0:  Get on their stream, you know?

01:26:14,722 --> 01:26:15,134
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:26:15,458 --> 01:26:16,830
SPEAKER_0:  The fact that you don't...

01:26:18,722 --> 01:26:22,814
SPEAKER_0:  See the experiment now isn't to me a reason to.

01:26:23,170 --> 01:26:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  give up on what I view as the most fundamental.

01:26:27,266 --> 01:26:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  paradox and.

01:26:28,578 --> 01:26:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  20th century.

01:26:30,274 --> 01:26:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  20th in present physics, 20, 21st century physics.

01:26:33,346 --> 01:26:36,926
SPEAKER_1:  Absolutely. You can see that it's possible. You just don't know the way.

01:26:37,154 --> 01:26:45,982
SPEAKER_1:  But that's what I mean why some of the philosophical questions could be formulated in a way that's explorable scientifically. So some of the stuff we've talked about.

01:26:46,594 --> 01:26:48,094
SPEAKER_1:  But for example,

01:26:48,866 --> 01:26:52,190
SPEAKER_1:  this topic has become more okay to talk about.

01:26:52,450 --> 01:26:54,174
SPEAKER_1:  which is the topic of consciousness.

01:26:55,074 --> 01:26:59,550
SPEAKER_1:  You know to me as an artificial intelligence person that's a very practically interesting topic

01:26:59,778 --> 01:27:01,566
SPEAKER_1:  but there's also philosophers.

01:27:01,826 --> 01:27:02,238
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:27:02,562 --> 01:27:03,294
SPEAKER_1:  Sean Carroll.

01:27:03,746 --> 01:27:07,669
SPEAKER_1:  loves to argue against them, but there's some philosophers that are panpsychists.

01:27:07,669 --> 01:27:10,669
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not against philosophers, it's just not as fun.

01:27:10,669 --> 01:27:11,966
SPEAKER_1:  That was not fun. Fuck.

01:27:13,058 --> 01:27:14,782
SPEAKER_1:  But they, they, they...

01:27:15,202 --> 01:27:17,950
SPEAKER_1:  start a little flame of a fire going.

01:27:18,498 --> 01:27:21,118
SPEAKER_1:  that some of those flames, I think.

01:27:21,410 --> 01:27:22,782
SPEAKER_1:  eventually become physics.

01:27:23,554 --> 01:27:26,334
SPEAKER_1:  So eventually becomes something that we can really.

01:27:27,426 --> 01:27:31,454
SPEAKER_1:  Having them around is really important because you'll discover something by

01:27:31,714 --> 01:27:37,214
SPEAKER_1:  modeling and exploring black holes. It's really weird and having these ideas around.

01:27:37,698 --> 01:27:39,518
SPEAKER_1:  like the ideas of panpsychist.

01:27:39,778 --> 01:27:42,494
SPEAKER_1:  that consciousness could be a fundamental force of nature.

01:27:43,106 --> 01:27:46,238
SPEAKER_1:  Just even having that crazy idea, swimming around in the background.

01:27:46,754 --> 01:27:48,702
SPEAKER_1:  to really spark something where...

01:27:49,634 --> 01:27:51,582
SPEAKER_1:  that you were missing something completely.

01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:55,518
SPEAKER_1:  And it's just, that's where the philosophy done.

01:27:55,810 --> 01:27:57,278
SPEAKER_1:  Right, I think.

01:27:57,602 --> 01:28:05,790
SPEAKER_1:  is very useful. That's where even the, you know, these thought experiments, which is very fun in the sort of the tech sci-fi world that we live in a simulation.

01:28:06,306 --> 01:28:06,686
SPEAKER_1:  Uh

01:28:07,458 --> 01:28:08,030
SPEAKER_1:  that.

01:28:08,578 --> 01:28:18,622
SPEAKER_1:  you know, taking a perspective of the universe as a, as a computer, as a, as a, as a computational system, the process of information, which is pretty intuitive notion, but you can.

01:28:18,882 --> 01:28:21,086
SPEAKER_1:  just even reframing it that way for yourself.

01:28:21,314 --> 01:28:22,974
SPEAKER_1:  could really open up some.

01:28:23,746 --> 01:28:24,894
SPEAKER_1:  different way of thinking.

01:28:25,186 --> 01:28:25,598
SPEAKER_1:  to me pay.

01:28:26,146 --> 01:28:27,614
SPEAKER_1:  And then you have...

01:28:28,514 --> 01:28:30,366
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if you're familiar with Stephen Wolfram's work.

01:28:30,818 --> 01:28:32,606
SPEAKER_1:  of cellular automaton complexity.

01:28:32,866 --> 01:28:33,182
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:28:33,442 --> 01:28:34,750
SPEAKER_0:  I did a podcast with Steve.

01:28:34,914 --> 01:28:35,870
SPEAKER_1:  Who's doing this?

01:28:36,194 --> 01:28:37,470
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, to me...

01:28:37,794 --> 01:28:39,902
SPEAKER_1:  Forget physics, forget all that.

01:28:40,482 --> 01:28:41,534
SPEAKER_1:  cellular automata.

01:28:42,690 --> 01:28:44,926
SPEAKER_1:  make no sense. They're so beautiful. They're so

01:28:45,218 --> 01:28:46,878
SPEAKER_1:  that from simple rules you can

01:28:47,266 --> 01:28:51,742
SPEAKER_1:  create complexity. I just don't think, you know, you wrote a book on new kind of science.

01:28:52,546 --> 01:28:53,022
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:28:54,562 --> 01:28:55,806
SPEAKER_1:  basically hinting at...

01:28:56,098 --> 01:29:00,670
SPEAKER_1:  which a lot of people have hinted at is like, we don't have a good way to talk about these objects.

01:29:00,994 --> 01:29:06,494
SPEAKER_1:  We can't figure out what is happening here. These simple, these trivial rules can create incredible complexity.

01:29:06,722 --> 01:29:08,254
SPEAKER_0:  He's totally right about that.

01:29:09,538 --> 01:29:11,806
SPEAKER_1:  And physicists, I guess, don't have...

01:29:12,450 --> 01:29:13,406
SPEAKER_1:  Don't know what to do with that.

01:29:14,370 --> 01:29:15,774
SPEAKER_1:  don't know what to do with cellular automata.

01:29:16,418 --> 01:29:16,766
SPEAKER_1:  because.

01:29:16,994 --> 01:29:19,678
SPEAKER_1:  You can describe the simple rules that govern the system.

01:29:20,418 --> 01:29:20,990
SPEAKER_1:  or how f-

01:29:21,250 --> 01:29:22,526
SPEAKER_1:  complexity can emerge.

01:29:23,042 --> 01:29:24,702
SPEAKER_1:  like incredible complexity.

01:29:26,562 --> 01:29:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  Of course, Wolfram's version of that is that physicists will never be able to describe.

01:29:31,202 --> 01:29:31,518
SPEAKER_1:  Right.

01:29:32,066 --> 01:29:34,686
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, exactly. He tries to prove that it's impossible.

01:29:35,298 --> 01:29:36,862
SPEAKER_1:  What do you make of that? What do you-

01:29:37,154 --> 01:29:40,158
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, what do you make about the tension of being a physicist?

01:29:40,514 --> 01:29:41,438
SPEAKER_1:  and potentially.

01:29:42,306 --> 01:29:44,990
SPEAKER_1:  not being able to it's like uh freud or somebody

01:29:45,538 --> 01:29:50,558
SPEAKER_1:  that maybe, Sigmund Freud, maybe you'll never be able to actually describe the human psyche.

01:29:51,458 --> 01:29:53,374
SPEAKER_1:  Is that a possibility for you?

01:29:54,114 --> 01:29:55,902
SPEAKER_1:  that you will never be able to get to the core.

01:29:56,322 --> 01:29:58,558
SPEAKER_1:  the method description of the laws of nature.

01:30:01,442 --> 01:30:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, so I had this conversation with Weinberg.

01:30:07,362 --> 01:30:07,710
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:30:08,098 --> 01:30:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  How'd it go?

01:30:10,722 --> 01:30:14,686
SPEAKER_0:  So Weinberg has this book called Dreams of a Final Theory.

01:30:16,258 --> 01:30:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  And I had this conversation with him. The environment

01:30:19,298 --> 01:30:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  Why do you think?

01:30:20,770 --> 01:30:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:30:21,698 --> 01:30:23,550
SPEAKER_0:  there's ever going to be a final theory.

01:30:23,810 --> 01:30:29,502
SPEAKER_0:  Why should there ever be a final theory? I mean, what does that mean? Do physics departments shut down? We've solved everything.

01:30:30,210 --> 01:30:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:30:31,394 --> 01:30:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:30:32,322 --> 01:30:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  You know, doesn't it seem that every time we answer some old questions, we'll...

01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  We'll just find new ones and that will just keep going on forever and ever.

01:30:43,234 --> 01:30:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  He said, well.

01:30:44,674 --> 01:30:48,126
SPEAKER_0:  That's what they used to say about the Nile. They were never going to find the end.

01:30:48,834 --> 01:30:49,214
SPEAKER_0:  Ha ha!

01:30:49,346 --> 01:30:50,270
SPEAKER_1:  physio ge Price Used

01:30:51,138 --> 01:30:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  Then one day they found it.

01:30:53,090 --> 01:30:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:30:53,922 --> 01:30:55,134
SPEAKER_0:  So, I don't know.

01:30:55,490 --> 01:30:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:30:56,930 --> 01:30:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  String theory doesn't.

01:31:00,130 --> 01:31:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  String theory doesn't look like a candidate to me for.

01:31:04,034 --> 01:31:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  a final theory.

01:31:06,754 --> 01:31:07,582
SPEAKER_1:  as it stands now.

01:31:08,162 --> 01:31:10,787
SPEAKER_1:  It doesn't get to the bottom of the world.

01:31:10,787 --> 01:31:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it seems to me that even if we kind of solved it.

01:31:16,066 --> 01:31:21,694
SPEAKER_0:  did experiments, there still would be more questions, like why are there four dimensions instead of six?

01:31:21,986 --> 01:31:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  doesn't seem to have any.

01:31:23,554 --> 01:31:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  anything in it that would explain that.

01:31:26,754 --> 01:31:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  You can always hope.

01:31:28,642 --> 01:31:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  that there's something that we don't know about string theory that will explain it. But...

01:31:32,930 --> 01:31:34,110
SPEAKER_0:  But it's still...

01:31:34,338 --> 01:31:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  It doesn't look like it's going to answer every question.

01:31:37,698 --> 01:31:38,494
SPEAKER_0:  And...

01:31:39,842 --> 01:31:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  Why is there one time, not two?

01:31:42,082 --> 01:31:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

01:31:43,042 --> 01:31:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  Why is there, you know, it doesn't seem like it's.

01:31:47,010 --> 01:31:49,635
SPEAKER_0:  I don't even know what it would mean to answer every question.

01:31:49,635 --> 01:31:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  Well, to answer every question, obviously.

01:31:52,514 --> 01:31:54,750
SPEAKER_1:  So when you refer to the theory of everything.

01:31:55,522 --> 01:31:56,542
SPEAKER_1:  you'll be able to have a

01:31:58,306 --> 01:31:59,422
SPEAKER_1:  if it exists.

01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:03,006
SPEAKER_1:  It would be a theory that allows you to predict precisely.

01:32:03,618 --> 01:32:06,110
SPEAKER_1:  the behavior of objects in the universe.

01:32:06,658 --> 01:32:07,774
SPEAKER_1:  and there's their movement

01:32:08,386 --> 01:32:08,702
SPEAKER_1:  Right?

01:32:09,538 --> 01:32:10,846
SPEAKER_1:  What about them? Their movement?

01:32:11,746 --> 01:32:12,094
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:32:12,482 --> 01:32:14,357
SPEAKER_1:  I think precisely no matter the.

01:32:14,357 --> 01:32:18,974
SPEAKER_0:  That's true. So that would be a really interesting state of affairs.

01:32:20,130 --> 01:32:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  If we could predict everything.

01:32:23,074 --> 01:32:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  but not necessarily.

01:32:24,866 --> 01:32:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  understand everything.

01:32:27,202 --> 01:32:28,414
SPEAKER_0:  So for example,

01:32:29,346 --> 01:32:33,342
SPEAKER_0:  Let's just forget about gravity. I mean, we're not too far from that situation.

01:32:33,890 --> 01:32:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  If we forget about gravity...

01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:37,374
SPEAKER_0:  The standard model.

01:32:38,306 --> 01:32:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  in principle.

01:32:39,682 --> 01:32:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  given a big enough computer.

01:32:42,402 --> 01:32:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  critics.

01:32:43,426 --> 01:32:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  Almost everything.

01:32:45,410 --> 01:32:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  But.

01:32:47,074 --> 01:32:48,734
SPEAKER_0:  If you look at the standard model...

01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  It's kind of a laundry list with neutrino masses and all that stuff there.

01:32:53,410 --> 01:32:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  There are hundreds of free parameters. Where do they come from?

01:32:57,762 --> 01:32:59,710
SPEAKER_0:  Is there an organizing principle?

01:33:00,450 --> 01:33:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  Is there some further unification?

01:33:03,426 --> 01:33:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  So being able to predict.

01:33:06,530 --> 01:33:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  everything.

01:33:07,810 --> 01:33:10,238
SPEAKER_0:  is not the only goal that physicists have.

01:33:11,746 --> 01:33:16,158
SPEAKER_1:  So on the way to trying to predict, you're trying to understand. That's actually probably the goal is to understand.

01:33:16,290 --> 01:33:16,606
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:33:17,826 --> 01:33:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  But, right, we're more interested in understanding than actually...

01:33:22,882 --> 01:33:24,862
SPEAKER_0:  than actually doing the predictions.

01:33:25,090 --> 01:33:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  but the predictions are more.

01:33:27,330 --> 01:33:29,406
SPEAKER_0:  focusing on how to make predictions.

01:33:29,890 --> 01:33:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  is a good way to...

01:33:32,162 --> 01:33:36,414
SPEAKER_0:  improve your understanding because you know you've understood it if you can do the predictions.

01:33:36,514 --> 01:33:37,790
SPEAKER_1:  It wasn't one of the interesting.

01:33:38,754 --> 01:33:42,718
SPEAKER_1:  that might come to a head with is artificial intelligence.

01:33:43,234 --> 01:33:45,854
SPEAKER_1:  there's an increasing use of AI in...

01:33:46,338 --> 01:33:47,038
SPEAKER_1:  in physics.

01:33:47,554 --> 01:33:49,310
SPEAKER_1:  We might live in a world where

01:33:49,890 --> 01:33:52,574
SPEAKER_1:  I would be able to predict perfectly what's happening.

01:33:52,802 --> 01:33:53,214
SPEAKER_1:  Hmm.

01:33:53,474 --> 01:33:57,022
SPEAKER_1:  And so they'll work as physicists, you'll have to come to.

01:33:57,282 --> 01:33:57,758
SPEAKER_1:

01:33:58,082 --> 01:34:01,342
SPEAKER_1:  to the fact that you're actually not that interested in prediction.

01:34:02,562 --> 01:34:03,678
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, it's very useful.

01:34:03,938 --> 01:34:06,430
SPEAKER_1:  but you're interested in really understanding the deep laws of nature.

01:34:06,818 --> 01:34:10,193
SPEAKER_1:  versus a perfect predictor. Yeah, you want to play chess within it.

01:34:10,193 --> 01:34:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  AI, AI people are trying to understand.

01:34:14,338 --> 01:34:18,526
SPEAKER_0:  what it is that the AI bots have learned in order to.

01:34:20,226 --> 01:34:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  produce whatever they produce.

01:34:21,762 --> 01:34:25,598
SPEAKER_1:  For sure but you still don't understand deeply especially because they're getting

01:34:26,594 --> 01:34:29,726
SPEAKER_1:  You know, especially language models, if you're paying attention.

01:34:30,146 --> 01:34:35,422
SPEAKER_1:  The systems that are able to generate text, they're able to have conversations. ChadGPT is the recent manifestation of that.

01:34:36,066 --> 01:34:37,758
SPEAKER_1:  They just seem to know.

01:34:38,754 --> 01:34:39,902
SPEAKER_1:  They're trained on the internet.

01:34:40,322 --> 01:34:41,214
SPEAKER_1:  There seem to be.

01:34:41,922 --> 01:34:43,518
SPEAKER_1:  Very, very good at...

01:34:44,130 --> 01:34:44,542
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

01:34:44,770 --> 01:34:46,142
SPEAKER_1:  something that looks like reasoning.

01:34:46,530 --> 01:34:47,550
SPEAKER_1:  They're able to generate.

01:34:47,970 --> 01:34:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  You can ask them questions, they can answer questions. It just feels like this thing is intelligent.

01:34:52,578 --> 01:34:53,406
SPEAKER_1:  Right.

01:34:53,698 --> 01:35:06,334
SPEAKER_1:  And I could just see that being possible with physics. You ask any kind of physical question and it'll be able to very precise about a particular star system or a particular black hole. It'll say, well, these are the numbers. It'll perfectly predict.

01:35:07,170 --> 01:35:09,694
SPEAKER_1:  And then sure you can understand.

01:35:10,402 --> 01:35:22,430
SPEAKER_1:  how the neural network is, the architecture is structured. Actually, for most of them now, they're very simple. You can understand what data is trained on. Huge amount of data. You're getting a huge amount of data from a very nice telescope or something.

01:35:23,170 --> 01:35:26,430
SPEAKER_1:  And then, but it seems to predict everything perfectly.

01:35:26,818 --> 01:35:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  You know?

01:35:27,586 --> 01:35:35,262
SPEAKER_1:  how a banana falls when you throw it. Everything is perfectly predicted. You still don't have a deep understanding of what governs the whole thing.

01:35:35,810 --> 01:35:36,254
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:35:37,090 --> 01:35:41,630
SPEAKER_1:  And maybe you can ask it a question. It'll be some kind of hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy type answer.

01:35:41,890 --> 01:35:42,814
SPEAKER_1:  uh... that

01:35:43,074 --> 01:35:44,894
SPEAKER_1:  You know, it's a funny world.

01:35:45,314 --> 01:35:45,822
SPEAKER_1:  Wow.

01:35:46,050 --> 01:35:49,086
SPEAKER_1:  we live in. Of course, it's also possible that there's no such deep.

01:35:49,346 --> 01:35:51,870
SPEAKER_1:  simple governing laws of nature.

01:35:53,410 --> 01:35:54,334
SPEAKER_1:  behind the whole thing.

01:35:54,562 --> 01:35:56,958
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, there's something in us humans.

01:35:57,058 --> 01:35:57,758
SPEAKER_0:  It's possible.

01:35:57,922 --> 01:35:59,582
SPEAKER_1:  that wants it there to be.

01:36:00,002 --> 01:36:05,854
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. But doesn't have to be right. Right. I do. What's, what's, where do you, again, you're betting the, you already bet the farm.

01:36:06,370 --> 01:36:07,966
SPEAKER_1:  But if you were to have a second farm.

01:36:08,674 --> 01:36:13,758
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think there is a theory of everything that we might get at? So, simple laws that govern the whole thing.

01:36:15,554 --> 01:36:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  I don't, I don't...

01:36:18,178 --> 01:36:19,646
SPEAKER_0:  Honestly, I-

01:36:20,386 --> 01:36:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know.

01:36:21,922 --> 01:36:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  but I'm pretty confident that if there is...

01:36:25,378 --> 01:36:27,358
SPEAKER_0:  We won't get to it in my lifetime.

01:36:28,578 --> 01:36:29,630
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think we're near it.

01:36:30,242 --> 01:36:32,862
SPEAKER_1:  But doesn't it feel like the fact that we have...

01:36:33,154 --> 01:36:35,518
SPEAKER_1:  The laws we do, they're relatively simple already.

01:36:36,322 --> 01:36:37,374
SPEAKER_1:  That's kind of incredible.

01:36:37,602 --> 01:36:38,814
SPEAKER_1:  It's just there seems to be...

01:36:39,426 --> 01:36:41,534
SPEAKER_1:  There seems to be simple laws that govern things.

01:36:42,818 --> 01:36:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  By theory of everything, you mean a theory of...

01:36:47,682 --> 01:36:48,926
SPEAKER_0:  of everything.

01:36:49,794 --> 01:36:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  an algorithm to predict everything.

01:36:52,514 --> 01:36:53,470
SPEAKER_0:  but a simple algorithm.

01:36:54,530 --> 01:36:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  a relatively simple algorithm to predict everything.

01:36:58,146 --> 01:37:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  So for me, it would be a sad day.

01:37:01,122 --> 01:37:02,590
SPEAKER_0:  if we arrived at that.

01:37:03,586 --> 01:37:05,886
SPEAKER_0:  without answering some deeper questions.

01:37:07,394 --> 01:37:09,790
SPEAKER_1:  Sure, of course, it definitely is, but the question.

01:37:10,114 --> 01:37:10,718
SPEAKER_1:  Yes.

01:37:11,874 --> 01:37:15,134
SPEAKER_1:  But one of the questions before we arrived there we can ask

01:37:15,746 --> 01:37:17,662
SPEAKER_1:  Does such a destination even exist?

01:37:19,426 --> 01:37:19,870
SPEAKER_1:  because

01:37:20,386 --> 01:37:24,862
SPEAKER_1:  the asking the question and the possible answers in the process of trying to answer that question.

01:37:25,346 --> 01:37:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  is in itself super interesting.

01:37:27,458 --> 01:37:30,206
SPEAKER_1:  Is that is, is, is even possible.

01:37:30,434 --> 01:37:33,214
SPEAKER_1:  to get there where there's an equals MC square type of.

01:37:33,666 --> 01:37:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  There's a function. Okay, you can have many parameters.

01:37:36,354 --> 01:37:37,086
SPEAKER_1:  uh... but

01:37:38,146 --> 01:37:42,078
SPEAKER_1:  a finite number of parameter function that can predict a lot of things about our universe.

01:37:42,658 --> 01:37:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  OK, but just to sort of...

01:37:45,634 --> 01:37:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  throw one thing in.

01:37:47,138 --> 01:37:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  In order to answer every question,

01:37:50,178 --> 01:37:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  we would need a theory of the origin of the universe.

01:37:54,978 --> 01:37:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  And that.

01:37:55,970 --> 01:37:57,118
SPEAKER_0:  is huge.

01:37:58,018 --> 01:37:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:37:59,202 --> 01:38:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  task, right?

01:38:00,834 --> 01:38:02,942
SPEAKER_0:  And the fact that the universe

01:38:03,330 --> 01:38:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  seems to have a beginning.

01:38:05,954 --> 01:38:07,742
SPEAKER_0:  defies everything we know and love.

01:38:09,026 --> 01:38:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  because we, you know, one of the, one of the.

01:38:13,026 --> 01:38:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  basic principles of physics is determinism.

01:38:17,122 --> 01:38:18,302
SPEAKER_0:  pass follows from.

01:38:19,746 --> 01:38:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  present follows from the past.

01:38:22,338 --> 01:38:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  The future follows from the present.

01:38:24,738 --> 01:38:25,214
SPEAKER_0:  So on.

01:38:26,466 --> 01:38:26,878
SPEAKER_0:  but.

01:38:27,682 --> 01:38:31,678
SPEAKER_0:  If you have the origin of the universe, if you have a big bang, that means before that, there was nothing.

01:38:32,546 --> 01:38:35,454
SPEAKER_0:  You can't have theory in which something falls from nothing.

01:38:37,282 --> 01:38:38,302
SPEAKER_0:  So somehow...

01:38:38,530 --> 01:38:40,126
SPEAKER_1:  Sounds like you don't like singularities.

01:38:42,370 --> 01:38:45,745
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I thought for somebody that works with black holes, I do get used to them by now.

01:38:45,745 --> 01:38:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  No, no, I like this because it's so hard to understand.

01:38:50,434 --> 01:38:52,446
SPEAKER_0:  I like it because it's hard to understand.

01:38:52,994 --> 01:38:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  but it's really challenging us. I don't think we're close to solving that problem. We've created them, baked them until rights toimes early.

01:38:59,362 --> 01:39:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  And string theory has basically had nothing.

01:39:02,402 --> 01:39:02,942
SPEAKER_0:  Ich bin...

01:39:03,170 --> 01:39:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  Almost nothing interesting said about that.

01:39:06,402 --> 01:39:07,262
SPEAKER_0:  in the last.

01:39:08,098 --> 01:39:13,717
SPEAKER_1:  many decades. So string theory hasn't really looked at the big bang. It hasn't really tried to get to the o-

01:39:13,717 --> 01:39:15,582
SPEAKER_0:  origin. Not, not successful.

01:39:16,066 --> 01:39:20,062
SPEAKER_0:  Not in, there aren't compelling papers that lots of people have read that

01:39:21,410 --> 01:39:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  People have taken it up and tried to go at it.

01:39:24,802 --> 01:39:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  but there aren't compelling.

01:39:28,418 --> 01:39:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  String theory doesn't seem to.

01:39:31,010 --> 01:39:32,030
SPEAKER_0:  have a trick that...

01:39:33,058 --> 01:39:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  that helps us with that puzzle.

01:39:35,170 --> 01:39:38,046
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think we'll be able to sneak up to the origin of the universe?

01:39:38,434 --> 01:39:39,646
SPEAKER_1:  Like reverse engineer it.

01:39:40,322 --> 01:39:42,430
SPEAKER_1:  from experimental theoretical perspective.

01:39:42,850 --> 01:39:45,598
SPEAKER_1:  Like, okay, if we can.

01:39:45,890 --> 01:39:52,254
SPEAKER_0:  What will be the trajectory? You've already gotten yourself in trouble, you see? Because you used the word reverse engineer.

01:39:52,994 --> 01:39:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  So if you're going to reverse engineer...

01:39:55,810 --> 01:39:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  That means.

01:39:56,994 --> 01:39:58,334
SPEAKER_0:  You know, you...

01:39:59,554 --> 01:40:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  Forward engineering means that you take the present and determine the future. Reverse engineering.

01:40:04,642 --> 01:40:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  means that you take the present and determine the past.

01:40:08,098 --> 01:40:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  but estimate that

01:40:09,634 --> 01:40:10,110
SPEAKER_1:  But yes.

01:40:10,914 --> 01:40:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  But if the past was nothing...

01:40:13,730 --> 01:40:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  How are you ever going to reverse engineer to nothing?

01:40:17,762 --> 01:40:18,887
SPEAKER_0:  That's hard to do.

01:40:18,887 --> 01:40:23,422
SPEAKER_1:  up against the nothing right until have mathematical models that break down nicely

01:40:23,842 --> 01:40:25,630
SPEAKER_1:  to where you can actually start to infer things.

01:40:29,058 --> 01:40:31,806
SPEAKER_0:  Let's work on it.

01:40:32,066 --> 01:40:41,598
SPEAKER_0:  No, but do you think that that... Maybe, but it is, people have tried to do things like that. Yeah, and have not succeeded. It's not something that we...

01:40:41,922 --> 01:40:43,838
SPEAKER_0:  we're getting A pluses in.

01:40:44,098 --> 01:40:44,606
SPEAKER_0:  Sure.

01:40:45,410 --> 01:40:47,102
SPEAKER_1:  Let's pretend we live in a world.

01:40:47,362 --> 01:40:48,606
SPEAKER_1:  or in 100 years.

01:40:49,154 --> 01:40:50,270
SPEAKER_1:  We have an answer to that.

01:40:51,586 --> 01:40:53,150
SPEAKER_1:  What would that answer look like?

01:40:53,858 --> 01:40:55,998
SPEAKER_1:  who, what department is that from?

01:40:57,538 --> 01:40:59,998
SPEAKER_1:  what fields left led us there.

01:41:00,290 --> 01:41:01,214
SPEAKER_1:  What uh...

01:41:01,474 --> 01:41:04,094
SPEAKER_1:  Not what fields, what set of ideas in theoretical physics?

01:41:04,962 --> 01:41:05,406
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:41:05,698 --> 01:41:07,454
SPEAKER_1:  Is it experimental? Is it theoretical?

01:41:08,578 --> 01:41:16,254
SPEAKER_1:  Like what can you imagine could have possibly lead us there? Is it through gravitational waves and some kind of observations there? Is it investigation of black holes?

01:41:16,482 --> 01:41:18,334
SPEAKER_1:  Is it simulation of universes?

01:41:18,818 --> 01:41:20,222
SPEAKER_1:  Is it, uh...

01:41:21,026 --> 01:41:24,062
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe you start creating black holes somehow. I don't know.

01:41:25,058 --> 01:41:27,454
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe some kind of high energy physics type of experiments.

01:41:30,274 --> 01:41:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  Well...

01:41:31,842 --> 01:41:36,717
SPEAKER_0:  I have some late night ideas about that that aren't really ready for prime time. Okay, sure.

01:41:36,717 --> 01:41:38,967
SPEAKER_1:  We have some ideas.

01:41:38,967 --> 01:41:42,846
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, yeah, but, and many people do.

01:41:43,906 --> 01:41:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  It could be that some of the advances in quantum information theory are.

01:41:47,938 --> 01:41:48,574
SPEAKER_0:  important.

01:41:49,154 --> 01:41:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  in that they...

01:41:51,202 --> 01:41:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  kind of go beyond.

01:41:53,122 --> 01:41:54,718
SPEAKER_0:  taking quantum systems and.

01:41:55,330 --> 01:41:57,022
SPEAKER_0:  just replicating themselves.

01:41:57,698 --> 01:41:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  combining them with others.

01:41:59,394 --> 01:42:00,062
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think?

01:42:01,026 --> 01:42:08,798
SPEAKER_1:  Since you highlighted the issue with time and the origin of the universe, do you think time is fundamental or emergent?

01:42:10,242 --> 01:42:12,478
SPEAKER_0:  I think ultimately it has to be emergent.

01:42:13,858 --> 01:42:14,983
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, what does it mean for time to-

01:42:14,983 --> 01:42:15,550
SPEAKER_1:  be emergent.

01:42:17,954 --> 01:42:18,366
SPEAKER_0:  Well.

01:42:19,938 --> 01:42:22,974
SPEAKER_0:  because of what's review what it means for space to be emergent

01:42:24,706 --> 01:42:27,646
SPEAKER_0:  What it means for space to be emergent is...

01:42:28,258 --> 01:42:29,438
SPEAKER_0:  that

01:42:30,274 --> 01:42:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  you have a holographic plate.

01:42:33,890 --> 01:42:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  and you shine some light that's.

01:42:36,514 --> 01:42:37,886
SPEAKER_0:  moving in space.

01:42:39,074 --> 01:42:39,614
SPEAKER_0:  and it

01:42:39,874 --> 01:42:41,182
SPEAKER_0:  produces an image.

01:42:41,922 --> 01:42:44,190
SPEAKER_0:  which contains an extra spatial dimension.

01:42:45,090 --> 01:42:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  and time just goes along for the ride.

01:42:49,346 --> 01:42:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:42:50,146 --> 01:42:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  what we'd like to.

01:42:52,514 --> 01:42:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  do.

01:42:53,538 --> 01:42:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  And indeed there is some rather concrete

01:42:56,898 --> 01:43:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  work in this direction, though again I would say even within ours.

01:43:00,962 --> 01:43:02,494
SPEAKER_0:  stringing community where not.

01:43:02,850 --> 01:43:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  getting A pluses on these efforts.

01:43:05,666 --> 01:43:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  what we'd like to do.

01:43:07,650 --> 01:43:08,670
SPEAKER_0:  is to...

01:43:08,930 --> 01:43:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  See.

01:43:10,210 --> 01:43:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:43:12,706 --> 01:43:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  examples in which the extra spacetime dimension

01:43:17,570 --> 01:43:19,134
SPEAKER_0:  is time. In other words,

01:43:21,218 --> 01:43:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  usually what we understand very well mathematically is

01:43:25,282 --> 01:43:26,686
SPEAKER_0:  how to take systems.

01:43:27,778 --> 01:43:28,414
SPEAKER_0:  Ah.

01:43:29,410 --> 01:43:29,758
SPEAKER_0:  in.

01:43:30,690 --> 01:43:33,342
SPEAKER_0:  some number of space-time dimensions.

01:43:34,114 --> 01:43:34,430
SPEAKER_0:  and.

01:43:34,690 --> 01:43:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  rewrite them as a plate.

01:43:36,770 --> 01:43:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  in fewer space dimensions.

01:43:39,554 --> 01:43:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  What we'd like to do is to take systems with.

01:43:42,914 --> 01:43:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  one time in some number of space dimensions.

01:43:45,922 --> 01:43:47,102
SPEAKER_0:  and to rewrite them.

01:43:47,522 --> 01:43:50,046
SPEAKER_0:  is a system that had only space dimensions in it.

01:43:50,658 --> 01:43:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  had no time evolution.

01:43:54,370 --> 01:43:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  And there are some fairly concrete ideas about

01:43:56,642 --> 01:43:57,886
SPEAKER_0:  to do that, but they're not.

01:43:59,042 --> 01:44:01,662
SPEAKER_0:  universally accepted even within the...

01:44:02,946 --> 01:44:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  stringy community.

01:44:05,826 --> 01:44:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  But isn't it wild to you?

01:44:07,842 --> 01:44:11,102
SPEAKER_1:  Yes. For it to be emergent. How do we intuit?

01:44:11,938 --> 01:44:17,905
SPEAKER_1:  these kinds of ideas as human beings for whom space and time seems as fundamentals as apples and oranges

01:44:17,905 --> 01:44:19,134
SPEAKER_0:  They're both illusions.

01:44:20,674 --> 01:44:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  They're both illusions.

01:44:22,274 --> 01:44:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  Eventide.

01:44:24,866 --> 01:44:30,078
SPEAKER_1:  You co-authored a paper titled Photon Rings around Warped Black Holes. First of all,

01:44:30,786 --> 01:44:32,382
SPEAKER_1:  Whoever writes your paper titles.

01:44:33,410 --> 01:44:36,862
SPEAKER_1:  You like the soft hair and the.

01:44:37,538 --> 01:44:41,502
SPEAKER_1:  and the term black hole in the big bang, you're very good at coming up with titles yourself.

01:44:41,954 --> 01:44:45,854
SPEAKER_1:  Anyway, you co-authored a paper titled Photon Rings Around Warped Black Holes.

01:44:46,210 --> 01:44:53,502
SPEAKER_1:  In it you write, quote, recent work has identified a number of emergence symmetries related to the intricate self-similar structure of the photon ring.

01:44:54,178 --> 01:44:56,053
SPEAKER_1:  What are photon rings? What are some interesting things and how fan world are created?

01:44:56,053 --> 01:44:57,118
SPEAKER_0:  and characteristics of a

01:44:59,138 --> 01:45:03,582
SPEAKER_0:  So that was a paper with Dan Kapitz and Alex Lipsaska.

01:45:04,290 --> 01:45:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  just came out.

01:45:06,178 --> 01:45:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  And this paper is kind of a wonderful example.

01:45:12,034 --> 01:45:13,310
SPEAKER_0:  of what happens.

01:45:14,082 --> 01:45:14,686
SPEAKER_0:  when...

01:45:15,170 --> 01:45:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  you start to talk to people who are.

01:45:19,042 --> 01:45:20,638
SPEAKER_0:  you know, way out of your...

01:45:21,026 --> 01:45:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  comfort zone of.

01:45:22,978 --> 01:45:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  no different stuff and...

01:45:24,834 --> 01:45:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  look at the world a different way.

01:45:27,810 --> 01:45:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  and some two or three years ago.

01:45:30,850 --> 01:45:31,614
SPEAKER_0:  I'm

01:45:31,874 --> 01:45:33,342
SPEAKER_0:  I'm part of this.

01:45:34,274 --> 01:45:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  The Black Hole Initiative, I'm also part of this event horizon.

01:45:37,890 --> 01:45:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  telescope collaboration that

01:45:40,290 --> 01:45:41,182
SPEAKER_0:  took the famous.

01:45:41,602 --> 01:45:42,110
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:45:42,562 --> 01:45:44,222
SPEAKER_0:  Though I had nothing to do with the experiment, but...

01:45:44,738 --> 01:45:45,182
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:45:45,474 --> 01:45:47,102
SPEAKER_0:  that took the famous.

01:45:47,394 --> 01:45:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  picture of the donut of.

01:45:49,570 --> 01:45:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  of M87.

01:45:51,106 --> 01:45:52,478
SPEAKER_0:  And, um.

01:45:53,250 --> 01:45:55,070
SPEAKER_0:  through conversations with them.

01:45:55,906 --> 01:45:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  which started out...

01:45:57,954 --> 01:45:59,134
SPEAKER_0:  in an effort.

01:45:59,938 --> 01:46:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  to.

01:46:01,026 --> 01:46:03,742
SPEAKER_0:  understand the image that they'd seen.

01:46:04,642 --> 01:46:09,278
SPEAKER_0:  So it's a great thing for somebody like me, a theoretical physicist.

01:46:10,242 --> 01:46:10,878
SPEAKER_0:  Lost.

01:46:11,490 --> 01:46:13,662
SPEAKER_0:  seemingly lost in string land.

01:46:14,466 --> 01:46:15,038
SPEAKER_0:  to.

01:46:15,266 --> 01:46:15,646
SPEAKER_0:  Be pr-

01:46:15,938 --> 01:46:16,926
SPEAKER_0:  presented with.

01:46:17,186 --> 01:46:17,950
SPEAKER_0:  The actual.

01:46:18,242 --> 01:46:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  picture.

01:46:19,234 --> 01:46:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  a black hole and to be asked what can we learn from this.

01:46:25,474 --> 01:46:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  So, you know, with some help.

01:46:28,450 --> 01:46:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhhhhh...

01:46:29,698 --> 01:46:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  from, you know.

01:46:31,298 --> 01:46:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  Michael Johnson, Alex Lipsaska.

01:46:34,594 --> 01:46:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  and a bunch of other people venture into collaboration.

01:46:39,778 --> 01:46:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  we came up with a fantastic, beautiful answer.

01:46:43,554 --> 01:46:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  using Einstein's theory.

01:46:46,050 --> 01:46:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  That

01:46:46,818 --> 01:46:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:46:47,586 --> 01:46:48,542
SPEAKER_0:  Is both?

01:46:48,962 --> 01:46:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  shaping the future.

01:46:51,586 --> 01:46:52,254
SPEAKER_0:  of

01:46:52,674 --> 01:46:54,462
SPEAKER_0:  Now it is shaping the future.

01:46:55,010 --> 01:46:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  of

01:46:56,514 --> 01:46:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  improved.

01:46:57,986 --> 01:47:00,606
SPEAKER_0:  black hole photographs. What you wax by pirm and

01:47:00,834 --> 01:47:02,878
SPEAKER_0:  want to concentrate on in the photograph.

01:47:03,202 --> 01:47:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  You just point it at the sky and click? No, you don't do that.

01:47:07,298 --> 01:47:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  you optimize for various features.

01:47:10,210 --> 01:47:11,198
SPEAKER_0:  And...

01:47:11,874 --> 01:47:12,382
SPEAKER_0:  It's.

01:47:12,898 --> 01:47:14,398
SPEAKER_0:  It's both shaping that.

01:47:14,626 --> 01:47:15,294
SPEAKER_0:  And...

01:47:16,450 --> 01:47:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  in the process of

01:47:18,978 --> 01:47:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  talking to them and thinking about how light behaves around a black hole.

01:47:24,866 --> 01:47:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  The black holes just...

01:47:26,594 --> 01:47:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  have so many magic tricks and they do so many weird things.

01:47:31,202 --> 01:47:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  and the photon ring is...

01:47:33,122 --> 01:47:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  among the weirdest of them.

01:47:35,074 --> 01:47:39,230
SPEAKER_0:  We understood the photon ring and in the process of this...

01:47:39,938 --> 01:47:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  We.

01:47:41,570 --> 01:47:43,838
SPEAKER_0:  said, hey, this photon ring.

01:47:45,346 --> 01:47:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  has gotta be telling us something.

01:47:48,482 --> 01:47:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  about the puzzle.

01:47:50,402 --> 01:47:51,358
SPEAKER_0:  of where?

01:47:51,618 --> 01:47:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  the holographic plate is.

01:47:54,722 --> 01:47:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:47:55,778 --> 01:47:59,006
SPEAKER_0:  outside of an ordinary astrophysical black hole.

01:47:59,842 --> 01:48:02,398
SPEAKER_0:  And we nailed it for the stringy black holes.

01:48:03,234 --> 01:48:03,550
SPEAKER_0:  but.

01:48:04,290 --> 01:48:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  they have a somewhat different character.

01:48:06,946 --> 01:48:08,062
SPEAKER_1:  What's a stringy black hole?

01:48:08,610 --> 01:48:09,735
SPEAKER_1:  uh... the black holes

01:48:09,735 --> 01:48:14,494
SPEAKER_0:  The black holes that are contained in string theory and they have different

01:48:14,978 --> 01:48:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  structure in them.

01:48:16,642 --> 01:48:20,606
SPEAKER_1:  Well, but actually, can we step back? So what was the light in the image taken in 2019?

01:48:21,058 --> 01:48:23,038
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not taking the 2018.

01:48:23,746 --> 01:48:24,871
SPEAKER_1:  uh... presenting his

01:48:24,871 --> 01:48:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  Here's the puzzle.

01:48:26,754 --> 01:48:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  What they really saw.

01:48:30,530 --> 01:48:33,470
SPEAKER_0:  So the black holes tend to gather.

01:48:33,762 --> 01:48:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  stuff.

01:48:34,946 --> 01:48:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  that swirls around it.

01:48:38,594 --> 01:48:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:48:39,554 --> 01:48:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  They don't know what that stuff is made of. They don't know what its temperature is.

01:48:44,226 --> 01:48:47,358
SPEAKER_0:  They don't know what kind of magnetic fields there are around there.

01:48:48,418 --> 01:48:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:48:50,242 --> 01:48:51,902
SPEAKER_0:  The form of the image.

01:48:52,482 --> 01:48:58,974
SPEAKER_0:  has a lot of unknowns in it, that it's dependent on many other things other than the geometry of the black hole.

01:49:00,194 --> 01:49:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  So most of what you're learning...

01:49:03,522 --> 01:49:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  is...

01:49:05,026 --> 01:49:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  about this stuff.

01:49:07,234 --> 01:49:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  Now the stuff.

01:49:08,834 --> 01:49:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  The swirling stuff.

01:49:10,594 --> 01:49:11,902
SPEAKER_0:  hot swirling stuff.

01:49:12,770 --> 01:49:14,334
SPEAKER_0:  is interesting as hell.

01:49:15,106 --> 01:49:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  but it's not as interesting as the black hole.

01:49:17,954 --> 01:49:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  which are the most, in my view.

01:49:21,058 --> 01:49:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  the most interesting things in the universe.

01:49:23,682 --> 01:49:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  So you don't want to just learn about the stuff.

01:49:27,010 --> 01:49:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  You want to learn about.

01:49:28,802 --> 01:49:30,983
SPEAKER_0:  the black hole that is swirling around.

01:49:30,983 --> 01:49:31,966
SPEAKER_1:  So one of the...

01:49:33,762 --> 01:49:36,414
SPEAKER_1:  at the very first step at the very primitive level.

01:49:36,738 --> 01:49:40,510
SPEAKER_1:  This is just a big leap for human civilization to be able to see.

01:49:41,698 --> 01:49:42,750
SPEAKER_1:  a black hole.

01:49:43,298 --> 01:49:45,982
SPEAKER_1:  and the way you can see it is because there's stuff around it.

01:49:46,690 --> 01:49:49,630
SPEAKER_1:  but you don't get to learn much about the black hole.

01:49:50,466 --> 01:49:52,734
SPEAKER_1:  You get to learn more about the stuff just from the

01:49:53,250 --> 01:49:53,790
SPEAKER_0:  image.

01:49:54,626 --> 01:49:58,238
SPEAKER_0:  But you're not going to learn about the details before you've even seen it.

01:49:58,370 --> 01:50:00,995
SPEAKER_1:  because there's too many parameters, there's too many variables that govern this.

01:50:00,995 --> 01:50:01,758
SPEAKER_0:  stuff. Yeah.

01:50:02,274 --> 01:50:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  So then we found a very wonderful way.

01:50:07,138 --> 01:50:08,766
SPEAKER_0:  to learn about the black hole.

01:50:09,090 --> 01:50:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  And here's how it works.

01:50:12,258 --> 01:50:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  The black hole is a mirror.

01:50:15,170 --> 01:50:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  And the way it's a mirror is if light...

01:50:18,018 --> 01:50:18,814
SPEAKER_0:  a photon.

01:50:19,394 --> 01:50:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  bounces off your face.

01:50:22,242 --> 01:50:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  towards the black hole.

01:50:23,682 --> 01:50:25,310
SPEAKER_0:  It goes straight to the black hole.

01:50:25,634 --> 01:50:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  just falls in, you never see it again.

01:50:28,866 --> 01:50:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  But if it just misses the black hole...

01:50:32,770 --> 01:50:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  it'll swing around the back.

01:50:35,042 --> 01:50:36,030
SPEAKER_0:  and come back to you.

01:50:37,186 --> 01:50:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  and you see yourself.

01:50:39,202 --> 01:50:39,550
SPEAKER_0:  from the.

01:50:40,194 --> 01:50:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  photon that went around the back of the black hole.

01:50:43,394 --> 01:50:45,022
SPEAKER_0:  But not only can that happen...

01:50:45,794 --> 01:50:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  the black hole, the photon can swing around twice.

01:50:51,202 --> 01:50:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  and come back. So you actually see an infinite number of copies.

01:50:55,682 --> 01:50:56,254
SPEAKER_0:  of yourself.

01:50:56,802 --> 01:50:58,206
SPEAKER_0:  Like with a little bit of a delay.

01:50:58,978 --> 01:51:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  with a little bit of a delay.

01:51:00,482 --> 01:51:00,830
SPEAKER_0:  Right.

01:51:02,722 --> 01:51:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  awesome.

01:51:03,554 --> 01:51:03,902
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:51:04,322 --> 01:51:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  And...

01:51:05,570 --> 01:51:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  In fact,

01:51:06,882 --> 01:51:09,822
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, we're not used to an object that bends light like that. Yeah.

01:51:10,594 --> 01:51:11,902
SPEAKER_1:  you're going to get some trippier.

01:51:12,066 --> 01:51:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. And in fact, one of my...

01:51:14,914 --> 01:51:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  My students has made it really awesome.

01:51:17,570 --> 01:51:19,646
SPEAKER_0:  animation of this, which I'm going to...

01:51:20,130 --> 01:51:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  show at a public lecture in a couple of weeks where the audience will see infinitely many copies of themselves.

01:51:26,946 --> 01:51:28,958
SPEAKER_0:  That's all. I got the black hole.

01:51:30,626 --> 01:51:31,166
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:51:31,938 --> 01:51:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  If you...

01:51:32,834 --> 01:51:35,454
SPEAKER_0:  So it's, a black hole is like a hall of mirrors.

01:51:35,906 --> 01:51:42,206
SPEAKER_0:  you know, like in a department store where you go and there's the three mirrors and you see infinitely many copies of yourself. yeah.

01:51:43,266 --> 01:51:45,054
SPEAKER_0:  Think of the black hole as the mirror.

01:51:46,594 --> 01:51:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

01:51:47,426 --> 01:51:49,822
SPEAKER_0:  and you go in there with your clothes.

01:51:50,050 --> 01:51:54,046
SPEAKER_0:  If you want to know about your clothes, you just look at the direct image. You're not learning anything about...

01:51:54,658 --> 01:51:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  configuration of mirror.

01:51:57,090 --> 01:51:58,110
SPEAKER_0:  But the relation...

01:51:59,010 --> 01:51:59,646
SPEAKER_0:  of

01:52:00,226 --> 01:52:01,534
SPEAKER_0:  of um

01:52:03,042 --> 01:52:04,734
SPEAKER_0:  the image you see in front of you.

01:52:05,634 --> 01:52:09,214
SPEAKER_0:  to the one you see at the side and the next one and so on.

01:52:10,146 --> 01:52:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  depends only on the mirrors. It doesn't matter what clothes you're wearing.

01:52:14,914 --> 01:52:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  you can go there.

01:52:16,642 --> 01:52:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  thousand times wearing different clothes.

01:52:18,946 --> 01:52:20,094
SPEAKER_0:  But each time...

01:52:20,482 --> 01:52:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  there will be the same relation between the subsequent images.

01:52:24,738 --> 01:52:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  And that...

01:52:26,018 --> 01:52:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  is how.

01:52:28,034 --> 01:52:30,206
SPEAKER_0:  we're gonna learn about the black holes.

01:52:30,882 --> 01:52:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  We're going to take the stuff that is swirling around.

01:52:34,690 --> 01:52:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  and we're gonna tease out.

01:52:37,570 --> 01:52:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  subsequent images.

01:52:39,202 --> 01:52:40,542
SPEAKER_0:  and look at their relation.

01:52:41,410 --> 01:52:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  And there's some very beautiful.

01:52:44,354 --> 01:52:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  really beautiful mathematics, which we were surprised to realize with.

01:52:49,122 --> 01:52:50,718
SPEAKER_0:  the volumes and volumes of.

01:52:51,874 --> 01:52:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  papers on

01:52:53,378 --> 01:52:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  black holes in their properties.

01:52:55,202 --> 01:52:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  this particular.

01:52:57,410 --> 01:53:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  it was a physical question that had never been asked in exactly this way.

01:53:01,570 --> 01:53:04,423
SPEAKER_1:  So basically you're looking at the relationship between.

01:53:04,423 --> 01:53:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  the subsequent images.

01:53:05,922 --> 01:53:09,438
SPEAKER_1:  But those are ultimately formed by photons that are swirling around.

01:53:09,858 --> 01:53:12,318
SPEAKER_0:  Photons that are orbiting. So the photon ring...

01:53:12,994 --> 01:53:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  are the photons that orbit around.

01:53:15,714 --> 01:53:19,678
SPEAKER_1:  beyond so like orbit and lose orbit like they are they like so.

01:53:20,578 --> 01:53:28,681
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, wow. And that starts to give you, what can you possibly figure out mathematically by the black hole, the geometry of it does the.

01:53:28,681 --> 01:53:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  create the spin.

01:53:30,722 --> 01:53:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  and you can verify.

01:53:34,338 --> 01:53:37,566
SPEAKER_0:  things behaving, you know, we have never seen.

01:53:38,946 --> 01:53:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  a region of space-time.

01:53:42,210 --> 01:53:48,254
SPEAKER_0:  with such high curvature. I mean, the region around a black hole is crazy. It's not like in this room.

01:53:48,482 --> 01:53:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  The curvature is everything, you know?

01:53:51,010 --> 01:53:53,630
SPEAKER_1:  You've spent probably enough time with the math and the photons.

01:53:56,002 --> 01:54:01,758
SPEAKER_1:  yourself in that space so we're like having a conversation in a pretty peaceful comfortable flat space

01:54:02,082 --> 01:54:05,086
SPEAKER_1:  Are you able to put yourself in a place around a black hole?

01:54:05,762 --> 01:54:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I'm able to imagine that kind of thing, yeah.

01:54:08,834 --> 01:54:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  So for example, and actually there's a wonderful movie.

01:54:13,154 --> 01:54:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  Interstellar.

01:54:15,170 --> 01:54:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  And, um...

01:54:17,346 --> 01:54:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  in that movie.

01:54:19,042 --> 01:54:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  You know, Kip Thorne.

01:54:20,770 --> 01:54:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  Of course, this is great.

01:54:22,946 --> 01:54:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  theoretical physicists, experimental who...

01:54:25,282 --> 01:54:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  later won the Nobel Prize.

01:54:27,522 --> 01:54:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:54:28,482 --> 01:54:29,278
SPEAKER_0:  for LEGO.

01:54:30,018 --> 01:54:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  and.

01:54:31,170 --> 01:54:32,702
SPEAKER_0:  That movie is very accurate.

01:54:32,962 --> 01:54:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  scientifically.

01:54:34,530 --> 01:54:37,374
SPEAKER_0:  and there's some funny statements in there.

01:54:39,010 --> 01:54:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  that.

01:54:40,162 --> 01:54:40,734
SPEAKER_0:  of the

01:54:41,794 --> 01:54:43,422
SPEAKER_0:  you know, 100 million people.

01:54:43,874 --> 01:54:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  who saw that movie.

01:54:45,634 --> 01:54:48,734
SPEAKER_0:  There can't be more than 10 or 20 understood.

01:54:49,378 --> 01:54:51,614
SPEAKER_0:  about why Matthew McConaughey is.

01:54:52,514 --> 01:54:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  ejecting the trash in a certain direction in order to...

01:54:55,938 --> 01:55:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  But, you know, for example, if I were a spinning black hole right here, if I were spinning fast enough.

01:55:02,498 --> 01:55:04,254
SPEAKER_0:  you wouldn't be able to stay still there.

01:55:05,186 --> 01:55:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  you'd have to be orbiting around like that. You'd have to have your microphone on.

01:55:10,818 --> 01:55:12,391
SPEAKER_0:  What the heck is this? I don't know what the experience is.

01:55:12,391 --> 01:55:15,683
SPEAKER_1:  is actually what the actual experience is that I mean space

01:55:15,683 --> 01:55:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  itself is curved. When space gets very curved, you get crushed.

01:55:21,602 --> 01:55:26,110
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the body gets ripped apart because the forces are different on different parts. Sure.

01:55:26,402 --> 01:55:30,750
SPEAKER_0:  But if it can be less curved so that the curvature is very noticeable?

01:55:31,490 --> 01:55:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  but you're not ripped apart.

01:55:36,642 --> 01:55:44,030
SPEAKER_1:  The fact that this was just nonchalantly stated is just beautiful. Like two biological systems discussing.

01:55:44,578 --> 01:55:47,294
SPEAKER_1:  which level of curvature is required to rip.

01:55:47,554 --> 01:55:49,406
SPEAKER_1:  apart said biological system.

01:55:49,986 --> 01:55:50,622
SPEAKER_1:  Very well.

01:55:50,850 --> 01:55:57,342
SPEAKER_1:  So you propose in the paper that a photon ring of a warped black hole is indeed part of the black hole hologram.

01:55:58,754 --> 01:56:04,798
SPEAKER_1:  A photon ring of a warped black hole is indeed part of the black hole hologram.

01:56:06,946 --> 01:56:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, so.

01:56:08,258 --> 01:56:10,398
SPEAKER_1:  What can you intuit about the hologram?

01:56:12,866 --> 01:56:15,198
SPEAKER_1:  and the holographic plate.

01:56:15,906 --> 01:56:18,046
SPEAKER_1:  from looking at the photon rings.

01:56:19,714 --> 01:56:20,094
SPEAKER_0:  Well...

01:56:20,450 --> 01:56:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  This paper.

01:56:22,082 --> 01:56:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  is exploring.

01:56:24,098 --> 01:56:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  A new idea. It's not make- it's not-

01:56:27,906 --> 01:56:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  It's not making a new...

01:56:32,706 --> 01:56:34,238
SPEAKER_0:  Discovery, so to speak.

01:56:34,882 --> 01:56:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  It's exploring an idea and...

01:56:39,042 --> 01:56:42,174
SPEAKER_0:  the ins and outs of it and what might work.

01:56:43,042 --> 01:56:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  and what might not.

01:56:44,514 --> 01:56:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:56:45,378 --> 01:56:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  This photon ring, somehow everybody always thought that the holographic plate

01:56:50,498 --> 01:56:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  sat at the horizon of the black hole.

01:56:53,762 --> 01:56:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  and that the quantum system...

01:56:56,002 --> 01:56:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  that describes the black hole is inside the horizon.

01:57:00,386 --> 01:57:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  And...

01:57:02,306 --> 01:57:03,166
SPEAKER_0:  In fact...

01:57:03,650 --> 01:57:04,286
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:57:04,642 --> 01:57:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  we think.

01:57:06,434 --> 01:57:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  It's plausible.

01:57:08,450 --> 01:57:10,718
SPEAKER_0:  and we give some evidence.

01:57:10,978 --> 01:57:12,894
SPEAKER_0:  in some soluble.

01:57:13,474 --> 01:57:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  examples, in this case in an example in one lower dimension where we can handle the equations better.

01:57:19,266 --> 01:57:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  that

01:57:20,130 --> 01:57:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  the quantum system.

01:57:21,858 --> 01:57:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  that describes the black hole.

01:57:25,186 --> 01:57:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  should correspond to a region of spacetime.

01:57:28,322 --> 01:57:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  Which is...

01:57:29,122 --> 01:57:30,654
SPEAKER_0:  includes the photon ring.

01:57:31,778 --> 01:57:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  So it's bigger.

01:57:34,626 --> 01:57:37,205
SPEAKER_1:  So that that would be the holographic place.

01:57:37,205 --> 01:57:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  That would be the holographic play. All of that.

01:57:39,746 --> 01:57:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, we didn't prove this.

01:57:42,178 --> 01:57:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  We, we...

01:57:44,962 --> 01:57:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  We put it out there.

01:57:48,098 --> 01:57:50,142
SPEAKER_0:  hadn't really been considered previously.

01:57:50,722 --> 01:57:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  We put it out there and.

01:57:52,418 --> 01:57:52,926
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:57:53,570 --> 01:57:56,542
SPEAKER_0:  It does seem more plausible than the idea that it...

01:57:56,866 --> 01:57:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  sits literally at the horizon.

01:57:58,882 --> 01:58:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  And it is a big...

01:58:01,122 --> 01:58:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  outstanding problem?

01:58:03,106 --> 01:58:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  of

01:58:04,002 --> 01:58:07,454
SPEAKER_0:  of how you have a holographic reconstruction of.

01:58:08,194 --> 01:58:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  black holes like M87.

01:58:10,978 --> 01:58:11,870
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think?

01:58:12,226 --> 01:58:13,918
SPEAKER_1:  There could be experimental.

01:58:14,402 --> 01:58:18,686
SPEAKER_1:  further experimental data that helps explore some of these ideas that you have for

01:58:19,074 --> 01:58:21,438
SPEAKER_1:  photon rings and holographic plates.

01:58:21,698 --> 01:58:25,823
SPEAKER_1:  through imaging and through sort of like high resolution images and also just more and more data

01:58:25,823 --> 01:58:28,030
SPEAKER_0:  I wish so, but I don't think so.

01:58:29,090 --> 01:58:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:58:30,082 --> 01:58:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  But what I think...

01:58:31,266 --> 01:58:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  already has happened and will continue to happen.

01:58:34,818 --> 01:58:35,934
SPEAKER_0:  is that the...

01:58:36,578 --> 01:58:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  You know, they're...

01:58:37,922 --> 01:58:39,422
SPEAKER_0:  There are many different ways that...

01:58:41,058 --> 01:58:42,910
SPEAKER_0:  theorists and

01:58:43,906 --> 01:58:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  observers can interact.

01:58:46,946 --> 01:58:48,574
SPEAKER_0:  the gold standard.

01:58:49,186 --> 01:58:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  is.

01:58:50,114 --> 01:58:51,710
SPEAKER_0:  The theorist makes a prediction.

01:58:52,258 --> 01:58:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  The Observer.

01:58:54,146 --> 01:58:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  measures it and confirms it or the observer.

01:58:57,186 --> 01:58:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  uh... makes it

01:58:59,618 --> 01:59:01,758
SPEAKER_0:  discovery and the theorist explains it.

01:59:02,594 --> 01:59:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:59:03,138 --> 01:59:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  But there's a lot.

01:59:04,450 --> 01:59:05,406
SPEAKER_0:  less than that.

01:59:05,826 --> 01:59:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  Which

01:59:06,882 --> 01:59:08,926
SPEAKER_0:  is really kind of the bread and butter.

01:59:09,410 --> 01:59:09,822
SPEAKER_0:  of.

01:59:10,114 --> 01:59:15,646
SPEAKER_0:  Those are dramatic moments when that happens, right? Those are once in a lifetime moments when that happens.

01:59:16,290 --> 01:59:18,366
SPEAKER_0:  But the bread and butter is more when...

01:59:18,754 --> 01:59:20,542
SPEAKER_0:  and it has already happened.

01:59:21,506 --> 01:59:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  They came to us and said, what is the interesting theoretical things we can understand?

01:59:27,394 --> 01:59:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  in this.

01:59:28,898 --> 01:59:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  swirl around the black hole and

01:59:31,618 --> 01:59:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  Oui.

01:59:32,834 --> 01:59:34,654
SPEAKER_0:  give an answer and then that.

01:59:35,810 --> 01:59:36,926
SPEAKER_0:  in turn.

01:59:37,186 --> 01:59:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  jogged us to.

01:59:39,714 --> 01:59:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  think about.

01:59:40,834 --> 01:59:43,134
SPEAKER_0:  the holographic principle in the context of...

01:59:43,874 --> 01:59:52,382
SPEAKER_0:  M87 a little bit differently. In the same vein, it's useful to talk to the philosophers, and it's useful.

01:59:52,930 --> 01:59:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  talk to the mathematicians and you know.

01:59:56,418 --> 01:59:57,406
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of, uh...

01:59:58,690 --> 01:59:59,326
SPEAKER_0:  You got it.

02:00:00,066 --> 02:00:00,830
SPEAKER_0:  We just gotta...

02:00:01,090 --> 02:00:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we don't know where we're going. We just got out like.

02:00:04,834 --> 02:00:05,534
SPEAKER_0:  Do everything.

02:00:06,114 --> 02:00:07,454
SPEAKER_1:  Let me ask you another sort of...

02:00:08,130 --> 02:00:11,102
SPEAKER_1:  philosophical type question, but not really actually.

02:00:12,066 --> 02:00:19,358
SPEAKER_1:  It seems that thought experiments are used. So it's not just mathematics that makes progress in theoretical physics, but thought experiments do. They did for Einstein.

02:00:19,938 --> 02:00:20,350
SPEAKER_1:  as well.

02:00:20,674 --> 02:00:23,838
SPEAKER_1:  They did for a lot of great physicists throughout history.

02:00:24,322 --> 02:00:29,662
SPEAKER_1:  over the years, how's your ability to generate thought experiments or just your intuition about some of these weird...

02:00:30,434 --> 02:00:32,414
SPEAKER_1:  things like quantum mechanics.

02:00:33,186 --> 02:00:35,230
SPEAKER_1:  or a string theory.

02:00:36,130 --> 02:00:37,374
SPEAKER_1:  or quantum gravity.

02:00:38,178 --> 02:00:43,719
SPEAKER_1:  or yeah, even general relativity, how's your intuition improved over the years? Have you been able to make progress?

02:00:43,719 --> 02:00:45,854
SPEAKER_0:  The hard part in physics...

02:00:47,042 --> 02:00:47,678
SPEAKER_0:  is.

02:00:48,610 --> 02:00:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  Most problems are...

02:00:52,994 --> 02:00:53,502
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:00:54,434 --> 02:00:55,230
SPEAKER_0:  either.

02:00:56,002 --> 02:00:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  doable. Most problems are theoretical calculations that are theoretical.

02:01:00,290 --> 02:01:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  physicists would do there.

02:01:01,826 --> 02:01:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  There's no end of problems.

02:01:04,674 --> 02:01:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  whose answer is uninteresting.

02:01:07,714 --> 02:01:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  can be solved?

02:01:09,250 --> 02:01:10,238
SPEAKER_0:  But the answer is...

02:01:10,498 --> 02:01:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  uninteresting.

02:01:13,410 --> 02:01:15,454
SPEAKER_0:  There's also no end of problems.

02:01:16,002 --> 02:01:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  that are very interesting.

02:01:19,682 --> 02:01:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  some of which you've asked me.

02:01:21,634 --> 02:01:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  but we don't have a clue how to solve them.

02:01:26,050 --> 02:01:28,670
SPEAKER_0:  And when first presented with the problem,

02:01:29,442 --> 02:01:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  Almost every problem is one or the other.

02:01:33,090 --> 02:01:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  It's the jackpot when you find one that isn't one or the other.

02:01:38,018 --> 02:01:39,143
SPEAKER_0:  And uh...

02:01:39,143 --> 02:01:42,686
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like there's a gray area between the two, right? That's where you should be looking.

02:01:44,034 --> 02:01:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I wouldn't describe it as a gray area, I would describe it as a knife edge.

02:01:48,610 --> 02:01:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  That's the first.

02:01:50,146 --> 02:01:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  Small area. There isn't like a huge.

02:01:53,794 --> 02:01:59,285
SPEAKER_0:  area with a sign, here lie problems that are doable and people want to know the answer.

02:01:59,285 --> 02:02:03,785
SPEAKER_1:  In some deep sense, that's where timing is everything with physics, with science, with science, with science, with science, with physics.

02:02:03,785 --> 02:02:04,734
SPEAKER_0:  with timing.

02:02:05,090 --> 02:02:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I think earlier in my career, I erred more on the side of.

02:02:11,650 --> 02:02:12,894
SPEAKER_0:  problems that were.

02:02:14,594 --> 02:02:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  not solvable.

02:02:16,386 --> 02:02:17,726
SPEAKER_1:  are the ambition of youth.

02:02:19,106 --> 02:02:19,422
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

02:02:19,842 --> 02:02:22,206
SPEAKER_1:  What made you fall in love with physics?

02:02:23,138 --> 02:02:23,678
SPEAKER_1:  at first.

02:02:24,066 --> 02:02:24,894
SPEAKER_1:  if we can go back.

02:02:26,530 --> 02:02:29,822
SPEAKER_1:  through the early days. I said black holes were there in the beginning.

02:02:30,530 --> 02:02:33,342
SPEAKER_1:  But what made you, do you remember what really made you fall in love?

02:02:33,954 --> 02:02:38,846
SPEAKER_0:  I wanted to reach nirvana and I sort of realized that wasn't going to happen.

02:02:39,554 --> 02:02:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  Then after that I wanted to know the meaning of life and I realized I wasn't.

02:02:44,002 --> 02:02:46,302
SPEAKER_0:  I probably wasn't going to figure that out. I don't

02:02:46,754 --> 02:02:47,774
SPEAKER_0:  wanted to like...

02:02:48,802 --> 02:02:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  understand, you know.

02:02:53,698 --> 02:02:55,678
SPEAKER_0:  justice and socialism and...

02:02:56,130 --> 02:02:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  Bro.

02:02:56,738 --> 02:02:57,374
SPEAKER_0:  Thanks and...

02:02:58,402 --> 02:03:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  Couldn't figure those out either.

02:03:00,930 --> 02:03:01,758
SPEAKER_0:  The thing.

02:03:02,114 --> 02:03:13,694
SPEAKER_0:  So smaller and smaller problems. Smaller and smaller problems. And then, I mean, most of this stuff talking about adolescents, you know, but it was the biggest problem.

02:03:14,658 --> 02:03:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  that.

02:03:15,330 --> 02:03:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  I thought that there was a prospect of.

02:03:18,978 --> 02:03:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  but not 100%, you know?

02:03:20,962 --> 02:03:22,206
SPEAKER_0:  And I was definitely.

02:03:23,138 --> 02:03:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  Ready to.

02:03:26,114 --> 02:03:26,878
SPEAKER_0:  Spend my-

02:03:28,226 --> 02:03:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  my life in the wilderness knocking my head against the wall.

02:03:32,546 --> 02:03:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  I haven't.

02:03:33,954 --> 02:03:34,398
SPEAKER_0:  had to.

02:03:35,170 --> 02:03:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  I haven't solved them, but...

02:03:37,698 --> 02:03:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  I've said enough interesting things that you're…

02:03:41,442 --> 02:03:45,598
SPEAKER_0:  you're interviewing me. So I'm not in the wilderness, but yeah.

02:03:46,146 --> 02:03:48,350
SPEAKER_1:  Do you remember the early days? Did you remember the early days?

02:03:48,834 --> 02:03:53,470
SPEAKER_1:  Do you feel nostalgic when you think back to the ideas, the circumstances that led down?

02:03:54,082 --> 02:03:55,166
SPEAKER_1:  that let you down this...

02:03:55,874 --> 02:03:56,414
SPEAKER_1:  the path.

02:03:57,282 --> 02:04:03,390
SPEAKER_1:  towards black holes, towards theoretical physics, towards the tools of physics, towards this really fascinating world of theoretical physics.

02:04:05,474 --> 02:04:07,006
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I wouldn't. I wouldn't.

02:04:07,586 --> 02:04:10,046
SPEAKER_0:  add nostalgia to it because

02:04:16,066 --> 02:04:17,406
SPEAKER_0:  It's not like a...

02:04:19,650 --> 02:04:20,254
SPEAKER_0:  You know...

02:04:21,410 --> 02:04:25,246
SPEAKER_0:  summer in Italy or something. It's like there's…

02:04:26,370 --> 02:04:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  There's

02:04:27,490 --> 02:04:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  results.

02:04:29,026 --> 02:04:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  They're there.

02:04:30,530 --> 02:04:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  there.

02:04:31,682 --> 02:04:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  that people are, and that's what's.

02:04:33,666 --> 02:04:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  That's what's so gratifying.

02:04:36,546 --> 02:04:36,990
SPEAKER_0:  I mean.

02:04:37,218 --> 02:04:38,718
SPEAKER_0:  Of course one's name.

02:04:39,490 --> 02:04:40,894
SPEAKER_0:  disappears from these.

02:04:41,602 --> 02:04:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  these things.

02:04:42,658 --> 02:04:43,070
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:04:43,842 --> 02:04:46,654
SPEAKER_0:  Unless you're Einstein or Newton or something.

02:04:47,650 --> 02:04:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  People are not gonna.

02:04:49,090 --> 02:04:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  remember my name in 50 years.

02:04:51,746 --> 02:04:56,574
SPEAKER_1:  almost basically everything will be forgotten in hundreds of years. Yeah.

02:04:56,930 --> 02:04:58,462
SPEAKER_1:  Are you able to by the way?

02:04:59,202 --> 02:04:59,902
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:05:00,194 --> 02:05:04,319
SPEAKER_1:  Love the idea the exploration of ideas themselves without the names of yeah

02:05:04,319 --> 02:05:07,838
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. So, I have not. I hope.

02:05:08,386 --> 02:05:10,046
SPEAKER_0:  someday, but I have not.

02:05:10,818 --> 02:05:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhh

02:05:11,586 --> 02:05:13,854
SPEAKER_0:  You know, there are some experiments now to...

02:05:14,498 --> 02:05:16,190
SPEAKER_0:  verify some of my

02:05:17,026 --> 02:05:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  predictions about.

02:05:18,658 --> 02:05:19,870
SPEAKER_0:  you know, properties of.

02:05:20,194 --> 02:05:22,558
SPEAKER_0:  gravity and so on, but I have not like.

02:05:24,866 --> 02:05:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  you know, most of what I've done.

02:05:27,042 --> 02:05:27,582
SPEAKER_0:  is.

02:05:28,162 --> 02:05:28,702
SPEAKER_0:  in the

02:05:29,570 --> 02:05:34,686
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it could happen still. It's still a logical possibility that everything having to do with...

02:05:35,042 --> 02:05:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  string theory and the...

02:05:37,090 --> 02:05:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, as we mentioned, I'm betting the farm that it's not.

02:05:42,082 --> 02:05:44,926
SPEAKER_0:  but it is indeed a logical possibility that.

02:05:45,602 --> 02:05:48,126
SPEAKER_0:  that people always say, can you believe?

02:05:48,898 --> 02:05:50,078
SPEAKER_0:  Lex Fridman.

02:05:50,338 --> 02:05:53,246
SPEAKER_0:  interviewed Elon Musk and Kanye West.

02:05:53,954 --> 02:05:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  Then he interviewed Strominger, who was on this.

02:05:57,634 --> 02:06:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  working on this theory that just completely went into the

02:06:01,442 --> 02:06:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

02:06:02,242 --> 02:06:04,867
SPEAKER_0:  went into the toilet you know I'm gonna make

02:06:04,867 --> 02:06:12,190
SPEAKER_1:  I'm gonna get with a wife. I don't have to make a public statement should be on stage. I'll say I'm really sorry I made this giant mistake.

02:06:13,666 --> 02:06:14,494
SPEAKER_1:  platforming.

02:06:15,234 --> 02:06:16,926
SPEAKER_1:  This wild-eyed physicist.

02:06:17,506 --> 02:06:21,959
SPEAKER_1:  The belief for decades in the power of theoretical physics. Yes. No.

02:06:21,959 --> 02:06:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  like you said. So that could happen.

02:06:24,002 --> 02:06:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  It could happen. It could happen. And of course, if that couldn't happen, it wouldn't be real …

02:06:30,722 --> 02:06:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  Absolutely.

02:06:32,034 --> 02:06:32,862
SPEAKER_0:  And m Welcome

02:06:34,082 --> 02:06:35,550
SPEAKER_0:  So, but I...

02:06:35,842 --> 02:06:38,814
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I do take a lot of satisfaction that...

02:06:39,074 --> 02:06:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  Some of the things I discovered are...

02:06:42,434 --> 02:06:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  At the minimum.

02:06:43,842 --> 02:06:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  mathematical truths and they're still

02:06:46,722 --> 02:06:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  So you don't.

02:06:47,394 --> 02:06:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  have that sort of...

02:06:49,122 --> 02:06:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  nostalgic feeling of it being something that was…

02:06:53,442 --> 02:06:54,174
SPEAKER_0:  gone and

02:06:54,466 --> 02:06:57,758
SPEAKER_0:  and I'm still making discoveries.

02:06:58,498 --> 02:06:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  Now that...

02:06:59,874 --> 02:07:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  I'm as excited about, we'll see if they...

02:07:03,618 --> 02:07:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  hold the test of time that

02:07:06,274 --> 02:07:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  That's it.

02:07:07,234 --> 02:07:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  the test of time that these other ones did, but that I'm as excited about as I.

02:07:12,994 --> 02:07:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  was about those when I, when I.

02:07:15,522 --> 02:07:18,897
SPEAKER_0:  when I made them. I am easily excitable as my friends will tell you.

02:07:18,897 --> 02:07:20,397
SPEAKER_1:  Well, one interesting thing about you is...

02:07:20,397 --> 02:07:24,871
SPEAKER_0:  And I have been very excited about things which turned out to be completely wrong.

02:07:24,871 --> 02:07:28,478
SPEAKER_1:  The excitement is a precondition for breakthroughs.

02:07:28,738 --> 02:07:29,150
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

02:07:29,698 --> 02:07:32,030
SPEAKER_1:  but you are also somebody that just like you said.

02:07:32,450 --> 02:07:35,614
SPEAKER_1:  You don't have a cynical view of the modern state of physics.

02:07:36,066 --> 02:07:36,766
SPEAKER_1:  No.

02:07:37,026 --> 02:07:45,726
SPEAKER_1:  So there's a lot of people that glorify like the early days of string theory and that, you know, all the, and the point is always, but you're saying like this, this to you.

02:07:46,114 --> 02:07:46,654
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

02:07:47,586 --> 02:07:51,070
SPEAKER_1:  might be one of, if not the most exciting times to be a therapist.

02:07:51,586 --> 02:07:55,966
SPEAKER_1:  like when the alien civilizations 500 years from now that

02:07:56,450 --> 02:08:01,717
SPEAKER_1:  Visit Earth will look back, they'll think the 21st century, some of the biggest discoveries ever were made in the

02:08:01,717 --> 02:08:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I mean, when they have a measurement of strength, the fund's over.

02:08:07,682 --> 02:08:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  Then we have to go on to something new, you know?

02:08:10,402 --> 02:08:18,814
SPEAKER_1:  No, there's deep, there's going to be, the fun is over. Oh man, but there is an end to the Nile, right? I mean, there's- Is there?

02:08:19,682 --> 02:08:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  I told you.

02:08:21,922 --> 02:08:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  people scratch each other.

02:08:23,266 --> 02:08:24,862
SPEAKER_0:  Some way bird guy.

02:08:24,994 --> 02:08:25,822
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

02:08:26,178 --> 02:08:29,374
SPEAKER_1:  Let me ask you another trippy out there question.

02:08:29,762 --> 02:08:30,718
SPEAKER_1:  Again,

02:08:31,010 --> 02:08:35,230
SPEAKER_1:  Perhaps unanswerable from a physics perspective, but do you wonder about?

02:08:36,258 --> 02:08:36,606
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:08:37,442 --> 02:08:39,486
SPEAKER_1:  alien civilizations. Do you wonder about?

02:08:40,354 --> 02:08:42,270
SPEAKER_1:  other intelligent beings out there.

02:08:42,498 --> 02:08:45,182
SPEAKER_1:  making up their own math and physics trying to figure out the world.

02:08:45,602 --> 02:08:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think they're out there?

02:08:49,250 --> 02:08:50,110
SPEAKER_0:  It is.

02:08:50,914 --> 02:08:52,478
SPEAKER_0:  hard to understand.

02:08:53,090 --> 02:08:57,374
SPEAKER_0:  why there would, given that there are so many planets and of course there's

02:08:57,922 --> 02:09:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  Drake's formula and we don't exactly know what the

02:09:02,850 --> 02:09:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I think Fermi's paradox that, you know...

02:09:06,402 --> 02:09:07,742
SPEAKER_0:  is a real paradox and...

02:09:08,770 --> 02:09:09,150
SPEAKER_0:  I.

02:09:10,466 --> 02:09:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  I think they're.

02:09:12,802 --> 02:09:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  There probably are, and I think it's very exciting that...

02:09:18,690 --> 02:09:19,230
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

02:09:19,842 --> 02:09:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  We might.

02:09:21,058 --> 02:09:21,438
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

02:09:21,730 --> 02:09:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  Find some.

02:09:23,074 --> 02:09:26,897
SPEAKER_0:  It's a logical possibility that we could learn about it.

02:09:26,897 --> 02:09:34,238
SPEAKER_1:  It's super interesting to think about aliens from a perspective of physics because so any intelligent civilization is going to be...

02:09:34,658 --> 02:09:36,094
SPEAKER_1:  Contending with the ideas.

02:09:36,386 --> 02:09:38,014
SPEAKER_1:  but you're trying to understand the world around it.

02:09:39,298 --> 02:09:39,774
SPEAKER_1:  So.

02:09:40,194 --> 02:09:42,910
SPEAKER_1:  I think that the universe is...

02:09:43,266 --> 02:09:44,702
SPEAKER_1:  filled with alien civilizations.

02:09:45,218 --> 02:09:46,718
SPEAKER_1:  So they all have their physicists.

02:09:47,522 --> 02:09:48,414
SPEAKER_1:  They all have their...

02:09:48,674 --> 02:09:50,398
SPEAKER_1:  They're all trying to understand the world around them.

02:09:50,786 --> 02:09:55,390
SPEAKER_1:  And it's just interesting to me to imagine all these different perspectives, all these different Einstein's.

02:09:55,714 --> 02:09:57,479
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. Like trying to make sense of the-

02:09:57,479 --> 02:10:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  Though they might be more different than we think.

02:10:00,578 --> 02:10:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  They might be different in a way that we...

02:10:02,882 --> 02:10:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  haven't even thought of.

02:10:04,770 --> 02:10:05,982
SPEAKER_0:  like smarter or different.

02:10:07,010 --> 02:10:11,102
SPEAKER_0:  just different, something that we're not even able to describe now.

02:10:11,714 --> 02:10:13,854
SPEAKER_0:  We just haven't thought about it, you know?

02:10:14,722 --> 02:10:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, this is a really frustrating thing when we think.

02:10:17,570 --> 02:10:21,950
SPEAKER_1:  from me as an AI person, you start to think about what is intelligence, which is consciousness.

02:10:22,434 --> 02:10:23,742
SPEAKER_1:  He starts his.

02:10:24,002 --> 02:10:24,766
SPEAKER_1:  Sometimes.

02:10:25,026 --> 02:10:25,406
SPEAKER_1:  again.

02:10:25,858 --> 02:10:26,782
SPEAKER_1:  uh... night

02:10:27,234 --> 02:10:29,150
SPEAKER_1:  evening thoughts is a

02:10:30,402 --> 02:10:34,366
SPEAKER_1:  how narrow our thinking is about these concepts.

02:10:34,690 --> 02:10:35,038
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

02:10:35,618 --> 02:10:35,966
SPEAKER_1:  I said.

02:10:36,258 --> 02:10:38,174
SPEAKER_1:  that it could be intelligence.

02:10:38,946 --> 02:10:40,190
SPEAKER_1:  could be.

02:10:40,802 --> 02:10:42,718
SPEAKER_1:  something could be intelligent and be

02:10:43,202 --> 02:10:43,966
SPEAKER_1:  Very different.

02:10:44,322 --> 02:10:45,918
SPEAKER_1:  intelligent in a very different way.

02:10:46,274 --> 02:10:47,582
SPEAKER_1:  it won't be able to detect.

02:10:47,842 --> 02:10:50,398
SPEAKER_1:  because we're not keeping an open mind.

02:10:51,010 --> 02:10:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  Open enough mind.

02:10:53,122 --> 02:10:54,494
SPEAKER_1:  And that's kind of sad because.

02:10:54,850 --> 02:10:58,174
SPEAKER_1:  To me, there's also just a strong possibility that aliens or-

02:10:58,434 --> 02:11:00,318
SPEAKER_1:  something like alien intelligence or some...

02:11:02,114 --> 02:11:03,646
SPEAKER_1:  Fascinating, beautiful.

02:11:04,258 --> 02:11:06,686
SPEAKER_1:  physical phenomena are all around us.

02:11:07,842 --> 02:11:09,150
SPEAKER_1:  and we're too dumb to see it.

02:11:09,986 --> 02:11:10,398
SPEAKER_1:  for now.

02:11:11,554 --> 02:11:12,318
SPEAKER_1:  or two.

02:11:12,866 --> 02:11:13,982
SPEAKER_1:  close-minded to see it.

02:11:14,882 --> 02:11:21,566
SPEAKER_1:  There's something we're just deeply missing. Whether it's like fundamental limitations of our cognitive abilities, or just because our tools are s-

02:11:22,210 --> 02:11:23,358
SPEAKER_1:  too primitive right now.

02:11:24,322 --> 02:11:26,974
SPEAKER_1:  or like the way we it's like you said like uh

02:11:27,746 --> 02:11:30,046
SPEAKER_1:  The ideas seem trivial once you figure it all out.

02:11:30,882 --> 02:11:31,582
SPEAKER_1:  Looking back.

02:11:32,098 --> 02:11:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

02:11:35,522 --> 02:11:39,166
SPEAKER_1:  That kind of makes me sad because there could be so much beauty in the world we're not seeing.

02:11:40,674 --> 02:11:41,470
SPEAKER_1:  because we're too dumb.

02:11:42,018 --> 02:11:43,070
SPEAKER_1:  There surely is.

02:11:43,298 --> 02:11:46,558
SPEAKER_1:  And that's, I guess, the process of science and physics is to keep exploring.

02:11:46,914 --> 02:11:48,318
SPEAKER_1:  to keep exploring.

02:11:49,826 --> 02:11:52,862
SPEAKER_1:  find the thing that will in a century seem obvious.

02:11:54,018 --> 02:11:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  Well, it's something we know for sure. I mean, the brain we don't.

02:11:58,722 --> 02:12:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  really understand.

02:12:00,482 --> 02:12:01,790
SPEAKER_0:  That's gotta be some-

02:12:03,074 --> 02:12:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  fabulously beautiful story that

02:12:05,890 --> 02:12:06,782
SPEAKER_1:  I'm hoping...

02:12:07,074 --> 02:12:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  some of that story will be written through the process of trying to build a brain. So the process of engineering intelligence.

02:12:14,114 --> 02:12:16,894
SPEAKER_1:  not just the neuroscience perspective of just looking at the brain.

02:12:17,442 --> 02:12:18,558
SPEAKER_1:  but trying to create it.

02:12:19,426 --> 02:12:19,774
SPEAKER_1:  uh

02:12:21,698 --> 02:12:24,574
SPEAKER_1:  But yeah, that story hasn't been written almost at all.

02:12:25,090 --> 02:12:26,942
SPEAKER_1:  or just the early days of figuring that one out.

02:12:27,266 --> 02:12:29,566
SPEAKER_1:  But see, like you said that math is discovered, so...

02:12:30,210 --> 02:12:30,814
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

02:12:31,554 --> 02:12:33,662
SPEAKER_1:  Aliens should at least have the same math as us.

02:12:35,042 --> 02:12:35,358
SPEAKER_1:  Alright.

02:12:35,586 --> 02:12:36,542
SPEAKER_1:  I think so.

02:12:36,898 --> 02:12:37,982
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe different samples?

02:12:38,210 --> 02:12:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, well, they might have discovered different...

02:12:41,218 --> 02:12:43,422
SPEAKER_0:  They might have discovered it differently.

02:12:44,578 --> 02:12:49,022
SPEAKER_0:  and they might have had a different idea of what a proof is.

02:12:52,194 --> 02:12:53,319
SPEAKER_0:  Sure.

02:12:53,319 --> 02:12:57,118
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, we're very, we're very like black and white with the proof thing.

02:12:57,378 --> 02:12:57,726
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

02:12:57,986 --> 02:12:59,198
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe they're a loser.

02:13:00,354 --> 02:13:04,254
SPEAKER_0:  Right. Well, so you can know something is true.

02:13:05,698 --> 02:13:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  First of all, you never know something is true with 100% uncertainty.

02:13:09,826 --> 02:13:10,238
SPEAKER_0:  I mean.

02:13:11,298 --> 02:13:12,510
SPEAKER_0:  You might have had a...

02:13:12,962 --> 02:13:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  black out at something just to be.

02:13:15,266 --> 02:13:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  It's never 100%, right? You might've had a momentary lapse of consciousness, the key step in the proof.

02:13:22,530 --> 02:13:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  Nobody read it.

02:13:23,746 --> 02:13:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  Whatever. Okay. So you'd have it all for sure.

02:13:27,362 --> 02:13:28,286
SPEAKER_0:  But you can.

02:13:29,346 --> 02:13:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  bean.

02:13:30,530 --> 02:13:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  You have a preponderance of evidence which makes it…

02:13:35,618 --> 02:13:37,150
SPEAKER_0:  and preponderance of evidence.

02:13:38,082 --> 02:13:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  is not accepted very much.

02:13:41,186 --> 02:13:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  in mathematics.

02:13:43,202 --> 02:13:44,254
SPEAKER_0:  And that was sort of...

02:13:45,026 --> 02:13:45,918
SPEAKER_0:  How?

02:13:46,306 --> 02:13:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the famous Ramanujan work he had.

02:13:50,274 --> 02:13:52,382
SPEAKER_0:  formulas which he guessed at and then he...

02:13:53,154 --> 02:13:55,134
SPEAKER_0:  gathered a preponderance of evidence.

02:13:55,746 --> 02:13:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  that he was sure they were true.

02:13:57,986 --> 02:14:01,822
SPEAKER_0:  So there might be, or something completely different, they might function in a different way.

02:14:02,178 --> 02:14:03,102
SPEAKER_0:  in a very different way.

02:14:04,482 --> 02:14:08,062
SPEAKER_1:  Let me ask you kind of a heavy question for physicists, but.

02:14:08,610 --> 02:14:10,078
SPEAKER_1:  one on nuclear weapons.

02:14:10,786 --> 02:14:14,014
SPEAKER_1:  Just in general, what do you think about nuclear weapons where...

02:14:14,370 --> 02:14:15,934
SPEAKER_1:  like philosophical level.

02:14:16,962 --> 02:14:17,502
SPEAKER_1:  where

02:14:17,890 --> 02:14:22,430
SPEAKER_1:  Brilliant physicists and brilliant engineering leads to things that can destroy human civilization.

02:14:23,138 --> 02:14:24,542
SPEAKER_1:  Sort of like some of the ideas.

02:14:25,986 --> 02:14:27,006
SPEAKER_1:  that you're working on.

02:14:29,282 --> 02:14:30,078
SPEAKER_1:  I have power.

02:14:30,690 --> 02:14:34,142
SPEAKER_1:  when engineered into machines, into systems.

02:14:34,530 --> 02:14:36,405
SPEAKER_1:  Is there some aspect of you that worries about?

02:14:36,405 --> 02:14:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know what the brilliant had to do with it because of course

02:14:40,450 --> 02:14:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  Oppenheimer and all that, okay, they did it really fast, but if you didn't have Oppenheimer

02:14:46,210 --> 02:14:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, would all have happened to anyone.

02:14:49,730 --> 02:14:52,894
SPEAKER_0:  It had a reality of its own.

02:14:53,602 --> 02:14:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  The possibility of making a nuclear didn't.

02:14:55,682 --> 02:14:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  It didn't depend on the fact that the physicists who built it were brilliant.

02:15:00,930 --> 02:15:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  sped it up by a year or two years, but by now we'd have nuclear weapons. It's something that…

02:15:06,818 --> 02:15:10,302
SPEAKER_1:  So ideas have momentum and that they're unstoppable.

02:15:11,138 --> 02:15:12,574
SPEAKER_0:  Right, the possibility of.

02:15:13,282 --> 02:15:16,190
SPEAKER_0:  making nuclear weapons was discovered.

02:15:16,514 --> 02:15:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  All right.

02:15:17,314 --> 02:15:19,038
SPEAKER_0:  It was there before.

02:15:19,746 --> 02:15:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  We didn't, we didn't, it's not like somebody made it, right?

02:15:23,394 --> 02:15:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:15:26,018 --> 02:15:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  Without Picasso.

02:15:28,066 --> 02:15:29,470
SPEAKER_0:  you know, there would never have been a...

02:15:30,658 --> 02:15:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  Gear in a Cub Butt.

02:15:32,194 --> 02:15:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  without Oppenheimer that would surely have still been.

02:15:35,490 --> 02:15:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  an air bomb.

02:15:36,930 --> 02:15:41,055
SPEAKER_1:  but timing matters right timing is very important as a guy who was a mustache

02:15:41,055 --> 02:15:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  Of course, of course, of course.

02:15:43,714 --> 02:15:46,334
SPEAKER_0:  The timing mattered there.

02:15:48,418 --> 02:15:49,246
SPEAKER_0:  But I...

02:15:50,082 --> 02:15:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah...

02:15:51,778 --> 02:15:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, I mean you could try to make a case for...

02:15:57,186 --> 02:15:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  stopping.

02:15:58,530 --> 02:16:06,494
SPEAKER_1:  No, no, no, it's the case of carrying the burden of the responsibility of the power of ideas when manifested through inter-systems.

02:16:06,946 --> 02:16:08,606
SPEAKER_1:  So it's not a game.

02:16:09,186 --> 02:16:13,822
SPEAKER_1:  It's not just a game of fun mathematics, just same with artificial intelligence. You have this...

02:16:14,050 --> 02:16:15,582
SPEAKER_1:  You know, a lot of people in AI.

02:16:16,002 --> 02:16:16,350
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

02:16:16,802 --> 02:16:17,278
SPEAKER_1:  You know, it's-

02:16:17,666 --> 02:16:19,006
SPEAKER_1:  in the right people.

02:16:19,330 --> 02:16:22,110
SPEAKER_1:  In the community is a fascinating fun puzzle.

02:16:22,434 --> 02:16:24,670
SPEAKER_1:  how to make systems more and more intelligent, how to make systems more and more intelligent,

02:16:24,962 --> 02:16:28,798
SPEAKER_1:  You have a bunch of benchmarks, you're trying to make them perform better and better and better and all of a sudden.

02:16:29,442 --> 02:16:32,254
SPEAKER_1:  You have a system that's able to outsmart people.

02:16:33,186 --> 02:16:36,990
SPEAKER_1:  It's now able to be used in geopolitics. It's able to create.

02:16:37,314 --> 02:16:48,039
SPEAKER_1:  super intelligent bots that are able to at scale control the belief of a population of people and now you can have world wars you can have a lot of really risky instabilities

02:16:48,039 --> 02:16:48,789
SPEAKER_0:  Incredible.

02:16:48,789 --> 02:16:54,078
SPEAKER_1:  they are incredible. And so to think, like there is some responsibility. This is not sort of.

02:16:54,562 --> 02:16:55,070
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:16:55,938 --> 02:17:00,798
SPEAKER_1:  It's a beauty and a power and a terror to these ideas.

02:17:04,738 --> 02:17:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  At that moment, it was certainly a question for Oppenheimer and everybody who participated in that.

02:17:11,714 --> 02:17:13,694
SPEAKER_0:  what is the responsible way to...

02:17:14,658 --> 02:17:15,806
SPEAKER_0:  Serve society.

02:17:16,610 --> 02:17:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  when you're.

02:17:18,786 --> 02:17:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  sort of accidentally in this position of.

02:17:21,602 --> 02:17:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  being at the forefront of

02:17:24,994 --> 02:17:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  a development that has a huge impact on society.

02:17:28,482 --> 02:17:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  I don't see my work.

02:17:31,618 --> 02:17:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  likelihood of having a

02:17:33,442 --> 02:17:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  huge impact on the development of society itself.

02:17:36,834 --> 02:17:38,174
SPEAKER_0:  But if I were you...

02:17:39,394 --> 02:17:48,222
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, I love this. Working on AI, I think that there is a possibility there and that it is as a responsible.

02:17:48,482 --> 02:17:50,110
SPEAKER_0:  scientists that it's really not

02:17:50,690 --> 02:17:51,902
SPEAKER_0:  Good thing to say.

02:17:52,514 --> 02:17:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  I'm just the scientist here and I'm figuring out what's possible.

02:17:56,322 --> 02:17:57,342
SPEAKER_0:  because

02:17:58,562 --> 02:17:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  Your

02:17:59,170 --> 02:18:00,542
SPEAKER_0:  in a role where you

02:18:01,634 --> 02:18:04,606
SPEAKER_0:  you have more of a...

02:18:06,370 --> 02:18:09,694
SPEAKER_0:  a podium to influence things than other people.

02:18:11,650 --> 02:18:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  It's your responsibility as a

02:18:14,242 --> 02:18:15,006
SPEAKER_0:  Citizen.

02:18:16,578 --> 02:18:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  of the planet or...

02:18:18,338 --> 02:18:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  Or let me phrase it a little.

02:18:20,674 --> 02:18:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  Bless.

02:18:21,698 --> 02:18:22,366

SPEAKER_0:  you have an opportunity.

02:18:26,658 --> 02:18:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  as a citizen of the planet too.

02:18:29,570 --> 02:18:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  make the world a better place, which

02:18:31,938 --> 02:18:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  which it would be sad too.

02:18:34,978 --> 02:18:35,838
SPEAKER_0:  to bypass.

02:18:36,418 --> 02:18:45,887
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, a nice world without going. It'd be nice to keep it going for a little bit longer. Andrew, I'm really honored that you sit down with me. Thank you for your work. Well…
