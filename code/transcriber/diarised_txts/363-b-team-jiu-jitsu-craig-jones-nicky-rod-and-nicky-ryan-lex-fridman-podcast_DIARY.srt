00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:05,950
SPEAKER_1:  How would a kangaroo attack a human? Knock them down and then they choke them. The kangaroos do? They choke each other, yeah.

00:00:06,274 --> 00:00:08,126
SPEAKER_1:  They don't choke each other. You don't believe me?

00:00:08,418 --> 00:00:11,134
SPEAKER_1:  You want to watch a video? They check each other out.

00:00:11,394 --> 00:00:17,630
SPEAKER_1:  I've seen this, yeah. I mean, probably the most annoying one was obviously the one where I had Gordon Anamba I was like, tap bro.

00:00:17,986 --> 00:00:19,678
SPEAKER_1:  and he wouldn't have, so I let him out.

00:00:20,002 --> 00:00:43,870
SPEAKER_1:  I didn't get surgery. I didn't do essentially any rehab. I just have noise yell in my left leg. So what's it like having no surgery goes. You've got two options, surgery rehab only. Nikki goes, I'll do nothing. Yeah. I mean, what could possibly go wrong? If you're the world's best grappler hates you and you're gently provoking him behind the scenes every day. Well, I mean in Texas and you've stolen his brother, held him for ransom.

00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,894
SPEAKER_1:  It is like a story of a shitty Western. The last part of a difficult wake up for me.

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,646
SPEAKER_1:  I try to find a sad movie and at least cry.

00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:59,070
SPEAKER_1:  I'm about a pound out. That really gets me over the line. What are the rules in the streets? Do you think if you're on steroids, you would have finished the joke?

00:00:59,682 --> 00:01:02,110
SPEAKER_1:  I- I mean, for sure. Who knew?

00:01:02,594 --> 00:01:03,550

00:02:57,922 --> 00:03:00,327

SPEAKER_1:  Alright, so in your altogether.

00:03:22,914 --> 00:03:26,046
SPEAKER_1:  part of the leadership of the B team here in Austin.

00:03:26,786 --> 00:03:33,022
SPEAKER_1:  Let's just get out some introductory questions. What in general accomplishment of the things you mentioned you're most proud of?

00:03:33,538 --> 00:03:40,190
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I'm proud just to not have to work a full-time job just to get by on the bullshit I've done so far.

00:03:40,546 --> 00:03:46,206
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. Honestly. Just making money off a thing you love. Exactly, yeah. When was the first time you made money on a thing you love?

00:03:47,138 --> 00:03:52,926
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, probably a jujitsu tournament. I think maybe in Abu Dhabi, where I won a thousand dollars, thought I was rich. Yeah.

00:03:53,282 --> 00:03:55,102
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, what'd you spend a thousand dollars on?

00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:01,342
SPEAKER_1:  Probably something bad, probably drugs or something at the time. Maybe blew it at the after party.

00:04:02,882 --> 00:04:11,838
SPEAKER_1:  That's a good introduction, Craig. So what about you? When's the first time you made money with Anji Jitsu or what was actually stepping back? Like, what's the thing you're most proud of? Is it a similar kind of thing?

00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:13,223
SPEAKER_1:  I think I think I'm most proud.

00:04:13,223 --> 00:04:17,598
SPEAKER_0:  of is uh i mean for sure two 80cc silver metals which

00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  hurts because you're so close to getting that gold but uh...

00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it takes time. I'm understanding that.

00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  You know, Sportive Jiu Jitsu takes quite a while to be at the...

00:04:26,594 --> 00:04:28,702
SPEAKER_0:  tip top to be the absolute best. So, uh.

00:04:29,122 --> 00:04:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm just being consistent in my training and my craft and...

00:04:32,258 --> 00:04:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  and we'll get that number one spot one day.

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,670
SPEAKER_1:  what failure or loss is the most painful to you?

00:04:38,882 --> 00:04:48,958
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, I probably have a pretty short term memory. So my losses, I just like, I'll just forget about them. Yeah, I mean, for sure, my loss at this past 80cc in the finals, I don't know.

00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,510
SPEAKER_0:  You know, that one's sung a bit because I definitely thought I was going to win. I mean, like.

00:04:52,802 --> 00:04:59,134
SPEAKER_0:  It takes a while to produce the skills or the reactions more so that you need to have to be, you know, to have as Pitt 沒有將 cup 許濟

00:04:59,426 --> 00:05:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  be that number one pound for pound guy.

00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:13,022
SPEAKER_0:  And you know, pre ADCC, I was coming off an injury. So it took me a little bit to find the right mentality and physicality that I needed in order to, you know, get the wins that required gold. So, my job is I make a stand for myself in the practice between my friends about where können everywhere

00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,302
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it's just a process.

00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:21,246
SPEAKER_1:  Interesting. You keep saying process like it takes a while to build up. You're not like thinking of a loss like a DCC is like.

00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:22,270
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

00:05:22,498 --> 00:05:27,550
SPEAKER_1:  specific failures you're not you haven't gone long enough in a particular process to being a champ.

00:05:27,842 --> 00:05:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I mean, for me, I'm coming, I'm closing in on five years of specifically jiu jitsu training. I'm about four and a half right now.

00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  And um...

00:05:36,642 --> 00:05:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it's just the, you kind of, you constantly have these ups and downs in training where like, as long as you stay consistent, you'll have a gradual raise.

00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:48,062
SPEAKER_0:  you know it's still you have these peaks and lows and

00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  You know, just trying to get better every day. I'm definitely not where I will be in a few years from now, but I'm striving to get there.

00:05:55,426 --> 00:05:57,886
SPEAKER_1:  Are you actually a brown belt? Was that a joke?

00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:00,254
SPEAKER_1:  Brown Belt. Yeah, you're a brown boat.

00:06:00,738 --> 00:06:02,014
SPEAKER_1:  Like, how many stripes?

00:06:02,402 --> 00:06:04,798
SPEAKER_1:  No stripes. No stripes. Stripes. No stripes.

00:06:05,186 --> 00:06:07,902
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, is that part of the process that you're working through?

00:06:08,194 --> 00:06:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  Definitely part of the process. I mean, I think a black belt is just based upon how much knowledge you have.

00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  Obviously, if you're talking competitive wise, from when I started, I was able to beat most black belts. It's just...

00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,806
SPEAKER_0:  kind of how I was gifted from my wrestling experience.

00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the time will come when it's right, but I'm not in a rush at all. I'm continuing. I just kind of take every day for what it is and try to improve upon that.

00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:37,246
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I want to give him the black belt. Nikki Ryan says he's not ready. What is it?

00:06:37,538 --> 00:06:40,414
SPEAKER_1:  I guess, like us no-gi folks, do you take that seriously?

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,454
SPEAKER_1:  Like the black belt or like how much does it come into play into?

00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,166
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean, it's like Nikki Rott said, you know, it's based off of knowledge.

00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:57,822
SPEAKER_1:  Not just you know what you do out on the competition mats because you know Like he said he had years of wrestling experience and obviously he's very physically gifted So we great based off of the amount of knowledge that you have

00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,190
SPEAKER_1:  How do you measure knowledge?

00:07:01,538 --> 00:07:09,438
SPEAKER_1:  I think teaching is a good measurement of it, like how well you're able to show the moves and really make sure that you have an understanding of what you're doing.

00:07:09,826 --> 00:07:11,742
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's an interesting rank. It's like, um...

00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,830
SPEAKER_1:  It's something that takes many years to accomplish. And for a lot of people, it's truly meaningful. It's like it represents...

00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,846
SPEAKER_1:  particular step in a journey.

00:07:19,618 --> 00:07:21,150
SPEAKER_1:  But for you guys, it's almost like

00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:23,646
SPEAKER_1:  different because you've been so focused on competition.

00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:24,926
SPEAKER_1:  that.

00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:31,390
SPEAKER_1:  I guess if you take it seriously, it is a big step for you too. Like as martial artists, that's bigger than just being.

00:07:32,002 --> 00:07:33,982
SPEAKER_1:  like top of the world competitors, right?

00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,214
SPEAKER_1:  So I thought it was a joke. You guys are actually taking this seriously.

00:07:37,794 --> 00:07:42,878
SPEAKER_1:  Like that he's a Brown bow. They's a Brown belt and he's in your taking seriously the rank of black belt. like It's going to be a fun day, no? I know, nevermind. You're going to have some fun life to yourself.

00:07:43,266 --> 00:07:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  It's part of your journey.

00:07:45,346 --> 00:07:49,758
SPEAKER_0:  Think by the time I get a black belt, I'll be no more pound for pound. I think it'd be pretty.

00:07:50,146 --> 00:07:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  Nice to accomplish that as a brown belt.

00:07:52,194 --> 00:07:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  and then maybe toss a black ball on top.

00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,614
SPEAKER_1:  maybe get promoted on the podium.

00:07:57,218 --> 00:07:59,582
SPEAKER_1:  What do you guys, do you love winning?

00:08:00,258 --> 00:08:01,598
SPEAKER_1:  or hate losing more.

00:08:02,914 --> 00:08:04,030
SPEAKER_1:  I definitely don't hate losing.

00:08:04,322 --> 00:08:13,246
SPEAKER_1:  If it pays the bills, I don't mind. Oh really? Yeah, but honestly, if I win, I feel more relief than anything rather than like excitement and stuff. I'm like, oh fuck, thank God that's over.

00:08:14,114 --> 00:08:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  I hate losing for sure.

00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  Um, but I understand that it's necessary to get, you know, to get to where you want to be.

00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  And then winning is like

00:08:23,618 --> 00:08:41,406
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, what I think winning is probably the closest you can think you can get to like heroin or something. Because I mean, we're on a like if you do have extreme success in a tournament that you've been adamant about training for and competing in for a while and you end up winning it I mean I feel like you're on that high for days at a time after.

00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,462
SPEAKER_1:  Heron's gonna be better.

00:08:42,626 --> 00:08:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  You think so? I'ma stick with no.

00:08:45,282 --> 00:08:50,558
SPEAKER_1:  I'm looking at sucked it to win.

00:08:50,914 --> 00:08:53,374
SPEAKER_1:  I guess that's a good boy, yeah.

00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:57,566
SPEAKER_1:  But you know, like because you come from a little bit of a wrestling culture.

00:08:57,922 --> 00:09:01,374
SPEAKER_1:  One of the things I really love is at the end of the match when they lose, they just, there's no...

00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,526
SPEAKER_1:  They just run off.

00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,982
SPEAKER_1:  They're like almost pissed off. It's like some mixture of.

00:09:06,434 --> 00:09:08,318
SPEAKER_1:  anger and frustration at themselves.

00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:11,518
SPEAKER_0:  I think sometimes people freak out on the mat.

00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that's just a.

00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:14,206
SPEAKER_0:  to show everybody like.

00:09:14,562 --> 00:09:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  They're acting like they care it a lot.

00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  and really maybe they didn't work enough to get to where they want to, to where they-

00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  expected to be and they lost and then they had this big boost of emotion like after

00:09:26,722 --> 00:09:27,902
SPEAKER_0:  after the loss, but uh...

00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  YAMIN

00:09:29,474 --> 00:09:32,862
SPEAKER_0:  I think you just cry in the mirror and not to everybody else.

00:09:33,634 --> 00:09:34,142
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:09:34,626 --> 00:09:38,302
SPEAKER_1:  What, have you ever cried watching a movie? I don't think I've ever cried, period. Okay could you close your plug for me tonight please, hello, okay

00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:40,094
SPEAKER_1:  Have you cried watching a movie?

00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,374
SPEAKER_1:  Not yet.

00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:42,462
SPEAKER_1:  Not yet.

00:09:42,722 --> 00:09:43,614
SPEAKER_1:  the notebook.

00:09:43,842 --> 00:09:45,438
SPEAKER_1:  I try to avoid those. My protection.

00:09:45,826 --> 00:09:49,982
SPEAKER_1:  I lie actually. Titanic. The last part of a difficult wake up for me.

00:09:50,498 --> 00:09:52,734
SPEAKER_1:  I try to find a sad movie and at least cry.

00:09:53,314 --> 00:09:57,534
SPEAKER_1:  I better pound out. That really gets me over the line. Low energy cutting.

00:09:57,794 --> 00:09:58,526
SPEAKER_1:  The tears.

00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,062
SPEAKER_1:

00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:08,862
SPEAKER_1:  Um, there's other following, uh, liquids I could talk to you about, but let's just, let's just, let's just continue on. No energy.

00:10:09,346 --> 00:10:13,342
SPEAKER_1:  What about you, Nikki? Love of winning versus hate of losing.

00:10:13,602 --> 00:10:18,366
SPEAKER_1:  I'm a very competitive person, so I for sure hate losing more than I like winning.

00:10:18,658 --> 00:10:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:24,062
SPEAKER_1:  I do think it's something that's kind of held me back over the past few years.

00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:24,830
SPEAKER_1:  Cuz uh...

00:10:25,378 --> 00:10:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  It makes it so that I'm not as active as I should be.

00:10:28,514 --> 00:10:33,342
SPEAKER_1:  because it's like, I really hate that feeling of, you know, after a match that you just lost.

00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:42,462
SPEAKER_1:  So it kind of prevents me from competing. So it's definitely something I need to work past So like when you think about a competition the possibility of losing which is always there in competition?

00:10:42,786 --> 00:10:51,070
SPEAKER_1:  is the thing that like weighs heavy on you in the months and weeks leading up to it. Yeah, my whole life, you know, my financial stability, everything depends on, you know.

00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:54,270
SPEAKER_1:  my ability to go out there and compete and my ability to teach.

00:10:54,594 --> 00:11:00,734
SPEAKER_1:  So, you know, it's a huge hit to the brand if you lose. So, you know, leading up to matches, that's definitely something that's in my mind.

00:11:01,346 --> 00:11:05,790
SPEAKER_1:  I know you see you guys are like world-class athletes, but for me more like a hobbyist competitor

00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:06,942
SPEAKER_1:  I compete a lot.

00:11:07,842 --> 00:11:10,334
SPEAKER_1:  The thing I was, uh, is I really wanted to win.

00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,566
SPEAKER_1:  The thing I was probably most afraid of was not just losing.

00:11:14,082 --> 00:11:15,486
SPEAKER_1:  but like, embarrassing myself.

00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,246
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, even even actually.

00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:19,102
SPEAKER_1:  winning by stalling.

00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,950
SPEAKER_1:  That was the thing I hated the most about myself.

00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,966
SPEAKER_1:  in terms of crying in the mirror.

00:11:25,154 --> 00:11:26,878
SPEAKER_1:  is like being too afraid.

00:11:27,618 --> 00:11:30,366
SPEAKER_1:  I take risks after I'm up on two points or something.

00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  I think you got to, in competition, sometimes it's good to take the emotion out of it.

00:11:34,146 --> 00:11:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  It's too easy sometimes to like, uh...

00:11:36,418 --> 00:11:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  think about all my girls and in the crowd, my family's watching, like I want to win because they're there.

00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  But at the highest level, if you're emotional at all, no, that's affecting you.

00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:47,774
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:11:48,162 --> 00:11:48,990
SPEAKER_1:  It's tough though.

00:11:49,762 --> 00:11:53,887
SPEAKER_1:  That's tough. Especially like leading up to one year on the map maybe, but...

00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  leading up to it.

00:11:55,138 --> 00:11:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's okay to be emotional.

00:11:56,802 --> 00:12:08,990
SPEAKER_0:  prior, like, you know, if we know ADCC or it's coming up and we have a big match, like definitely, I'll go out and, and practice and I'll, I'll visualize, I'll put myself in that competition. That way when it's game time, it's like, I've been there a thousand times already.

00:12:09,378 --> 00:12:14,846
SPEAKER_1:  So not the actual competition, but even leading up to it, like stepping on the mat, like all the walk, walk towards it, all that.

00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:24,478
SPEAKER_0:  all that stuff, like I'll do the same exact warmup for weeks on end until my competition day comes. That way, you know, when I compete, I'm just like, oh, it's another Tuesday at practice.

00:12:25,218 --> 00:12:29,374
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, what about you, Craig? How do you prepare mentally for a tournament like ADCC?

00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:32,702
SPEAKER_1:  I push it completely out of my mind. Don't even think about it.

00:12:33,346 --> 00:12:35,550
SPEAKER_1:  try to avoid any visualization.

00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:38,558
SPEAKER_1:  any rituals, warmups, anything like that.

00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,918
SPEAKER_1:  Block it out until the last second. Yeah, trying not to think about it.

00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,582
SPEAKER_1:  I just go to training to have fun.

00:12:44,002 --> 00:12:44,542
SPEAKER_1:  Learn a bit.

00:12:45,026 --> 00:12:47,038
SPEAKER_1:  So I try to approach competition the exact same way.

00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,086
SPEAKER_1:  I don't warm up training.

00:12:49,346 --> 00:12:50,686
SPEAKER_1:  to very little warm up for competition.

00:12:51,714 --> 00:12:56,926
SPEAKER_1:  Uh huh. And you just step on the mat. Step on the mat. My philosophy is there's no warm ups on the street.

00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,445
SPEAKER_0:  We're so vastly dem-

00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,862
SPEAKER_1:  Thanks.

00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:01,470
SPEAKER_1:  EAR RAPE

00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:02,526
SPEAKER_1:

00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,374
SPEAKER_1:  Alright, so you like legit don't warm up.

00:13:05,954 --> 00:13:09,598
SPEAKER_1:  No, I probably should now I'm 31, but I would just like in the gym.

00:13:09,826 --> 00:13:16,414
SPEAKER_1:  It easy the first round you know like if I look around the room and Nicky Ryan's down my go I will have an easier first round today.

00:13:16,802 --> 00:13:17,822
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:13:18,978 --> 00:13:21,566
SPEAKER_1:  So even for like the most high stakes matches.

00:13:22,306 --> 00:13:23,454
SPEAKER_1:  you try to push it up.

00:13:23,714 --> 00:13:24,510
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I didn't even think about it.

00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:33,150
SPEAKER_1:  What about like all the social Instagram posts you have to do about that match? You just make a joke out of it and kinda... Yeah, I mean that's kinda pretty.

00:13:33,474 --> 00:13:34,974
SPEAKER_1:  silly, you know, we're just.

00:13:35,202 --> 00:13:42,366
SPEAKER_1:  wrestling each other, you know? We put the meaning into it, but to someone that doesn't follow the sport, it looks stupid. Well, all of human existence is pretty silly.

00:13:42,786 --> 00:13:43,614
SPEAKER_1:  Like, what are we doing?

00:13:44,002 --> 00:13:45,374
SPEAKER_1:  None of us really know what's going on.

00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,678
SPEAKER_1:  We'll kind of have sex to reproduce.

00:13:48,002 --> 00:13:49,214
SPEAKER_1:  We'll get hungry when we eat.

00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:52,094
SPEAKER_1:  and then we're all chasing money and cars and whatever the hell.

00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,678
SPEAKER_1:  in a capitalist society or we worship a dictator in a.

00:13:55,938 --> 00:13:56,990
SPEAKER_1:  authoritarian regime.

00:13:58,498 --> 00:13:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  and it would get off on.

00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,694
SPEAKER_1:  We'll let power abuse us and then we just.

00:14:02,434 --> 00:14:03,358
SPEAKER_1:  murder others.

00:14:03,682 --> 00:14:04,702
SPEAKER_1:  because we get off on it.

00:14:06,434 --> 00:14:08,222
SPEAKER_1:  and then eventually all of us will die.

00:14:08,642 --> 00:14:10,462
SPEAKER_1:  because the sun will run out of energy.

00:14:11,362 --> 00:14:13,278
SPEAKER_1:  because colonizing other planets is very difficult.

00:14:13,762 --> 00:14:14,718
SPEAKER_1:  That's another what matters.

00:14:15,074 --> 00:14:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  It's a good philosophy. It's pretty good.

00:14:18,434 --> 00:14:19,559
SPEAKER_1:  That's exactly what I was gonna say.

00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,958
SPEAKER_0:  the sun run out of energy.

00:14:21,474 --> 00:14:29,406
SPEAKER_1:  You caught me there. It's a nuclear fusion engine and eventually burns out.

00:14:29,794 --> 00:14:32,126
SPEAKER_1:  Like when you get tired of training, it's never happened.

00:14:32,258 --> 00:14:35,326
SPEAKER_0:  I try to get tired. I was like, dude, it's not working.

00:14:35,746 --> 00:14:36,990
SPEAKER_1:

00:14:37,346 --> 00:14:40,734
SPEAKER_1:  All right, cool. So you legit don't care about losing.

00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,142
SPEAKER_1:  It doesn't weigh heavy on you.

00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:55,294
SPEAKER_1:  I try not to list, like if I win, I try to block out all the compliments, all the niceties and stuff. So I try to do the same with losing. It's happened. Move on to the next one, you know, don't dwell on it too much. And sometimes make a joke out of it. Yeah, exactly. Losing?

00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,854
SPEAKER_1:  With the right joke, we can make money.

00:14:58,114 --> 00:15:00,638
SPEAKER_1:  or for the event that's just transpired.

00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,014
SPEAKER_1:  That's what's most important.

00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:04,606
SPEAKER_1:  Excellent. Thank you. I have a bunch of your merch.

00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:05,886
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, nice.

00:15:06,146 --> 00:15:07,774
SPEAKER_1:  This one's the Jordan Byers ripoff.

00:15:09,314 --> 00:15:09,630
SPEAKER_1:  Thanks for watching!

00:15:09,986 --> 00:15:10,526
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:15:10,882 --> 00:15:11,934
SPEAKER_1:  All I see is silver.

00:15:12,738 --> 00:15:22,814
SPEAKER_1:  The way he pronounces broils is very, very sexy. Okay. I throw lines at people and I try to gauge their reaction. Like sometimes I'll say something to Nikki and I'll be like.

00:15:23,202 --> 00:15:24,382
SPEAKER_1:  Alright, that's probably crossing the line.

00:15:24,738 --> 00:15:29,790
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I mean, we'll tone it down for the public. So, yeah, so it's not just right. You have to think is this crossing the line?

00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:32,478
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, yeah, I get as close to it as possible.

00:15:32,738 --> 00:15:35,230
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I feel like he can't really cross it.

00:15:36,578 --> 00:15:39,134
SPEAKER_1:  Just a little bit. Just a little bit, yeah.

00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:41,758
SPEAKER_1:  Speaking of which...

00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:47,934
SPEAKER_1:  You said that I'm Switzerland in World War II since I'm friends with both you and Gordon.

00:15:48,162 --> 00:15:48,734
SPEAKER_1:  and John.

00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:53,406
SPEAKER_1:  Very rich country. Are you a Hitler or a Stalin by the way in this analogy?

00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,646
SPEAKER_1:  Would you like to be Hitler or Stalin?

00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,790
SPEAKER_1:  And should you make a t-shirt out of it or?

00:15:58,018 --> 00:16:02,238
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, a Nazi t-shirt, I don't know how well that sells. I think it would, you know.

00:16:02,466 --> 00:16:08,670
SPEAKER_1:  I think let's brainstorm out on this one offline. I think since Hitler lost.

00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:12,446
SPEAKER_1:  So you got second place in World War II. That's true. That's true.

00:16:12,898 --> 00:16:15,998
SPEAKER_1:  Anyway, to the degree that you can.

00:16:16,898 --> 00:16:22,686
SPEAKER_1:  Can you tell the story of how the time you've had with the Donahue Death Squad and why you split up?

00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,014
SPEAKER_1:  I competed against Gordon for ADCC.

00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:27,902
SPEAKER_1:  and EBI.

00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,982
SPEAKER_1:  in 2017.

00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,566
SPEAKER_1:  And I remember I competed against him at ADCC and then we had...

00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,126
SPEAKER_1:  the EBOI event, and then...

00:16:36,386 --> 00:16:38,654
SPEAKER_1:  I had a kiss eye. I used to compete.

00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:40,798
SPEAKER_1:  All the time, every week. I wouldn't even.

00:16:41,282 --> 00:16:44,510
SPEAKER_1:  do the preparation or anything. I just feel like trying to disseminize, make money.

00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:48,350
SPEAKER_1:  and then jump in and compete. I remember I showed up to Kasai after I faced him twice.

00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:50,878
SPEAKER_1:  And they were like four locker rooms and they put me...

00:16:51,298 --> 00:16:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  with all the DDS guys.

00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:53,822
SPEAKER_1:  It was just me.

00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,902
SPEAKER_1:  and all of DDS and I think we competed.

00:16:56,354 --> 00:16:57,886
SPEAKER_1:  the week, weekend before.

00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,126
SPEAKER_1:  So I thought it was gonna be super rock cool, but I'm zeshy.

00:17:00,578 --> 00:17:01,566
SPEAKER_1:  It was actually pretty chill.

00:17:01,826 --> 00:17:03,198
SPEAKER_1:  and the Casai was in New York.

00:17:03,682 --> 00:17:06,014
SPEAKER_1:  And they suggested to come train that way.

00:17:06,562 --> 00:17:08,606
SPEAKER_1:  So I came trains, hung out with them a bit.

00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:09,502
SPEAKER_1:  uh

00:17:09,922 --> 00:17:11,134
SPEAKER_1:  Ultimately the goal was...

00:17:11,426 --> 00:17:14,206
SPEAKER_1:  to move to America, enjoy the big attain just cause.

00:17:14,882 --> 00:17:20,254
SPEAKER_1:  That flight to Australia is death. Australia is so far away from everywhere. That's kind of like.

00:17:20,642 --> 00:17:21,470
SPEAKER_1:  Not realistic.

00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,742
SPEAKER_1:  to base yourself in Australia with all the tournaments.

00:17:24,098 --> 00:17:24,766
SPEAKER_1:  Hire in America.

00:17:25,346 --> 00:17:28,670
SPEAKER_1:  And then I went and trained with the guys and they just had a massive

00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:29,502
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:17:30,114 --> 00:17:32,030
SPEAKER_1:  massively deep talent pool in that room.

00:17:32,482 --> 00:17:33,502
SPEAKER_1:  Like show up to like a.

00:17:33,858 --> 00:17:37,726
SPEAKER_1:  Meant to be 7am, actual 8am class, Brazilian time.

00:17:38,242 --> 00:17:40,446
SPEAKER_1:  It'll be like a hundred people in there maybe.

00:17:40,674 --> 00:17:44,190
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know how many black belts, but a ton of elite guys and I was coming from Australia.

00:17:44,834 --> 00:17:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  uh

00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:49,470
SPEAKER_1:  training with Lachlan Giles, but really that room was pretty shallow and like most people had.

00:17:49,922 --> 00:17:53,150
SPEAKER_1:  serious jobs and stuff. So it was like, basically me just training with Loughlin.

00:17:53,602 --> 00:17:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe a couple of other guys.

00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,790
SPEAKER_1:  and then to go to New York and have access to it.

00:17:58,146 --> 00:17:59,166
SPEAKER_1:  What a ray.

00:17:59,554 --> 00:18:01,566
SPEAKER_1:  of training partners and guys that are training.

00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:02,622
SPEAKER_1:  us each day.

00:18:03,074 --> 00:18:07,902
SPEAKER_1:  I feel like that's what you really need. You need people that can train as much as you are. Works again…

00:18:08,674 --> 00:18:12,670
SPEAKER_1:  You get humbled in that room at first? For sure. Because my style at the time was basically-

00:18:12,898 --> 00:18:14,206
SPEAKER_1:  a rip-off version.

00:18:14,434 --> 00:18:17,502
SPEAKER_1:  of what they were doing. Leg locks came in, I remember just-

00:18:18,178 --> 00:18:20,926
SPEAKER_1:  watching Eddie Cummings nonstop and just seeing this guy.

00:18:21,282 --> 00:18:26,846
SPEAKER_1:  rip people's legs off and I was like, you know what? That's probably a good move. You know, that looks like an easier path.

00:18:27,362 --> 00:18:27,966
SPEAKER_1:  to victory.

00:18:28,258 --> 00:18:31,902
SPEAKER_1:  than trying to beat these guys at what they're good at already.

00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,790
SPEAKER_1:  My philosophy at the time was...

00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:37,918
SPEAKER_1:  If it's bothering old Brazilians, it's bothering them for a reason.

00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,326
SPEAKER_1:  It's probably effective.

00:18:39,906 --> 00:18:41,534
SPEAKER_1:  And that's the path I took to sort of.

00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,422
SPEAKER_1:  Try to rip off their moves.

00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:46,238
SPEAKER_1:  And then obviously to go into that room, try to do them.

00:18:46,466 --> 00:18:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  to them.

00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,542
SPEAKER_1:  it's going to be a bit more difficult.

00:18:49,986 --> 00:18:51,006
SPEAKER_1:  Alright, so...

00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:52,382
SPEAKER_1:  That's how it started.

00:18:53,922 --> 00:18:55,166
SPEAKER_1:  How did you end up here?

00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,654
SPEAKER_1:  How do we end up here? We're in Austin, Texas. I mean...

00:18:59,234 --> 00:19:01,438
SPEAKER_1:  I like to think of Puerto Rico.

00:19:01,794 --> 00:19:03,006
SPEAKER_1:  as Apocalypse Now.

00:19:03,586 --> 00:19:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  John Danaher as Colonel Kurtz.

00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,126
SPEAKER_1:  Things got very weird in the jungle.

00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,078
SPEAKER_1:  and the teams went in two.

00:19:10,338 --> 00:19:11,902
SPEAKER_1:  different directions.

00:19:12,866 --> 00:19:19,902
SPEAKER_1:  But honestly, I mean, it's not really my story to tell. I had some issues with some of those people. At the time of the split, I got along very well with Jon.

00:19:20,482 --> 00:19:22,974
SPEAKER_1:  I feel like me and him connected very well. I don't know.

00:19:23,554 --> 00:19:25,758
SPEAKER_1:  Well that was maybe it was just because he missed.

00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,638
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, I may miss the familiar accent, Australian New Zealand accent.

00:19:29,058 --> 00:19:29,790
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhh...

00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,798
SPEAKER_1:  But I mean, I basically followed Nicky.

00:19:33,186 --> 00:19:34,302
SPEAKER_1:  Left with Nikki?

00:19:34,658 --> 00:19:35,038
SPEAKER_1:  Sort of.

00:19:35,266 --> 00:19:37,534
SPEAKER_1:  that core group of guys left with Nikki.

00:19:37,858 --> 00:19:38,398
SPEAKER_1:  And I mean.

00:19:38,658 --> 00:19:41,502
SPEAKER_1:  I just back, there was personal problems. So I just back Nikki, basically.

00:19:41,954 --> 00:19:42,302
SPEAKER_1:  Got it.

00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,542
SPEAKER_1:  just sticking on you for a bit.

00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,366
SPEAKER_1:  Is there a part of you that...

00:19:46,722 --> 00:19:49,022
SPEAKER_1:  you know, finds it heartbreaking that DDS split up.

00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,966
SPEAKER_1:  This party you miss working with John and everybody.

00:19:52,802 --> 00:19:54,270
SPEAKER_1:  Now can you steal me on the case for that?

00:19:54,658 --> 00:20:02,590
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I miss certain aspects of it, but I also do prefer the freedom of being apart from it. It's obviously a very strict regime.

00:20:03,074 --> 00:20:03,582
SPEAKER_1:  Under.

00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,302
SPEAKER_1:  John Dana her, you know, obviously it's possible. I miss.

00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,310
SPEAKER_1:  The past the public doesn't see of John.

00:20:09,794 --> 00:20:12,414
SPEAKER_1:  the behind the scenes banter, I feel like he's very conscious.

00:20:12,738 --> 00:20:14,814
SPEAKER_1:  of the image he portrays to the world.

00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,126
SPEAKER_1:  But basically...

00:20:16,514 --> 00:20:20,254
SPEAKER_1:  He closed doors. He's always making jokes, always funny, I guess more in line.

00:20:20,674 --> 00:20:21,630
SPEAKER_1:  with the Australian.

00:20:22,146 --> 00:20:25,246
SPEAKER_1:  Kiwi sort of culture, but you don't really see that.

00:20:25,506 --> 00:20:27,486
SPEAKER_1:  in the public eye. that perspective.

00:20:27,778 --> 00:20:29,662
SPEAKER_1:  I do miss that relationship with John.

00:20:30,114 --> 00:20:33,790
SPEAKER_1:  In terms of setting aside personal differences, Gordon was.

00:20:34,082 --> 00:20:35,486
SPEAKER_1:  a good training partner.

00:20:35,938 --> 00:20:38,014
SPEAKER_1:  Definitely a good training partner to train with.

00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:39,774
SPEAKER_1:  but obviously the

00:20:40,226 --> 00:20:43,710
SPEAKER_1:  Negative things we can't really talk about outweighed all of those things.

00:20:44,194 --> 00:20:45,854
SPEAKER_1:  and we obviously had to make a decision.

00:20:46,562 --> 00:20:47,326
SPEAKER_1:  to leave.

00:20:47,586 --> 00:20:49,246
SPEAKER_1:  But yeah. It's happening in the jungle.

00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:53,118
SPEAKER_1:  the things happen to the jungle. Should never be spoken of. But I personally...

00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:59,422
SPEAKER_1:  Cannot speak up. Yeah, but obviously I do miss certain aspects. Like, I mean, nothing's all bad. Nothing's so good, you know?

00:21:00,322 --> 00:21:02,398
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, this goes back to your like, uh...

00:21:02,626 --> 00:21:03,870
SPEAKER_1:  Everything we're doing is silly.

00:21:04,578 --> 00:21:08,606
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, exactly. That's why I don't get people take it so serious. Smash lights are serious. It's just...

00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,862
SPEAKER_1:  It's just pretty stupid really, especially in the gate looks just...

00:21:13,698 --> 00:21:23,806
SPEAKER_1:  It looks bad. And then I mean, it's pretty silly with, with and without the Ghee. It's just a bunch of apes. What's silly about no Ghee and what's silly about the Ghee and just mixed and matched bottoms there. You know what I mean?

00:21:24,226 --> 00:21:25,950
SPEAKER_1:  Wait, which one? What?

00:21:26,242 --> 00:21:27,550
SPEAKER_1:  I see what you're doing.

00:21:28,194 --> 00:21:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  Brother, you come...

00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:33,694
SPEAKER_1:  to my house and defend my people.

00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:36,030
SPEAKER_1:  All right.

00:21:37,826 --> 00:21:38,558
SPEAKER_1:  This is

00:21:38,818 --> 00:21:40,926
SPEAKER_1:  We're going to go to every dark place apparently.

00:21:41,154 --> 00:21:45,470
SPEAKER_1:  Nick, how did you get with DDS? What was that journey like? Is there—

00:21:45,794 --> 00:21:51,998
SPEAKER_1:  Try to see if there's things that you remember fondly that you've gotten from the experience.

00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  Alright, so the way I started training with DDS...

00:21:55,906 --> 00:21:59,230
SPEAKER_0:  Um, initially I was training for like,

00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,766
SPEAKER_0:  Well, initially I was...

00:22:01,058 --> 00:22:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  I was a bouncer, right? I dropped out of college to pursue this fitness modeling career I ended up signing with a

00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:10,750
SPEAKER_0:  Willamina models up in New York. And I was like, try to get in better shape.

00:22:10,978 --> 00:22:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  And while I was bouncing kind of the talk of like, you know, who's tougher came up between the wrestlers and a few of the bouncers that train jiu-jitsu.

00:22:18,146 --> 00:22:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  And, uh, you know, they convinced me to go to a practice and, and I went to my first practice over there.

00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,254
SPEAKER_0:  And uh, I-

00:22:24,706 --> 00:22:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  And for the most part, I just controlled everybody got on top of them was able to avoid like kind of like you know shitty submissions because I had

00:22:31,426 --> 00:22:35,742
SPEAKER_0:  I had an awareness of the sport and I'm a fan of fighting and what not.

00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,078
SPEAKER_0:  I kind of understood it pretty well.

00:22:38,338 --> 00:22:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  And then soon after that, I joined a school and.

00:22:41,602 --> 00:22:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  My second week of Jiu Jitsu I started.

00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:44,318
SPEAKER_0:  repeating.

00:22:44,578 --> 00:22:51,614
SPEAKER_0:  had pretty good success. I was subbin a few black belts and beating everybody pretty decisively with points and stuff.

00:22:52,098 --> 00:22:59,902
SPEAKER_0:  And about three months into training locally, I got connected with a Gordon, Gordon Ryan and John Danner up in New York. And I started.

00:23:00,194 --> 00:23:03,934
SPEAKER_0:  I committed to make the drive up there as many days as I could.

00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:09,915
SPEAKER_0:  At the time I live in South Jersey and it was about two and a half hour, three hour drive without traffic to New York.

00:23:09,915 --> 00:23:11,070
SPEAKER_1:  We're in South Jersey.

00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,798
SPEAKER_0:  Gloucester County.

00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  I'll talk about New Jersey specifically, but Gloucester County.

00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:25,553
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. So it was about, it was about 130 miles and without traffic, you know, about two or two and a half hours or so, but on the way back, man, we, it'd be three plus sometimes, you know, you're catching that rush.

00:23:25,553 --> 00:23:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  What year was this do you remember? this was 2018

00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:29,566
SPEAKER_1:  to get how young.

00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:36,254
SPEAKER_1:  I was there before all that. All right, cool. Anyway, you're doing the long drive and then.

00:23:37,634 --> 00:23:55,454
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, doing a long drive. And then, uh, you know, once I went 80 CC trials, I was able to make a couple of bucks and then, you know, I got my silver medal at 80 CC and I was able to afford to live up there in New York and North Jersey area. So I lived up there, trained there full time every day. And, uh, you know, it was kind of stuck with the team throughout, throughout the turbulent times and

00:23:55,842 --> 00:23:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  found ourselves in Austin.

00:23:57,346 --> 00:23:57,982
SPEAKER_1:  in the jungle.

00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:01,982
SPEAKER_1:  in the jungle. Things we shall not speak of.

00:24:02,978 --> 00:24:04,734
SPEAKER_1:  What, uh, what's.

00:24:05,314 --> 00:24:10,065
SPEAKER_1:  Are there things that you remember that you've learned from John Donahue from Italy?

00:24:10,065 --> 00:24:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I mean, I definitely learned a ton from John and the team as a whole.

00:24:16,962 --> 00:24:33,854
SPEAKER_0:  It's you have to be the guy that asks questions in, in the type of environment, right? Cause there's not, it's not, you're not going to get singled out to be that specific, uh, like star or the, the best guy in the room when you have all these other, you know, stud athletes. So I really had to seek out and figure out the kind of questions that I needed to ask.

00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  And once I became a bit more verbal with my training, and you know, I

00:24:39,266 --> 00:24:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  I'm expressing all my curiosities about grappling to these guys. Definitely help boost my technique and my career as a whole.

00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:51,454
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, did you understand what kind of stuff like technically you want to get good at? What fits your body? Leave a comment below and I will try to answer all of those questions in one segment!

00:24:51,746 --> 00:24:54,846
SPEAKER_1:  Like what would be good for you? What are your weaknesses and all that?

00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:57,406
SPEAKER_0:  So initially, when I started grappling, I had...

00:24:57,666 --> 00:25:03,454
SPEAKER_0:  and innate ability to just get to opponents back. So I was like, all right, I'm good at getting to the back. Let me get.

00:25:03,906 --> 00:25:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  Let me perfect controlling the back and then submitting opponent via reneged choke.

00:25:08,162 --> 00:25:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and then besides that, I really focused on leg lock defense. And then eventually came the Roddy lock pass where, you know, I'm, uh, I'm really good at body lock passing my opponents now. And then, and, um, yeah, it just takes a quite a long time because you have to find, uh, different sequences and then there's always these, uh, an abundance of opportunities that your opponent gets from these specific sequences. So.

00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:29,054
SPEAKER_0:  Take care.

00:25:31,426 --> 00:25:35,422
SPEAKER_1:  Is there part of you that finds the fact that DGS split up heartbreaking?

00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:25:37,218 --> 00:25:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  I definitely...

00:25:38,594 --> 00:25:43,518
SPEAKER_0:  You know, having one person to go to that runs practice every day that's, you know, consistent.

00:25:43,874 --> 00:25:53,205
SPEAKER_0:  Um, it was definitely, it was definitely, definitely a gift, but now I've also gifted with many, many other partners have Nikki Ryan, um, you know, Craig Jonesy.

00:25:53,205 --> 00:25:56,830
SPEAKER_1:  You're RIGHT.

00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:57,758
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:25:58,082 --> 00:26:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  We have Ethan Crellison, Damian Anderson, so a full team of knowledgeable athletes that I can continue to go to with multiple questions. But yeah, definitely, definitely it took me some time to adjust to training or to learning from you know, snogging

00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,558
SPEAKER_0:  Specifically my team and not just one person

00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:22,142
SPEAKER_1:  We should mention for people just listening, because you can't visually see that Nicky Ryan is currently terrified.

00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,350
SPEAKER_1:  And Craig Jones's.

00:26:24,578 --> 00:26:31,742
SPEAKER_1:  currently enjoying the fact that they characterized it. But anyway, can you talk about your, Nikki, can you talk about your time with DDS?

00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:45,054
SPEAKER_1:  I started training when I was like around 13. You know, my brother Gordon had started prior to me and I really just went into training just as like a means to exercise and lose weight at the beginning because I was pretty fat as a kid.

00:26:45,634 --> 00:26:51,358
SPEAKER_1:  So I went to the first class, loved it, and then just started training every day at Gary Shimm Brunswick.

00:26:52,066 --> 00:26:54,654
SPEAKER_1:  And then during the summer when I'd get off from school.

00:26:55,202 --> 00:26:57,822
SPEAKER_1:  they would take me up to New York to train under John.

00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:07,230
SPEAKER_1:  And you know, I just absolutely loved it. I knew what I wanted to do with my life at a young age. So I ended up dropping out of school actually after my freshman year in high school.

00:27:07,554 --> 00:27:14,302
SPEAKER_1:  So yeah, 15 I ended up dropping out and just pursuing Jiu-Jitsu full-time, you know, training every day up in the Blue Basement.

00:27:14,594 --> 00:27:16,350
SPEAKER_1:  Like what aspect of the jet too was this?

00:27:16,834 --> 00:27:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  Um, made you-

00:27:18,082 --> 00:27:19,838
SPEAKER_1:  know that this is the thing for you.

00:27:20,226 --> 00:27:30,206
SPEAKER_1:  It was just something I just enjoyed being, you know, like on the mats every day. I love that there's, you know, a problem solving aspect to it. Um, so it's, you know, it's mentally challenging. It's physically challenging.

00:27:30,498 --> 00:27:33,950
SPEAKER_1:  me get in shape so I just yeah right off the bat I knew I loved it.

00:27:34,914 --> 00:27:37,502
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so then we'll go to the jungle.

00:27:37,762 --> 00:27:42,142
SPEAKER_1:  what happened in the jungle. And in general, like, uh,

00:27:43,074 --> 00:27:48,542
SPEAKER_1:  I like this. I like this. This is like this like shroud of mystery.

00:27:48,802 --> 00:27:57,182
SPEAKER_1:  that she'll never be penetrated. That she'll never be like. We've got a book deal, it's coming. A book deal? Obviously left high school, he's not riding it.

00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,614
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

00:28:00,034 --> 00:28:06,174
SPEAKER_1:  I'll do the Russian translation. Okay. So what are.

00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:09,822
SPEAKER_1:  What are things that you enjoy that you remember from work on John Donahue?

00:28:10,274 --> 00:28:15,102
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean, you know, obviously he's considered one of the best coaches in the world.

00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:42,206
SPEAKER_1:  you know, very charismatic guy when you see him in person. You know, I pretty much was, you know, kind of raised in the DDS, you know, that's where I spent the majority of my time every day. So I obviously had very deep connections, you know, with John, my brother, Gary, you know, even Eddie Cummings and stuff back then. So obviously I miss interacting with those guys every day. And, you know, it's like they said, it's good to have somebody to kind of crack the whip at you every day. And John was very good at that.

00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  When you're like younger in your teenage years, you can kinda...

00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:48,254
SPEAKER_1:  You have to get humbled, right? There's like a process to that.

00:28:48,578 --> 00:28:53,790
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, for sure. And uh, it's a pretty good room to get humbled in. I guess. Yeah, exactly. I mean I was uh,

00:28:54,210 --> 00:29:07,070
SPEAKER_1:  I started training with them just when like everybody started to break out. Gary was like the biggest name at the time, uh, just cause he had one ADCC trials already. And, uh, he had a crazy match with Kron at a Kron Gracie at a ADCC.

00:29:07,426 --> 00:29:15,230
SPEAKER_1:  But Eddie was just starting to break out. Gordon just started winning EBI. So I started training under John, you know, right when everything was exploding.

00:29:16,194 --> 00:29:17,726
SPEAKER_1:  What are the good things?

00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:20,350
SPEAKER_1:  about life, about Jiu-Jitsu, you learn from your brother.

00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:26,174
SPEAKER_1:  Both me and my brother never really wanted to, you know, work a full-time job doing something that we hate.

00:29:26,434 --> 00:29:30,558
SPEAKER_1:  And he was always, you know, a very confident person. So he just went, you know.

00:29:31,106 --> 00:29:33,310
SPEAKER_1:  fully started pursuing Jiu-Jitsu.

00:29:33,602 --> 00:29:43,134
SPEAKER_1:  So I'm very happy that you know he did that and I ended up following in his footsteps because you can ask these guys I'm a lazy sack of shit out of outside of the the mat

00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,110
SPEAKER_1:  So that's definitely one thing that...

00:29:46,338 --> 00:29:47,486
SPEAKER_1:  I'm very grateful for.

00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:57,854
SPEAKER_1:  that he paved the way, like you can make money doing the stuff you love. Yeah, exactly, and he was a big reason, you know, why my parents eventually let me drop out of school because, you know, one...

00:29:58,114 --> 00:30:02,590
SPEAKER_1:  When they were coming up, there was no money in the sport. It was very hard to make a full living.

00:30:02,818 --> 00:30:03,646
SPEAKER_1:  Like if you wanted.

00:30:03,874 --> 00:30:06,590
SPEAKER_1:  to actually make a living, you'd eventually have to transfer to MMA.

00:30:07,074 --> 00:30:13,822
SPEAKER_1:  And I feel like Gordon and Gary and those guys were, you know, some of the first people to make a very good living off of just jiu-jitsu.

00:30:14,466 --> 00:30:16,766
SPEAKER_1:  At this party you find it heartbreaking.

00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,102
SPEAKER_1:  that you've split up.

00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:23,838
SPEAKER_1:  from GDS, but also from your brother in terms of spending time in the mat every day.

00:30:24,226 --> 00:30:35,550
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, for sure. You know, I mean growing up, you know, obviously he's my big brother I looked up to him a lot. So I definitely like I said, I'm misinteracting with those guys I was pretty much raised, you know in that blue basement, you know that

00:30:36,098 --> 00:30:38,046
SPEAKER_1:  John was like, you know, a father figure to me.

00:30:38,274 --> 00:30:38,782
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,918
SPEAKER_1:  So I definitely miss seeing those guys every day.

00:30:42,722 --> 00:30:46,270
SPEAKER_1:  Do you have animosity towards Gordon and does he have animosity toward you?

00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:49,022
SPEAKER_1:  And what is the source of that?

00:30:49,762 --> 00:30:52,254
SPEAKER_1:  and do you think you'll ever be able to forgive each other?

00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,486
SPEAKER_1:  Definitely initially during the

00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:56,158
SPEAKER_1:  dead.

00:30:56,578 --> 00:30:59,998
SPEAKER_1:  Initial split we definitely hated each other at the beginning

00:31:00,354 --> 00:31:08,318
SPEAKER_1:  Um, but it's definitely started to, uh, to calm down actually just prior to, you know, all this social media drama that's going on currently.

00:31:08,706 --> 00:31:16,382
SPEAKER_1:  He had reached out to me and that was literally like the first time that we have actually talked since spirit.

00:31:16,802 --> 00:31:20,990
SPEAKER_1:  since the split happened. So we didn't talk to each other for, what is it now, like almost two years?

00:31:21,762 --> 00:31:26,206
SPEAKER_1:  And that was the first time that we interacted again.

00:31:26,722 --> 00:31:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  Overall, you know, he wasn't, you know, aggressive towards me. I wasn't aggressive towards him. You were cracking some jokes. So.

00:31:32,898 --> 00:31:35,390
SPEAKER_1:  Hopefully the animosity is going down.

00:31:36,578 --> 00:31:38,238
SPEAKER_1:  There's this Godfather quote.

00:31:39,234 --> 00:31:42,302
SPEAKER_1:  That wrote down. I recently rewatched it.

00:31:42,914 --> 00:31:46,302
SPEAKER_1:  from the Don, from Don Corleone, Vito Corleone.

00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:52,830
SPEAKER_1:  The strength of a family, like the strength of an army, lies in its loyalty to each other. Is there some aspect of...

00:31:53,058 --> 00:31:54,206
SPEAKER_1:  family that you miss.

00:31:54,594 --> 00:31:56,574
SPEAKER_1:  of the blood that kind of connects you.

00:31:56,866 --> 00:31:57,790
SPEAKER_1:  They can count on.

00:31:58,178 --> 00:32:02,846
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, my parents, you know, they both raised us that, you know, like family is everything. You never, you know

00:32:03,394 --> 00:32:05,118
SPEAKER_1:  betray your family or anything like that.

00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:08,510
SPEAKER_1:  So I definitely, you know, miss him from time to time.

00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:11,518
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, imagine you're like 40 years from now.

00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:14,334
SPEAKER_1:  sitting on a porch with a shotgun.

00:32:14,626 --> 00:32:15,582
SPEAKER_1:  drink your whiskey.

00:32:16,162 --> 00:32:18,846
SPEAKER_1:  looking over like all the land you've conquered.

00:32:20,034 --> 00:32:23,678
SPEAKER_1:  uh... looking back to this moment is the reason you split up a bullshit reason

00:32:24,354 --> 00:32:28,702
SPEAKER_1:  Is it a good reason from the perspective of the king who has now conquered the lands?

00:32:28,962 --> 00:32:30,878
SPEAKER_1:  have proven themselves have done everything.

00:32:31,426 --> 00:32:36,798
SPEAKER_1:  I think it was definitely like a justifiable reason for the team splitting. Like it just...

00:32:37,026 --> 00:32:48,926
SPEAKER_1:  with the way things were going, it just was not going to work with, you know, all of us in the same room together. It started, you know, affecting training, people didn't feel comfortable in things. So I definitely think that it was a justifiable reason to split.

00:32:49,922 --> 00:32:52,222
SPEAKER_1:  The things that happen in the jungle.

00:32:52,706 --> 00:32:53,758
SPEAKER_1:  to be told about in the.

00:32:54,466 --> 00:32:58,974
SPEAKER_1:  Is it gonna be an audio book or is it just gonna be, who's gonna voice it?

00:32:59,330 --> 00:32:59,998
SPEAKER_1:  Might be a play.

00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:03,550
SPEAKER_1:  A musical? Yeah, a musical. Broadway.

00:33:04,226 --> 00:33:04,862
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:33:05,314 --> 00:33:11,102
SPEAKER_1:  How's your singing voice? Mine's not so good, but Nikki has a beautiful voice. Does he? Of an angel? That girl had bat.

00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,958
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:20,094
SPEAKER_1:  Speaking of the social media drama, I should mention that I've talked recently to Gordon a bunch.

00:33:21,026 --> 00:33:22,878
SPEAKER_1:  I've talked about talking to you guys.

00:33:23,394 --> 00:33:27,486
SPEAKER_1:  and he's had nothing but really nice things to say about you, Nicky Ryan.

00:33:28,002 --> 00:33:30,174
SPEAKER_1:  and he has had nothing but bad things.

00:33:30,882 --> 00:33:36,702
SPEAKER_1:  What was some of the things?

00:33:37,378 --> 00:33:47,006
SPEAKER_1:  Well, let's just go to the social media first. Because the social media stuff that he said publicly is just like a warm up. It's like...

00:33:47,394 --> 00:33:48,606
SPEAKER_1:  uh... for play yes

00:33:49,122 --> 00:33:50,430
SPEAKER_1:  So Gordon sent...

00:33:51,234 --> 00:33:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  You, Nekuad.

00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,686
SPEAKER_1:  Flowers for Valentine's Day.

00:33:55,042 --> 00:33:56,574
SPEAKER_1:  posting on Instagram, quote.

00:33:56,834 --> 00:34:02,078
SPEAKER_1:  I've been fucking him in every round in competition since we met in 2018.

00:34:02,562 --> 00:34:04,510
SPEAKER_1:  The least I can do is buy him flowers.

00:34:05,666 --> 00:34:12,702
SPEAKER_1:  We didn't get the flowers. No, that was the question. Did you get the flowers? You never got the flowers. He sent it to the wrong address.

00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  He did?

00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:15,358
SPEAKER_1:  Where do you think he sent it?

00:34:15,778 --> 00:34:19,903
SPEAKER_1:  It was close, but it was wrong. Did you appreciate the romantic gesture?

00:34:19,903 --> 00:34:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  I did, I was looking forward to the flowers and-

00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  potentially chocolates in there.

00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,630
SPEAKER_0:  But you know, it was a bit of a let down.

00:34:25,954 --> 00:34:29,502
SPEAKER_1:  Can you describe your recent match against Gordon, the EBR match?

00:34:29,826 --> 00:34:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  Okay so EBI match on UFC Fight Pals was a 20 minute match.

00:34:34,786 --> 00:34:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  And immediately...

00:34:37,346 --> 00:34:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  No match starts, I pull guard.

00:34:39,522 --> 00:34:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  And then I stand up, he pulls guard.

00:34:42,018 --> 00:34:47,998
SPEAKER_0:  And we have this kind of like back and forth where he's trying to dig for underhooks, trying to get on top of me and he can't really find success.

00:34:48,482 --> 00:34:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, and out and, and then in the midst of me trying to work my body lock pass, uh, Gordon's able to under hook a leg and we end up in a.

00:34:55,874 --> 00:34:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  Like entanglement?

00:34:57,154 --> 00:35:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  And then I'm able to transfer that leg entanglement to a 50-50 position, still in the leg entanglement.

00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:11,678
SPEAKER_0:  From that 50-50 position, I'm able to separate his feet and actually get a few pops. And he actually said I broke his foot in that exchange.

00:35:11,938 --> 00:35:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  With a toehold. A toehold, yep. And after that, we had a.

00:35:17,634 --> 00:35:24,254
SPEAKER_0:  A bit more, I was just being working on top position, trying to get my body locked. Time runs out and we go to overtime.

00:35:24,546 --> 00:35:25,671
SPEAKER_0:  And overtime,

00:35:25,671 --> 00:35:29,278
SPEAKER_1:  Hold on a second, actually, what does it mean to break a leg? I was very confused about-

00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:35,166
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so is this like a expression or what do you mean? What when you broke it? What which part breaks in a toll?

00:35:35,394 --> 00:35:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, so on a toehold, there's a few different grades of it. Like you could get a few pops and have some walking issues.

00:35:43,778 --> 00:35:48,926
SPEAKER_0:  And people consider that break and then you could break it fully and have your foot be like a limp noodle

00:35:49,186 --> 00:35:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I think what goes at Achilles?

00:35:51,202 --> 00:35:52,327
SPEAKER_0:  We'll get to the front of the Achilles.

00:35:52,327 --> 00:36:01,246
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, probably the ligaments. I mean, it's funny, like, a lot of people say they broke something, but like to me, you break bones, you tear ligaments. So I would imagine you probably had a...

00:36:01,602 --> 00:36:02,398
SPEAKER_1:  Grade 3 tear.

00:36:03,522 --> 00:36:03,934
SPEAKER_1:  Grade three.

00:36:04,514 --> 00:36:07,038
SPEAKER_1:  How hard do you think is it to, I always wondered that with, um,

00:36:07,586 --> 00:36:12,350
SPEAKER_1:  with like a straight foot lock, how hard is it to break the shin? or like the actual bones versus the teres though?

00:36:12,674 --> 00:36:13,694
SPEAKER_1:  Depends how many steroids there are.

00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,510
SPEAKER_1:  and obviously how much you're on.

00:36:17,154 --> 00:36:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  You're one of the few guys that have actually broken bones in competition.

00:36:20,706 --> 00:36:22,334
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, yeah, have I?

00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:23,902
SPEAKER_1:  Oh yeah, a video? BYE

00:36:24,258 --> 00:36:25,630
SPEAKER_1:  Which bone did you break?

00:36:26,658 --> 00:36:28,382
SPEAKER_1:  Spiral fracture of the fibula.

00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:36,830
SPEAKER_1:  Very specific. A lot of power. Is it like a twist thing? How did you break it? Oh, it was a heel hook. Benny always used to say heel hooks.

00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,430
SPEAKER_1:  Leg locks don't work.

00:36:39,138 --> 00:36:39,998
SPEAKER_1:  But unfortunately...

00:36:40,386 --> 00:36:41,790
SPEAKER_1:  Age gets the best of all of us.

00:36:42,402 --> 00:36:44,126
SPEAKER_1:  I think he had some mileage on those ligaments.

00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:47,998
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. And the bone, I guess. So it's actually what the bone.

00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:53,054
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, his ankle like disconnected from the tibia and the fibula, but the fibula definitely.

00:36:53,506 --> 00:36:55,710
SPEAKER_1:  Snaps pretty bad though. I fell off. N constipation?

00:36:56,738 --> 00:37:00,519
SPEAKER_1:  the dynamics of that. Okay, anyway, it went over time. What happened in overtime? Okay.

00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:03,102
SPEAKER_0:  We're having overtime. Let's see.

00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  trying to hang, oh, okay, I go defense first. whistle blows, I'm able to escape in like 17 seconds.

00:37:10,722 --> 00:37:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  And then immediately after I go on his back and.

00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:18,142
SPEAKER_0:  he gets out in exactly 17 seconds. I'm like, shit, all right, I thought I had a good start.

00:37:18,498 --> 00:37:19,582
SPEAKER_0:  And then...

00:37:19,842 --> 00:37:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  He gets on my back right after that, and he's able to ride me out for pretty much the entire round.

00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  After that, I go back on his back, he escapes in maybe like a minute and some change.

00:37:31,906 --> 00:37:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  I think where I went wrong in the overtime is I should have been less adamant about chasing the submission and more aware of collecting time.

00:37:40,802 --> 00:37:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  I kind of diverted my attention towards acquiring, you know.

00:37:44,674 --> 00:37:53,182
SPEAKER_0:  time on the clock it would have been more my favor. But yeah, at the end of my overtime round, I'm able to lock up a renegade choke over the face.

00:37:53,506 --> 00:37:59,742
SPEAKER_0:  but there just wasn't enough time to fully finish. You know, I got a few seconds of squeeze in there. I didn't have enough time to adjust and f***.

00:38:00,482 --> 00:38:01,607
SPEAKER_0:  God, oh, dude.

00:38:01,607 --> 00:38:03,966
SPEAKER_1:  think if you're on steroids, you would have finished the joke.

00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, for sure, for sure. That's what I thought too. If you're on gear, you're changing the biology of your body. You're adjusting your DNA.

00:38:13,602 --> 00:38:15,998
SPEAKER_0:  for sure if I adjust in my DNA, I mean.

00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:19,587
SPEAKER_1:  It's a finish. You're implying you're a natural athlete, is what you're saying.

00:38:19,587 --> 00:38:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, I'm definitely a natural athlete, yeah.

00:38:22,114 --> 00:38:22,942
SPEAKER_0:  Have immigration.

00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:26,462
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:32,798
SPEAKER_1:  So for people who don't know that the EBI rules, it's an interesting rule structure where the overtime you put

00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:38,750
SPEAKER_1:  yourself in the worst possible position and the task is to escape and the other person gets the same thing

00:38:39,298 --> 00:38:41,150
SPEAKER_1:  What do you guys think about that rule set?

00:38:41,826 --> 00:38:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  I like it just because...

00:38:44,994 --> 00:39:02,558
SPEAKER_0:  First of all, I don't like the idea of having to put somebody on my back, but I do like the definitive answer in the match. Either you escaped in time or you got ridden out. So you get to define a winner, that's great. I'd much rather have that than a close decision.

00:39:03,746 --> 00:39:04,254
SPEAKER_1:  or why you.

00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:11,454
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, honestly, there's all the different rules. When I look at the rule sets, I just try to think of what rules that I could beat that individual in.

00:39:11,714 --> 00:39:13,662
SPEAKER_1:  and I sort of gear myself towards that.

00:39:14,722 --> 00:39:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  That's really the strategy there. I think there's some guys that like, uh,

00:39:18,402 --> 00:39:19,262
SPEAKER_1:  that stole a lot.

00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:23,102
SPEAKER_1:  that you would love to have EBI overtime with at the end, you know, they're stalling until...

00:39:23,426 --> 00:39:24,734
SPEAKER_1:  They have to give us a good position.

00:39:25,314 --> 00:39:29,726
SPEAKER_1:  But then there's some guys that are so good in those positions. I'm like, oh, maybe we just do a regular match, you know?

00:39:30,146 --> 00:39:33,438
SPEAKER_1:  What are the rules in the streets? No time limit.

00:39:34,178 --> 00:39:34,494
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:39:34,978 --> 00:39:35,646
SPEAKER_1:  That's one of it.

00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:36,606
SPEAKER_1:  There's also like

00:39:36,866 --> 00:39:38,910
SPEAKER_1:  concrete and cars and stuff. They have lots of things to

00:39:39,554 --> 00:39:40,222
SPEAKER_1:  Biting, yeah.

00:39:40,706 --> 00:39:41,086
SPEAKER_1:  talking.

00:39:43,394 --> 00:39:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so you don't like that rule set?

00:39:45,474 --> 00:39:48,382
SPEAKER_1:  Are there some people you would prefer in the street as a rule set?

00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,750
SPEAKER_1:  Me? Probably not.

00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,542
SPEAKER_1:  Hahahaha

00:39:52,962 --> 00:39:58,078
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know the EBI. I mean, it's tricky, you know, it depends on the opponent, which rules that I'd want to do.

00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:10,046
SPEAKER_1:  What about you, Nicker? What do you think about the ruleset of EBI? Yes, I think EBI is very good from a spectator point of view. You know, people find it very entertaining to watch, you know, because you're...

00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:18,494
SPEAKER_1:  people want to see submissions and you're putting people, you're putting the athletes in a position where, you have like the highest percentage submission in the sport.

00:40:18,722 --> 00:40:20,862
SPEAKER_1:  So obviously you're gonna get a lot of submissions.

00:40:21,698 --> 00:40:28,190
SPEAKER_1:  My issue with it is it is a rule set that allows somebody that's overall worse at jiu-jitsu to win a match

00:40:28,514 --> 00:40:38,782
SPEAKER_1:  A guy can go out there and just stall and just get completely dominated for the entirety of regulation and then he gets to start on the guy's back. So that's my one issue with it.

00:40:39,042 --> 00:40:39,710
SPEAKER_1:  but also...

00:40:40,002 --> 00:40:41,598
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, it's interesting to see.

00:40:42,754 --> 00:40:46,078
SPEAKER_1:  Like the best people in the world have to be put in a really bad position.

00:40:46,434 --> 00:40:49,854
SPEAKER_1:  and to see how good their escapes are, for example. Yeah.

00:40:50,178 --> 00:40:56,094
SPEAKER_1:  But it doesn't feel like a realistic, it's a fun thing to watch but it doesn't feel like

00:40:57,186 --> 00:40:58,238
SPEAKER_1:  The real fight.

00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,062
SPEAKER_1:  It feels weird.

00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:08,446
SPEAKER_1:  I'll claim it. If I start an overtime on someone and finish them, I'll claim it. But if they submit me an overtime, I'm like, I asked them. You're good to know. Yeah. It's not a real submission. It's good.

00:41:08,898 --> 00:41:10,023
SPEAKER_1:  If you have a good one, stay well.

00:41:10,023 --> 00:41:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  The issue is people stalling to just win overtime. You got this guy that his whole training camp is just

00:41:15,426 --> 00:41:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  not get subbed and win overtime.

00:41:17,954 --> 00:41:18,462
SPEAKER_0:  It's a bit boring.

00:41:19,586 --> 00:41:22,238
SPEAKER_1:  By the way, I have a rose behind you.

00:41:22,498 --> 00:41:27,587
SPEAKER_1:  Somebody gave me a Valentine's flower. So if you miss the one from Gordon, I got one for you.

00:41:27,587 --> 00:41:28,337
SPEAKER_0:  Appreciate that.

00:41:28,337 --> 00:41:32,862
SPEAKER_1:  It's good to feel loved. Yeah. All right. Um,

00:41:33,122 --> 00:41:34,014
SPEAKER_1:  Funny Facts

00:41:34,754 --> 00:41:40,542
SPEAKER_1:  So what did you learn from that match? Like takeaways, technically speaking, like what do you need to work on?

00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I learned that I am pretty good.

00:41:43,778 --> 00:41:45,694
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I would.

00:41:45,794 --> 00:42:00,990
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, pretty good. I got a few, I know exactly what my weakness is. It's the leg lock department and I'm doing a lot to get better in that specific aspect. Attack and defense? I would say yeah, attack, defense, reattacks.

00:42:01,282 --> 00:42:05,886
SPEAKER_0:  Um, even if I wanted to offensively enter a leg, you know, I could use some work there as well.

00:42:06,178 --> 00:42:08,990
SPEAKER_0:  But I feel like once I solidify like

00:42:09,282 --> 00:42:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  my like if I come up become a black belt specifically in the leg lock department, I feel like I'd be unstoppable.

00:42:16,258 --> 00:42:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  If you...

00:42:17,954 --> 00:42:21,406
SPEAKER_1:  Nicky Rod definitively beat Gordon Ryan. How'd you do it?

00:42:22,242 --> 00:42:22,686
SPEAKER_1:  Buggy check.

00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:24,990
SPEAKER_1:  Puggy choke. Puggy choke.

00:42:25,282 --> 00:42:26,302
SPEAKER_1:  The listener

00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:33,182
SPEAKER_1:  I don't even know how to describe Bucky choke. What's the definitive conclusion on that choke?

00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:35,774
SPEAKER_1:  Does it work? It's a choke.

00:42:36,258 --> 00:42:38,270
SPEAKER_1:  that you do when you're in a...

00:42:38,882 --> 00:42:42,622
SPEAKER_1:  uh... what's the opposite of dominance not submissive and not on the position

00:42:42,946 --> 00:42:43,966
SPEAKER_1:  bottom of sight control.

00:42:44,482 --> 00:42:47,006
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, just an embarrassing submission to get caught with, really.

00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:48,702
SPEAKER_1:  But does it work?

00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:50,206
SPEAKER_1:  It works on...

00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:59,038
SPEAKER_1:  certain people. For the listener, he glassed over a Niki. It's embarrassing, but it's also what is a way to frustrate the opponent.

00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:03,806
SPEAKER_1:  For sure. Yeah. It's a new part of the spot. I feel like the Rotolo has brought it back into fashion and

00:43:04,098 --> 00:43:05,470
SPEAKER_1:  Even if you don't get it.

00:43:05,826 --> 00:43:07,614
SPEAKER_1:  because it's one of those movies that's so embarrassing.

00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,598
SPEAKER_1:  at the first sign of danger.
