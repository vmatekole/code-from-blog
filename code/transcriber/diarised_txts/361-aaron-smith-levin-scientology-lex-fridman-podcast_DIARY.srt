00:00:00,098 --> 00:00:02,206
SPEAKER_1:  if Scientology was just.

00:00:03,234 --> 00:00:03,966
SPEAKER_1:  Getting auditing.

00:00:05,218 --> 00:00:06,078
SPEAKER_1:  when you want it.

00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,246
SPEAKER_1:  about the subjects you wanted.

00:00:09,826 --> 00:00:10,814
SPEAKER_1:  and you could take it or leave it.

00:00:11,362 --> 00:00:11,966
SPEAKER_1:  That would be fine.

00:00:12,866 --> 00:00:13,278
SPEAKER_1:  It's.

00:00:13,602 --> 00:00:18,238
SPEAKER_1:  It's the fact that it's part and parcel to this entire organization and this entire experience.

00:00:19,138 --> 00:00:19,838
SPEAKER_1:  that.

00:00:20,546 --> 00:00:21,246
SPEAKER_1:  has.

00:00:21,794 --> 00:00:28,382
SPEAKER_1:  as a part of that experience, taking everything from you, demanding everything from you, controlling who you can speak with.

00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,990
SPEAKER_1:  controlling who you can have relationships with, who you have to erase from your life.

00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:35,070
SPEAKER_1:  This is where, and it's hard to, it's hard to-

00:00:35,362 --> 00:00:36,190
SPEAKER_1:  place one.

00:00:36,642 --> 00:00:40,350
SPEAKER_1:  pinpoint on this is where Scientology goes wrong. It's really hard to do that.

00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:43,518
SPEAKER_1:  because the good parts of Scientology and the bad parts of Scientology

00:00:44,258 --> 00:00:45,406
SPEAKER_1:  are all just Scientology.

00:00:48,098 --> 00:00:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  Following is a conversation with Aaron Smith, 11.

00:00:50,722 --> 00:00:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  a former Scientologist raised in Scientology and have worked in organization full time.

00:00:56,162 --> 00:00:56,958
SPEAKER_0:  for many years.

00:00:57,218 --> 00:00:58,206
SPEAKER_0:  as a staff member.

00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:03,486
SPEAKER_0:  and a C-ORG member, including the job of training Scientology auditors.

00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  Today he educates the public about Scientology on his YouTube channel.

00:01:08,546 --> 00:01:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  growing up in Scientology.

00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:12,766
SPEAKER_0:  This is the Lex Freedman Podcast.

00:01:13,026 --> 00:01:13,630

00:01:16,194 --> 00:01:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  And now...

00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  Dear friends,

00:01:18,018 --> 00:01:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  Here's Aaron Smith Levin.

00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:27,486
SPEAKER_0:  Let's do a full overview of Scientology, its ideas, how it operates, how it wields its power and influence.

00:01:27,874 --> 00:01:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  And let's start at the very basics. What is Scientology?

00:01:31,074 --> 00:01:33,726
SPEAKER_1:  Scientology is a belief system.

00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:35,422
SPEAKER_1:  Created by L. Ron Hubbard.

00:01:36,354 --> 00:01:37,470
SPEAKER_1:  that does.

00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,878
SPEAKER_1:  Fundamentally.

00:01:39,202 --> 00:01:41,118
SPEAKER_1:  believe that we are all immortal spiritual beings.

00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:42,622
SPEAKER_1:  called Thetans.

00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:44,542
SPEAKER_1:  that we have.

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,942
SPEAKER_1:  Native godlike.

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,062
SPEAKER_1:  potential.

00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  that there is nothing more powerful in the universe than a theta.

00:01:52,418 --> 00:01:54,302
SPEAKER_1:  So Godlike is quite literal here.

00:01:55,586 --> 00:01:56,190
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:01:56,514 --> 00:01:57,918
SPEAKER_1:  that through various

00:01:58,594 --> 00:02:03,902
SPEAKER_1:  decisions that they have made. They have fallen away from their native godlike power.

00:02:04,962 --> 00:02:05,470
SPEAKER_1:  too.

00:02:05,762 --> 00:02:07,486
SPEAKER_1:  falling down to a state.

00:02:07,842 --> 00:02:11,870
SPEAKER_1:  where most they ends on even where that they are they can sign even where that they ever.

00:02:12,418 --> 00:02:13,918
SPEAKER_1:  have lived before.

00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:15,550
SPEAKER_1:  or have these powers.

00:02:15,938 --> 00:02:18,942
SPEAKER_1:  and that things are now in a state where they're trapped in bodies.

00:02:19,234 --> 00:02:20,126
SPEAKER_1:  trapped here on Earth.

00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:24,478
SPEAKER_1:  trapped in this prison of a physical universe, trapped on this prison of a planet.

00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,758
SPEAKER_1:  and that only Scientology can restore a thing to its.

00:02:30,114 --> 00:02:31,422
SPEAKER_1:  Native State.

00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,686
SPEAKER_0:  Are these multiple beings? Like is there one Thetan?

00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  inside of me that's trapped in this prison.

00:02:38,018 --> 00:02:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  Well, the thing would be you.

00:02:40,322 --> 00:02:42,654
SPEAKER_1:  The thing would be me. The Thetan is you.

00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  presumably limited in some fundamental way. So this statement that is me is limited. So there's like.

00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  8 billion.

00:02:50,786 --> 00:02:51,614
SPEAKER_0:  Satan's on the planet.

00:02:52,834 --> 00:02:55,294
SPEAKER_1:  There's one primary thing in animating each body.

00:02:56,258 --> 00:03:01,534
SPEAKER_1:  Later in Scientology, you learn there's actually like tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of like

00:03:01,794 --> 00:03:02,366
SPEAKER_1:  Sick.

00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,022
SPEAKER_1:  unconscious, half dead.

00:03:05,314 --> 00:03:09,950
SPEAKER_1:  they've been stuck to you that are now an additional cause of problems for you.

00:03:10,402 --> 00:03:12,638
SPEAKER_1:  But fundamentally at the lower levels

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,254
SPEAKER_1:  the non-confidential levels. There's just one Thetan per body.

00:03:17,474 --> 00:03:20,862
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's an interesting idea. I just would like to kind of explore.

00:03:22,018 --> 00:03:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  the philosophy of that. So there's a being that's all powerful, that's immortal.

00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:27,678
SPEAKER_0:  and it's.

00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:30,206
SPEAKER_0:  projectionist manifestation on this earth is

00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:32,126
SPEAKER_0:  Fundamentally Limited.

00:03:32,802 --> 00:03:33,534
SPEAKER_0:  and you're trying to.

00:03:33,986 --> 00:03:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  the process of Scientology.

00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  is the process of letting go of those limitations.

00:03:39,842 --> 00:03:44,286
SPEAKER_0:  you know that's an interesting idea i mean a lot of religions have this kind of idea that there's a

00:03:44,962 --> 00:03:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  not just religion, but like we have the capacity.

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,822
SPEAKER_0:  as human beings to do.

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  to achieve greatness in all kinds of ways.

00:03:52,546 --> 00:03:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  And that's the question we have with our cognitive abilities. We start with an embryo and build up into this organism.

00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,758
SPEAKER_0:  and like this world of opportunities before us, what are we capable of?

00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  And the idea that we're capable of almost anything is a really powerful one. And there's a lot of

00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,278
SPEAKER_0:  religions there's a lot of philosophies there's a lot of

00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  Advice.

00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:11,614
SPEAKER_0:  of hope.

00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  that kind of explore those ideas. And so.

00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  It seems like with Scientology, the application of this religious philosophy means...

00:04:19,522 --> 00:04:20,862
SPEAKER_0:  that there's, we're limited.

00:04:21,474 --> 00:04:25,534
SPEAKER_0:  and we have to break through those limitations. And there's a process to break through those limitations.

00:04:25,858 --> 00:04:26,590
SPEAKER_1:  That would be correct.

00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,694
SPEAKER_1:  So what can make it challenging to.

00:04:30,658 --> 00:04:32,798
SPEAKER_1:  adequately and completely.

00:04:33,346 --> 00:04:37,854
SPEAKER_1:  described Scientology in the beginning is what Scientologists believe actually changes.

00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:39,646
SPEAKER_1:  as they progress.

00:04:40,258 --> 00:04:41,726
SPEAKER_1:  further into or further up.

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,166
SPEAKER_1:  in Scientology.

00:04:43,874 --> 00:04:44,350
SPEAKER_1:  So.

00:04:44,642 --> 00:04:48,894
SPEAKER_1:  The explanation is I've given is pretty consistent with what you would get at the lowest levels.

00:04:49,186 --> 00:04:51,358
SPEAKER_1:  Right. You're a Thetan. I'm a Thetan.

00:04:51,618 --> 00:04:52,702
SPEAKER_1:  Everyone's a Thetan.

00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:54,526
SPEAKER_1:  and we have...

00:04:55,074 --> 00:04:56,478
SPEAKER_1:  A reactive mind.

00:04:57,346 --> 00:04:58,142
SPEAKER_1:  I'll run Hubbard Wood.

00:04:58,818 --> 00:05:00,350
SPEAKER_1:  say the reactive mind is a collection.

00:05:00,898 --> 00:05:02,526
SPEAKER_1:  of these recordings.

00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:05,918
SPEAKER_1:  mental recordings of any moments of pain and unconsciousness.

00:05:06,178 --> 00:05:08,734
SPEAKER_1:  you've ever had in your life. It's like the subconscious.

00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:09,502
SPEAKER_1:  Mind.

00:05:10,498 --> 00:05:14,814
SPEAKER_1:  It's always recording in moments of pain and unconsciousness.

00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:18,590
SPEAKER_1:  and that these recordings are called, I'll run Hubbard called them NGRIP.

00:05:19,426 --> 00:05:27,294
SPEAKER_1:  Now when L. Ron Hubbard first wrote Dianetics in 1950, this was before Scientology came along a couple years later, right? So in 1950 when he wrote Dianetics.

00:05:28,098 --> 00:05:29,918
SPEAKER_1:  It wasn't a spiritual.

00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,382
SPEAKER_1:  Endeavor it was supposed to be a mental

00:05:32,642 --> 00:05:34,014
SPEAKER_1:  a science of mental health.

00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:35,454
SPEAKER_1:  So.

00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,566
SPEAKER_1:  As of that time, the earliest engram you could have was the incident of birth.

00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:42,878
SPEAKER_1:  being born.

00:05:43,522 --> 00:05:44,286
SPEAKER_1:  was an engram.

00:05:45,282 --> 00:05:50,206
SPEAKER_1:  And technically in Dianetics, they said you could have prenatal engrams, like when you're still in the womb.

00:05:50,914 --> 00:05:52,830
SPEAKER_1:  but there was no concept of past lives.

00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,486
SPEAKER_1:  as of 1950 version of Dianetics, right?

00:05:56,738 --> 00:05:59,198
SPEAKER_1:  And so the idea there was.

00:05:59,618 --> 00:06:00,158
SPEAKER_1:  that.

00:06:01,122 --> 00:06:04,606
SPEAKER_1:  uh... the reactive mind is essentially a stimulus response mechanism

00:06:05,474 --> 00:06:09,470
SPEAKER_1:  created through evolution millions of years ago to protect the individual from

00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:11,998
SPEAKER_1:  things that would harm them, in other words, things that would bring about pain.

00:06:12,258 --> 00:06:13,182
SPEAKER_1:  and unconsciousness.

00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,550
SPEAKER_1:  So you have these recordings of things that hurt you.

00:06:16,162 --> 00:06:19,902
SPEAKER_1:  create a pain in unconsciousness, and in present time these things will react upon you.

00:06:20,226 --> 00:06:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  in a way.

00:06:21,602 --> 00:06:22,462
SPEAKER_1:  to cause you to.

00:06:22,754 --> 00:06:24,606
SPEAKER_1:  Avoid similar things.

00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,934
SPEAKER_1:  reacting upon you in a subconscious, unconscious.

00:06:28,674 --> 00:06:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  So the ReactiMind protects you.

00:06:31,362 --> 00:06:33,918
SPEAKER_0:  from the trauma that is inside your subconscious mind.

00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:34,910
SPEAKER_1:  Yes.

00:06:35,138 --> 00:06:36,190
SPEAKER_1:  And the idea is...

00:06:36,674 --> 00:06:40,734
SPEAKER_1:  We've now as human beings evolved to a state where it no longer serves us.

00:06:41,186 --> 00:06:43,038
SPEAKER_1:  Beneficially, it only serves us negatively.

00:06:44,706 --> 00:06:45,630
SPEAKER_1:  This was Hubbard's Dairy.

00:06:46,146 --> 00:06:59,230
SPEAKER_1:  And he said, so you can get rid of these engrams by, you know, basically recalling them and going over them again and again, using Dianetics auditing therapy. And if you get back to the moment of birth and erase the earliest engram, all the other subsequent engrams on the chain.

00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,894
SPEAKER_1:  would vanish.

00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:02,631
SPEAKER_0:  Oh nice, so there's a ch-

00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:05,470
SPEAKER_1:  Early, similar, early, similar, early, similar, early, similar.

00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,750
SPEAKER_1:  So that gives you a pretty good understanding of how Elrond Hubbard thought of...

00:07:11,074 --> 00:07:11,838
SPEAKER_1:  the mind.

00:07:12,386 --> 00:07:13,502
SPEAKER_1:  because that carries on.

00:07:13,826 --> 00:07:15,646
SPEAKER_1:  has applicability later on in Scientology.

00:07:16,098 --> 00:07:16,798
SPEAKER_0:  I mean that's a pretty-

00:07:17,122 --> 00:07:19,326
SPEAKER_0:  powerful model of the mind. I mean Freud had...

00:07:19,938 --> 00:07:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  similar conceptions that a lot of our traumas.

00:07:23,394 --> 00:07:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  are grounded in

00:07:25,314 --> 00:07:25,822
SPEAKER_0:  sort of.

00:07:27,554 --> 00:07:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhh...

00:07:29,058 --> 00:07:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  Poor formulation of sexuality or imperfect formulation of sexuality in our childhood.

00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  something like this.

00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:39,981
SPEAKER_0:  And then we're trying to figure out the puzzle of whatever we formed in early childhood and similar, similar.

00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:40,766
SPEAKER_1:  It is similar.

00:07:41,154 --> 00:07:42,686
SPEAKER_1:  That's probably what Hubbard took it from.

00:07:43,234 --> 00:07:43,646
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:07:44,002 --> 00:07:47,102
SPEAKER_1:  in the early days of Dianetics before he decided psychiatry was evil.

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,566
SPEAKER_1:  He actually credited Sigmund Freud.

00:07:49,954 --> 00:07:50,270
SPEAKER_1:  with.

00:07:50,786 --> 00:07:52,542
SPEAKER_1:  some of the shoulders he was standing on.

00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,758
SPEAKER_1:  in writing Dianetics.

00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,070
SPEAKER_0:  So the.

00:07:55,554 --> 00:08:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  So he still admired psychiatry at that time. So that's an interesting moment of Dynetics. So what else? You mentioned Dynetics. Auditing was there too.

00:08:01,986 --> 00:08:07,006
SPEAKER_0:  So if we just before Scientology, what are the ideas that formed?

00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,118
SPEAKER_0:  what we know as Dynetics.

00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:14,445
SPEAKER_1:  As I've just described, that is the fundamental. That is pretty much the nuts and bolts of Dianetics.

00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:14,846
SPEAKER_0:  Ride.

00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:16,446
SPEAKER_1:  Was it applied often?

00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:25,150
SPEAKER_1:  Oh yeah, no, that's what dietetics in the early days was all about, was just auditing. Auditing is the process of the one-on-one counseling. Recall a moment of pain and unconsciousness, run through the anagram over and over and over again.

00:08:25,378 --> 00:08:27,742
SPEAKER_1:  find something earlier, Simo, that is Dianetics auditing.

00:08:28,034 --> 00:08:31,102
SPEAKER_1:  One of the main things that changed with Scientology is that birth

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,054
SPEAKER_1:  or prenatal angriams were no longer.

00:08:33,314 --> 00:08:34,718
SPEAKER_1:  the earliest angrams on the chain.

00:08:35,362 --> 00:08:39,646
SPEAKER_1:  The idea is you have to get the earliest ingram on the chain for the later ones to blow, which is a race.

00:08:40,738 --> 00:08:42,846
SPEAKER_1:  And so, but all of a sudden now...

00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:43,582
SPEAKER_1:  with.

00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:44,798
SPEAKER_1:  The, uh...

00:08:45,218 --> 00:08:47,646
SPEAKER_1:  addition of an immortal spiritual being into the equation.

00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:52,254
SPEAKER_1:  Well, now the earliest incident could be trillions of years ago in other galaxies and universes.

00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:53,703
SPEAKER_1:  other universes.

00:08:53,703 --> 00:08:55,454
SPEAKER_0:  before the end of this universe. Yes!

00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,685
SPEAKER_0:  Is there a model of physics integrated in any of this?

00:08:57,685 --> 00:08:58,110
SPEAKER_1:  No.

00:08:59,074 --> 00:09:01,662
SPEAKER_1:  The model is you have the physical universe.

00:09:02,978 --> 00:09:04,926
SPEAKER_1:  And then above that you have the theta universe.

00:09:05,218 --> 00:09:06,654
SPEAKER_1:  So we used the word thing earlier.

00:09:07,266 --> 00:09:08,958
SPEAKER_1:  So in Scientology, we'll use the word theta.

00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:14,942
SPEAKER_1:  Theta is just basically Thetan power. Thetans collectively.

00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:16,094
SPEAKER_1:  Sorry.

00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,238
SPEAKER_1:  Hubbard would say you have the theta universe.

00:09:18,498 --> 00:09:19,294
SPEAKER_1:  which is senior.

00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,110
SPEAKER_1:  to the physical universe and creates the physical universe.

00:09:22,402 --> 00:09:24,862
SPEAKER_1:  And remember, I said, I said native godlike potentials.

00:09:25,474 --> 00:09:27,518
SPEAKER_1:  So we're not talking about the God who created the earth.

00:09:27,874 --> 00:09:30,942
SPEAKER_1:  We're just like, scientists don't believe in a God, but we'll get into that later.

00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:39,934
SPEAKER_1:  We're talking about just creating universes. Like just think like Matrix. Like just when I say creating a universe, essentially just creating different things simulations.

00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  But it sounds like a little bit more like the ideas of Play-Doh, which is there's these

00:09:45,346 --> 00:09:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  platonic forms, there's abstract forms that are...

00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,366
SPEAKER_0:  bigger more general than our

00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  particular.

00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  Reality here

00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  and those forms are used to construct the reality.

00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,270
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I grew up in a cult, so I'm not familiar with the works of Play-Doh.

00:09:58,658 --> 00:09:59,550
SPEAKER_0:  Hahaha.

00:10:00,674 --> 00:10:03,166
SPEAKER_0:  You can't use that as an excuse for everything.

00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:09,406
SPEAKER_0:  I would like to, you know, non jokingly, steal man the case because a lot of philosophies.

00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  a lot of religions.

00:10:11,138 --> 00:10:12,862
SPEAKER_0:  a lot of even scientific endeavors.

00:10:13,634 --> 00:10:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  are a little bit full of.

00:10:16,002 --> 00:10:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  uncertainty.

00:10:17,698 --> 00:10:19,070
SPEAKER_0:  You can call it bullshit.

00:10:19,554 --> 00:10:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  but you're on sturdy ground because we're surrounded by mystery. And you have to take these ideas.

00:10:25,602 --> 00:10:26,942
SPEAKER_0:  somewhat seriously.

00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:28,990
SPEAKER_0:  and see where those ideas go wrong.

00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  This happens with communism, this happens with capitalism. These ideas sound beautiful in their ideal forms, and then they somehow go wrong, and some go more wrong than others.

00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  And so I don't think.

00:10:41,122 --> 00:10:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  sort of, it's easy to...

00:10:44,802 --> 00:10:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  sort of caricature and make fun of the ideas, I think if we take them seriously, you'll start to understand like-

00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:54,622
SPEAKER_0:  When you're in it, it was serious. It can be very convincing.

00:10:54,978 --> 00:10:59,934
SPEAKER_0:  The devil is going to be a charismatic person, he's not going to be a caricature of ridiculous.

00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  So that helps us understand which ideas.

00:11:03,842 --> 00:11:05,717
SPEAKER_0:  uh... will sound appealing but will be

00:11:05,717 --> 00:11:08,478
SPEAKER_1:  come dangerous.

00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,038
SPEAKER_1:  thrusts.

00:11:11,394 --> 00:11:16,862
SPEAKER_1:  I have on my channel is wanting to talk about Scientology in a way that would actually resonate with.

00:11:17,538 --> 00:11:21,566
SPEAKER_1:  current Scientologists, not just resonate with former Scientologists.

00:11:21,858 --> 00:11:24,990
SPEAKER_1:  I want people who are still in to be able to hear how I talk about it and go.

00:11:25,282 --> 00:11:26,526
SPEAKER_1:  Wow, he's being really fit.

00:11:27,106 --> 00:11:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  and really accurate.

00:11:28,642 --> 00:11:30,334
SPEAKER_1:  He's not just a hater, you know what I mean?

00:11:30,626 --> 00:11:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  If you look at the, let's take one of the worst places on earth is North Korea.

00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,990
SPEAKER_0:  You have Kim Jong Un.

00:11:37,602 --> 00:11:39,102
SPEAKER_0:  And the reality is there's a lot of

00:11:39,714 --> 00:11:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  citizens of that nation that deeply love

00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:43,710
SPEAKER_0:  the leader.

00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:51,070
SPEAKER_0:  because they grew up in that way. I mean, through fear, through all kinds of manipulation, through propaganda and so on, they're not allowed to love.

00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  Members of their own family, they're not allowed to have romantic love, they're only allowed to have love for the leader.

00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:59,198
SPEAKER_0:  And to reach those people you have to empathize with the fact that

00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,414
SPEAKER_0:  in their eyes.

00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  in some sense, this is a great man, this is a god.

00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:05,022
SPEAKER_0:  messianic figure.

00:12:05,314 --> 00:12:06,686
SPEAKER_0:  You can't just make fun of...

00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  the ridiculousness of the situation that this pudgy person.

00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,635
SPEAKER_0:  Waltzing around creating propaganda.

00:12:13,635 --> 00:12:15,135
SPEAKER_1:  with a funny haircut.

00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  haircut like it's so easy.

00:12:17,282 --> 00:12:22,558
SPEAKER_0:  Hitler too to make fun of to make a caricature of the person, but this is a real person

00:12:22,818 --> 00:12:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  A real person that

00:12:24,386 --> 00:12:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  influenced the minds of millions of people. In the case of Hitler.

00:12:28,322 --> 00:12:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  of tens of millions of people.

00:12:30,594 --> 00:12:32,862
SPEAKER_0:  and created a huge amount of suffering.

00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  Not because of-

00:12:35,138 --> 00:12:35,614
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:12:36,578 --> 00:12:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  the caricature version, but because he was a charismatic leader, he was somebody that people deeply, deeply loved. And that just over time, I mean, with the

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  the abuse of any kind of

00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:50,782
SPEAKER_0:  ideology this happens over and over. So it's interesting because.

00:12:51,202 --> 00:12:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  Scientology is so close to the...

00:12:54,754 --> 00:13:00,382
SPEAKER_0:  to the core of what is America because so many Americans are involved with it. So it's interesting to study.

00:13:00,802 --> 00:13:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  The.

00:13:01,538 --> 00:13:05,406
SPEAKER_0:  the beauty and the power of the ideas that underlie it and where things go wrong.

00:13:06,818 --> 00:13:13,694
SPEAKER_1:  I'll just say it's interesting to note you would never get a representative of the Church of Scientology to sit down and have a conversation with you.

00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,958
SPEAKER_1:  and even be as fair and accurate about Scientology.

00:13:17,186 --> 00:13:18,110
SPEAKER_1:  as I'm going to be.

00:13:18,626 --> 00:13:20,501
SPEAKER_1:  which is noteworthy.

00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  I honestly deeply believe that's the case. There's not going to be a high level official.

00:13:25,314 --> 00:13:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  that would sit down.

00:13:27,298 --> 00:13:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  for conversation.

00:13:29,954 --> 00:13:30,750
SPEAKER_0:  I disagree with you.

00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  I hope you're right.

00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,902
SPEAKER_0:  because I think that given the current dynamics of what's happening

00:13:36,706 --> 00:13:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  I think in order to save from their perspective, in order to save the

00:13:40,098 --> 00:13:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  the Church of Scientology, they have to.

00:13:43,298 --> 00:13:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  be transparent and authentic.

00:13:45,026 --> 00:13:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  Basically, steel man their case, but better.

00:13:47,362 --> 00:13:48,254
SPEAKER_0:  You would think so.

00:13:49,058 --> 00:13:54,683
SPEAKER_0:  Well, we'll talk about the other ways you could do that was just the manipulation through propaganda, through control media and all that kind of stuff.

00:13:54,683 --> 00:13:56,350
SPEAKER_1:  They paint themselves into a corner.

00:13:56,706 --> 00:14:01,310
SPEAKER_1:  of not being able to send a representative out into the world to speak honestly about it because

00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,358
SPEAKER_1:  you're literally not allowed to.

00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,678
SPEAKER_1:  So when faced, you know, if you're just sitting down with an entertainment journalist.

00:14:08,226 --> 00:14:10,654
SPEAKER_1:  representative might be able to fudge their way through an interview.

00:14:10,978 --> 00:14:11,742
SPEAKER_1:  by sitting down.

00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  for a long form.

00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:14,654
SPEAKER_1:  format.

00:14:14,978 --> 00:14:15,582
SPEAKER_1:  interview.

00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,182
SPEAKER_1:  with someone who.

00:14:17,698 --> 00:14:19,486
SPEAKER_1:  is going to ask them about Xenu.

00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:23,422
SPEAKER_1:  and the body Phaetons and Leah Remini and Lisa McPherson.

00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,150
SPEAKER_1:  That's a no-go zone.

00:14:25,826 --> 00:14:31,518
SPEAKER_1:  So I'm representing why it will never happen, but shit, I would tune in for that interview. I mean, I hope you do get someone.

00:14:31,682 --> 00:14:33,758
SPEAKER_0:  You don't think David Miscavige would sit down for an interview.

00:14:34,466 --> 00:14:35,358
SPEAKER_1:  I would love to be wrong.

00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  You know, in general, journalists in these kinds of situations can be.

00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:39,550
SPEAKER_0:  We'll catch you next time.

00:14:40,354 --> 00:14:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  attack.

00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:46,430
SPEAKER_0:  in a way that doesn't empathize and doesn't come from a place of deep knowledge and understanding.

00:14:46,722 --> 00:14:49,950
SPEAKER_0:  And I think it's possible to have serious conversations with people.

00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  like that in an empathetic way, but it's also in a challenging way.

00:14:54,178 --> 00:14:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  I think there's a huge amount of trust required.

00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  and obviously for us, a very secretive organization.

00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  The amount of trust, yes, might be too much.

00:15:03,842 --> 00:15:06,494
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, anyone over there, if they've done their homework, knows.

00:15:06,754 --> 00:15:09,470
SPEAKER_1:  you're going to be as fair as anyone in the world is going to be.

00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:10,846
SPEAKER_1:  And yet...

00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,830
SPEAKER_1:  They're simply things they're not allowed.

00:15:13,282 --> 00:15:15,934
SPEAKER_1:  to talk about and they're not even allowed to say I'm not allowed to talk about it.

00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  So that's a fundamental part.

00:15:18,178 --> 00:15:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  of the Church of Scientology is the secrecy. Yeah.

00:15:21,506 --> 00:15:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  So that's where you're trained as you go up through the ranks Secretly, secrecy

00:15:25,154 --> 00:15:26,942
SPEAKER_1:  It's not even a matter of training, it's that there's...

00:15:27,298 --> 00:15:31,262
SPEAKER_1:  an entire the entire upper half of Scientology's bridge is simply confidential.

00:15:31,714 --> 00:15:35,294
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, and I never even did those levels when I was in Scientology. I didn't learn.

00:15:35,746 --> 00:15:38,686
SPEAKER_1:  what Scientologists actually believe on those upper levels.

00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,822
SPEAKER_1:  Until after I got out of Scientology and I was freaking born and raised in it.

00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:47,102
SPEAKER_0:  Let's go there. Let's go to your personal story. So you've spent 30 years in cytology.

00:15:47,362 --> 00:15:48,766
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I was four years old when my mom.

00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:49,726
SPEAKER_1:  Got in.

00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  And then.

00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  about seven years ago, got out. Yeah. on what YouTube channel now.

00:15:56,194 --> 00:15:57,374
SPEAKER_0:  and you're an educator.

00:15:57,506 --> 00:16:00,062
SPEAKER_1:  So I was four years old when my mom got introduced to Scientology.

00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:08,734
SPEAKER_1:  and she got in really fast really quick. So I was 12 years old when I was taken out of school and started officially full-time working for Scientology.

00:16:09,634 --> 00:16:13,790
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so in various capacities, I worked with them from the ages of 12.

00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:15,838
SPEAKER_1:  to the age of 26.

00:16:16,162 --> 00:16:16,574
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:17,566
SPEAKER_1:  So.

00:16:18,146 --> 00:16:21,470
SPEAKER_1:  And then I was 34 when I officially.

00:16:21,986 --> 00:16:23,422
SPEAKER_1:  ways with Scientology.

00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:29,182
SPEAKER_1:  which was really more them officially parting ways with me, but we can get into all that later. That's just kind of how Scientology does it.

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,254
SPEAKER_0:  And what do you do now in terms of Scientology?

00:16:32,546 --> 00:16:36,510
SPEAKER_1:  So now I run growing up in Scientology, the YouTube channel, but what I primarily do.

00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,926
SPEAKER_1:  is I help run an organization that helps people who are escaping from Scientology.

00:16:41,154 --> 00:16:43,262
SPEAKER_1:  I'm the Vice President of the Aftermath Foundation.

00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:49,854
SPEAKER_1:  And we created the foundation after the television show, the Aramne Scientology in the aftermath.

00:16:50,914 --> 00:16:55,230
SPEAKER_1:  And there was such an outpouring of support from non-scientologists all over the world.

00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,502
SPEAKER_1:  What can we do to help people?

00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:58,910
SPEAKER_1:  Leave Scientology.

00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,630
SPEAKER_1:  that we decided to create a foundation.

00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:10,494
SPEAKER_1:  And it's been incredibly successful. We've helped people escape from all regions and echelons of Scientology. We've accomplished...

00:17:10,978 --> 00:17:13,726
SPEAKER_1:  What we've accomplished is far beyond what we actually.

00:17:14,146 --> 00:17:16,510
SPEAKER_1:  envisioned would be possible. It's been a huge success.

00:17:16,738 --> 00:17:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  So we'll talk about the negative aspect, the abuses of power, but let's just explore the ideas a little bit more.

00:17:22,434 --> 00:17:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  So the public facing.

00:17:25,026 --> 00:17:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  Three fundamental truths of.

00:17:27,426 --> 00:17:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  Scientology, maybe correct me if I'm wrong.

00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  Man is an immortal spiritual being, like we said with thetans.

00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,670
SPEAKER_0:  His experience extends well beyond a single lifetime.

00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  So infinite memory backwards.

00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,526
SPEAKER_0:  His capabilities are unlimited even if not presently realized.

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  the capabilities are limited.

00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,582
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so that when I say Godlike, I really just mean.

00:17:47,874 --> 00:17:48,990
SPEAKER_1:  you know, Thanos.

00:17:49,506 --> 00:17:50,558
SPEAKER_1:  like unlimited.

00:17:51,522 --> 00:18:00,862
SPEAKER_1:  Scientologists don't believe in a God. So when I say God-like, I just mean the most powerful entity, the creator, the prime mover unmoved, except we are all that.

00:18:01,442 --> 00:18:09,502
SPEAKER_1:  You know, a thetan in signatology has no position in space or time. A thetan does not actually exist in the physical universe.

00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,190
SPEAKER_1:  it might choose to locate itself.

00:18:12,578 --> 00:18:18,718
SPEAKER_1:  in the physical universe, right? And then forget that it made that decision and then sort of get caught and trapped in the physical universe.

00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:22,910
SPEAKER_1:  but that once the Thain is restored to its native.

00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,126
SPEAKER_1:  powers.

00:18:24,802 --> 00:18:28,542
SPEAKER_1:  uh... everything you see in the physical universe is just i think i'm playing a game

00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:32,094
SPEAKER_1:  Like literally, we are in a simulation right now of some fate.

00:18:32,418 --> 00:18:33,214
SPEAKER_1:  It's like physics.

00:18:33,506 --> 00:18:40,702
SPEAKER_1:  doesn't have to make sense when we're talking about it this way. Like technically you're a Thayton, I'm a Thayton, we're here, but this could also all just be another Thayton's game.

00:18:41,026 --> 00:18:42,110
SPEAKER_1:  with Tatans all the way down.

00:18:42,434 --> 00:18:46,014
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's just things everywhere things all comes down to the thing.

00:18:46,274 --> 00:18:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  Is there an idea of a god?

00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:51,838
SPEAKER_0:  I read there is a sense of a supreme being.

00:18:52,322 --> 00:18:53,310
SPEAKER_0:  is that basically...

00:18:53,826 --> 00:18:57,694
SPEAKER_0:  the fate and that's at the core at the bottom of it all yes not

00:18:58,242 --> 00:18:59,774
SPEAKER_0:  Not defined. Undefined.

00:19:00,034 --> 00:19:00,382
SPEAKER_1:  Correct.

00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:04,350
SPEAKER_1:  Scientology has this concept of the dynamics when a cell around our blood is warning someone about another virus in your body and how it can get your body and you feel that your ability to reason with each other is marked as necessary

00:19:04,674 --> 00:19:09,022
SPEAKER_1:  a different dynamics and the dynamic meaning a thrust towards survival.

00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:15,806
SPEAKER_1:  So he would say, you know, the first dynamic is you yourself. Second dynamic is your family. Third dynamic is any other group.

00:19:16,162 --> 00:19:17,598
SPEAKER_1:  that you're a part of other than your family.

00:19:17,986 --> 00:19:19,742
SPEAKER_1:  Forth dynamic is all humankind.

00:19:20,098 --> 00:19:23,198
SPEAKER_1:  The fifth dynamic is plant and animal life, all non-human life.

00:19:23,682 --> 00:19:26,238
SPEAKER_1:  sixth dynamic is the physical world.

00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:31,038
SPEAKER_1:  Seventh dynamic is sort of like spirituality collectively, Thetans as a Thetans.

00:19:31,554 --> 00:19:33,182
SPEAKER_1:  and the eighth dynamic.

00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:35,774
SPEAKER_1:  L. Ron Hubbard says, Scientology doesn't deal with the 8th.

00:19:36,322 --> 00:19:38,590
SPEAKER_1:  but we recognize that people have this idea.

00:19:38,818 --> 00:19:39,806
SPEAKER_1:  of a supreme being.

00:19:40,418 --> 00:19:44,254
SPEAKER_1:  And so Scientology says you can call the eighth dynamic the supreme being dynamic.

00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,014
SPEAKER_1:  but we call it infinity.

00:19:46,466 --> 00:19:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  Just...

00:19:47,106 --> 00:19:51,678
SPEAKER_1:  the allness of everything without having to define it. And then they sort of do a little dance and they're like,

00:19:52,066 --> 00:20:04,478
SPEAKER_1:  Scientology, the purpose of Scientology is to get you to the point where you have your own understandings or realizations about the nature of the eighth dynamic. We don't tell you what you have to believe about that. And technically speaking, that is true.

00:20:05,154 --> 00:20:06,334
SPEAKER_1:  Technically speaking, that is true.

00:20:06,594 --> 00:20:11,134
SPEAKER_1:  There's no point in Scientology where they sit you down and say you're now required to revoke your belief in a supreme being.

00:20:11,618 --> 00:20:14,942
SPEAKER_1:  It's just that everything in Scientology is inconsistent.

00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,478
SPEAKER_1:  with a belief in the Supreme Being.

00:20:17,314 --> 00:20:23,038
SPEAKER_1:  You can still find Scientologists who through cognitive dissonance will tell you they believe in a supreme being. Mostly they're lying to you.

00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,525
SPEAKER_0:  How is this inconsistent with the supreme being?

00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:28,638
SPEAKER_1:  like things because they ins have created everything not God.

00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:34,686
SPEAKER_0:  So things creative, they're also creative force. They're not just the force that runs everything.

00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  But can't those be just the fingertips of a god?

00:20:38,178 --> 00:20:40,094
SPEAKER_1:  Sure the only way.

00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,910
SPEAKER_1:  you could reconcile a supreme being.

00:20:43,554 --> 00:20:44,542
SPEAKER_1:  is if you say

00:20:44,866 --> 00:20:47,038
SPEAKER_1:  A single supreme being created?

00:20:47,682 --> 00:20:48,382
SPEAKER_1:  all theta.

00:20:49,954 --> 00:20:51,454
SPEAKER_1:  like the spiritual Big Bang.

00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,942
SPEAKER_1:  But that's not what most people think when they talk about God.

00:20:55,426 --> 00:20:57,118
SPEAKER_1:  They're talking about a creator.

00:20:57,346 --> 00:20:57,822
SPEAKER_1:  of.

00:20:58,594 --> 00:21:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  the physical universe. Yes. We'll be right back.

00:21:01,378 --> 00:21:01,790
SPEAKER_1:  Right.

00:21:02,818 --> 00:21:05,150
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, even as I've described Scientology so far.

00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,454
SPEAKER_1:  None of what I've said is something I even subject.

00:21:07,746 --> 00:21:12,094
SPEAKER_1:  to ridicule. This is pretty common sense stuff actually. I mean, if you believe in spirituality,

00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,262
SPEAKER_1:  or spirits at all, there's nothing I've described so far that's crazy.

00:21:16,322 --> 00:21:19,742
SPEAKER_1:  you know, believing in past lives isn't particularly unique or special.

00:21:20,898 --> 00:21:24,190
SPEAKER_1:  The fact that Scientology does this little dance of.

00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:31,646
SPEAKER_1:  pretending to believe in a God. I mean, it's even like a PR line, Scientology representatives will tell you, you can be a Christian and be a Scientologist.

00:21:32,034 --> 00:21:32,766
SPEAKER_1:  Let me tell you what.

00:21:33,186 --> 00:21:35,646
SPEAKER_1:  Christians don't believe in past lives.

00:21:35,874 --> 00:21:39,038
SPEAKER_1:  lives on other galaxies and planets and universes.

00:21:39,394 --> 00:21:46,519
SPEAKER_1:  But in Scientology knows that Scientology knows you can't be a Christian and be a Scientologist, but they will say that it's just an example of sort of the fundamental baked in dishonesty.

00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  because it's so important to Scientology on the organizational level to have

00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:51,518
SPEAKER_0:  hex exempt status.

00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  I wonder...

00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  How do you-

00:21:54,402 --> 00:21:58,110
SPEAKER_0:  Do you know the process of what it takes to prove that an organization is a religion?

00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:05,630
SPEAKER_1:  while going through that process with the IRS for the second time, by the way. Scientology actually had tax exemption in the early days when the IRS pulled it.

00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,710
SPEAKER_1:  and then they got it back in 1993.

00:22:08,322 --> 00:22:09,662
SPEAKER_1:  while going through that process again.

00:22:10,306 --> 00:22:12,478
SPEAKER_1:  the IRS actually took issue.

00:22:12,834 --> 00:22:18,686
SPEAKER_1:  with the fact that Scientology was claiming you could be a Scientologist and a member of another religion. The IRS actually said.

00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,414
SPEAKER_1:  Pump the brakes there. Yeah.

00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:22,014
SPEAKER_1:  If you're gonna say that...

00:22:22,978 --> 00:22:24,638
SPEAKER_1:  we're gonna say you're not a religion. yeah.

00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  and they actually put in writing to the IRS. No, no, no, no, no, that's not what we meant. That's not what we meant.

00:22:30,978 --> 00:22:37,086
SPEAKER_1:  We meant in the beginning you can be both, but eventually you just have to be a Scientologist.

00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  So you mentioned the eight.

00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  the eight dynamics, but y'all so much as survival.

00:22:42,658 --> 00:22:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  So that seems to be a core-

00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,054
SPEAKER_0:  principle that

00:22:45,858 --> 00:22:48,030
SPEAKER_0:  that human existence is about survival.

00:22:48,642 --> 00:22:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  Can you elaborate what is meant by survival? We're talking about the survival of the human species.

00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,334
SPEAKER_0:  survival of the individual humans.

00:22:54,818 --> 00:22:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  Survival of the...

00:22:56,098 --> 00:22:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  the manifestation of

00:22:58,338 --> 00:23:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  tens in human form, what survival?

00:23:01,762 --> 00:23:04,478
SPEAKER_1:  So it would be all of that because survival is.

00:23:04,962 --> 00:23:07,326
SPEAKER_1:  the dominant force across all the dynamics.

00:23:08,898 --> 00:23:11,806
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, L. Ron Hubbard, it was either Dianetics or Science of Survival.

00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:12,734
SPEAKER_1:  Hehehe.

00:23:13,282 --> 00:23:14,494
SPEAKER_1:  as he discovered.

00:23:14,754 --> 00:23:15,678
SPEAKER_1:  the principle.

00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:16,990
SPEAKER_1:  upon which.

00:23:17,442 --> 00:23:19,006
SPEAKER_1:  All life exists and that is.

00:23:19,586 --> 00:23:21,534
SPEAKER_1:  all life no matter what it is trying to do.

00:23:22,306 --> 00:23:23,006
SPEAKER_1:  Are you ready, Lex?

00:23:23,714 --> 00:23:24,606
SPEAKER_1:  trying to survive.

00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,334
SPEAKER_0:  That's pretty powerful.

00:23:26,658 --> 00:23:30,033
SPEAKER_0:  That's pretty powerful. Here's the thing. Is it? No, I got it.

00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:33,033
SPEAKER_1:  tell you I got it might get me back in

00:23:33,033 --> 00:23:43,038
SPEAKER_0:  I'm trying to get you back in. I'm trying to get you to take seriously the power of the ideas behind Scientology because I think those ideas are not bad ideas.

00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  They resonate with a lot of ideas throughout philosophy, throughout religions, throughout the history of human civilization.

00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  The interesting aspect is how it goes wrong.

00:23:52,194 --> 00:23:54,846
SPEAKER_1:  But here's the thing, Lex, here's the thing. It is consistent.

00:23:55,106 --> 00:23:55,966
SPEAKER_1:  with Prior.

00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:56,990
SPEAKER_1:  efforts.

00:23:57,282 --> 00:23:57,886
SPEAKER_1:  or studies.

00:23:58,178 --> 00:24:05,767
SPEAKER_1:  It's just that L. Ron Hubbard said this was a watershed breakthrough that was being discovered for the first time. That's kind of what I'm mocking, really. Yeah, but you can mock n-

00:24:05,767 --> 00:24:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  Nietzsche for saying

00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,821
SPEAKER_0:  Man is will to power, you can mo-

00:24:08,821 --> 00:24:11,071
SPEAKER_1:  But did he claim to be the first person to ever say it?

00:24:11,071 --> 00:24:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  Well, Nietzsche, he's had a bit of an ego, so. Like, and he's full of contradictions, but I'm pretty sure.

00:24:17,346 --> 00:24:20,702
SPEAKER_0:  The implied thing is that he was the first to...

00:24:21,474 --> 00:24:26,110
SPEAKER_0:  first to say it. There's a lot of scientists. There's one of the people I really admire Stephen Wolfram.

00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  who wrote a book called A New Kind of Science that explores complex systems in cellular automata and these mathematical systems that have been explored before.

00:24:37,506 --> 00:24:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  but he boldly kind of defined, I am presenting to you a whole new way to look at the world.

00:24:42,626 --> 00:24:43,966
SPEAKER_0:  And if you just set.

00:24:44,258 --> 00:24:51,902
SPEAKER_0:  a little bit of the ego behind that aside, there's actually beautiful ideas in there. They have of course been done before and explored before, so there are several kinds that you could use.

00:24:52,226 --> 00:24:53,351
SPEAKER_0:  People declare this.

00:24:53,351 --> 00:25:08,478
SPEAKER_1:  This is the coolest. That's the only thing I'm really mocking is that this discovery that life is trying to survive is greater than the discovery of fire. Okay, I mean, again, it's a little silly, but that's fine. We can agree that the fact that life is trying to survive has meaning and is meaningful and is valuable.

00:25:08,738 --> 00:25:11,363
SPEAKER_1:  I mean life is trying to survive.

00:25:11,363 --> 00:25:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  Montreal definition of what is life.

00:25:13,538 --> 00:25:13,854
SPEAKER_0:  here.

00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,606
SPEAKER_0:  So this idea of a thing, the thing that permeates.

00:25:17,154 --> 00:25:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  through lifetimes.

00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:19,742
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. Through people. There's some...

00:25:20,194 --> 00:25:22,878
SPEAKER_0:  some fabric that is bigger than the individual.

00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  biological.

00:25:24,098 --> 00:25:24,926
SPEAKER_0:  bags of meat.

00:25:25,378 --> 00:25:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  That's a...

00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:29,918
SPEAKER_0:  Philosophically-initial idea, of course, if it's not grounded in...

00:25:30,338 --> 00:25:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  a little bit more.

00:25:31,842 --> 00:25:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  physical reality then it becomes a little too woo-woo.

00:25:35,426 --> 00:25:40,894
SPEAKER_1:  And the way L. Ron Hubbard in Scientology defines survival is very much intertwined with how they define ethics. Ethics anything.

00:25:41,218 --> 00:25:42,270
SPEAKER_1:  you know, to be ethical.

00:25:42,562 --> 00:25:43,486
SPEAKER_1:  is pro survival.

00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  to be unethical.

00:25:45,474 --> 00:25:46,142
SPEAKER_1:  counter-survival.

00:25:46,786 --> 00:25:54,334
SPEAKER_1:  But we were talking about just the concept of the dynamics, like what does survival refer to? And it actually does refer to all of them, but just keep in mind when it comes to the seventh dynamic.

00:25:54,818 --> 00:25:55,902
SPEAKER_1:  faytans collectively.

00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:56,894
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:25:57,218 --> 00:25:59,710
SPEAKER_1:  involved in here is the idea that a thing cannot.

00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:00,606
SPEAKER_1:  die.

00:26:00,898 --> 00:26:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  There's no such thing as killing a thing. A thing can only.

00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,086
SPEAKER_1:  can only survive.

00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:07,326
SPEAKER_1:  And so, um...

00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:13,630
SPEAKER_1:  Anyway, this concept of the dynamics is one of the most fundamental and important concepts in Scientology.

00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,798
SPEAKER_1:  But, but because I mentioned that it also gets tied up with ethics.

00:26:17,506 --> 00:26:22,590
SPEAKER_1:  And this probably speaks to what you're just talking about is you can have the ideas and the concepts and you can have how do they go wrong.

00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:24,798
SPEAKER_1:  Because...

00:26:25,122 --> 00:26:25,854
SPEAKER_1:  They hold.

00:26:26,754 --> 00:26:30,302
SPEAKER_1:  that Scientology, applying Scientology, getting people into Scientology.

00:26:30,946 --> 00:26:32,094
SPEAKER_1:  is the key.

00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,694
SPEAKER_1:  to basically saving.

00:26:34,018 --> 00:26:34,526
SPEAKER_1:  Every.

00:26:34,786 --> 00:26:36,126
SPEAKER_1:  spiritual being in existence.

00:26:37,314 --> 00:26:39,294
SPEAKER_1:  when you're analyzing what is ethical.

00:26:39,906 --> 00:26:42,942
SPEAKER_1:  it becomes whatever's good for Scientology.

00:26:44,034 --> 00:26:45,598
SPEAKER_1:  becomes by definition ethical.

00:26:46,178 --> 00:26:48,094
SPEAKER_1:  because anything that's good for Scientology...

00:26:48,322 --> 00:26:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  which is a third dynamic.

00:26:49,986 --> 00:26:51,934
SPEAKER_1:  is inherently good for all the dynamics.

00:26:52,386 --> 00:26:53,406
SPEAKER_1:  So that's where you get.

00:26:54,434 --> 00:26:58,718
SPEAKER_1:  the ends justifying the means to do anything possible and use any means necessary.

00:26:59,138 --> 00:27:00,830
SPEAKER_1:  to forward the aims of Scientology.

00:27:00,962 --> 00:27:04,606
SPEAKER_0:  kind of where a lot of Soviet implementation of communism went wrong.

00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  as the ends justify the means.

00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,598
SPEAKER_0:  the equality, the justice for the workers.

00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,582
SPEAKER_0:  If we have to...

00:27:12,002 --> 00:27:13,790
SPEAKER_0:  kill murder and prison censor.

00:27:14,178 --> 00:27:16,446
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. In the name of that, then it's.

00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,390
SPEAKER_0:  is for the greater good in the long term to achieve the

00:27:19,682 --> 00:27:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  the ideal of communism.

00:27:21,122 --> 00:27:25,502
SPEAKER_1:  In some respects, Scientology created a near-perfect communist experiment in its organization.

00:27:26,466 --> 00:27:29,790
SPEAKER_1:  What is it? From everyone according to their ability to each according to their need or something like that.

00:27:31,074 --> 00:27:34,494
SPEAKER_1:  Scientology C organization is damn near a perfect communist experiment.

00:27:36,098 --> 00:27:56,670
SPEAKER_1:  coming from someone who doesn't necessarily know what the perfect communist experiment really is, because I grew up in a cult, Lex. You can't keep using that as an excuse. It's a funny tagline I use in my videos. I like it. But it is interesting that an organization that is so hyper-capitalist and so money-hungry and is known to be very wealthy, at its core is run by these group of Searge members that live a communist.

00:27:56,962 --> 00:27:57,470
SPEAKER_1:  Lifestyle.

00:27:58,306 --> 00:27:59,431
SPEAKER_1:  We're gonna jump around.

00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:01,681
SPEAKER_0:  go what is C-ORG? What is C-Organization? What is...

00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:07,358
SPEAKER_1:  This organization is the most dedicated version, the most dedicated brand of Scientologists.

00:28:07,746 --> 00:28:10,398
SPEAKER_1:  There's three like echelons.

00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,518
SPEAKER_1:  of Scientologists.

00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:12,638
SPEAKER_1:  There's public.

00:28:13,634 --> 00:28:17,182
SPEAKER_1:  live normal lives in the real world and they pay to do Scientology courses and auditing.

00:28:17,794 --> 00:28:18,878
SPEAKER_1:  then they're staff members.

00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,734
SPEAKER_1:  who also live in the real world.

00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:29,374
SPEAKER_1:  uh... but work on two and a half year contracts are five-year contracts at their local Scientology organization and then once they finish their contract there their debt is paid or whatever

00:28:29,954 --> 00:28:33,534
SPEAKER_1:  And then there's the Sea Org members. These are the guys who signed the billion year contract.

00:28:34,402 --> 00:28:42,277
SPEAKER_1:  They don't have lives in the outside world. They don't own property. They live in Scientology provided housing. They eat Scientology run cafeterias.

00:28:42,277 --> 00:28:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  Actual contract that says a billion years?

00:28:44,418 --> 00:28:45,502
SPEAKER_1:  It's symbolic, but yes.

00:28:46,146 --> 00:28:48,254
SPEAKER_1:  Like, no, it's not a legally enforceable contract.

00:28:48,802 --> 00:28:49,406
SPEAKER_1:  Ha ha ha!

00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:53,854
SPEAKER_1:  They haven't succeeded in enforcing it in any subsequent lifetimes yet.

00:28:54,082 --> 00:28:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  Marriage contracts should be like that. Please describe the sedative video.

00:28:57,538 --> 00:29:02,645
SPEAKER_0:  Not until death do us part, but a billion years, it really makes it very concrete of what you're signing up for.

00:29:02,645 --> 00:29:03,102
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:08,158
SPEAKER_1:  Those are the billion year guys. You hear a lot about the billion year contract, the billion year contract. That's the Sea Org.

00:29:08,482 --> 00:29:14,462
SPEAKER_1:  and and uh... all of Scientology management international management middle management continental management

00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,638
SPEAKER_1:  and even some lower level service orgs.

00:29:16,962 --> 00:29:19,774
SPEAKER_1:  are composed 100% of Sea York members.

00:29:20,578 --> 00:29:21,438
SPEAKER_1:  You're not allowed to.

00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:23,614
SPEAKER_1:  marry or date someone who's not in the sea or.

00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,406
SPEAKER_1:  You're also not allowed to have children.

00:29:26,978 --> 00:29:29,603
SPEAKER_0:  with anybody outside of C.O.G.O. in general, you're not allowed to have children.

00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:32,734
SPEAKER_1:  Sea Org members are not allowed to have children unless they leave the Sea Org.

00:29:33,282 --> 00:29:34,622
SPEAKER_1:  They're expected to.

00:29:34,978 --> 00:29:38,270
SPEAKER_1:  have an abortion and stay in the sea or because it's the greatest good for Scientology.

00:29:38,754 --> 00:29:39,806
SPEAKER_1:  if you accidentally get pregnant.

00:29:40,386 --> 00:29:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  interesting because it distracts from the focus of the work.

00:29:43,778 --> 00:29:45,022
SPEAKER_0:  What about sexual relations?

00:29:45,346 --> 00:29:49,118
SPEAKER_1:  only once married, but that's why people get married after like three days. y 이제 bring up a a an

00:29:49,442 --> 00:29:52,830
SPEAKER_1:  Hey you, you look, you look all right, let's get married. Are you allowed to have divorce?

00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:55,230
SPEAKER_1:  You get divorced a lot in the sea or.

00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:59,294
SPEAKER_1:  I've known people who get married and divorced three times by the age of 25.

00:29:59,522 --> 00:29:59,838
SPEAKER_1:  Oh wow.

00:30:00,194 --> 00:30:02,846
SPEAKER_1:  because in this year getting married is practically like dating.

00:30:03,938 --> 00:30:04,350
SPEAKER_1:  Also.

00:30:04,866 --> 00:30:07,582
SPEAKER_1:  Unless you're married, you're living in dorms with a bunch of other people.

00:30:07,874 --> 00:30:10,174
SPEAKER_1:  So in order to get your own room, you also have to get married.

00:30:10,722 --> 00:30:11,838
SPEAKER_1:  So there's many benefits.

00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,566
SPEAKER_0:  Oh wow, okay.

00:30:13,954 --> 00:30:17,406
SPEAKER_0:  So you mentioned communism, in which way?

00:30:17,826 --> 00:30:20,670
SPEAKER_0:  Is there a hierarchy inside C-ORG?

00:30:20,962 --> 00:30:22,814
SPEAKER_0:  Is there a redistribution of...

00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  Influence position.

00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:26,046
SPEAKER_0:  money.

00:30:26,434 --> 00:30:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  Power is S-Yorg.

00:30:28,098 --> 00:30:30,334
SPEAKER_1:  Everyone in the sea org makes $50 a week.

00:30:30,946 --> 00:30:31,326
SPEAKER_1:  everybody.

00:30:31,682 --> 00:30:34,590
SPEAKER_1:  except David Miscavige, but. And, and some.

00:30:34,946 --> 00:30:40,862
SPEAKER_1:  Some posts might have a cash bonus incentive structure, but fundamentally their pay is $50 a week.

00:30:41,314 --> 00:30:43,070
SPEAKER_1:  So even the head of...

00:30:43,298 --> 00:30:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  a big Scientology organization.

00:30:46,754 --> 00:30:47,870
SPEAKER_1:  is getting 50 bucks a week.

00:30:49,346 --> 00:30:51,998
SPEAKER_0:  Are celebrities also part of C-Org? Well, no, not usually.

00:30:52,258 --> 00:30:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  So this is really the management layer.

00:30:55,490 --> 00:31:00,318
SPEAKER_0:  So what's the idea behind $50 a week? Is that basically live a humble life?

00:31:00,738 --> 00:31:04,702
SPEAKER_1:  They don't have to give you anything at all. It's just, oh, you mean like, what's the idea behind not paying?

00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,046
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, basically nothing.

00:31:07,874 --> 00:31:10,334
SPEAKER_1:  Everything you need is already being provided for you. You're not here for the money.

00:31:11,426 --> 00:31:16,862
SPEAKER_1:  You're working all the time anyway. It's not like you don't have days off. I mean, you're working all the time. There's not.

00:31:17,186 --> 00:31:20,286
SPEAKER_1:  There's no concept of the weekends. There's no- thank God it's Friday.

00:31:20,802 --> 00:31:21,694
SPEAKER_1:  Friday's just another day.

00:31:21,954 --> 00:31:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  And how are the positions, the tasks, the jobs allocated within the C-ORG?

00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  What do you mean? What kind of tasks you're doing, what kind of-

00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:32,286
SPEAKER_1:  Mmm, it's very similar to just any other.

00:31:32,578 --> 00:31:33,470
SPEAKER_1:  Um, business?

00:31:33,698 --> 00:31:38,110
SPEAKER_1:  as far as you can have your human resources, you can have your sales, you can have your accounting, your operations.

00:31:38,402 --> 00:31:41,438
SPEAKER_1:  your quality control, it's just that in Scientology, your operations.

00:31:41,698 --> 00:31:43,166
SPEAKER_1:  is delivering courses and auditing.

00:31:43,842 --> 00:31:49,950
SPEAKER_1:  So your operations and your quality control where most of the activity occurs as far as.

00:31:50,274 --> 00:31:51,390
SPEAKER_1:  Delivering Scientology.

00:31:52,258 --> 00:31:53,534
SPEAKER_1:  And then you've got your.

00:31:53,762 --> 00:31:56,670
SPEAKER_1:  you'd call it business development, but that's just bringing in new members, right?

00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:57,790
SPEAKER_1:  So.

00:31:58,242 --> 00:31:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  Look at that.

00:31:59,362 --> 00:32:02,174
SPEAKER_1:  the function of a Scientology organization is very...

00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:07,102
SPEAKER_1:  uh... very comparable to a a normal business in the normal world

00:32:08,002 --> 00:32:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:32:08,642 --> 00:32:12,017
SPEAKER_0:  Let's talk about the products of this business, auditing and courses.

00:32:12,017 --> 00:32:12,766
SPEAKER_1:  but what's auditing?

00:32:13,378 --> 00:32:16,510
SPEAKER_1:  So auditing is, so we described earlier, Dianetics auditing.

00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,582
SPEAKER_1:  Scientology auditing is very similar to that.

00:32:19,906 --> 00:32:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  So at first glance, it's.

00:32:21,826 --> 00:32:23,326
SPEAKER_0:  it looks like psychotherapy.

00:32:23,618 --> 00:32:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  a kind of therapy.

00:32:24,898 --> 00:32:28,030
SPEAKER_1:  All Scientology auditing is going to look like that.

00:32:28,674 --> 00:32:29,886
SPEAKER_1:  It's one on one.

00:32:30,178 --> 00:32:30,974
SPEAKER_1:  talk therapy.

00:32:31,586 --> 00:32:32,766
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, you're now.

00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:35,582
SPEAKER_1:  A room by yourselves, no distraction, no noise.

00:32:35,714 --> 00:32:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  One on one? Yeah.

00:32:37,474 --> 00:32:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  like this.

00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,830
SPEAKER_1:  But in Scientology they have what's called an emeter.

00:32:41,442 --> 00:32:43,710
SPEAKER_1:  All right, almost all auditing.

00:32:43,938 --> 00:32:46,046
SPEAKER_1:  implies the use of an E-meter. What's an E-meter?

00:32:46,626 --> 00:32:47,742
SPEAKER_1:  So an E-meter.

00:32:48,098 --> 00:32:48,702
SPEAKER_1:  is.

00:32:48,962 --> 00:32:49,982
SPEAKER_1:  a device.

00:32:50,498 --> 00:32:53,086
SPEAKER_1:  just measures the resistance to a small electrical flow.

00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:59,998
SPEAKER_1:  except Scientologists believe that this emitter can be used to simply direct the progress of an auditing session to determine whether

00:33:00,386 --> 00:33:01,182
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhhhhh

00:33:02,082 --> 00:33:04,062
SPEAKER_1:  The auditing has reached a good.

00:33:04,706 --> 00:33:05,854
SPEAKER_1:  Satisfactory.

00:33:06,594 --> 00:33:07,262
SPEAKER_1:  Conclusion.

00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:10,654
SPEAKER_1:  All auditing sessions have to.

00:33:10,978 --> 00:33:13,118
SPEAKER_1:  and on a satisfactory conclusion.

00:33:14,018 --> 00:33:15,742
SPEAKER_1:  That's the job of the auditor. There's you don't just.

00:33:16,066 --> 00:33:18,622
SPEAKER_1:  It's not like, sorry, the session sucked. See you next week. Like that.

00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,830
SPEAKER_1:  Every auditing session has to end.

00:33:21,314 --> 00:33:21,694
SPEAKER_1:  Amen.

00:33:22,114 --> 00:33:23,294
SPEAKER_1:  on a positive note.

00:33:23,522 --> 00:33:24,286
SPEAKER_1:  And if it doesn't...

00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,430
SPEAKER_1:  uh... there's corrections to be made

00:33:26,786 --> 00:33:31,006
SPEAKER_1:  So the emitter. What does it look like visually? Oh, you can pull it up.

00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:34,462
SPEAKER_1:  Pull up Mark 8, emitter Mark 8.

00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  So there's a few dials.

00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,102
SPEAKER_0:  There's a...

00:33:39,426 --> 00:33:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  basic information about time and duration I presume and then a dial that just goes zero to something

00:33:45,122 --> 00:33:48,990
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so let's say that the meter's in front of me and you're the one holding the cans.

00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  I'm holding the cancer, you're doing the auditing of me. Yeah.

00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:53,470
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

00:33:53,634 --> 00:34:07,902
SPEAKER_1:  I'm holding the cans. No, literally in the beginning of an auditing session when you're calibrating the sensitivity of the emitter, you do a can squeeze. So I go squeeze the cans please. Okay, so I'm just like squeezing the cans. And I'm just changing the sensitivity because when you squeeze the cans, I want to get about a one third of a dial drop on the needle.

00:34:08,194 --> 00:34:15,614
SPEAKER_1:  The idea is you don't want if the needle is too sensitive, then every time you shift around in your chair, the needle is gonna bounce all over the place. So you're trying to set the sensitivity of this thing.

00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,494
SPEAKER_1:  And that's all the knob there on the.

00:34:19,138 --> 00:34:21,278
SPEAKER_1:  bottom to the left, that's the sensitivity knob.

00:34:21,986 --> 00:34:23,038
SPEAKER_1:  And that determines just.

00:34:23,298 --> 00:34:24,126
SPEAKER_1:  How much

00:34:24,386 --> 00:34:25,662
SPEAKER_1:  how sensitive the needle's gonna be.

00:34:26,082 --> 00:34:27,038
SPEAKER_1:  and the

00:34:27,362 --> 00:34:28,254
SPEAKER_1:  The bigger dial.

00:34:28,578 --> 00:34:29,534
SPEAKER_1:  It's called the tone arm.

00:34:30,178 --> 00:34:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  And that is changing.

00:34:32,386 --> 00:34:32,894
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:34:33,186 --> 00:34:36,561
SPEAKER_1:  I want to say voltage or current, but I'm not intending. I'm going to get one of those words is wrong.

00:34:36,561 --> 00:34:40,542
SPEAKER_0:  But it is a real device. It's a real device. That you can actually calibrate.

00:34:40,994 --> 00:34:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  add to.

00:34:42,402 --> 00:34:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  Probably.

00:34:44,674 --> 00:34:46,549
SPEAKER_0:  you know, get an outcome that you want.

00:34:46,549 --> 00:34:50,206
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so here's even how just how a Scientology auditor believes it works.

00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:57,470
SPEAKER_1:  You're holding the cans, there's a tiny little battery in that emitter that's sending and you're completing the circuit when you pick up the cans, right? So you got a little thing.

00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:58,334
SPEAKER_1:  going there.

00:34:58,562 --> 00:34:59,902
SPEAKER_1:  and that needle.

00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:00,958
SPEAKER_1:  will respond.

00:35:01,218 --> 00:35:06,590
SPEAKER_1:  to your physical movement, but that's not what we want. We want you to sit the hell still so that we can read this thing when I'm asking you questions.

00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

00:35:07,938 --> 00:35:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  So you're sitting there still, very still.

00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,638
SPEAKER_1:  As still as you can, comfortable, right?

00:35:12,898 --> 00:35:15,038
SPEAKER_1:  and I'm gonna go, is there something you're withholding from me?

00:35:15,362 --> 00:35:19,806
SPEAKER_1:  And what I'm looking for is right when I say at the end of me, I'm looking for the needle to dip to the right.

00:35:19,938 --> 00:35:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  having a needle even if it's kind of random.

00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  can really be like a...

00:35:25,474 --> 00:35:26,599
SPEAKER_0:  a catalyst for a conversation.

00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:28,222
SPEAKER_1:  That's what it's used for.

00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:32,510
SPEAKER_1:  except it's an enforced conversation. So I'll give you a really good example of this.

00:35:33,154 --> 00:35:33,662
SPEAKER_1:  So.

00:35:34,594 --> 00:35:37,950
SPEAKER_1:  You're holding the cans. Say, is there anything you're withholding from me?

00:35:38,818 --> 00:35:40,062
SPEAKER_1:  and I get an instant read.

00:35:40,898 --> 00:35:42,718
SPEAKER_1:  And I go, is there anything you're withholding from me?

00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:44,350
SPEAKER_1:  You're gonna go, I don't think so.

00:35:44,674 --> 00:35:46,942
SPEAKER_1:  And I don't see the needle. No, you don't see the needle.

00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:48,510
SPEAKER_1:  I go, whoa.

00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:55,326
SPEAKER_1:  What did you think of when I asked you the question? Now, if you've already had a lot of auditing, you know how this goes. It means I got an instant read and we're not going.

00:35:56,258 --> 00:35:57,982
SPEAKER_1:  to move on until this question gets resolved.

00:35:58,626 --> 00:36:00,158
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so you're gonna go, you know what I was thinking of.

00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:01,502
SPEAKER_1:  And then I'm gonna.

00:36:01,794 --> 00:36:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  be like, you know, take a look and I'll help you out here. I'll try to steer you.

00:36:05,218 --> 00:36:07,454
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so I'm looking to get roughly the same read while you're-

00:36:08,002 --> 00:36:09,630
SPEAKER_1:  thinking about whatever. What was that?

00:36:10,338 --> 00:36:11,006
SPEAKER_1:  What was that right there?

00:36:11,426 --> 00:36:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  And you can start digging to what you can start.

00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:15,678
SPEAKER_1:  I just want an answer to the question.

00:36:16,354 --> 00:36:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, I can go to memory.

00:36:18,658 --> 00:36:23,582
SPEAKER_1:  and you can give me any answer you want. There's no way for me to know if you're giving me the right answer, but I want you to give me something.

00:36:23,906 --> 00:36:29,278
SPEAKER_1:  If you say you can't give me anything, I'm going to keep using the email until you give me something. Yeah. Okay, so let's say you give me something.

00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  I'm gonna get all the details about that.

00:36:32,866 --> 00:36:33,822
SPEAKER_1:  And until...

00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:42,782
SPEAKER_1:  like time, place, form an event. I want to know everything that happened. I want to know all the details. And by the way, I'm writing all this down. So I'm taking notes of everything you're telling me that it's a bad thing that you did that you haven't told me about.

00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:43,902
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so I'm keeping notes.

00:36:44,706 --> 00:36:47,134
SPEAKER_1:  when you represent to me that you've told me everything there is to tell.

00:36:47,426 --> 00:36:48,958
SPEAKER_1:  I'm looking for the needle.

00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  to give like a smooth back and forth motion like this.

00:36:53,154 --> 00:36:54,846
SPEAKER_1:  and Scientology calls that a floating needle.

00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,158
SPEAKER_1:  That means...

00:36:56,418 --> 00:36:57,438
SPEAKER_1:  in Scientology land.

00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:58,590
SPEAKER_1:  We're done with that.

00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:03,678
SPEAKER_1:  So now I might go back to check the question. Okay, good, I'll check the question again. Is there anything you're withholding from me?

00:37:04,258 --> 00:37:06,302
SPEAKER_1:  If I get another read, we've got to go through the process again.

00:37:06,818 --> 00:37:07,230
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:11,806
SPEAKER_1:  If you tell me I've told you everything and I don't get a floating needle, I've got to go, okay.

00:37:12,322 --> 00:37:13,822
SPEAKER_1:  Is there an earlier?

00:37:14,146 --> 00:37:14,814
SPEAKER_1:  similar.

00:37:15,586 --> 00:37:20,830
SPEAKER_1:  Have you basically done an earlier similar thing? Is there an earlier similar time you haven't told someone something or is there an earlier similar thing?

00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,686
SPEAKER_1:  that you did the thing that you just told me.

00:37:23,586 --> 00:37:28,318
SPEAKER_1:  We're gonna keep going earlier, similar, earlier, similar, until I get a floating needle.

00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:29,726
SPEAKER_1:  And that's where...

00:37:29,986 --> 00:37:32,190
SPEAKER_1:  I'm explaining it this way you can see how.

00:37:32,578 --> 00:37:35,742
SPEAKER_1:  no matter what the specific auditing session happens to be about.

00:37:36,418 --> 00:37:39,358
SPEAKER_1:  there's still the potential in any auditing session that you're going into past lives.

00:37:40,386 --> 00:37:41,246
SPEAKER_1:  just because.

00:37:41,506 --> 00:37:43,742
SPEAKER_1:  You have to go earlier similar until you get a floating needle.

00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:44,414
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

00:37:44,898 --> 00:37:45,310
SPEAKER_1:  Now.

00:37:45,602 --> 00:37:47,454
SPEAKER_1:  Here's how Scientologists think.

00:37:47,746 --> 00:37:49,438
SPEAKER_1:  the emitter actually works, meaning.

00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:52,830
SPEAKER_1:  why does the emitter work? so we talked before about these um

00:37:53,346 --> 00:37:54,622
SPEAKER_1:  these mental pictures.

00:37:54,978 --> 00:37:55,998
SPEAKER_1:  right, these recordings.

00:37:56,546 --> 00:38:00,542
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, well we spoke about engrams, just recordings of pain and unconsciousness.

00:38:01,218 --> 00:38:03,262
SPEAKER_1:  Well, Scientology would hold.

00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:06,654
SPEAKER_1:  the bad recordings aren't the only recordings.

00:38:06,914 --> 00:38:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  that you have. Those are just the recordings in your reactive mind.

00:38:09,762 --> 00:38:11,070
SPEAKER_1:  You also have an analytical mind.

00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:13,342
SPEAKER_1:  which is just your conscious memory.

00:38:13,986 --> 00:38:16,062
SPEAKER_1:  conscious recording of everything from present time to...

00:38:16,354 --> 00:38:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  the last 76 trillion years.

00:38:18,978 --> 00:38:22,910
SPEAKER_1:  And Hubbard would say that these memories are actually perfectly detailed.

00:38:23,202 --> 00:38:25,630
SPEAKER_1:  recording and these are like 56 perceptions or something.

00:38:26,146 --> 00:38:27,294
SPEAKER_1:  and that it's perfect.

00:38:28,002 --> 00:38:31,038
SPEAKER_1:  and you can access that information.

00:38:31,554 --> 00:38:32,670
SPEAKER_1:  You just have trouble doing so.

00:38:33,122 --> 00:38:33,630
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

00:38:33,922 --> 00:38:38,526
SPEAKER_1:  So he says that these recordings, these mental pictures, have actual electrical charge and mass.

00:38:39,586 --> 00:38:41,726
SPEAKER_1:  Now you asked before, is there any actual physics in this?

00:38:42,082 --> 00:38:47,134
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know, where are you supposed to store the pictures of your last 76 trillion years that have charge in mass?

00:38:47,906 --> 00:38:48,574
SPEAKER_1:  I don't see it.

00:38:48,898 --> 00:38:49,790
SPEAKER_1:  But Hubbard says it's there.

00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,854
SPEAKER_1:  So he says that these things have mass.

00:38:54,562 --> 00:38:55,006
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:57,310
SPEAKER_1:  when you recall them or put attention on them.

00:38:58,178 --> 00:38:59,550
SPEAKER_1:  You create an electrical flow.

00:39:00,386 --> 00:39:05,758
SPEAKER_1:  which maybe through magnetic fields or whatever, impinges upon the electrical flow.

00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:07,070
SPEAKER_1:  of the emeter.

00:39:07,906 --> 00:39:09,374
SPEAKER_1:  and it shows up as a read on the needle.

00:39:10,018 --> 00:39:14,750
SPEAKER_1:  That's how Scientologists believe that's why the needle reads.

00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:18,942
SPEAKER_1:  Now, Cinex would say the needle only reads on palm sweat.

00:39:19,394 --> 00:39:20,062
SPEAKER_1:  and movement.

00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:21,726
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I know that's not true.

00:39:23,074 --> 00:39:25,214
SPEAKER_1:  Right, I can't tell you everything the needle.

00:39:25,538 --> 00:39:26,238
SPEAKER_1:  does read on.

00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,574
SPEAKER_1:  But I can tell you it's not just.

00:39:29,186 --> 00:39:30,526
SPEAKER_1:  moving your hands and sweaty hands.

00:39:31,106 --> 00:39:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  It does correlate to thoughts probably.

00:39:33,634 --> 00:39:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  someway somehow.

00:39:35,074 --> 00:39:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  Because if it didn't correlate to thoughts that this process would be way

00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  Way too inefficient.

00:39:40,706 --> 00:39:47,678
SPEAKER_0:  Because it would be too, there's going to be a bunch of people who are just not, you're not going to get the, what is it called, the floating needle.

00:39:48,354 --> 00:39:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  Like no matter what.

00:39:49,698 --> 00:39:51,966
SPEAKER_1:  I can't explain to you how you get a floating needle.

00:39:52,354 --> 00:39:53,758
SPEAKER_1:  but it sure as hell isn't hand sweat.

00:39:54,178 --> 00:39:57,095
SPEAKER_1:  and it sure as hell isn't squeezing the cans. Right, so you eventually-

00:39:57,095 --> 00:39:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  most people will get to the floating needle.

00:39:59,362 --> 00:40:00,670
SPEAKER_1:  And somehow you get floating needles.

00:40:00,802 --> 00:40:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  There's like a feed, there probably is a feedback mechanism that you will-

00:40:04,418 --> 00:40:07,902
SPEAKER_0:  Each person realizes how their mind and body.

00:40:08,258 --> 00:40:10,883
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. Because you want a resolution, right? It's probably a-

00:40:10,883 --> 00:40:12,903
SPEAKER_1:  your needle to float. For both people...

00:40:12,903 --> 00:40:16,653
SPEAKER_0:  Yes. And it's probably a great experience when you're like, yes, it's a game of.

00:40:16,653 --> 00:40:21,534
SPEAKER_1:  feeling, right? Well, when you're training on how to use the emitter, there are drills where you practice.

00:40:21,826 --> 00:40:23,454
SPEAKER_1:  you generating with your mind.

00:40:24,002 --> 00:40:30,782
SPEAKER_1:  various needle reactions. So, you know, there is a drill where you sit there and you consciously try to create a floating needle by recalling happy thoughts.

00:40:31,074 --> 00:40:32,094
SPEAKER_1:  Go to your happy place.

00:40:32,994 --> 00:40:36,702
SPEAKER_1:  And at the end of every auditing session, you actually have to go to a third party.

00:40:37,026 --> 00:40:39,390
SPEAKER_1:  sit down in front of a knee meter and verify that your knee is floating.

00:40:40,162 --> 00:40:45,502
SPEAKER_1:  Every single auditing session not only has to end on a floating needle, but then you have to go to someone else and have the floating needle verified.

00:40:45,922 --> 00:40:47,614
SPEAKER_1:  Any Scientologist who's

00:40:48,034 --> 00:40:52,350
SPEAKER_1:  a seasoned recipient of auditing knows how to make their needle float at the exam.

00:40:53,922 --> 00:40:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  But I gotta be honest though, this process again.

00:40:57,186 --> 00:40:58,814
SPEAKER_0:  Sorry to be going there, but.

00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  It feels like this is a very rigorous talk.

00:41:04,834 --> 00:41:06,014
SPEAKER_0:  therapy session.

00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  Is there good aspects to this?

00:41:08,322 --> 00:41:08,734
SPEAKER_1:  Sure.

00:41:09,026 --> 00:41:12,478
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of people find auditing very helpful. I mean, I've heard some describe it as.

00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:13,982
SPEAKER_1:  thoroughly addictive.

00:41:14,402 --> 00:41:16,542
SPEAKER_1:  Me personally, I never enjoyed getting auditing.

00:41:16,994 --> 00:41:18,590
SPEAKER_1:  That's probably more a function of having.

00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:23,934
SPEAKER_1:  been raised in it and it was never something I wanted to do, something that was forced on me as a child, you know, and also I was never.

00:41:24,354 --> 00:41:29,918
SPEAKER_1:  I don't like talking about private secret stuff. Like you kind of have to want to be an open book.

00:41:30,594 --> 00:41:31,646
SPEAKER_1:  Sure. Just playing the channel.

00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:34,398
SPEAKER_1:  honestly and thoroughly participate in an auditing session.

00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:37,662
SPEAKER_0:  Because there's not necessarily a belief that this is going to be private.

00:41:37,986 --> 00:41:43,262
SPEAKER_1:  There's no expectation of privacy, but there's no expectation that your stuff's gonna be leaked or blackmail either.

00:41:44,098 --> 00:41:44,606
SPEAKER_1:  You kinda-

00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:47,038
SPEAKER_1:  You trust the people in the organization.

00:41:47,842 --> 00:41:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  even despite rumors and stuff like that. But the rumors are coming from people that are lying to you, essentially.

00:41:53,986 --> 00:41:55,390
SPEAKER_1:  if you're a Scientologist.

00:41:55,618 --> 00:41:59,070
SPEAKER_1:  and you're participating in an auditing session.

00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:01,854
SPEAKER_1:  You know that any one in the organization is.

00:42:02,914 --> 00:42:03,870
SPEAKER_1:  has the ability to.

00:42:04,194 --> 00:42:09,214
SPEAKER_1:  know the stuff that you talk. It's not like, oh my God, I'm only telling my auditor because I think no one's ever gonna know. You know that people know.

00:42:09,634 --> 00:42:11,038
SPEAKER_1:  but you also trust the organization.

00:42:11,682 --> 00:42:14,110
SPEAKER_0:  How quickly does it go to past memories?

00:42:14,306 --> 00:42:15,774
SPEAKER_1:  For people who are seasoned...

00:42:16,482 --> 00:42:18,302
SPEAKER_1:  Like they actually like going past life.

00:42:19,074 --> 00:42:21,374
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. I hated it. I would make sure-

00:42:21,634 --> 00:42:23,070
SPEAKER_1:  I was really good at making my needle float.

00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:26,302
SPEAKER_1:  I didn't want to have some auditor because I never believed in the best life memory.

00:42:27,138 --> 00:42:35,390
SPEAKER_1:  So I didn't want to be in that impassable, reach an impasse in an auditing session where I was being asked for something I couldn't provide. Cause I knew this auditing session has to end on a good point.

00:42:35,938 --> 00:42:38,046
SPEAKER_1:  But Scientologists enjoy!

00:42:38,338 --> 00:42:41,118
SPEAKER_1:  for the most part, going, they call it whole track. Whole track is past life.

00:42:41,794 --> 00:42:42,462
SPEAKER_1:  going whole track.

00:42:42,818 --> 00:42:44,350
SPEAKER_1:  Your time track, they call it the time track.

00:42:44,578 --> 00:42:47,678
SPEAKER_1:  is your whole memory, but whole track refers to anything past life.

00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:57,534
SPEAKER_1:  Okay. So going whole track or deep whole track with high reality, meaning it's not like, oh, I have a fuzzy memory and I'm not sure if it's real. Like your real season Scientologists are like.

00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:02,015
SPEAKER_1:  Oh yeah, I was on this planet this time circling this garden. This is what I was eating for breakfast.

00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:05,822
SPEAKER_0:  Fascinating before the origin of life on Earth.

00:43:06,178 --> 00:43:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  So billions of years ago.

00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:13,278
SPEAKER_0:  on a distant planet where you were eating for breakfast. Or other universes. I wonder if this is-

00:43:13,794 --> 00:43:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  Nice shortcut.

00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:20,062
SPEAKER_0:  to sneak up to actual trauma that happened to you as a therapy device.

00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  I just, so putting Scientology aside is just.

00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:24,030
SPEAKER_0:  I'm thinking about.

00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:25,598
SPEAKER_0:  as a technique for therapy.

00:43:26,146 --> 00:43:26,942
SPEAKER_0:  discussing.

00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:34,430
SPEAKER_0:  Basically, you know, some people have trauma and one of the things you do with therapy is like bring the trauma to the surface. The stuff that happened to you childhood.

00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe it's a more convenient thing to do.

00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  kind of map that indirectly onto

00:43:40,066 --> 00:43:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  fictitious.

00:43:41,442 --> 00:43:41,886
SPEAKER_0:  telling.

00:43:42,338 --> 00:43:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  of what happened to you.

00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  something like that trauma on a distant planet elsewhere.

00:43:47,618 --> 00:43:49,278
SPEAKER_0:  Could be a nice way to sneak up to it.

00:43:49,474 --> 00:43:49,790
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:43:50,082 --> 00:43:53,182
SPEAKER_1:  And it goes both flows there, not just things that have happened to you, but things that you've done.

00:43:53,986 --> 00:43:56,510
SPEAKER_1:  So, you know, you could be being asked for it.

00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:59,262
SPEAKER_1:  You know, you'd be going back, I wiped out a civilization.

00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,534
SPEAKER_1:  I committed genocide on

00:44:01,922 --> 00:44:03,006
SPEAKER_1:  this race on this planet.

00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:04,446
SPEAKER_1:  Oh yeah.

00:44:05,186 --> 00:44:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  So you can actually take on a whole new-

00:44:07,202 --> 00:44:07,614
SPEAKER_0:  guilt.

00:44:07,874 --> 00:44:09,694
SPEAKER_0:  Oh yeah. Eh, okay.

00:44:10,082 --> 00:44:12,766
SPEAKER_0:  Alright, you might actually take on a lot more guilt than I go off.

00:44:13,954 --> 00:44:14,782
SPEAKER_0:  Because if you feel...

00:44:15,074 --> 00:44:16,926
SPEAKER_0:  Like that's a critical aspect.

00:44:17,538 --> 00:44:18,526
SPEAKER_0:  of the brain.

00:44:19,842 --> 00:44:22,238
SPEAKER_0:  Boy, because my brain is really self-critical.

00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:27,454
SPEAKER_0:  so I could see myself manufacturing if I was forced to over time, some kind of story where I didn't.

00:44:27,778 --> 00:44:32,798
SPEAKER_0:  genocide a whole population of like Pluto or something a different distant is somewhere in office and tarry

00:44:32,994 --> 00:44:35,619
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so I mean, now I walk around with that guilt.

00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:37,119
SPEAKER_0:  way I'm actually a horrible

00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:47,422
SPEAKER_1:  person. So imagine though, if you had not only are you looking at, you know, if someone's being self-critical, trying to identify destructive patterns of behavior in your present life, but what if you really internalize the fact that

00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,150
SPEAKER_1:  I haven't only been this way.

00:44:49,954 --> 00:44:50,974
SPEAKER_1:  for 40 years.

00:44:51,202 --> 00:44:53,342
SPEAKER_1:  I've been this way for 40 trillion years.

00:44:54,626 --> 00:44:56,798
SPEAKER_1:  But Scientology would argue.

00:44:57,890 --> 00:44:58,398
SPEAKER_1:  that.

00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:01,598
SPEAKER_1:  As a Thayton, you're inherently good.

00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:03,358
SPEAKER_1:  All things are basically good.

00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:08,510
SPEAKER_1:  So the goal of the auditing procedure there would be essentially to figure out, find the moment.

00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:10,430
SPEAKER_1:  Find what it was that caused you.

00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:12,414
SPEAKER_1:  to make that shift.

00:45:12,802 --> 00:45:13,566
SPEAKER_1:  as a being.

00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:15,230
SPEAKER_1:  to.

00:45:15,778 --> 00:45:18,110
SPEAKER_1:  dramatize evil intentions and stuff like that.

00:45:18,402 --> 00:45:20,222
SPEAKER_1:  So even if you're going whole track.

00:45:20,962 --> 00:45:22,782
SPEAKER_1:  looking at all the horrible things you've done.

00:45:23,202 --> 00:45:24,606
SPEAKER_1:  The goal is to find like...

00:45:24,962 --> 00:45:28,190
SPEAKER_1:  Well, what happened just prior to that? What was like the prior confusion and-

00:45:28,482 --> 00:45:37,150
SPEAKER_1:  What did you misunderstand just before that and whatnot? So the goal is basically, so Scientologists after a lot of auditing are also convinced that they have fixed.

00:45:38,242 --> 00:45:38,846
SPEAKER_1:  The reason.

00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:40,830
SPEAKER_1:  for any non-optimum.

00:45:41,762 --> 00:45:42,174
SPEAKER_1:  conduct.

00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:45,182
SPEAKER_0:  And underlying this is a belief that at the core.

00:45:45,474 --> 00:45:46,302
SPEAKER_0:  We're all good.

00:45:46,626 --> 00:45:52,766
SPEAKER_0:  Yes. There's a lot of really powerful ideas in Scientology. That's true. Which is so interesting that it goes wrong. Yeah.

00:45:53,026 --> 00:46:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, what about the training you mentioned? The training of the auditor, that's really interesting. So how lengthy is that process? It can take years.

00:46:01,858 --> 00:46:02,750
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, one of that.

00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  Question I want to ask is are people in Sea Org, like as an auditor, do you-

00:46:07,266 --> 00:46:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  believe everything how much

00:46:09,026 --> 00:46:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  Is there a crisis of faith?

00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:12,382
SPEAKER_0:  creeps in.

00:46:12,994 --> 00:46:15,006
SPEAKER_0:  Religion you have a crisis of faith when you

00:46:15,426 --> 00:46:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  start to wonder like does God even exist?

00:46:17,922 --> 00:46:18,878
SPEAKER_0:  So in this case.

00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  How often do you start to doubt?

00:46:21,666 --> 00:46:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  that some of the core beliefs of Scientology are false.

00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:29,278
SPEAKER_1:  Scientology would say that Scientology is not about beliefs, it's about.

00:46:29,922 --> 00:46:36,414
SPEAKER_1:  application of the techniques of Scientology auditing to improve someone's spiritual awareness and ability.

00:46:36,962 --> 00:46:40,574
SPEAKER_1:  So the belief level of Scientology is pretty much.

00:46:40,962 --> 00:46:42,087
SPEAKER_1:  the stuff we've already discussed.

00:46:42,087 --> 00:46:43,587
SPEAKER_0:  the effectiveness of the audit across

00:46:43,587 --> 00:46:47,550
SPEAKER_1:  So the effectiveness of the auditing process is one of the things Hubbard says is that

00:46:47,842 --> 00:46:48,926
SPEAKER_1:  standard.

00:46:49,858 --> 00:46:54,846
SPEAKER_1:  standard Scientology, they call it the tech, the technology of how to deliver auditing, standard tech, worth $100,000.

00:46:55,106 --> 00:46:55,678
SPEAKER_1:  100.

00:46:56,098 --> 00:46:57,086
SPEAKER_1:  percent of the time?

00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:00,062
SPEAKER_1:  When applied, 100% correctly.

00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:01,726
SPEAKER_1:  Well, that's kind of unfalsifiable, right?

00:47:02,594 --> 00:47:05,214
SPEAKER_1:  because anytime it doesn't work, it wasn't applied correctly. Exactly.

00:47:06,082 --> 00:47:07,294
SPEAKER_1:  That's a nice little, uh...

00:47:07,714 --> 00:47:09,950
SPEAKER_1:  escape hatch to pull on having a crisis of faith.

00:47:10,658 --> 00:47:11,646
SPEAKER_1:  But it didn't work.

00:47:12,738 --> 00:47:16,318
SPEAKER_1:  and obviously it wasn't applied correctly. That's where quality control comes in.

00:47:16,674 --> 00:47:18,174
SPEAKER_1:  Their job is to nitpick.

00:47:18,466 --> 00:47:20,830
SPEAKER_1:  And you can always find one thing that wasn't done correctly.

00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:21,790
SPEAKER_0:  communism.

00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  uh, didn't work because it wasn't implemented correctly. That's the.

00:47:26,434 --> 00:47:29,502
SPEAKER_0:  It's always an escape hatch with ideologies.

00:47:29,602 --> 00:47:32,894
SPEAKER_1:  That's right. That's right. I would probably argue that auditors.

00:47:33,378 --> 00:47:34,462
SPEAKER_1:  um... are not

00:47:34,754 --> 00:47:38,942
SPEAKER_1:  in a position of having many crisis of faith, because actually they're usually seeing people.

00:47:39,362 --> 00:47:40,158
SPEAKER_1:  for the most part.

00:47:40,802 --> 00:47:42,494
SPEAKER_1:  improve in some ways.

00:47:43,138 --> 00:47:44,350
SPEAKER_1:  it through the process of auditing.

00:47:44,674 --> 00:47:44,990
SPEAKER_1:  Now.

00:47:45,538 --> 00:47:47,966
SPEAKER_1:  Auditing can create like a state of somewhat of a euphoric state.

00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:49,182
SPEAKER_1:  You feel.

00:47:49,474 --> 00:47:51,486
SPEAKER_1:  You're just blown out of your head.

00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:55,486
SPEAKER_1:  You know you feel fear on top of the world i've had that in some of my auditing.

00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,878
SPEAKER_1:  as an auditor so you know as a person receiving on it

00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:07,774
SPEAKER_1:  And so my point is that as an auditor doing a lot of auditing, you know, you're going to have someone in front of you called the pre clear is the person in front of you who's getting the auditing called the PC or the pre clear.

00:48:08,674 --> 00:48:16,830
SPEAKER_1:  They see over and over and over again, these pieces having these sort of euphoric states and floating needles, and I feel great and fantastic. Thanks, you saved my life and da da da da da.

00:48:17,986 --> 00:48:22,846
SPEAKER_1:  I've always said if people didn't find Scientology helpful, nobody would ever stay in Scientology.

00:48:24,418 --> 00:48:31,070
SPEAKER_1:  And so auditors are pretty much the ones doing the heavy lifting of what it even means to be a Scientologist. Those guys aren't the ones that you end up.

00:48:31,522 --> 00:48:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  I'm having crisis of faith. I mean, doing Scientology, auditing, it doesn't require.

00:48:36,322 --> 00:48:37,630
SPEAKER_1:  that you believe just.

00:48:38,146 --> 00:48:39,678
SPEAKER_1:  have faith that you believe something.

00:48:40,098 --> 00:48:45,598
SPEAKER_1:  You just have to go through these motions. And Scientologists, one of the reasons Scientologists think this is all scientific is because it's like.

00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:48,318
SPEAKER_1:  I don't care if you believe why this works.

00:48:48,546 --> 00:48:50,558
SPEAKER_1:  I care how you feel at the end of an auditing session.

00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  and empirically speaking.

00:48:53,442 --> 00:48:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  like anecdotal data is it actually seems to improve people's lives within the context.

00:48:59,426 --> 00:49:00,926
SPEAKER_0:  taking the outside world out of it.

00:49:01,314 --> 00:49:03,166
SPEAKER_0:  within this particular organization.

00:49:03,906 --> 00:49:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  you're actually...

00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  measurably seeing improvement. Yes. Is that to some degree real?

00:49:10,242 --> 00:49:12,574
SPEAKER_0:  Because like, if you look at a book like Animal Farm.

00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:16,350
SPEAKER_0:  where the pigs start to rule the other animals.

00:49:16,866 --> 00:49:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  And over time the life of the animals gets worse and worse and worse while the pigs keep saying that it's actually getting better and better and better. Again, communism, same thing.

00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:27,902
SPEAKER_0:  the rationing was getting worse and worse and worse, less and less food.

00:49:28,194 --> 00:49:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  but there's constant reporting.

00:49:30,306 --> 00:49:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  that there's more and more food where

00:49:32,834 --> 00:49:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  We're winning. Hashtag.

00:49:34,274 --> 00:49:37,438
SPEAKER_1:  I would argue that what you've just described could be.

00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:42,462
SPEAKER_1:  an identical description of what it feels like and what it means to go up Scientology's bridge to total freedom.

00:49:43,426 --> 00:49:47,102
SPEAKER_1:  You are reinforcing to yourself that everything's getting better and better and better and

00:49:47,426 --> 00:49:48,126
SPEAKER_1:  and you'd be like...

00:49:49,218 --> 00:49:54,398
SPEAKER_1:  You don't spend time with your family anymore. You're broke even though you make a lot of money.

00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:59,838
SPEAKER_1:  You're always stressed. You're at the beck and call of these people who seem to run your...

00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,342
SPEAKER_1:  run your lives like.

00:50:01,698 --> 00:50:03,806
SPEAKER_1:  how a Scientologist feels about their own life.

00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:05,246
SPEAKER_1:  is.

00:50:05,986 --> 00:50:08,222
SPEAKER_1:  It's very interesting to compare that to how that.

00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:09,950
SPEAKER_1:  person's life looks.

00:50:10,338 --> 00:50:12,190
SPEAKER_1:  to their non-scientology family members.

00:50:12,514 --> 00:50:14,174
SPEAKER_1:  I get contacted by a lot of people.

00:50:14,434 --> 00:50:15,902
SPEAKER_1:  who've never been in Scientology.

00:50:16,578 --> 00:50:24,030
SPEAKER_1:  but like I got a family member who's really deep and I just, can you help me understand some things? Why is this person's life like this? Why is this person's life like this?

00:50:24,962 --> 00:50:25,342
SPEAKER_1:  So.

00:50:26,018 --> 00:50:27,998
SPEAKER_1:  I don't want to say that

00:50:28,354 --> 00:50:29,534
SPEAKER_1:  Scientologists.

00:50:29,858 --> 00:50:31,166
SPEAKER_1:  Do not actually.

00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:34,270
SPEAKER_1:  I don't want to say, oh, it's all in their heads. They think they're being helped, but they're really not.

00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:35,550
SPEAKER_1:  That doesn't feel honest.

00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:36,350
SPEAKER_1:  You know?

00:50:36,994 --> 00:50:40,798
SPEAKER_1:  but it's this thing where if Scientology was just.

00:50:41,826 --> 00:50:42,558
SPEAKER_1:  Getting auditing.

00:50:43,842 --> 00:50:44,638
SPEAKER_1:  when you want it.

00:50:46,434 --> 00:50:47,838
SPEAKER_1:  about the subjects you wanted.

00:50:48,418 --> 00:50:49,406
SPEAKER_1:  and you can take it or leave it.

00:50:49,986 --> 00:50:50,558
SPEAKER_1:  That would be fine.

00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:51,902
SPEAKER_1:  It's.

00:50:52,194 --> 00:50:56,830
SPEAKER_1:  It's the fact that it's part and parcel to this entire organization and this entire experience.

00:50:57,698 --> 00:50:58,430
SPEAKER_1:  that

00:50:59,138 --> 00:50:59,838
SPEAKER_1:  has.

00:51:00,386 --> 00:51:06,974
SPEAKER_1:  as a part of that experience, taking everything from you, demanding everything from you, controlling who you can speak with.

00:51:07,554 --> 00:51:11,678
SPEAKER_1:  controlling who you can have relationships with, who you have to erase from your life.

00:51:11,906 --> 00:51:13,662
SPEAKER_1:  This is where and it's hard to it's hard to.

00:51:13,986 --> 00:51:14,782
SPEAKER_1:  place one.

00:51:15,234 --> 00:51:17,886
SPEAKER_1:  pinpoint on this is where Scientology goes wrong.

00:51:18,114 --> 00:51:18,974
SPEAKER_1:  It's really hard to do that.

00:51:19,458 --> 00:51:22,110
SPEAKER_1:  because the good parts of Scientology and the bad parts of Scientology.

00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:24,030
SPEAKER_1:  are all just Scientology.

00:51:24,546 --> 00:51:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, so there's definition of what's bad for you and it's probably in the beginning is bad for you.

00:51:29,986 --> 00:51:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  Um, it's almost just.

00:51:31,586 --> 00:51:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  sounds like a template of a toxic relationship.

00:51:34,274 --> 00:51:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  You know, there's a bunch of stuff in this world that are just not good for you.

00:51:37,506 --> 00:51:37,886
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  the authoritarian says like, I'm just protecting you by.

00:51:43,586 --> 00:51:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  blocking you off from those negative things. And they're probably negative, they are probably negative things.

00:51:47,714 --> 00:51:48,638
SPEAKER_0:  But then this like...

00:51:49,346 --> 00:51:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  This freedom starts closing in

00:51:52,034 --> 00:51:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  to where you can't no longer.

00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  Speak freely, think freely, act freely.

00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  And there's some, I mean, that's why I sort of power corrupts.

00:52:00,002 --> 00:52:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  and absolute power corrupts absolutely that person doing the controlling

00:52:04,514 --> 00:52:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  actually starts getting

00:52:06,466 --> 00:52:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  that like dopamine rush.

00:52:08,386 --> 00:52:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  of the controller that's exciting. It's a vicious negative cycle. So you start out.

00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  as a-

00:52:14,754 --> 00:52:15,518
SPEAKER_0:  It starts out.

00:52:15,746 --> 00:52:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  Good.

00:52:16,514 --> 00:52:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  because he's trying to do good for the person.

00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:19,678
SPEAKER_0:  Um, but then it

00:52:19,938 --> 00:52:21,182
SPEAKER_0:  somehow goes to shit.

00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. So what, what, uh, what are the aspects that just, that are often controlled about.

00:52:27,042 --> 00:52:29,406
SPEAKER_0:  about a person who's in cytology, especially C-work.

00:52:29,666 --> 00:52:30,110
SPEAKER_1:  Well...

00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:35,486
SPEAKER_1:  Information control access to the internet access to any information critical of Scientology.

00:52:35,714 --> 00:52:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  Is some Internet access allowed?

00:52:38,978 --> 00:52:40,222
SPEAKER_1:  public Scientologists.

00:52:40,578 --> 00:52:41,150
SPEAKER_1:  has no.

00:52:41,378 --> 00:52:43,454
SPEAKER_1:  restrictions to their access to the internet.

00:52:43,746 --> 00:52:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  They're just not allowed.

00:52:45,506 --> 00:52:48,062
SPEAKER_1:  to read anything critical of Scientology.

00:52:48,866 --> 00:52:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, okay, so they're supposed to self control.

00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:53,598
SPEAKER_0:  what they read or not.

00:52:53,986 --> 00:52:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  And what's the explanation?

00:52:56,226 --> 00:52:59,902
SPEAKER_0:  Is it always assumed that anything critical of Scientology is a lie?

00:53:00,674 --> 00:53:02,014
SPEAKER_1:  They really pushed this thing.

00:53:02,274 --> 00:53:03,038
SPEAKER_1:  that uh...

00:53:04,002 --> 00:53:05,310
SPEAKER_1:  Unless you've...

00:53:05,858 --> 00:53:08,222
SPEAKER_1:  been in a Scientology organization yourself.

00:53:08,674 --> 00:53:11,262
SPEAKER_1:  or unless you've actually been a Scientologist.

00:53:11,682 --> 00:53:13,694
SPEAKER_1:  You couldn't possibly know the truth about Scientology.

00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:15,358
SPEAKER_1:  If you're only getting information.

00:53:15,682 --> 00:53:20,542
SPEAKER_1:  from people who aren't members or former members, then you couldn't possibly be getting the correct information.

00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:21,758
SPEAKER_1:  Now, they don't...

00:53:22,018 --> 00:53:25,886
SPEAKER_1:  realize the math there doesn't make sense. If you can find out the true information.

00:53:26,178 --> 00:53:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  by becoming and being a Scientologist.

00:53:28,642 --> 00:53:29,470
SPEAKER_1:  then that means...

00:53:29,954 --> 00:53:40,670
SPEAKER_1:  you can get the correct information from a former Scientologist because they traveled that path and they got the correct information. So they still create this, they try to create this unfalsifiable loop where unless you are personally...

00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:41,502
SPEAKER_1:  doing it.

00:53:41,826 --> 00:53:43,742
SPEAKER_1:  you don't have correct information.

00:53:44,098 --> 00:53:46,238
SPEAKER_1:  And you go, what about the people who did personally do it?

00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:48,254
SPEAKER_1:  got the correct information.

00:53:49,122 --> 00:53:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  laugh.

00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:57,502
SPEAKER_1:  and are now sharing that with others. Well, no, those are lies. Well, okay, so just anything you don't like is a lie then. You go, yeah, pretty much, that's kind of how it.

00:53:57,858 --> 00:53:58,430
SPEAKER_1:  That's kind of how it works.

00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  So what about the control of negative information on the internet?

00:54:01,986 --> 00:54:07,774
SPEAKER_0:  What like the actual operations I've, you know, preparing, I should admit I don't know.

00:54:08,002 --> 00:54:09,406
SPEAKER_0:  much about Scientology.

00:54:09,698 --> 00:54:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  doing a bunch of reading and...

00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  The Wikipedia page on Scientology, interestingly enough, is not that negative about Scientology.

00:54:17,634 --> 00:54:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  uh

00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,454
SPEAKER_0:  So like, it made me ask.

00:54:20,578 --> 00:54:23,966
SPEAKER_0:  yet if you would be careful how you can send stuff from a computer here to

00:54:24,418 --> 00:54:30,366
SPEAKER_0:  consider because money can buy things there. There's certain special interests and so on. But like it made me wonder like.

00:54:30,882 --> 00:54:34,686
SPEAKER_0:  Like with a lot of controversial topics, what is true and where do I look?

00:54:35,042 --> 00:54:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  where do I go for truth? So like how much

00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:42,686
SPEAKER_0:  sort of deliberate action is there to control what is true on the internet by Scientology

00:54:43,106 --> 00:54:47,934
SPEAKER_1:  Well, these days they've pretty much, I think, thrown in the towel, but they have the Scientology middle management.

00:54:48,642 --> 00:54:49,086
SPEAKER_1:  was.

00:54:49,922 --> 00:54:54,622
SPEAKER_1:  Editing Wikipedia so often from IP addresses that were traced back to the Scientology buildings that

00:54:55,074 --> 00:55:00,190
SPEAKER_1:  uh... wikipedia lock them out from any i p addresses associated with Scientology from being able to edit it.

00:55:00,514 --> 00:55:01,022
SPEAKER_1:  It's like.

00:55:01,474 --> 00:55:05,278
SPEAKER_1:  Scientology was so infatuated with trying to control the information

00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:09,886
SPEAKER_1:  And in the early days of the internet, they had a certain degree of success with that. It's just hopeless these days.

00:55:10,178 --> 00:55:12,862
SPEAKER_0:  the scale the scales not that but actually i'm very surprised

00:55:13,186 --> 00:55:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  how

00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  bot farms, how effective that can be at a very small scale. If you just pay.

00:55:19,202 --> 00:55:20,094
SPEAKER_0:  100 people.

00:55:20,418 --> 00:55:21,854
SPEAKER_0:  Just spread narratives.

00:55:22,434 --> 00:55:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  But the...

00:55:24,098 --> 00:55:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  the bad stuff, the.

00:55:25,346 --> 00:55:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  The reason that's effective is you can kind of...

00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  create conspiracy theories.

00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:33,342
SPEAKER_0:  that create chaos and nobody knows what is true.

00:55:33,666 --> 00:55:34,974
SPEAKER_0:  that bot farms can do.

00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  but actually really nicely control a narrative is hard.

00:55:38,914 --> 00:55:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  So to create chaos.

00:55:40,866 --> 00:55:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  it's easier to do to basically say like.

00:55:44,194 --> 00:55:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:55:45,154 --> 00:55:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  You know, do PR control is very hard.

00:55:47,714 --> 00:55:50,046
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, so especially on the internet, especially when...

00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:51,838
SPEAKER_0:  The Critical Eye.

00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:58,343
SPEAKER_0:  is there. The internet can smell bullshit, which is one of the really really powerful things about the internet. And I gotta tell ya, it- expect-

00:55:58,343 --> 00:56:00,030
SPEAKER_1:  It's one of the reasons I do my YouTube channel.

00:56:00,642 --> 00:56:04,126
SPEAKER_1:  It's one of the reasons I decided to upload every day. I've uploaded every day for the last six months.

00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:07,390
SPEAKER_1:  I just wanted there to be a non stop.

00:56:07,938 --> 00:56:08,350
SPEAKER_1:  flow.

00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:09,982
SPEAKER_1:  of information.

00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:11,998
SPEAKER_1:  of any kind and any variety.

00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  As long as it's fair.

00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:15,742
SPEAKER_1:  and balanced, intelligent.

00:56:16,162 --> 00:56:19,614
SPEAKER_1:  Interesting that Scientologists who stumble upon the internet

00:56:20,066 --> 00:56:20,830
SPEAKER_1:  We're going, oh look!

00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:22,622
SPEAKER_1:  Someone's talking about my thing.

00:56:23,106 --> 00:56:24,222
SPEAKER_1:  Let's see what they got going on.

00:56:25,154 --> 00:56:27,006
SPEAKER_1:  And I know this guy.

00:56:27,394 --> 00:56:28,542
SPEAKER_1:  The fact that Scientology.

00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:33,406
SPEAKER_1:  so much information before before YouTube before like I have the only like

00:56:33,634 --> 00:56:36,638
SPEAKER_1:  big Scientology channel. And that only got big in the last six months.

00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:40,254
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so before that there were channels, there was things, but it's almost like.

00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:41,534
SPEAKER_1:  It took a lot of.

00:56:42,338 --> 00:56:46,622
SPEAKER_1:  Like people felt like it took a lot of bravery and courage to like say something.

00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:52,830
SPEAKER_1:  on the internet about Scientology and so people would pop up and there weren't very many voices and I was like I want this to be prolific.

00:56:53,282 --> 00:56:59,326
SPEAKER_1:  I want to be prolific. I want to have 30 or 40 other channels being prolific so that Scientology couldn't.

00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:00,894
SPEAKER_1:  Possibly.

00:57:01,346 --> 00:57:02,494
SPEAKER_1:  successfully control.

00:57:02,882 --> 00:57:03,774
SPEAKER_1:  the narrative about it.

00:57:04,002 --> 00:57:09,150
SPEAKER_1:  Have you been personally attacked? AaronSmithLevin.com is a website created by the Church of Scientology.

00:57:09,538 --> 00:57:10,046
SPEAKER_1:  Have you seen it?

00:57:10,658 --> 00:57:11,934
SPEAKER_1:  what kind of content is on there.

00:57:12,386 --> 00:57:18,462
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, Aaron's an abusive father and a horrible husband and the worst staff member we've ever had and gave him adrenaline cm유

00:57:18,722 --> 00:57:23,710
SPEAKER_1:  I openly talk about it because I think the fact that Scientology even does things like that is.

00:57:24,194 --> 00:57:25,118
SPEAKER_1:  Fucking hilarious.

00:57:25,378 --> 00:57:26,174
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:29,950
SPEAKER_1:  uh... anything that tried to do me a mark i get the way i think about it is

00:57:30,402 --> 00:57:35,134
SPEAKER_1:  you know you're just giving me an opportunity to turn the mirror back on you and show everyone how horrible you are

00:57:35,298 --> 00:57:36,030
SPEAKER_0:  Does it stick?

00:57:37,538 --> 00:57:40,807
SPEAKER_0:  Do you find that there is ineffective? It's completely ineffective.

00:57:40,807 --> 00:57:42,622
SPEAKER_1:  They're so over the top.

00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:45,342
SPEAKER_1:  And I'll tell you how the website even came into being.

00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:48,734
SPEAKER_1:  So I was on the first season of Leah Remini Scientology in the aftermath.

00:57:49,698 --> 00:57:50,302
SPEAKER_1:  Every

00:57:50,562 --> 00:57:53,342
SPEAKER_1:  single person who participated in that show got a website.

00:57:54,914 --> 00:57:57,182
SPEAKER_1:  It's just that everyone else's website is like.

00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,358
SPEAKER_1:  Who is MarkHedley.com?

00:57:59,682 --> 00:58:01,598
SPEAKER_1:  Who is MikeRender.com?

00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:06,654
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I bought who is Aaron Smith Levin dot com, but I was too stupid to buy Aaron. I didn't buy Aaron Smith Levin.

00:58:07,394 --> 00:58:08,862
SPEAKER_1:  So I'm actually the only one.

00:58:09,218 --> 00:58:12,286
SPEAKER_1:  who has a website in their name. Oh, nice. best seller.

00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:16,030
SPEAKER_1:  And I'm like, I can't really get a lawyer to get it back for me. But I'm like, why?

00:58:16,354 --> 00:58:20,062
SPEAKER_1:  I want everyone to see what a nasty, petty

00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:25,325
SPEAKER_1:  disgusting organization that this is. And nobody believes anything Scientology says anyway. does object.

00:58:25,325 --> 00:58:26,825
SPEAKER_0:  on public know that it comes from scientific research.

00:58:26,825 --> 00:58:33,726

SPEAKER_0:  Read about Aaron Smith-Levins, an angry man spreading hate from an-

00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:50,494
SPEAKER_0:  from the internet's shadows.

00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  Open mouth shot.

00:58:53,666 --> 00:58:56,291
SPEAKER_0:  And you're saying like at the, wow, there's testimony.

00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:58,541
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, there's videos from former

00:59:01,762 --> 00:59:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  and he just goes totally nuts.

00:59:03,618 --> 00:59:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  Well, that one is true. I didn't understand why you slapped me before the interview.

00:59:07,042 --> 00:59:12,894
SPEAKER_1:  I thought that... They got links to everyone else's website on the bottom. It's so funny. Who is, okay. See, 성공은 �icked.

00:59:13,122 --> 00:59:19,678
SPEAKER_1:  2021 Church of Scientology International, all rights reserved. Here's an example of just Scientology's complete lack of self-awareness.

00:59:20,322 --> 00:59:23,326

SPEAKER_1:  The reason we created the bobblehead is because on Mike Rinder's hate site.

00:59:43,362 --> 00:59:46,430
SPEAKER_1:  Scientology created a GIF or a GIF. How do you say it? Scientology created a GIF or a GIF.

00:59:46,722 --> 00:59:56,094
SPEAKER_1:  The correct way is GIF. GIF, good. Scientology created a GIF of Mike Rinder as a bobblehead. It was an insult like, oh, all he does is sit next to Leah Remini and go, yes, Leah, yes, Leah.

00:59:56,386 --> 00:59:58,398
SPEAKER_1:  and so they they made a gift of him with a bobblehead.

00:59:58,658 --> 00:59:59,550
SPEAKER_1:  So we were like.

00:59:59,906 --> 01:00:06,718
SPEAKER_1:  We're gonna make mic render bobbleheads and we're gonna sell them on the spshop.com to raise money for the Aftermath Foundation. Love it.

01:00:07,138 --> 01:00:17,246
SPEAKER_1:  And now that I go out and buy, yeah, go to thescreenshop.com and get yourself a mic render bobblehead. Now look, now that my profile is getting a little higher, this head was made to bobble. Like this.

01:00:17,762 --> 01:00:21,887
SPEAKER_1:  smooth shiny head needs its own bobble head now. It does. 100%

01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:23,387
SPEAKER_0:  it does i can't believe it doesn't

01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:29,854
SPEAKER_1:  So, but let me show you. So here's what's happening here. We just hired some day laborers off of what like Craigslist or something.

01:00:30,978 --> 01:00:32,158
SPEAKER_1:  So what Scientology did?

01:00:32,514 --> 01:00:32,958
SPEAKER_1:  was

01:00:33,282 --> 01:00:33,790
SPEAKER_1:  They had.

01:00:34,018 --> 01:00:35,006
SPEAKER_1:  private investigator.

01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:36,094
SPEAKER_1:  Stake out.

01:00:37,026 --> 01:00:38,302
SPEAKER_1:  the house flip project.

01:00:38,978 --> 01:00:41,374
SPEAKER_1:  They were clearly running license plates of anyone.

01:00:41,602 --> 01:00:42,622
SPEAKER_1:  who visited the property.

01:00:42,978 --> 01:00:48,254
SPEAKER_1:  because otherwise, otherwise, how would they find out the laborer's names, look, do background checks on them?

01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:50,014
SPEAKER_1:  to find out they had criminal records.

01:00:50,402 --> 01:00:53,886
SPEAKER_1:  and they publish this as if it's gonna reflect negatively on me.

01:00:54,306 --> 01:00:56,286
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, we hired someone to do work who had a

01:00:56,546 --> 01:00:57,086
SPEAKER_1:  Criminal Record?

01:00:57,538 --> 01:00:58,334
SPEAKER_1:  Giz-a-shit.

01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:02,014
SPEAKER_1:  You know, one of the biggest problems people with records have is finding employment.

01:01:02,466 --> 01:01:05,566
SPEAKER_1:  There's nothing bad about hiring someone who's got a criminal record.

01:01:05,826 --> 01:01:09,758
SPEAKER_1:  It doesn't reflect negatively on me, but it shows you what they think about those people.

01:01:10,018 --> 01:01:13,150
SPEAKER_1:  It shows you what they think about people who are trying to put their lives back together.

01:01:13,442 --> 01:01:16,926
SPEAKER_1:  maybe, you know, actually work for a living. And it also shows that there are

01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:18,462
SPEAKER_1:  surveilling us.

01:01:18,786 --> 01:01:19,262
SPEAKER_1:  You like to...

01:01:19,746 --> 01:01:24,926
SPEAKER_1:  They don't realize that putting this up, they're publishing information that they could only have if they're surveilling.

01:01:25,282 --> 01:01:26,878
SPEAKER_1:  me and Mike and it doesn't occur to them.

01:01:27,298 --> 01:01:28,222
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe we shouldn't put that up.

01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  Just a general process.

01:01:31,106 --> 01:01:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  sad to say, of journalism.

01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:39,774
SPEAKER_0:  where they're looking for any kind of dirt and it's, they're trying to conjure up a story.

01:01:40,226 --> 01:01:45,214
SPEAKER_0:  and there's something about drama and negative stories that get clicks and so on. So this is a general process.

01:01:45,698 --> 01:01:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  The more, especially the more of celebrity you become, the more these kinds of attacks come and they look for any kind of thing.

01:01:52,482 --> 01:01:55,454
SPEAKER_0:  that could be, you know, it doesn't even have to be facts. It could be.

01:01:56,194 --> 01:01:58,014
SPEAKER_0:  Just asking who is he really?

01:01:58,338 --> 01:01:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  seems to have traction on the internet.

01:02:00,386 --> 01:02:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  What is the actual truth?

01:02:03,298 --> 01:02:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  of the man you keep claiming you are, of the good man you keep claiming you are.

01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  is fascinating.

01:02:10,594 --> 01:02:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  but sometimes that can be effective.

01:02:12,514 --> 01:02:18,302
SPEAKER_0:  But I think if you're being transparent and authentic and just putting yourself out there completely in their story completely then...

01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:19,838
SPEAKER_0:  That's the best way to fight it.

01:02:20,354 --> 01:02:25,598
SPEAKER_1:  That's the other reason to be prolific on the internet, right? The reason Joe Rogan can't get cancelled.

01:02:26,626 --> 01:02:27,454
SPEAKER_1:  is because.

01:02:28,194 --> 01:02:35,390
SPEAKER_1:  anyone can watch thousands of hours of the authentic Joe Rogan. You can't misrepresent him because he spent thousands of hours representing himself genuinely.

01:02:36,194 --> 01:02:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  The nice thing.

01:02:37,282 --> 01:02:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  when you're representing yourself generally.

01:02:39,874 --> 01:02:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  You should be a good person.

01:02:41,826 --> 01:02:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  If you're a good person, then the internet will know.

01:02:44,034 --> 01:02:45,278
SPEAKER_0:  You can smell out the bullshit.

01:02:45,922 --> 01:02:50,014
SPEAKER_0:  Who is David Muskovic? It's even like, because you said Elron Hubbard.

01:02:50,306 --> 01:02:51,614
SPEAKER_0:  Founded Scientology.

01:02:53,378 --> 01:02:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  Let's go to the story.

01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:57,365
SPEAKER_0:  of how we transition from that to do.

01:02:57,365 --> 01:02:59,326
SPEAKER_1:  The current leader of Scientology.

01:03:00,258 --> 01:03:02,814
SPEAKER_1:  He was actually not selected by L. Ron Hubbard to take over.

01:03:03,042 --> 01:03:05,667
SPEAKER_1:  but ended up usurping power and taking over.

01:03:05,667 --> 01:03:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  like Stalin and Trotsky and communism, similar story. It's the person.

01:03:10,818 --> 01:03:12,414
SPEAKER_0:  Oftentimes in situation.

01:03:13,794 --> 01:03:15,678
SPEAKER_0:  uh... it's not the natural

01:03:16,258 --> 01:03:17,342
SPEAKER_0:  successor.

01:03:17,762 --> 01:03:19,262
SPEAKER_0:  Power, it's the one that

01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  takes power.

01:03:21,218 --> 01:03:24,414
SPEAKER_1:  I think the quote sometimes gets attributed to David Miscavige is

01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:25,758
SPEAKER_1:  power.

01:03:26,338 --> 01:03:27,742
SPEAKER_1:  Power is not given, it is assumed.

01:03:28,418 --> 01:03:28,990
SPEAKER_1:  Something like that.

01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:34,174
SPEAKER_1:  The last six years of L. Ron Hubbard's life, he was often in seclusion, essentially hiding from lawsuits.

01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:35,230
SPEAKER_1:  now.

01:03:35,554 --> 01:03:38,110
SPEAKER_1:  By the time Hubbard went off into seclusion.

01:03:38,402 --> 01:03:41,502
SPEAKER_1:  Miscavige had sort of already risen up through the ranks of the C organization.

01:03:41,986 --> 01:03:48,734
SPEAKER_1:  Now Miscavige was like a teenager, either like 11, 12, 13, or something like that. Miscavige was not born into Scientology, but he was a young-

01:03:49,122 --> 01:03:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  a young boy.

01:03:50,274 --> 01:03:52,414
SPEAKER_1:  when his father got into Scientology.

01:03:52,674 --> 01:03:52,990
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

01:03:53,282 --> 01:03:57,086
SPEAKER_1:  So, Ms. Gavage did start working as a C-ORG member.

01:03:57,346 --> 01:04:01,566
SPEAKER_1:  So there's one organization that existed to essentially serve Hubbard directly.

01:04:02,146 --> 01:04:05,918
SPEAKER_1:  and to represent his interest and that was called the Commodore he was the Commodore of the Sea Organization.

01:04:06,242 --> 01:04:08,478
SPEAKER_1:  the Commodore's Messengers Organization, and call it the CMO.

01:04:09,282 --> 01:04:13,150
SPEAKER_1:  Miscavige started working for the CMO pretty early on in his C-Org.

01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:15,038
SPEAKER_1:  career. You are probably expecting a subject overview, but if you do have them, put them together

01:04:16,482 --> 01:04:16,894
SPEAKER_1:  Mini Mic.

01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:18,206
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

01:04:18,914 --> 01:04:19,550
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

01:04:19,842 --> 01:04:21,822
SPEAKER_1:  uh... he just became not known as it as a doer

01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:23,678
SPEAKER_1:  like a guy who'll get it done.

01:04:24,866 --> 01:04:27,614
SPEAKER_1:  No excuses, no stops, you know, get it done.

01:04:28,354 --> 01:04:28,862
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:04:29,858 --> 01:04:31,806
SPEAKER_1:  he had made a name for himself in the CMO.

01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:33,502
SPEAKER_1:  Around the time.

01:04:34,402 --> 01:04:36,158
SPEAKER_1:  by the time Hubbard and Ruff into seclusion.

01:04:36,642 --> 01:04:42,942
SPEAKER_1:  Now when he went off into seclusion, he took two other CMO, or I'm gonna call them messengers, right? Commodore's messengers. He took two other messengers with him.

01:04:43,234 --> 01:04:44,094
SPEAKER_1:  Patent Any Broker.

01:04:44,642 --> 01:04:46,142
SPEAKER_1:  Now, it has been said...

01:04:46,402 --> 01:04:48,286
SPEAKER_1:  Bye people. Mike, Mike Rinder has told me.

01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:49,182
SPEAKER_1:  He goes.

01:04:49,506 --> 01:04:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  The reason Pat and Annie went off with LRH...

01:04:52,642 --> 01:04:55,742
SPEAKER_1:  isn't necessarily because he desperately wanted them to.

01:04:56,162 --> 01:04:57,150
SPEAKER_1:  but partly because.

01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:59,038
SPEAKER_1:  we could afford to let them go, we didn't.

01:04:59,298 --> 01:05:01,150
SPEAKER_1:  necessarily need them. Sure.

01:05:01,666 --> 01:05:05,406
SPEAKER_1:  And between the two of them, Annie was the one who was like a really compassionate person.

01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:08,510
SPEAKER_1:  intelligent person, caring person.

01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:12,990
SPEAKER_0:  Was there a possible trajectory of this world where she was the one that took over? Yes.

01:05:13,122 --> 01:05:15,518
SPEAKER_1:  In fact, Pat and any broker.

01:05:15,842 --> 01:05:18,334
SPEAKER_1:  were the two people that were supposed to take over.

01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:19,358
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

01:05:20,098 --> 01:05:22,878
SPEAKER_1:  because Pat and Amy were with Hubbard in seclusion.

01:05:23,522 --> 01:05:24,638
SPEAKER_1:  Miscavige?

01:05:25,602 --> 01:05:26,366
SPEAKER_1:  Basically.

01:05:26,882 --> 01:05:27,198
SPEAKER_1:  head.

01:05:27,874 --> 01:05:31,038
SPEAKER_1:  the complete run of the operation without any oversight from Hubbard.

01:05:31,362 --> 01:05:33,918
SPEAKER_1:  the only way any information would get from.

01:05:34,242 --> 01:05:35,198
SPEAKER_1:  Scientology World.

01:05:35,458 --> 01:05:35,998
SPEAKER_1:  to Hubbard.

01:05:36,258 --> 01:05:39,678
SPEAKER_1:  Is Ms. Scavage and Pet Broker would meet at a confidential location?

01:05:40,386 --> 01:05:40,702
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:05:40,962 --> 01:05:42,238
SPEAKER_1:  Miscavige would give broker.

01:05:42,658 --> 01:05:44,606
SPEAKER_1:  any information he wanted to go to LRH.

01:05:44,834 --> 01:05:46,686
SPEAKER_1:  So if Ms. Cavich wanted to get rid of somebody.

01:05:47,074 --> 01:05:51,646
SPEAKER_1:  All he had to do was feed LRH false information that this person had been caught doing something treasonous.

01:05:52,706 --> 01:05:55,326
SPEAKER_1:  and then he would get in response some order from L. Ron Hubbard to

01:05:56,002 --> 01:05:57,086
SPEAKER_1:  get rid of this person.

01:05:58,786 --> 01:06:03,390
SPEAKER_1:  Are there so many similarities between various communist regimes?

01:06:03,650 --> 01:06:04,775
SPEAKER_1:  and fascist regimes.

01:06:04,775 --> 01:06:08,862
SPEAKER_0:  Well, Hitler did the same thing when he became the supreme leader. He had to take power.

01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, you had to wait for the president to die, but the whole time there's a control and information and a slow aggregation of power. Of course, with nations it's different because if you control the military you control a lot.

01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:24,862
SPEAKER_0:  So there's you have to also get the generals on your side and so on, but I'm sure in this situation there is.

01:06:25,474 --> 01:06:27,070
SPEAKER_0:  similar kind of dynamics.

01:06:27,298 --> 01:06:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  You have to get certain.

01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  people on your side.

01:06:30,018 --> 01:06:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  control the flow of information.

01:06:32,066 --> 01:06:33,470
SPEAKER_0:  Let the original

01:06:33,986 --> 01:06:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  founder, the original leader, die off?

01:06:37,154 --> 01:06:39,614
SPEAKER_0:  and make sure that you are the one that's left with the power.

01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:40,062
SPEAKER_1:  Right.

01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:43,134
SPEAKER_1:  So, whereas Pat and Annie are off with LRH.

01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:48,670
SPEAKER_1:  all of Scientology's attorneys and accountants and lobbyists and whatever.

01:06:48,898 --> 01:06:49,534
SPEAKER_1:  They all know.

01:06:49,826 --> 01:06:50,238
SPEAKER_1:  Dave.

01:06:50,594 --> 01:06:51,966
SPEAKER_1:  Dave's the one they deal with.

01:06:52,482 --> 01:06:56,222
SPEAKER_1:  So, you know, LRH passes away, Pat and Nanny make this appearance.

01:06:56,450 --> 01:06:57,534
SPEAKER_1:  Nobody knows Pat and Annie.

01:06:57,954 --> 01:06:58,846
SPEAKER_1:  Everybody knows Dave.

01:07:00,162 --> 01:07:06,302
SPEAKER_1:  And so he ended up getting rid of Pat and Nanny. This is a very short, perhaps slightly bastardized version of it.

01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:09,150
SPEAKER_1:  of miscavige basically they had been.

01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:12,734
SPEAKER_1:  They had been ushering just suitcases of cash.

01:07:13,602 --> 01:07:15,198
SPEAKER_1:  to L. Ron Hubbard during this time.

01:07:15,746 --> 01:07:19,902
SPEAKER_1:  And you know, like so you have Miscavige handing boatloads of cash.

01:07:20,194 --> 01:07:20,606
SPEAKER_1:  to.

01:07:21,026 --> 01:07:21,566
SPEAKER_1:  Pat Broker.

01:07:23,138 --> 01:07:27,998
SPEAKER_1:  Pat would do crazy things like hide the money in the walls of houses and dig pits and everything. So.

01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:30,334
SPEAKER_1:  Miscavige basically threatened to

01:07:30,626 --> 01:07:33,502
SPEAKER_1:  turn pet broker over to the IRS for tax evasion.

01:07:34,178 --> 01:07:36,350
SPEAKER_1:  That's part pet brokers still alive.

01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:37,895
SPEAKER_0:  is yes i thought

01:07:37,895 --> 01:07:38,494
SPEAKER_1:  No

01:07:38,786 --> 01:07:44,062
SPEAKER_1:  He basically went away and kept his mouth shut. She died a handful of years ago. She stayed a loyal.

01:07:44,418 --> 01:07:46,046
SPEAKER_1:  See you, org member, until the very end.

01:07:46,914 --> 01:07:50,494
SPEAKER_1:  But literally, like, Ms. Gavage put her on menial tasks, like...

01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:53,758
SPEAKER_1:  Like she had no authority whatsoever. She was just put.

01:07:54,274 --> 01:08:01,310
SPEAKER_1:  on menial tasks, washing dishes, but not really groundskeeper, just, just stupid low-level assistant paper pusher stuff.

01:08:01,666 --> 01:08:02,270
SPEAKER_1:  She never.

01:08:02,658 --> 01:08:07,582
SPEAKER_1:  but she never operated with any actual authority, even though she was supposed to be the one to take over her impact.

01:08:08,674 --> 01:08:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  So I'm David Muscarriage.

01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  Difficult question, but can you make?

01:08:13,442 --> 01:08:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  both the case that he is a good man who's misunderstood and the case that he's not a good man.

01:08:21,122 --> 01:08:23,870
SPEAKER_1:  First of all, I believe that Miscavige is a true believer in Scientology.

01:08:24,578 --> 01:08:25,703
SPEAKER_1:  I do believe that. I do believe that.

01:08:25,703 --> 01:08:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  important questions. Do you think he believes in all the phatens and all of that?

01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:31,422
SPEAKER_1:  He definitely believes in that.

01:08:32,258 --> 01:08:39,518
SPEAKER_1:  I think he believes in Scientology but in a different way than all other Scientologists because he's aware of a lot more.

01:08:40,098 --> 01:08:42,590
SPEAKER_1:  information, damaging information about.

01:08:42,882 --> 01:08:48,766
SPEAKER_1:  of Ron Hubbard and the true story of Scientology than most people. So his version of belief is different. I'll give you one example here.

01:08:49,090 --> 01:08:53,406
SPEAKER_1:  So Scientology's bridge to total freedom goes up to what they call OT8, operating thing in level 8.

01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:54,078
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

01:08:54,754 --> 01:08:56,670
SPEAKER_1:  Scientologists have all been told.

01:08:57,058 --> 01:08:58,910
SPEAKER_1:  that L ran Hubbard before he passed.

01:08:59,490 --> 01:09:03,710
SPEAKER_1:  Finished, completed, putting together OT9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.

01:09:04,738 --> 01:09:05,694
SPEAKER_1:  It's just sitting in the vault.

01:09:06,146 --> 01:09:07,134
SPEAKER_1:  waiting to be released.

01:09:07,618 --> 01:09:08,702
SPEAKER_1:  This is part of.

01:09:09,058 --> 01:09:15,134
SPEAKER_1:  the Scientology belief system, because remember, I said growing up Scientology's bridge to total freedom is how you're supposed to get back to your native godlike state.

01:09:15,874 --> 01:09:19,358
SPEAKER_1:  while all the Scientologists in the world already know that they haven't gotten there.

01:09:20,098 --> 01:09:21,982
SPEAKER_1:  they still believe in Scientology because they're told.

01:09:22,402 --> 01:09:23,038
SPEAKER_1:  There's more.

01:09:23,394 --> 01:09:24,382
SPEAKER_1:  But wait, there's more!

01:09:25,122 --> 01:09:26,750
SPEAKER_1:  Miscavige knows there is no more.

01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:29,118
SPEAKER_1:  So Miscavige knows.

01:09:29,442 --> 01:09:30,398
SPEAKER_1:  the fundamental.

01:09:30,658 --> 01:09:33,278
SPEAKER_1:  of being able to achieve full operating Thetan.

01:09:33,986 --> 01:09:34,814
SPEAKER_1:  is a lie.

01:09:35,362 --> 01:09:37,630
SPEAKER_1:  He knows L. Ron Hubbard didn't accomplish that.

01:09:37,986 --> 01:09:38,686
SPEAKER_1:  So therefore...

01:09:38,946 --> 01:09:40,638
SPEAKER_1:  no one else is going to accomplish it as well.

01:09:41,122 --> 01:09:43,038
SPEAKER_1:  If L. Ron Hubbard had accomplished it.

01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:45,886
SPEAKER_1:  Miss Gavage knows, well, he didn't write it up. He didn't.

01:09:46,306 --> 01:09:48,798
SPEAKER_1:  but leave instructions for anyone else would accomplish it.

01:09:49,442 --> 01:09:50,782
SPEAKER_1:  So no matter what...

01:09:51,458 --> 01:09:52,702
SPEAKER_1:  Miscavige knows.

01:09:53,762 --> 01:10:00,318
SPEAKER_1:  that the fundamental promise that's not what Scientology is saying, they will be able to deliver to mankind.

01:10:01,346 --> 01:10:02,142
SPEAKER_1:  is a lie.

01:10:02,914 --> 01:10:06,654
SPEAKER_1:  Now it's gonna sound like I'm contradicting myself because it sounds like I'm saying, he knows it's bullshit.

01:10:07,874 --> 01:10:08,670
SPEAKER_1:  I think.

01:10:08,962 --> 01:10:11,838
SPEAKER_1:  He believes that L. Ron Hubbard just failed.

01:10:13,282 --> 01:10:14,942
SPEAKER_1:  to finish his work.

01:10:15,490 --> 01:10:18,526
SPEAKER_1:  and he's kind of hoping that Ron Hubbard's gonna come back to finish the job.

01:10:19,138 --> 01:10:20,510
SPEAKER_1:  because L. Ron Hubbard did tell.

01:10:21,058 --> 01:10:24,734
SPEAKER_1:  the people at the international management base, at least a core of them.

01:10:25,058 --> 01:10:26,462
SPEAKER_1:  that he was coming back.

01:10:27,234 --> 01:10:33,598
SPEAKER_1:  Now we know that David Miscavige believed this because right around the 21 year mark, he was supposed to come back like 21 years after he died.

01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:35,550
SPEAKER_1:  right around the twenty one year mark

01:10:35,938 --> 01:10:39,358
SPEAKER_1:  David Miscavige was getting busy putting some things in place that.

01:10:39,586 --> 01:10:42,110
SPEAKER_1:  had to get done in case L. Ron Hubbard came back. So we know he.

01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:43,678
SPEAKER_1:  at least believe to that level.

01:10:44,034 --> 01:10:46,494
SPEAKER_0:  Do you believe that Elrond and Hubbard can-

01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:47,646
SPEAKER_0:  sort of.

01:10:47,906 --> 01:10:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  Enter his own body? No.

01:10:49,474 --> 01:10:49,918
SPEAKER_1:  That's not how.

01:10:50,498 --> 01:10:51,038
SPEAKER_1:  in Scientology.

01:10:52,066 --> 01:10:53,726
SPEAKER_0:  So you can't have a transfer.

01:10:54,562 --> 01:10:55,134
SPEAKER_0:  Satan's.

01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:57,182
SPEAKER_1:  If you were full OT, you could.

01:10:58,018 --> 01:11:02,974
SPEAKER_0:  Can you describe the OT again? So OT levels OT 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to the 8.

01:11:03,266 --> 01:11:06,270
SPEAKER_0:  What, uh, what are they? What's, how do you get to level one?

01:11:06,498 --> 01:11:08,734
SPEAKER_1:  I'm gonna answer this question by first connecting some dots. Yes.

01:11:08,962 --> 01:11:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

01:11:09,922 --> 01:11:10,366
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:11:10,626 --> 01:11:14,430
SPEAKER_1:  We spoke early in the interview about achieving your native godlike.

01:11:15,042 --> 01:11:17,662
SPEAKER_1:  Yes. State that in Scientology is called native state.

01:11:18,402 --> 01:11:19,870
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, native state.

01:11:20,386 --> 01:11:23,390
SPEAKER_1:  and full operating Thetan mean the exact same thing.

01:11:24,226 --> 01:11:26,878
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, because that native state, you are a fully.

01:11:27,138 --> 01:11:27,838
SPEAKER_1:  operating.

01:11:28,354 --> 01:11:28,766
SPEAKER_1:  Theta.

01:11:29,154 --> 01:11:31,454
SPEAKER_1:  operating in your full capacity.

01:11:32,194 --> 01:11:34,238
SPEAKER_1:  So OT means Operating Thing.

01:11:35,266 --> 01:11:39,742
SPEAKER_1:  So the upper confidential half of Scientology's bridge called the OT levels, the operating Thain levels.

01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:41,086
SPEAKER_1:  And these...

01:11:41,474 --> 01:11:42,782
SPEAKER_1:  And remember, they're confidential, so.

01:11:43,042 --> 01:11:44,958
SPEAKER_1:  Most Scientologists have not done these levels.

01:11:45,410 --> 01:11:46,206
SPEAKER_1:  They don't know what's on them.

01:11:47,106 --> 01:11:50,014
SPEAKER_1:  It is on these levels that you learn.

01:11:50,786 --> 01:11:53,411
SPEAKER_1:  about the Xenu and the body Phaeton story. When you wanna hear more about the story please support critter series website at click then click 202 L Campus bonus by clicking t yrowth

01:11:53,411 --> 01:11:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  And practising Absten Rico plus.

01:11:54,498 --> 01:11:56,766
SPEAKER_1:  We spoke earlier about how at the lower.

01:11:57,026 --> 01:12:01,086
SPEAKER_1:  non-confidential levels of Scientology's bridge, Hubbard is saying that what's wrong with you is your reactive mind.

01:12:01,666 --> 01:12:02,014
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

01:12:03,618 --> 01:12:07,934
SPEAKER_1:  Well, in Scientology, once you've gotten rid of your reactive mind, that is what's called the state of clear.

01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:11,870
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so after you finish state of clear, the next thing on the bridge is the OT levels.

01:12:12,610 --> 01:12:17,150
SPEAKER_1:  Well, if you've already gotten rid of your active mind, what the heck are you supposed to do now? Well now, L. Ron Hubbard says.

01:12:17,570 --> 01:12:20,542
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, first what was wrong with you was just your reactive mind.

01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:27,166
SPEAKER_1:  but now the next thing you have to resolve, the next thing that's wrong with you is you actually have tens of thousands

01:12:27,522 --> 01:12:30,302
SPEAKER_1:  of Phaetons stuck to your body.

01:12:30,658 --> 01:12:33,310
SPEAKER_1:  and they all have their own reactive minds.

01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:35,175
SPEAKER_1:  You have to audit.

01:12:35,175 --> 01:12:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  the Phaetans.

01:12:39,586 --> 01:12:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  How do you audit the things, these like different?

01:12:42,978 --> 01:12:45,054
SPEAKER_0:  shades of your inner mind.

01:12:45,314 --> 01:12:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  and you have to try to access them somehow.

01:12:47,906 --> 01:12:48,830
SPEAKER_1:  You use the emitter.

01:12:49,442 --> 01:12:55,582
SPEAKER_1:  like we spoke about except now you've got a divider that separates the cans so they don't short-circuit and you hold both cans in one hand

01:12:56,546 --> 01:12:59,326
SPEAKER_1:  and you have the emitter in front of you. So now you're auditing yourself.

01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:01,822
SPEAKER_1:  you're telepathically.

01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:02,686
SPEAKER_1:  talking.

01:13:03,106 --> 01:13:04,478
SPEAKER_1:  to the things that are stuck to you.

01:13:05,282 --> 01:13:08,510
SPEAKER_1:  you are thinking the commands instead of saying them out loud.

01:13:09,282 --> 01:13:13,694
SPEAKER_1:  and you sort of do drills where you practice looking for emitter reads at the instant you have a thought.

01:13:15,202 --> 01:13:17,118
SPEAKER_1:  You're telepathically

01:13:17,762 --> 01:13:21,630
SPEAKER_1:  auditing spirits that L. Ron Hubbard says are stuck to your body.

01:13:22,146 --> 01:13:24,286
SPEAKER_1:  Does this sound like a recipe for a mental breakdown?

01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  or a head governmental journey.

01:13:27,426 --> 01:13:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  Wherever that leads, it could lead anywhere. It probably leads to a very bad place, right?

01:13:32,706 --> 01:13:33,694
SPEAKER_1:  very often does.

01:13:35,234 --> 01:13:40,286
SPEAKER_1:  And you combine that with the fact that Scientology is against any forms of mental help or health.

01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:43,134
SPEAKER_1:  outside of Scientology and you have a recipe for disaster.

01:13:43,586 --> 01:13:43,966
SPEAKER_1:  Now.

01:13:44,258 --> 01:13:47,582
SPEAKER_1:  You might go, where did all these spirits come from that are stuck to your body?

01:13:47,842 --> 01:13:49,342
SPEAKER_1:  This is where Xenu comes into play.

01:13:49,826 --> 01:13:52,158
SPEAKER_1:  So Hubbard says that 75 million years ago...

01:13:52,610 --> 01:13:55,422
SPEAKER_1:  Zinu was basically...

01:13:55,874 --> 01:13:56,734
SPEAKER_1:  A Dictator app.

01:13:57,730 --> 01:14:03,934
SPEAKER_1:  The Galactic Confederation is like 70 something or 80 something planets somewhere in the Milky Way. And Xenu was like.

01:14:04,194 --> 01:14:07,614
SPEAKER_1:  A dictator and overlord for either one of these planets or the whole system.

01:14:08,354 --> 01:14:09,982
SPEAKER_1:  and they had a population problem.

01:14:10,818 --> 01:14:11,838
SPEAKER_1:  And Xenu was like...

01:14:12,226 --> 01:14:14,110
SPEAKER_1:  we need to get rid of like half the people.

01:14:14,914 --> 01:14:16,798
SPEAKER_1:  So we called them all in for tax audits.

01:14:17,794 --> 01:14:20,830
SPEAKER_1:  Alron Hubbard didn't like the IRS. So of course the story has to do with tax audits.

01:14:21,506 --> 01:14:22,910
SPEAKER_1:  Call them all in for tax audits.

01:14:23,266 --> 01:14:24,510
SPEAKER_1:  Said psych bitches!

01:14:24,802 --> 01:14:25,886
SPEAKER_1:  froze them in glycol.

01:14:26,146 --> 01:14:27,710
SPEAKER_1:  Loaded them up on space planes.

01:14:28,002 --> 01:14:29,214
SPEAKER_1:  flew them to Earth.

01:14:29,602 --> 01:14:32,670
SPEAKER_1:  Remember the story has to be earth because the story is what's wrong with us.

01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:34,398
SPEAKER_1:  flew them to Earth.

01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:37,758
SPEAKER_1:  dropped them in volcanoes, blew them up with hydrogen bombs.

01:14:38,562 --> 01:14:42,974
SPEAKER_1:  and then captured them with like spirit magnets. I'm making up words because okay.

01:14:43,426 --> 01:14:43,998
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:45,726
SPEAKER_1:  and these

01:14:46,242 --> 01:14:47,134
SPEAKER_1:  disembodied.

01:14:47,458 --> 01:14:49,726
SPEAKER_1:  spirits of these people that got blown up.

01:14:49,954 --> 01:14:53,758
SPEAKER_1:  have just been blown in the wind here on Earth and they attach themselves to things.

01:14:54,114 --> 01:14:57,086
SPEAKER_1:  and they can be in the environment and they stick to bodies and everything.

01:14:57,314 --> 01:14:59,390
SPEAKER_1:  And so, and they all have reactive minds.

01:14:59,874 --> 01:15:04,926
SPEAKER_1:  So at Scientology's upper levels, if you get sick or you have cancer or there's something wrong with you...

01:15:05,474 --> 01:15:06,558
SPEAKER_1:  Scientology will say.

01:15:07,394 --> 01:15:10,759
SPEAKER_1:  That's one of your body things. You need to get some auditing to fix the body thing. PoWadík Je م children asd, hisste

01:15:10,759 --> 01:15:11,678
SPEAKER_0:  story.

01:15:12,322 --> 01:15:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  You do it with a bit of a chuckle.

01:15:15,330 --> 01:15:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  But when done seriously...

01:15:17,442 --> 01:15:19,838
SPEAKER_0:  So it's just told in a serious way.

01:15:20,642 --> 01:15:22,517
SPEAKER_0:  Like to, like, or written down. It's right.

01:15:22,517 --> 01:15:29,022
SPEAKER_1:  and you read it. By most accounts, Scientologists struggle when they read this for the first time because this is not consistent with what

01:15:29,922 --> 01:15:36,926
SPEAKER_1:  Scientologists are hoping for is on the RT levels. They're hoping for some real life changing magic. The way these things are described and sold there.

01:15:37,954 --> 01:15:43,038
SPEAKER_1:  Remember, they're hoping that these OT levels are going to give them the ability to go completely.

01:15:43,298 --> 01:15:47,774
SPEAKER_1:  independent of their body at will. Yeah. Steer eyes from your body, go back into your body, you know, like.

01:15:48,386 --> 01:15:50,261
SPEAKER_1:  have some real spirit powers.

01:15:50,261 --> 01:15:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  The first is kind of a shock.

01:15:52,642 --> 01:15:54,846
SPEAKER_0:  But then you still probably believe you hope.

01:15:55,714 --> 01:16:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  And you might turn it on yourself, self-critical that this is, I'm just not.

01:16:00,738 --> 01:16:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  strong enough yet.

01:16:02,530 --> 01:16:09,086
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, because also part of the Scientology member, it works 100% of the time when used 100% correctly. And if it doesn't...

01:16:10,466 --> 01:16:13,982
SPEAKER_1:  It could be because something's not being done right, but it also could be because.

01:16:14,594 --> 01:16:17,502
SPEAKER_1:  You're doing bad things that you're not telling people about.

01:16:18,050 --> 01:16:20,062
SPEAKER_1:  Like if you're committing present time.

01:16:20,546 --> 01:16:22,174
SPEAKER_1:  over its crimes, sins,

01:16:23,042 --> 01:16:26,942
SPEAKER_1:  Scientologists would be like, that's part of the reason auditing isn't working on you is because you're

01:16:27,234 --> 01:16:29,214
SPEAKER_1:  committing criminal behavior that you're not being honest about.

01:16:29,762 --> 01:16:32,990
SPEAKER_1:  So every Scientologist is sort of incentivized to

01:16:33,634 --> 01:16:35,262
SPEAKER_1:  to make auditing work on them.

01:16:35,938 --> 01:16:36,286
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

01:16:36,738 --> 01:16:38,174
SPEAKER_1:  Now Lex this is where it gets a little crazy.

01:16:38,722 --> 01:16:42,174
SPEAKER_1:  On OT3 you learn about the body things for the first time.

01:16:42,914 --> 01:16:47,614
SPEAKER_1:  When you finish OT3, you attest to having achieved this state of having no more body things.

01:16:48,194 --> 01:16:49,502
SPEAKER_1:  and then you start O2-4.

01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:51,646
SPEAKER_1:  And he's like, psych.

01:16:52,130 --> 01:16:52,990
SPEAKER_1:  You got more.

01:16:53,282 --> 01:16:54,398
SPEAKER_1:  You got more BTs.

01:16:54,658 --> 01:16:58,654
SPEAKER_1:  except those other BTs, they had drug problems and that's why you couldn't find them the first time.

01:16:59,106 --> 01:17:06,494
SPEAKER_1:  So we're gonna do a little something a little different here, do something a little different there. Gotta get rid of these BTs that were addicted to drugs. Okay, then you finish OT4 and you're thinking.

01:17:06,946 --> 01:17:08,478
SPEAKER_1:  Man, I hope we get to the good stuff soon.

01:17:08,962 --> 01:17:12,606
SPEAKER_1:  and then you get to OT5 and he's like, Sike, you got more BTs.

01:17:12,834 --> 01:17:20,286
SPEAKER_1:  You couldn't find these BTs because they were all bunched up together in clusters. And first you have to break up the clusters and then you can get rid of the BTs. And you're like, okay.

01:17:20,898 --> 01:17:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  Gotta do that.

01:17:22,722 --> 01:17:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  And this is all Elrond Howard approved.

01:17:25,410 --> 01:17:26,535
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, this is from L.R.

01:17:26,535 --> 01:17:34,046
SPEAKER_1:  and then after you finish OT5 you get rid of all the BT clusters. OT6 is just a training course to teach how to auto OT7.

01:17:34,498 --> 01:17:35,390
SPEAKER_1:  Well, T7...

01:17:35,778 --> 01:17:42,782
SPEAKER_1:  Is now more BTs except it's in the environment and stuff. You're trying to locate BTs. You can find them on your body, but it's just more BTs.

01:17:43,522 --> 01:17:43,966
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

01:17:44,194 --> 01:17:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  and then OT8.

01:17:45,506 --> 01:17:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  is remember we talked about in all these auditing sessions throughout the entire Scientology bridge.

01:17:50,338 --> 01:17:55,102
SPEAKER_1:  You have people who've run hundreds or thousands of past life, whole track incidents.

01:17:55,618 --> 01:17:59,646
SPEAKER_1:  These memories have become part of their self-identity of who they even think they are.

01:18:00,450 --> 01:18:01,118
SPEAKER_1:  OT8.

01:18:01,506 --> 01:18:07,102
SPEAKER_1:  You go through all these past life recalls and essentially I'm oversimplifying this a little bit. He goes, psych.

01:18:07,682 --> 01:18:09,726
SPEAKER_1:  All those past life memories weren't yours.

01:18:10,434 --> 01:18:11,710
SPEAKER_1:  They were your BTs.

01:18:13,698 --> 01:18:14,782
SPEAKER_1:  And he goes, now.

01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:16,542
SPEAKER_1:  that you've discovered this.

01:18:16,898 --> 01:18:19,326
SPEAKER_1:  Now you know who you are not.

01:18:20,194 --> 01:18:22,366
SPEAKER_1:  and you are ready to find out who you really are.

01:18:23,394 --> 01:18:26,046
SPEAKER_1:  Well, now you're supposed to find out who you really are on OT9 and 10.

01:18:26,850 --> 01:18:27,966
SPEAKER_1:  Those don't exist!

01:18:29,186 --> 01:18:30,750
SPEAKER_1:  Do we know they don't exist? Yes.

01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:33,726
SPEAKER_1:  In fact, the whole story of how that became known.

01:18:34,018 --> 01:18:35,550
SPEAKER_1:  is part of how.

01:18:36,066 --> 01:18:38,462
SPEAKER_1:  David Miscavige was able to get rid of Pat Broker.

01:18:38,850 --> 01:18:40,254
SPEAKER_1:  and take over power because.

01:18:40,706 --> 01:18:47,294
SPEAKER_1:  It was believed that Pat Broker had been, was in possession of the upper unreleased OT levels and when Miscavige determined

01:18:47,554 --> 01:18:50,654
SPEAKER_1:  that he was not and there weren't in fact any levels?

01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:57,310
SPEAKER_1:  That was bad. That was a bad day to be David Miscavige because he now knew he had something on his hands he could not get himself out of. He's like, oh, sh-

01:18:57,410 --> 01:18:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  So there's no gap.

01:18:59,298 --> 01:19:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  for faith to seep in that there is.

01:19:02,690 --> 01:19:05,315
SPEAKER_0:  level 9 and 10 11 and 12. Oh the f-

01:19:05,315 --> 01:19:06,206
SPEAKER_1:  faith is there.

01:19:06,754 --> 01:19:09,310
SPEAKER_1:  Scientologists believe that these things do exist. Zbar however is incredibly hahaha

01:19:10,434 --> 01:19:11,559
SPEAKER_1:  Rod Hubbard didn't leave anything.

01:19:11,559 --> 01:19:13,854
SPEAKER_0:  behind? Does David Miscavige believe they exist?

01:19:14,370 --> 01:19:16,222
SPEAKER_1:  Oh no, he knows they don't exist.

01:19:16,770 --> 01:19:20,446
SPEAKER_1:  No, I mean, when I say exist, oh, I don't mean do advanced.

01:19:20,674 --> 01:19:23,006
SPEAKER_1:  uh... levels of spiritual awareness exists

01:19:23,490 --> 01:19:27,070
SPEAKER_1:  When I said, is it, means did L Ron Hubbard write down.

01:19:27,714 --> 01:19:30,590
SPEAKER_1:  what anyone is supposed to do that's called OT9.

01:19:31,138 --> 01:19:32,263
SPEAKER_1:  That doesn't exist. These.

01:19:32,263 --> 01:19:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  David Miscavige believes.

01:19:34,626 --> 01:19:35,454
SPEAKER_0:  the day.

01:19:35,874 --> 01:19:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  can be written down so they exist in a platonic sense.

01:19:39,874 --> 01:19:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  Elrond Harbert is the only one that can

01:19:42,754 --> 01:19:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  Write it down? So his face is really deep.

01:19:45,730 --> 01:19:49,105
SPEAKER_1:  You mean his faith that only Elron Hubbard could have ever been the one to do it? The f-

01:19:49,105 --> 01:19:52,670
SPEAKER_0:  The full principles, beliefs of Scientology, he is...

01:19:53,346 --> 01:19:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  Jeff

01:19:54,786 --> 01:19:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  Are you sure, he believes?

01:19:56,674 --> 01:19:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  That what exactly?

01:19:58,242 --> 01:20:00,542
SPEAKER_0:  everything about Scientology that is true.

01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:04,254
SPEAKER_1:  To the best of my ability to know that, I believe it to be true.

01:20:06,242 --> 01:20:09,502
SPEAKER_1:  Like I'll give you some all even stupid examples like Mike renders told a story.

01:20:09,794 --> 01:20:12,606
SPEAKER_1:  where at the international base, Miscavige actually had like

01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:13,950
SPEAKER_1:  Hopper.

01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:16,318
SPEAKER_1:  a contraption built into the ground.

01:20:16,930 --> 01:20:17,886
SPEAKER_1:  grounded into the ground.

01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:19,198
SPEAKER_1:  come out where you could.

01:20:19,522 --> 01:20:22,206
SPEAKER_1:  and here's something he sort of came up with too.

01:20:22,594 --> 01:20:25,310
SPEAKER_1:  uh... your bt your because ground your bt's

01:20:25,666 --> 01:20:30,814
SPEAKER_1:  could get your BTs that if you're feeling over stimulated or something, I'm probably slightly bastardizing this story.

01:20:31,842 --> 01:20:34,366
SPEAKER_1:  He came up with this as a great idea, something to help someone.

01:20:34,690 --> 01:20:39,806
SPEAKER_1:  destimulate if their BTs were getting a little too overactive. Now, so that's a stupid story that's sort of like...

01:20:40,642 --> 01:20:45,630
SPEAKER_1:  It shows you he believes in the concept of BTs of his creating little rods to get rid of them to ground them into the earth.

01:20:45,954 --> 01:20:48,158
SPEAKER_0:  Well, he could be conjuring up the stories because...

01:20:48,546 --> 01:20:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  He understands the power of myth and narrative and so on to...

01:20:52,162 --> 01:20:52,990
SPEAKER_0:  inspire.

01:20:53,218 --> 01:20:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  Sure, but like.

01:20:54,818 --> 01:20:56,190
SPEAKER_0:  but also if we look at history.

01:20:56,802 --> 01:21:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  both with, this is an interesting thing because I've been reading a lot about Hitler installing

01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:02,942
SPEAKER_0:  It seems like...

01:21:03,394 --> 01:21:05,310
SPEAKER_0:  both of them in different ways.

01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:06,974
SPEAKER_0:  believed.

01:21:07,874 --> 01:21:09,502
SPEAKER_0:  in the stories they were telling.

01:21:10,242 --> 01:21:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  Even when the stories, this is the fascinating, especially with Hitler and propaganda.

01:21:14,306 --> 01:21:16,574
SPEAKER_0:  where they were literally conjured up at first.

01:21:17,090 --> 01:21:19,006
SPEAKER_0:  but then you start to believe you're in propaganda.

01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  With Stalin, I think what he always believed is the bigger ideal of pure communism.

01:21:25,922 --> 01:21:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  and anything justifies.

01:21:28,066 --> 01:21:31,070
SPEAKER_0:  the journey to communism because it will ultimately be.

01:21:31,330 --> 01:21:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  Good.

01:21:32,034 --> 01:21:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  for humanity to achieve the state of pure communism. And then he's a godlike figure that can...

01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:38,174
SPEAKER_0:  can bring.

01:21:38,818 --> 01:21:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  uh... can bring humanity there

01:21:40,898 --> 01:21:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  But like...

01:21:41,922 --> 01:21:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  Well, Hitler is interesting because like this constant propaganda.

01:21:45,954 --> 01:21:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  that he knows is not true.

01:21:48,578 --> 01:21:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  A little bit. There's gotta be doubt.

01:21:50,914 --> 01:21:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  But then he like did all doubt is removed very quickly.

01:21:54,338 --> 01:21:56,213
SPEAKER_0:  I guess humans are just this.

01:21:56,213 --> 01:21:57,182
SPEAKER_1:  how they operate.

01:21:57,538 --> 01:22:03,902
SPEAKER_1:  The conversation about David Miscavige gets really interesting because I could give you a- if I wanted to make the argument that he didn't believe-

01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:08,158
SPEAKER_1:  I could give you a dozen examples to make that argument. I just happen.

01:22:09,282 --> 01:22:10,398
SPEAKER_1:  to think that.

01:22:10,882 --> 01:22:12,286
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, he believes.

01:22:12,514 --> 01:22:13,502
SPEAKER_1:  in a different

01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:14,238
SPEAKER_1:  way.

01:22:14,498 --> 01:22:16,094
SPEAKER_1:  Whereas your average Scientologist

01:22:16,514 --> 01:22:22,526
SPEAKER_1:  believes that Alvarran Hubbard was practically infallible, that he thought of everything in advance, he took care of everything before he left.

01:22:22,754 --> 01:22:26,878
SPEAKER_1:  and Miscavige still believes in like the main structure of this thing.

01:22:27,106 --> 01:22:28,414
SPEAKER_1:  But he's like, ah shit.

01:22:28,962 --> 01:22:31,006
SPEAKER_1:  It's falling to me to figure out how to actually.

01:22:31,458 --> 01:22:32,606
SPEAKER_1:  make this thing happen.

01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:38,750
SPEAKER_1:  I think Miscavige sees himself as someone who has to a certain degree had to go back and fix all of Hubbard's mistakes.

01:22:39,138 --> 01:22:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  Do you think he sees himself as doing good for the world? I do.

01:22:43,586 --> 01:22:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  What about for the people of Scientology?

01:22:46,690 --> 01:22:47,934
SPEAKER_1:  I think in his own way he does.

01:22:48,738 --> 01:22:50,558
SPEAKER_1:  I don't think he wakes up thinking he's.

01:22:50,978 --> 01:22:51,550
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:22:51,938 --> 01:22:53,534
SPEAKER_1:  screwing Scientologists.

01:22:54,338 --> 01:22:56,382
SPEAKER_1:  I think he sees everyone else as screwing him.

01:22:57,506 --> 01:22:58,366
SPEAKER_1:  I think he sees.

01:22:58,754 --> 01:23:07,166
SPEAKER_1:  uh... that it that it is his job to expand scientology throughout the world and accomplish the ends of scientology and he sees that it's not happening

01:23:07,522 --> 01:23:09,886
SPEAKER_1:  and he thinks if everyone else would just stop.

01:23:10,370 --> 01:23:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  If everyone else would get out of his way and stop creating problems for him, it would happen like-

01:23:14,178 --> 01:23:14,590
SPEAKER_1:  Uh-uh.

01:23:15,138 --> 01:23:18,750
SPEAKER_1:  I do think he sees himself as someone who is doing.

01:23:19,490 --> 01:23:19,838
SPEAKER_1:  Good.

01:23:20,354 --> 01:23:21,470
SPEAKER_1:  I think that's fair to say.

01:23:22,434 --> 01:23:23,678
SPEAKER_1:  I think the evidence shows that.

01:23:23,778 --> 01:23:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  What about the effects of...

01:23:25,666 --> 01:23:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  clearly power and influence that he's had and money.

01:23:29,058 --> 01:23:32,094
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, without question that has served as a corrupting force.

01:23:32,226 --> 01:23:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  It has without question. Have you seen sort of evidence of that, that he's changed over time?

01:23:36,898 --> 01:23:40,286
SPEAKER_1:  after the 1993 IRS exemption.

01:23:40,610 --> 01:23:42,014
SPEAKER_1:  that Scientology won back.

01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  and this information comes from Mike Rinder.

01:23:45,922 --> 01:23:47,390
SPEAKER_1:  That's when

01:23:47,810 --> 01:23:48,766
SPEAKER_1:  David Miscavige.

01:23:49,218 --> 01:23:53,342
SPEAKER_1:  As soon as the checks on his power were removed, Ms. Gavish's behavior changed markedly.

01:23:54,178 --> 01:23:59,381
SPEAKER_0:  Can you tell the story of Shelley, Miss Gavage, and the mystery surrounding her? I saw that there is quite a bit of mystery.

01:23:59,381 --> 01:23:59,838
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:24:00,578 --> 01:24:02,334
SPEAKER_1:  So Shelley Miscavige.

01:24:02,722 --> 01:24:05,214
SPEAKER_1:  for many years held the job.

01:24:06,146 --> 01:24:08,030
SPEAKER_1:  host in this organization was.

01:24:08,386 --> 01:24:09,758
SPEAKER_1:  David Miscavige's assistant.

01:24:10,498 --> 01:24:11,614
SPEAKER_1:  That was her post.

01:24:11,874 --> 01:24:13,694
SPEAKER_1:  It's important to truly understand.

01:24:14,338 --> 01:24:16,414
SPEAKER_1:  that and what that means because

01:24:16,994 --> 01:24:20,094
SPEAKER_1:  The fact that she was Miss Gavage's wife.

01:24:21,058 --> 01:24:21,950
SPEAKER_1:  is meaningless.

01:24:22,882 --> 01:24:24,286
SPEAKER_1:  And this is something that's hard to.

01:24:24,770 --> 01:24:28,350
SPEAKER_1:  for regular people in the regular world to truly grasp how meaningless it is in Scientology.

01:24:28,866 --> 01:24:30,526
SPEAKER_1:  for Sea Org members who are spouses.

01:24:31,106 --> 01:24:31,742
SPEAKER_1:  It means nothing.

01:24:32,514 --> 01:24:33,598
SPEAKER_1:  your role matters more.

01:24:33,826 --> 01:24:36,638
SPEAKER_1:  Within C-Worg. Your role is the only thing that matters.

01:24:36,866 --> 01:24:39,870
SPEAKER_1:  So let's say if Shelly was married to Dave.

01:24:40,514 --> 01:24:41,342
SPEAKER_1:  But she...

01:24:41,602 --> 01:24:42,782
SPEAKER_1:  worked in a different organization.

01:24:43,810 --> 01:24:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  she would never be seen with him.

01:24:45,922 --> 01:24:47,166
SPEAKER_1:  ever. who have microchipped their

01:24:47,490 --> 01:24:48,318
SPEAKER_1:  Wouldn't travel with him.

01:24:48,578 --> 01:24:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  Wouldn't go to events with him, nothing.

01:24:51,298 --> 01:24:52,446
SPEAKER_1:  Sometime around.

01:24:53,058 --> 01:24:54,078
SPEAKER_1:  2016-2007.

01:24:54,306 --> 01:24:55,934
SPEAKER_1:  and i'm very oversimplifying

01:24:57,218 --> 01:25:01,022
SPEAKER_1:  Shelly basically pissed off Dave to the point where he's like, okay, I'm done with you.

01:25:01,858 --> 01:25:03,518
SPEAKER_1:  I'm going to take you off of your post.

01:25:05,538 --> 01:25:08,062
SPEAKER_1:  At that point, she was reassigned to another.

01:25:08,290 --> 01:25:11,518
SPEAKER_1:  Confidential Scientology Base up in Twin Peaks, California.

01:25:12,898 --> 01:25:15,518
SPEAKER_1:  Um, why am I the reason I'm providing

01:25:15,842 --> 01:25:19,230
SPEAKER_1:  this type of detail is because we hear that Shelley's missing.

01:25:20,418 --> 01:25:20,766
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

01:25:21,634 --> 01:25:26,014
SPEAKER_1:  You realize the same people who report that Shelly's missing are also the same people who will tell you exactly where she is.

01:25:26,818 --> 01:25:28,990
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, she works at this secretive CST.

01:25:29,218 --> 01:25:31,006
SPEAKER_1:  Church of Spiritual Technology Bay-Soutan.

01:25:31,298 --> 01:25:32,126
SPEAKER_1:  Twin Peaks, California.

01:25:32,738 --> 01:25:33,406
SPEAKER_1:  I have-

01:25:33,666 --> 01:25:35,326
SPEAKER_1:  personal confirmation.

01:25:35,682 --> 01:25:36,670
SPEAKER_1:  that she was seen.

01:25:37,026 --> 01:25:38,046
SPEAKER_1:  and spoken with.

01:25:38,434 --> 01:25:39,774
SPEAKER_1:  by someone who knew her well.

01:25:40,322 --> 01:25:40,798
SPEAKER_1:  in.

01:25:41,186 --> 01:25:42,142
SPEAKER_1:  I'll say 2019.

01:25:43,010 --> 01:25:47,006
SPEAKER_1:  Shelley Miscavige is missing in the sense that.

01:25:48,098 --> 01:25:51,614
SPEAKER_1:  She hasn't been seen with David Miscavige since about 2006.

01:25:52,258 --> 01:25:54,366
SPEAKER_1:  but because she's no longer his assistant.

01:25:55,394 --> 01:25:56,958
SPEAKER_1:  You would never see her with him.

01:25:57,666 --> 01:26:02,878
SPEAKER_0:  As opposed to the mystery of a person that might be murdered, this is more of a...

01:26:03,202 --> 01:26:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  reallocation within the organization.

01:26:05,794 --> 01:26:07,102
SPEAKER_1:  Certain people.

01:26:07,586 --> 01:26:08,894
SPEAKER_1:  who cover Scientology.

01:26:10,114 --> 01:26:12,062
SPEAKER_1:  who have published stories.

01:26:13,154 --> 01:26:15,966
SPEAKER_1:  where Shelley's Miscavige's family member told.

01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:23,550
SPEAKER_1:  A story to another family member who told the story to a friend who told the story to a former Scientologist who told the story to a journalist who published the story.

01:26:24,898 --> 01:26:29,022
SPEAKER_1:  has created the impression that some of Shelley Miscavige's family members are actually talking to the press.

01:26:29,570 --> 01:26:30,846
SPEAKER_1:  when in fact that has never occurred.

01:26:31,938 --> 01:26:39,070
SPEAKER_1:  And so the very people who are publishing about Shelley Miscavige missing have contributed to the fact that Shelley Miscavige does no longer speak to those family members.

01:26:40,226 --> 01:26:41,822
SPEAKER_1:  because she thinks they're talking to the press.

01:26:42,306 --> 01:26:43,070
SPEAKER_1:  when they never have.

01:26:43,842 --> 01:26:44,318
SPEAKER_1:  pretty messed up.

01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  It's sad that she, because those family members, what would be a way for her to...

01:26:50,754 --> 01:26:51,838
SPEAKER_0:  to recover to...

01:26:52,130 --> 01:26:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  to flourish as a human being to escape.

01:26:54,082 --> 01:26:54,398
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:26:55,394 --> 01:26:55,838
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:26:56,962 --> 01:26:57,918
SPEAKER_1:  I believe.

01:26:58,178 --> 01:27:03,998
SPEAKER_1:  the information that I have that I verified. I'm putting out, I'm the one representing it's true without revealing my sources. Culture

01:27:04,738 --> 01:27:08,030
SPEAKER_1:  that Shelley was still actively in touch regularly.

01:27:08,258 --> 01:27:11,998
SPEAKER_1:  with family members outside of the C organization until about 2014.

01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:14,430
SPEAKER_1:  So, I mean, regularly.

01:27:15,042 --> 01:27:17,150
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so there's no question about her safety.

01:27:17,378 --> 01:27:18,558
SPEAKER_1:  during that period.

01:27:19,042 --> 01:27:21,470
SPEAKER_1:  and then someone else who knew Shelley very well.

01:27:21,922 --> 01:27:26,654
SPEAKER_1:  Did see her and actually have a conversation with her in a public place

01:27:27,234 --> 01:27:28,862
SPEAKER_1:  in 2019 or 2020.

01:27:29,794 --> 01:27:41,246
SPEAKER_1:  Now somebody could still come along and be like, how do we know she's okay? It's been three years. Yeah, okay, you can say that about anybody. There's the nature of working in the highest levels of Scientology management at the super secretive basis.

01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:46,654
SPEAKER_1:  It's a very weird and unique situation. It has isolation baked in.

01:27:46,914 --> 01:27:48,446
SPEAKER_0:  house secrecy enforced.

01:27:48,802 --> 01:27:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  Why is everybody...

01:27:51,362 --> 01:27:55,102
SPEAKER_0:  holding on to their stories so intensely.

01:27:55,426 --> 01:27:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  people that are within the organization. Like this for hard to leak.

01:27:59,202 --> 01:28:01,534
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, they wouldn't want to leak. They're true believers.

01:28:01,794 --> 01:28:02,430
SPEAKER_1:  They see.

01:28:03,042 --> 01:28:07,806
SPEAKER_1:  They see like there's sort of a conspiracy theory that runs right through all of Scientology.

01:28:08,706 --> 01:28:14,174
SPEAKER_1:  which is that Scientology represents an existential threat.

01:28:14,402 --> 01:28:17,086
SPEAKER_1:  to the powers that really control this planet.

01:28:17,218 --> 01:28:18,174
SPEAKER_0:  Do they have a...

01:28:18,658 --> 01:28:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  Face to the powers that are really controlled. FACE TO THE POWERS THAT ARE REALLY CONTROLLED.

01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  Names to it? Like who's controlling? It's Znews Homies.

01:28:25,026 --> 01:28:27,486
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I'm sure that's not what they say. Xeno...

01:28:27,810 --> 01:28:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  embodied in it's actually sort of a multifaceted

01:28:30,946 --> 01:28:31,358
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:28:31,842 --> 01:28:33,726
SPEAKER_1:  conspiracy in that on the one hand

01:28:34,018 --> 01:28:37,054
SPEAKER_1:  L. Ron Hubbard points his fingers at the international bankers.

01:28:38,178 --> 01:28:40,478
SPEAKER_1:  which has shades of antisemitism to it.

01:28:40,770 --> 01:28:43,395
SPEAKER_0:  And then the IRS is going to be quickly.

01:28:43,395 --> 01:28:50,782
SPEAKER_1:  Big 10 or no? The IRS, no, the IRS is so low on the totem pole as far as the, I mean, the international bankers, he would say runs everything.

01:28:51,010 --> 01:28:55,614
SPEAKER_1:  But use that these bankers also use big pharma.

01:28:56,066 --> 01:28:57,182
SPEAKER_1:  and big psych.

01:28:57,858 --> 01:28:59,198
SPEAKER_1:  to control the population.

01:28:59,490 --> 01:29:01,598
SPEAKER_1:  and Scientology is famously against.

01:29:02,178 --> 01:29:02,750
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:29:03,170 --> 01:29:14,302
SPEAKER_1:  Pharma and Psych. And so this is sort of how L. Ron Hubbard characterizes like this big war between Scientology that's trying to set everyone free and Big Pharma and Big Psych that's trying to enslave everyone on the planet.

01:29:14,722 --> 01:29:15,326
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:29:15,682 --> 01:29:18,307
SPEAKER_0:  controlling their mind, controlling their body through chemical

01:29:18,307 --> 01:29:20,190
SPEAKER_1:  and who controls the press.

01:29:20,930 --> 01:29:22,142
SPEAKER_1:  Big Pharma and Big Psych.

01:29:22,434 --> 01:29:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  So there's a lot of correlation to other kinds of conspiracy theories. So my name's William Walker and I've joined you in the

01:29:26,818 --> 01:29:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

01:29:27,938 --> 01:29:29,063
SPEAKER_0:  Ah, that's fascinating.

01:29:29,063 --> 01:29:30,558
SPEAKER_1:  But you asked the question.

01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:31,998
SPEAKER_1:  where, uh,

01:29:32,386 --> 01:29:36,478
SPEAKER_1:  why would all these people hold onto their stories? they would never want to leak

01:29:37,090 --> 01:29:37,406
SPEAKER_1:  like.

01:29:37,634 --> 01:29:38,238
SPEAKER_1:  by even

01:29:39,074 --> 01:29:40,254
SPEAKER_1:  Anyone who would want to leak?

01:29:40,642 --> 01:29:42,494
SPEAKER_1:  would not even want to be a Scientologist anymore.

01:29:42,914 --> 01:29:47,710
SPEAKER_1:  Like if you truly believe in Scientology and you got your shoulder to the wheel and you're a CERC member.

01:29:48,002 --> 01:29:50,910
SPEAKER_1:  You think Scientology is literally the only thing.

01:29:51,202 --> 01:29:57,246
SPEAKER_1:  that can save every being on this planet from a fate of eternal amnesia.

01:29:57,602 --> 01:29:58,526
SPEAKER_1:  and slavery.

01:29:59,586 --> 01:30:02,174
SPEAKER_1:  Right? So it's like, I mean, you've seen the matrix, right?

01:30:02,786 --> 01:30:05,438
SPEAKER_1:  So you've got everyone once you're unplugged from the matrix.

01:30:05,826 --> 01:30:08,126
SPEAKER_1:  And you realize, yeah, you can get plugged back in.

01:30:08,418 --> 01:30:10,814
SPEAKER_1:  and live your nice life, but you're a slave.

01:30:11,426 --> 01:30:13,118
SPEAKER_1:  That's how Scientologists see this planet.

01:30:13,442 --> 01:30:13,950
SPEAKER_1:  Next time.

01:30:14,210 --> 01:30:15,710
SPEAKER_1:  they refer to Earth as a prison planet.

01:30:16,994 --> 01:30:17,630
SPEAKER_1:  Just an-

01:30:17,730 --> 01:30:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  Individual level, how is it possible to reach a person like that?

01:30:23,042 --> 01:30:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  Is there something you could say to that? What's the journey of reaching a person like that?

01:30:27,970 --> 01:30:29,470
SPEAKER_1:  I personally...

01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:30,558
SPEAKER_1:  because.

01:30:30,850 --> 01:30:32,798
SPEAKER_1:  because of when I was in those shoes.

01:30:33,154 --> 01:30:35,582
SPEAKER_1:  I say there's nothing anybody could have said to me.

01:30:36,066 --> 01:30:36,926
SPEAKER_1:  to get me to change.

01:30:37,282 --> 01:30:38,814
SPEAKER_1:  how I felt and thought about Scientology.

01:30:39,906 --> 01:30:41,214
SPEAKER_1:  It's almost foolproof.

01:30:41,570 --> 01:30:45,630
SPEAKER_1:  that the more evidence you try to present that there's something.

01:30:46,498 --> 01:30:48,574
SPEAKER_1:  wrong with what Scientology is doing.

01:30:48,962 --> 01:30:50,910
SPEAKER_1:  the more you're just working for the psychs.

01:30:51,554 --> 01:30:51,966
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

01:30:52,258 --> 01:30:54,814
SPEAKER_1:  It's very, very difficult. I mean, most people.

01:30:55,074 --> 01:30:56,350
SPEAKER_1:  who leave Scientology.

01:30:56,674 --> 01:30:57,886
SPEAKER_1:  leave because they have.

01:30:58,178 --> 01:31:02,430
SPEAKER_1:  had some personal experience that was just such a grave injustice.

01:31:03,298 --> 01:31:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  that it just pushed them.

01:31:04,866 --> 01:31:05,566
SPEAKER_1:  Beyond.

01:31:06,818 --> 01:31:08,670
SPEAKER_1:  the point of what they're willing to experience.

01:31:09,218 --> 01:31:16,094
SPEAKER_1:  Very rare, I've never, I'm not sure I've really ever heard a story of someone going, yeah, I just woke up, you know, I just gradually realized it was all BS and drifted away.

01:31:17,122 --> 01:31:18,526
SPEAKER_1:  You know, it's usually like.

01:31:18,978 --> 01:31:19,646
SPEAKER_1:  No.

01:31:20,194 --> 01:31:24,254
SPEAKER_1:  I really believed and they treated me so horribly.

01:31:24,738 --> 01:31:26,814
SPEAKER_1:  I almost had no choice.

01:31:27,522 --> 01:31:29,662
SPEAKER_1:  but to leave. And then the stories get pretty crazy.

01:31:30,466 --> 01:31:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  Meaning you don't care what's true anymore. You just have to leave with this, the unpleasant feeling, the suffering. Yeah.

01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:38,718
SPEAKER_1:  And this sort of goes back to...

01:31:38,978 --> 01:31:42,334
SPEAKER_1:  the conversation we're having about like, well, does Miscavige really believe?

01:31:42,818 --> 01:31:45,566
SPEAKER_1:  And I said I could make an argument for the fact that he doesn't, right?

01:31:46,018 --> 01:31:46,974
SPEAKER_1:  because I go.

01:31:47,458 --> 01:31:49,054
SPEAKER_1:  It wouldn't be that hard.

01:31:49,314 --> 01:31:51,358
SPEAKER_1:  to change the way Scientology treats people.

01:31:51,746 --> 01:31:53,150
SPEAKER_1:  just a little bit.

01:31:53,506 --> 01:31:55,134
SPEAKER_1:  and you'd probably stop losing.

01:31:55,490 --> 01:32:02,590
SPEAKER_1:  anyone because Scientologists already believe to such a strong degree. You have to be pretty freaking horrible to people to make him leave.

01:32:03,266 --> 01:32:04,126
SPEAKER_1:  And that's where you go.

01:32:04,418 --> 01:32:10,814
SPEAKER_1:  Well, does Miscavige even want Scientology to expand? Cause if he was really being clever about it, it seems like he could at least stop the bleeding.

01:32:11,074 --> 01:32:12,062
SPEAKER_1:  And yet he doesn't.

01:32:12,418 --> 01:32:15,134
SPEAKER_1:  So that's where you make the argument, well if he doesn't then he must not want to.

01:32:15,810 --> 01:32:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  So his mind is corrupted to the point where he's not able to actually...

01:32:19,938 --> 01:32:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  be a good businessman essentially.

01:32:21,762 --> 01:32:22,558
SPEAKER_1:  It seems that way.

01:32:25,922 --> 01:32:30,047
SPEAKER_1:  The numbers of Scientologists have been going down and down and down since the early 90s.

01:32:30,047 --> 01:32:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  Is there a good?

01:32:31,298 --> 01:32:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's very difficult to get to this number.

01:32:33,506 --> 01:32:39,131
SPEAKER_0:  but is there a good estimate of what the current number of scientists or practicing Scientologists is?

01:32:39,131 --> 01:32:41,822
SPEAKER_1:  Oh yeah, I did a video about this. It's actually quite easy to get some of the number.

01:32:42,114 --> 01:32:44,446
SPEAKER_1:  It's not more than 35,000 in the entire world.

01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:50,110
SPEAKER_1:  And that's being very generous and charitable. I was intentionally generous. I broke it all down in a spreadsheet and everything.

01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:53,315
SPEAKER_0:  What can you give like some insights of how you get that?

01:32:53,315 --> 01:32:57,502
SPEAKER_1:  Sure, there's about 175 to 200 Scientology organizations in the world.

01:32:58,146 --> 01:32:58,974
SPEAKER_1:  anybody who's

01:32:59,202 --> 01:33:00,958
SPEAKER_1:  ever worked at these organizations, no.

01:33:01,314 --> 01:33:04,126
SPEAKER_1:  There's not more than 35 to 50 staff members per org.

01:33:04,770 --> 01:33:08,478
SPEAKER_1:  There's not more than one to 200 public Scientologists per org.

01:33:08,930 --> 01:33:12,766
SPEAKER_1:  I broke down the number of Sea Org members who'd be working at every continental management unit.

01:33:12,994 --> 01:33:13,694
SPEAKER_1:  middle management.

01:33:13,954 --> 01:33:15,006
SPEAKER_1:  international management.

01:33:15,394 --> 01:33:18,142
SPEAKER_1:  I broke it on the Mission Network and I was generous.

01:33:18,370 --> 01:33:21,502
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, my numbers were like, if L. Ron Hubbard came back.

01:33:22,050 --> 01:33:23,262
SPEAKER_1:  and they were doing an event.

01:33:23,650 --> 01:33:23,998
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:33:24,226 --> 01:33:31,454
SPEAKER_1:  L. Ron Hubbard was coming back and announcing OT9 and 10? How many Scientologists could we scrape together in every city to come to this event?

01:33:31,682 --> 01:33:33,118
SPEAKER_1:  It wasn't more than 35,000.

01:33:33,346 --> 01:33:35,134
SPEAKER_1:  Now contrast that to what Scientology says.

01:33:36,450 --> 01:33:38,910
SPEAKER_1:  millions, 10 million.

01:33:39,394 --> 01:33:39,838
SPEAKER_1:  people.

01:33:40,514 --> 01:33:42,526
SPEAKER_0:  Is this less people than there used to be?

01:33:42,626 --> 01:33:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, at its peak it was about 100,000 active members.

01:33:46,114 --> 01:33:47,742
SPEAKER_0:  but never the millions.

01:33:49,826 --> 01:33:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  has David Miscavige.

01:33:52,738 --> 01:33:54,110

01:33:59,010 --> 01:34:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  harassment assault and actual

01:34:02,786 --> 01:34:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know how to define assault, but violence. Oh yeah.

01:34:05,794 --> 01:34:06,814
SPEAKER_1:  dozens.

01:34:07,202 --> 01:34:09,374
SPEAKER_1:  of former Sea Org members from the International Base.

01:34:09,666 --> 01:34:12,126
SPEAKER_1:  have told stories of being assaulted by Miscavige. In fact,

01:34:12,674 --> 01:34:13,374
SPEAKER_1:  Mic Render.

01:34:13,858 --> 01:34:16,030
SPEAKER_1:  is probably the one person who's been assaulted by...

01:34:16,386 --> 01:34:18,046
SPEAKER_1:  Miscavige more than anyone else.

01:34:18,306 --> 01:34:20,542
SPEAKER_1:  He's personally probably been assaulted dozens of times.

01:34:21,986 --> 01:34:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  Who is Mike Rinder?

01:34:23,842 --> 01:34:27,294
SPEAKER_1:  So man, you're one of the highest ranking executives in Scientology.

01:34:27,650 --> 01:34:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  The Author

01:34:28,898 --> 01:34:31,902
SPEAKER_1:  There you go, a billion years. A billion years.

01:34:32,322 --> 01:34:34,878
SPEAKER_1:  It's a really is a fantastic book. Just like the guy.

01:34:35,618 --> 01:34:42,942
SPEAKER_1:  If the guy was born and raised in Scientology and worked personally with L. Ron Hubbard and worked personally with David Miscavige for decades, it doesn't get much more insider than that.

01:34:43,362 --> 01:34:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  A candid and deeply felt memoir of a life lost to false belief.

01:34:47,298 --> 01:34:48,766
SPEAKER_0:  and courageously regained.

01:34:49,218 --> 01:34:50,046
SPEAKER_0:  Lawrence Wright.

01:34:51,042 --> 01:34:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  A billion years my escape from a life in the highest ranks of Scientology, my grander.

01:34:56,194 --> 01:34:57,310
SPEAKER_1:  It's a fantastic book.

01:34:58,178 --> 01:35:01,918
SPEAKER_1:  He also narrates his own audio book too. I know you like the audio books. That's how I listen to it. Thank you for listening.

01:35:02,658 --> 01:35:05,726
SPEAKER_1:  So Mike, famously, you know, I just said a moment ago, like.

01:35:06,050 --> 01:35:10,686
SPEAKER_1:  someone who's treated so horribly, even though he still believes in Scientology, he had no choice but to leave.

01:35:11,458 --> 01:35:16,350
SPEAKER_1:  And he tells the story in that book, and he still believed in Scientology for years after he escaped.

01:35:16,770 --> 01:35:17,662
SPEAKER_1:  for years.

01:35:18,242 --> 01:35:24,446
SPEAKER_1:  Because there's this thing called the independent Scientology movement or the free zone or whatever. There are people who do Scientology outside of the Church of Scientology.

01:35:25,186 --> 01:35:25,918
SPEAKER_1:  There's just not many of them.

01:35:26,466 --> 01:35:27,710
SPEAKER_1:  but Mike was one of those people.

01:35:28,194 --> 01:35:32,670
SPEAKER_1:  who was actually doing Scientology even after he left. Now he no longer believes in that anymore and he doesn't do it.

01:35:33,250 --> 01:35:35,550
SPEAKER_1:  but even though he still believed, even though.

01:35:35,970 --> 01:35:37,278
SPEAKER_1:  Everything he knew.

01:35:38,146 --> 01:35:39,390
SPEAKER_1:  was what he was leaving behind.

01:35:39,906 --> 01:35:40,894
SPEAKER_1:  He still had to leave it behind.

01:35:41,634 --> 01:35:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  And by the way, I just opened a random page and he says.

01:35:44,322 --> 01:35:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  when I signed on for C-ORG in Adelaide in 1973.

01:35:48,066 --> 01:35:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  The recruiter promised I would train as a Scientology executive under the direct tutelage of Hubbard on the Apollo.

01:35:55,874 --> 01:35:59,038
SPEAKER_0:  This is another thing I should probably ask you about this.

01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:01,045
SPEAKER_1:  We can go for days.

01:36:01,045 --> 01:36:05,118
SPEAKER_0:  I was also told that after I learned all I needed to learn at the foot of the Master,

01:36:05,474 --> 01:36:09,118
SPEAKER_0:  I would return to Australia to help expand Scientology in my home country.

01:36:09,858 --> 01:36:10,238
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

01:36:10,786 --> 01:36:11,262
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:36:11,586 --> 01:36:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  What was the thing that really broke him?

01:36:14,434 --> 01:36:15,390
SPEAKER_1:  The final thing.

01:36:15,810 --> 01:36:16,638
SPEAKER_1:  is when

01:36:17,282 --> 01:36:23,166
SPEAKER_1:  He got to a point where he was no longer being forced to lie to protect a run Hubbard.

01:36:24,034 --> 01:36:27,838
SPEAKER_1:  He was now being forced to lie to protect David Miscavige.

01:36:28,642 --> 01:36:32,670
SPEAKER_1:  And specifically, it was about the allegations of having been assaulted by Miscavige.

01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:33,982
SPEAKER_1:  Mic render.

01:36:34,562 --> 01:36:39,870
SPEAKER_1:  was at some event. It might have been a grand opening for a building, a Scientology building in London.

01:36:40,322 --> 01:36:44,222
SPEAKER_1:  And I believe it was John Sweeney, at that time a BBC journalist.

01:36:44,610 --> 01:36:49,118
SPEAKER_1:  who stuck a camera and a microphone in Mike's face. Is it true David Miscavige assaulted you? Is it true?

01:36:49,378 --> 01:36:50,846
SPEAKER_1:  and Mike denied it on camera.

01:36:51,522 --> 01:36:53,790
SPEAKER_1:  and then turned around and to himself is like.

01:36:55,138 --> 01:36:55,678
SPEAKER_1:  This is what.

01:36:55,938 --> 01:36:57,470
SPEAKER_1:  my life has been reduced to?

01:36:58,146 --> 01:37:00,574
SPEAKER_1:  lying to protect David Miscavige?

01:37:01,122 --> 01:37:02,910
SPEAKER_1:  This used to be about Elrond Hobbird.

01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:04,062
SPEAKER_1:  This used to be about.

01:37:04,450 --> 01:37:05,790
SPEAKER_1:  Scientology.

01:37:06,114 --> 01:37:07,678
SPEAKER_1:  Now it's about protecting this douchebag?

01:37:08,770 --> 01:37:11,262
SPEAKER_1:  and Miscavige had just issued orders.

01:37:11,938 --> 01:37:13,246
SPEAKER_1:  that was gonna send Mike.

01:37:13,538 --> 01:37:14,654
SPEAKER_1:  Off to Australia.

01:37:15,074 --> 01:37:16,894
SPEAKER_1:  Miscavige is sadistic.

01:37:17,506 --> 01:37:18,078
SPEAKER_1:  That is.

01:37:18,370 --> 01:37:19,358
SPEAKER_1:  That is without question.

01:37:19,714 --> 01:37:23,262
SPEAKER_1:  Sadistic meaning he enjoys inflicting pain upon others

01:37:23,618 --> 01:37:32,734
SPEAKER_1:  So he very specifically was gonna tell Mike, tell Render, or tell that cocksucker, we're shipping him off to Australia. He's never gonna see his wife and his kids again, essentially.

01:37:33,442 --> 01:37:34,430
SPEAKER_1:  And that's what Mike was like.

01:37:35,202 --> 01:37:37,086
SPEAKER_1:  They were the only reason I hadn't already left.

01:37:38,786 --> 01:37:40,094
SPEAKER_1:  So if I follow the orders...

01:37:41,090 --> 01:37:41,758
SPEAKER_1:  I'm gonna lose them.

01:37:43,874 --> 01:37:45,630
SPEAKER_1:  If I leave Scientology, I'm gonna lose them.

01:37:46,786 --> 01:37:48,286
SPEAKER_1:  At least if I leave Scientology.

01:37:49,762 --> 01:37:50,974
SPEAKER_1:  I'll be free of something.

01:37:53,218 --> 01:37:53,758
SPEAKER_1:  fucking sad.

01:37:54,178 --> 01:37:55,454
SPEAKER_0:  and he still believed.

01:37:55,874 --> 01:37:58,622
SPEAKER_0:  Scientology to some degree after you left, is what you're saying.

01:37:59,842 --> 01:38:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  Has he spoken about what it took to let go of believing in Scientology?

01:38:04,674 --> 01:38:07,326
SPEAKER_1:  He does a very good job talking about all of this in the book.

01:38:09,698 --> 01:38:13,214
SPEAKER_1:  It took him like four or five years to get that book done.

01:38:13,442 --> 01:38:14,334
SPEAKER_1:  polished version.

01:38:14,786 --> 01:38:21,822
SPEAKER_1:  polished version of his story. And I think Mike's about getting ready to start his own YouTube channel, so that'll be a lot of fun. Actually, Mike comes on my channel all the time.

01:38:22,082 --> 01:38:35,486
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, you guys do a thing together, right? Yeah, we do. Three amigos with me and Mike Rinder and Mark Headley. That's why I gave you Mark's book. I thought maybe you would know him from our little three amigos, our Mondays with Mike and Mark videos. Mark Headley.

01:38:36,130 --> 01:38:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  BALONE FOR GOOD

01:38:38,210 --> 01:38:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  behind the Iron Curtain of Scientology.

01:38:40,386 --> 01:38:43,838
SPEAKER_1:  So he escaped from the international base on a motorcycle. It's a wild story.

01:38:44,674 --> 01:38:47,299
SPEAKER_1:  I won't even try to do it justice, but. Who's a better writer?

01:38:47,299 --> 01:38:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  out of the tooth.

01:38:49,730 --> 01:38:50,855
SPEAKER_1:  You're not gonna get me there, like.

01:38:50,855 --> 01:38:53,105
SPEAKER_0:  I'm trying to be investigative journalist.

01:38:53,105 --> 01:38:56,894
SPEAKER_1:  Mike and Mark are both on the board of the Aftermath Foundation with me.

01:38:57,474 --> 01:38:58,599
SPEAKER_1:  So who's better looking?

01:38:58,599 --> 01:38:59,349
SPEAKER_0:  Knives. W lemonade.

01:38:59,349 --> 01:39:05,278
SPEAKER_1:  It's one of my justifications for just putting up content every day is every video is just an excuse to

01:39:05,602 --> 01:39:08,830
SPEAKER_1:  in some little way promote the Aftermath Foundation. And I do that again.

01:39:09,186 --> 01:39:11,102
SPEAKER_1:  One, to genuinely help people escape.

01:39:11,330 --> 01:39:13,758
SPEAKER_1:  And two, because I know it drives David Miscavige crazy.

01:39:13,858 --> 01:39:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  If you look in your own heart, is there anger there?

01:39:17,506 --> 01:39:18,462
SPEAKER_1:  I don't think it's anger.

01:39:19,426 --> 01:39:22,718
SPEAKER_1:  I don't hate, I don't hate Scientology. I don't hate David Miscavige.

01:39:23,266 --> 01:39:25,598
SPEAKER_1:  I don't even hate my experience in Scientology.

01:39:25,922 --> 01:39:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  be able to.

01:39:27,362 --> 01:39:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  Accept the good.

01:39:28,962 --> 01:39:30,782
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. From your experience. Yeah.

01:39:31,106 --> 01:39:31,742
SPEAKER_1:  Absolutely.

01:39:32,130 --> 01:39:33,886
SPEAKER_1:  but it's also the only path that I traveled.

01:39:34,210 --> 01:39:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  So I tend.

01:39:36,322 --> 01:39:38,558
SPEAKER_1:  No, I'm okay, a little less so these days, but.

01:39:38,818 --> 01:39:39,518
SPEAKER_1:  earlier in life.

01:39:40,194 --> 01:39:46,462
SPEAKER_1:  I tended to attribute all positive characteristics in me to Scientology because in my simplistic way of thinking I was like...

01:39:46,786 --> 01:39:50,485
SPEAKER_1:  what else could it possibly be attributed to? that's a very black and white way of saying it

01:39:50,485 --> 01:39:54,686
SPEAKER_0:  Beautiful way to see life. No matter what happens to you, you attribute.

01:39:55,330 --> 01:39:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  Like you focus on the positive. Yeah.

01:39:57,666 --> 01:40:03,070
SPEAKER_0:  And you feel like sometimes people have traumatic experiences with parents and so on. Yeah. And if you focus on the positive.

01:40:03,554 --> 01:40:04,894
SPEAKER_0:  It's a good way to let go. Right.

01:40:05,346 --> 01:40:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  of the trauma associated with it. True

01:40:07,842 --> 01:40:13,822
SPEAKER_1:  But like another example would be like, I didn't go to school. Like I stopped going to school in the seventh grade, but people go, but you sound so smart.

01:40:14,466 --> 01:40:17,086
SPEAKER_1:  And what am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to say, well, that's because of Scientology?

01:40:17,634 --> 01:40:18,654
SPEAKER_1:  How do I answer that question?

01:40:19,266 --> 01:40:21,182
SPEAKER_1:  Like, if it's the only path I traveled.

01:40:21,570 --> 01:40:25,662
SPEAKER_1:  How do I answer that question? I don't necessarily wanna give Scientology credit, but what the hell am I supposed to point to?

01:40:26,338 --> 01:40:26,686
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

01:40:26,882 --> 01:40:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, you said.

01:40:28,802 --> 01:40:29,278
SPEAKER_0:  There's...

01:40:29,698 --> 01:40:34,974
SPEAKER_0:  you kind of enjoy, I mean part of it is you joking and trolling, that you enjoy knowing that your YouTube channel

01:40:35,426 --> 01:40:37,310
SPEAKER_0:  drives David Miscavige crazy.

01:40:38,178 --> 01:40:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, what?

01:40:40,738 --> 01:40:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  That means you still, I mean, there is a joy.

01:40:43,298 --> 01:40:45,923
SPEAKER_1:  You have. There is a joy. I'm not going to deny that.

01:40:45,923 --> 01:40:49,214
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know what to make of that, because I suppose there's an intimacy.

01:40:49,858 --> 01:40:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  when you're part of a tribe of that kind.

01:40:52,994 --> 01:40:54,334
SPEAKER_1:  It's almost like, let me try it out.

01:40:54,818 --> 01:40:55,806
SPEAKER_1:  Let me try to frame it.

01:40:56,610 --> 01:40:58,782
SPEAKER_1:  I wasn't trying to get kicked out of Scientology.

01:40:59,330 --> 01:41:01,950
SPEAKER_1:  I was trying to not get kicked out of Scientology.

01:41:02,946 --> 01:41:08,542
SPEAKER_1:  I, you know, so what happened first? First, my mom got kicked out for basically talking some smack about David Miscavige.

01:41:09,506 --> 01:41:13,630
SPEAKER_1:  And then they go to me and they go, okay, you've got a disconnect from your mom or you're gonna get kicked out.

01:41:14,370 --> 01:41:19,038
SPEAKER_1:  And I lied about that. I was like, okay, I'll disconnect. But I never did. For a couple years, I lied my ass off about it.

01:41:19,426 --> 01:41:20,318
SPEAKER_1:  Eventually they were like

01:41:20,546 --> 01:41:22,046
SPEAKER_1:  This guy's gonna keep lying to us, right?

01:41:22,306 --> 01:41:23,870
SPEAKER_1:  And they're like, yeah, like, all right, you're out.

01:41:24,194 --> 01:41:26,878
SPEAKER_1:  So then they go to my wife, say you gotta divorce your husband you're gonna get kicked out.

01:41:27,202 --> 01:41:27,838
SPEAKER_1:  And she goes, no.

01:41:34,562 --> 01:41:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  That's a hell of a statement from her.

01:41:37,474 --> 01:41:39,614
SPEAKER_1:  It's going to get harder from here. It's okay, if這是uk yeah, If tell acknowledgement that

01:41:40,002 --> 01:41:40,990
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not quite sure how to...

01:41:42,050 --> 01:41:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, I'll try to get, I'll try to do my best. I don't seem like a man who's afraid of hard things.

01:41:46,498 --> 01:41:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

01:41:47,522 --> 01:41:48,286
SPEAKER_1:  So she's like.

01:41:49,442 --> 01:41:49,854
SPEAKER_1:  No.

01:41:51,330 --> 01:41:52,638
SPEAKER_1:  then they go to her parents.

01:41:55,202 --> 01:41:57,854
SPEAKER_1:  and they say, you've got a disconnect from your daughter.

01:41:58,594 --> 01:42:00,190
SPEAKER_1:  and your three granddaughters.

01:42:01,538 --> 01:42:02,686
SPEAKER_1:  or you're gonna get kicked out.

01:42:05,794 --> 01:42:08,222
SPEAKER_1:  but they have three other kids who are Scientologists.

01:42:08,610 --> 01:42:11,326
SPEAKER_1:  who have spouses who are Scientologists, who have grandkids.

01:42:13,058 --> 01:42:13,854
SPEAKER_1:  So I feel like.

01:42:14,594 --> 01:42:20,158
SPEAKER_1:  Up until that point, everybody was sort of making a decision for themselves and what would be best for themselves.

01:42:21,218 --> 01:42:22,494
SPEAKER_1:  until they get to her parents.

01:42:23,330 --> 01:42:24,030
SPEAKER_1:  And then they're like

01:42:24,386 --> 01:42:26,110
SPEAKER_1:  Which grandkids are we going to lose?

01:42:26,850 --> 01:42:27,358
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

01:42:28,290 --> 01:42:30,590
SPEAKER_1:  at the part where they were trying to get me to disconnect from my mom.

01:42:31,330 --> 01:42:31,678
SPEAKER_1:  They work.

01:42:32,162 --> 01:42:34,590
SPEAKER_1:  that I spent talking to them going...

01:42:35,138 --> 01:42:36,318
SPEAKER_1:  You know guys.

01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:38,526
SPEAKER_1:  There's another way.

01:42:40,386 --> 01:42:41,822
SPEAKER_1:  It doesn't have to go this way.

01:42:42,690 --> 01:42:45,406
SPEAKER_1:  There's another way that ends well for all of us.

01:42:46,370 --> 01:42:48,350
SPEAKER_1:  and that wasn't even considered.

01:42:49,218 --> 01:42:50,302
SPEAKER_1:  And I go like.

01:42:51,330 --> 01:42:53,022
SPEAKER_1:  They created this monster.

01:42:54,914 --> 01:42:56,190
SPEAKER_1:  And that's a fact.

01:42:57,090 --> 01:42:58,302
SPEAKER_1:  And that's why I take joy in it.

01:42:59,298 --> 01:43:09,374
SPEAKER_1:  When people ask me is Scientology a destructive cult? I don't even have to get into all the academic discussions of what's a religion and what's a cult and what's the difference. I go as long as they destroy families like that.

01:43:09,986 --> 01:43:10,590
SPEAKER_1:  their cult.

01:43:12,546 --> 01:43:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  Julz.

01:43:13,858 --> 01:43:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  Cut people off.

01:43:15,426 --> 01:43:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  deliberately, one by one.

01:43:20,962 --> 01:43:22,398
SPEAKER_0:  And it doesn't have to be that way.

01:43:23,650 --> 01:43:24,670
SPEAKER_0:  And why is it that way?

01:43:25,666 --> 01:43:26,654
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, it started with.

01:43:27,074 --> 01:43:30,558
SPEAKER_1:  L. Ron Hubbard laying out a policy framework, a policy structure.

01:43:31,106 --> 01:43:31,838
SPEAKER_1:  that

01:43:32,674 --> 01:43:34,686
SPEAKER_1:  if interpreted and applied.

01:43:35,074 --> 01:43:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  in the worst.

01:43:36,130 --> 01:43:37,310
SPEAKER_1:  possible way.

01:43:37,730 --> 01:43:40,894
SPEAKER_1:  with the worst possible judgment can be abused in that way.

01:43:41,218 --> 01:43:42,494
SPEAKER_1:  I would make the argument.

01:43:43,330 --> 01:43:45,726
SPEAKER_1:  that if an anti-broker had taken over.

01:43:46,530 --> 01:43:48,062
SPEAKER_1:  that Scientology policy.

01:43:48,290 --> 01:43:49,822
SPEAKER_1:  does have enough.

01:43:50,082 --> 01:43:52,670
SPEAKER_1:  little um caveats baked into it that

01:43:53,282 --> 01:43:58,334
SPEAKER_1:  even the policies about disconnection could be interpreted and implemented in a

01:43:59,138 --> 01:44:00,350
SPEAKER_1:  non-destructive way.

01:44:01,442 --> 01:44:03,582
SPEAKER_1:  There is room for judgment and discretion.

01:44:04,802 --> 01:44:07,294
SPEAKER_1:  and Miscavige has just created the worst

01:44:07,778 --> 01:44:11,550
SPEAKER_1:  possible version of Scientology and that's where you sort of get that argument of.

01:44:11,842 --> 01:44:15,934
SPEAKER_1:  Does he even want Scientology to succeed? Because he seems to be hell bent.

01:44:16,802 --> 01:44:18,014
SPEAKER_1:  on making sure that he doesn't.

01:44:20,322 --> 01:44:23,806
SPEAKER_1:  And I don't want to see him make it succeed, but it.

01:44:24,066 --> 01:44:25,694
SPEAKER_1:  does bring that question up of like.

01:44:26,050 --> 01:44:27,198
SPEAKER_1:  What are his motivations?

01:44:27,938 --> 01:44:31,070
SPEAKER_1:  Can he not see that he's destroying the thing he's supposed to be?

01:44:31,330 --> 01:44:31,966
SPEAKER_1:  Expanding.

01:44:32,162 --> 01:44:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  That's also, you know, there's ways to measure.

01:44:34,914 --> 01:44:35,422
SPEAKER_0:  cost.

01:44:37,986 --> 01:44:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  That would probably be the most costly aspect of Scientology.

01:44:42,946 --> 01:44:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  is the suffering associated with the separating of families.

01:44:46,722 --> 01:44:51,614
SPEAKER_0:  I mean that actually just puts, makes it very concrete what we value in human life.

01:44:52,386 --> 01:44:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  is the connection to our loved ones.

01:44:54,562 --> 01:44:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  Like everything else doesn't matter. I like getting 50 bucks a week.

01:44:58,882 --> 01:44:59,422
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

01:45:00,482 --> 01:45:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  Like that, like.

01:45:02,082 --> 01:45:02,526
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

01:45:02,818 --> 01:45:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  getting money stolen from you.

01:45:05,218 --> 01:45:08,798
SPEAKER_0:  getting the truth stolen from you, none of that compares.

01:45:09,730 --> 01:45:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  You can even frame that as the good, there could be a lot of positives, whatever, in the tribe.

01:45:15,234 --> 01:45:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  But separating families, separating loved ones, that's the destructive thing.

01:45:20,162 --> 01:45:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  So no hate.

01:45:21,762 --> 01:45:23,102
SPEAKER_0:  No, I genuinely don't hate them.

01:45:24,226 --> 01:45:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  Do you forgive them?

01:45:25,538 --> 01:45:26,270
SPEAKER_1:  100%

01:45:26,882 --> 01:45:29,662
SPEAKER_1:  There's no one I look at in Scientology that I go.

01:45:30,050 --> 01:45:31,678
SPEAKER_1:  How dare you. Julian's going to be dough, mommy.

01:45:33,026 --> 01:45:33,566
SPEAKER_1:  having to.

01:45:33,986 --> 01:45:36,190
SPEAKER_1:  you know, operate under David Miscavige's orders, I would have done.

01:45:36,418 --> 01:45:37,086
SPEAKER_1:  The same thing.

01:45:37,378 --> 01:45:38,142
SPEAKER_1:  and I would have loved it.

01:45:39,074 --> 01:45:39,518
SPEAKER_1:  Truthfully.

01:45:40,578 --> 01:45:43,198
SPEAKER_1:  I don't blame any of them. I mean, I take the opposite approach.

01:45:43,458 --> 01:45:44,318
SPEAKER_1:  If they knew.

01:45:44,578 --> 01:45:45,406
SPEAKER_1:  What I knew.

01:45:45,954 --> 01:45:46,910
SPEAKER_1:  they'd be doing what I'm doing.

01:45:47,906 --> 01:45:49,470
SPEAKER_1:  If they knew what I knew and believed it.

01:45:49,762 --> 01:45:50,622
SPEAKER_1:  They'd be doing what I'm doing.

01:45:50,946 --> 01:45:53,790
SPEAKER_1:  They're not dumb. It's not dumb people in Scientology.

01:45:55,394 --> 01:45:57,118
SPEAKER_0:  They're ambitious. Third.

01:45:57,666 --> 01:45:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  Dreamers they got

01:45:59,266 --> 01:46:01,662
SPEAKER_0:  They're driven, all that kind of stuff. Yeah.

01:46:02,530 --> 01:46:03,998
SPEAKER_1:  And it's one of the reasons I like.

01:46:04,546 --> 01:46:05,022
SPEAKER_1:  Putting up.

01:46:05,282 --> 01:46:08,670
SPEAKER_1:  content on my channel so they can see, hey, like if you are a Scientologist.

01:46:09,154 --> 01:46:10,078
SPEAKER_1:  You look at that and you go, hey.

01:46:10,690 --> 01:46:20,478
SPEAKER_1:  He seems like he's doing well, he's happy, he's a positive guy, he's a good communicator, he knows what he's talking about, he's not lying, he's not exaggerating. I don't exaggerate anything.

01:46:20,994 --> 01:46:23,390
SPEAKER_1:  on my channel. I don't make up anything.

01:46:24,546 --> 01:46:27,262
SPEAKER_1:  And this actually comes from an experience I had.

01:46:27,682 --> 01:46:33,438
SPEAKER_1:  from 1998 to 2000, I was living in LA. I sort of had a two year period in my life where I actually had almost no contact with Scientology.

01:46:35,074 --> 01:46:38,014
SPEAKER_1:  And during that time, I found my way onto the internet.

01:46:38,530 --> 01:46:39,838
SPEAKER_1:  and there was a website, it might've been.

01:46:40,130 --> 01:46:43,422
SPEAKER_1:  ESMB ex-scientology message, but whatever it was, it was.

01:46:43,746 --> 01:46:45,150
SPEAKER_1:  At that time, the main source of

01:46:45,410 --> 01:46:47,230
SPEAKER_1:  critical information about Scientology on the internet.

01:46:47,874 --> 01:46:50,206
SPEAKER_1:  And I looked at it and remember I was still a true believer.

01:46:50,978 --> 01:46:52,478
SPEAKER_1:  And I looked at this and it was so.

01:46:53,602 --> 01:46:54,718
SPEAKER_1:  offensive

01:46:54,978 --> 01:46:58,334
SPEAKER_1:  Um, insulting, uh, hyperbolic exaggerated. I was like.

01:46:59,010 --> 01:46:59,326
SPEAKER_1:  Oh.

01:46:59,842 --> 01:47:00,542
SPEAKER_1:  It's a bunch of bullshit.

01:47:02,818 --> 01:47:05,982
SPEAKER_1:  I was in Scientology for 16 more years.

01:47:07,298 --> 01:47:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  IF

01:47:08,642 --> 01:47:10,558
SPEAKER_1:  what I had seen on the internet about

01:47:11,010 --> 01:47:15,902
SPEAKER_1:  of Scientology, if what I had seen when I had seen it was something that actually resonated with me.

01:47:16,738 --> 01:47:17,854
SPEAKER_1:  that I was like, oh.

01:47:18,690 --> 01:47:20,830
SPEAKER_1:  that I believed was true. Does that seem credible?

01:47:21,506 --> 01:47:23,614
SPEAKER_1:  I would have gotten out of Scientology 16 years earlier.

01:47:24,386 --> 01:47:25,150
SPEAKER_1:  So I was like.

01:47:27,330 --> 01:47:29,950
SPEAKER_1:  How can I help create an experience on the internet?

01:47:30,210 --> 01:47:32,478
SPEAKER_1:  that if a Scientologist stumbles upon it,

01:47:32,802 --> 01:47:34,142
SPEAKER_1:  it will resonate with them.

01:47:34,402 --> 01:47:35,678
SPEAKER_1:  instead of repelling them.

01:47:36,194 --> 01:47:37,662
SPEAKER_1:  And that is exactly.

01:47:37,890 --> 01:47:40,126
SPEAKER_1:  what I have set out to do and what I believe I've accomplished.

01:47:40,610 --> 01:47:42,686
SPEAKER_0:  There's the content, the message, but.

01:47:43,074 --> 01:47:48,510
SPEAKER_0:  Also just showing that you can be happy outside of Scientology. Exactly. You can have a fulfilling life, you can be a good man.

01:47:49,282 --> 01:47:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  All that.

01:47:51,330 --> 01:47:55,582
SPEAKER_0:  What benefit do you think Tom Cruise gets from Scientology? So why is he still in Scientology?

01:47:55,778 --> 01:48:01,438
SPEAKER_1:  He genuinely loves it. And also Miscavige does. There's one celebrity who does have.

01:48:01,794 --> 01:48:04,638
SPEAKER_1:  the most unique experience in Scientology, and that is Tom.

01:48:05,282 --> 01:48:07,326
SPEAKER_1:  Scientology hires all of Tom's staff.

01:48:07,842 --> 01:48:09,086
SPEAKER_1:  There are no

01:48:09,442 --> 01:48:17,630
SPEAKER_1:  All of Tom's staff are subject to interrogations by Scientology, not only in the hiring process, but during the employment, like.

01:48:18,018 --> 01:48:24,607
SPEAKER_1:  David Miscavige on Scientology runs Tom Cruise's life and his production company and his household staff. Did you imagine this?

01:48:24,607 --> 01:48:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  personal connection there where

01:48:26,466 --> 01:48:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  They're just, they like each other a lot.

01:48:28,802 --> 01:48:29,598
SPEAKER_1:  Best friends.

01:48:30,562 --> 01:48:35,230
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, it's them against the world is how they see it. I think it's pretty easy to see.

01:48:35,554 --> 01:48:37,246
SPEAKER_1:  how that works between the two of them.

01:48:37,570 --> 01:48:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  I think this idea of...

01:48:39,138 --> 01:48:41,054
SPEAKER_0:  them against the world us against the world

01:48:41,410 --> 01:48:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  It's a really powerful, intimate.

01:48:43,938 --> 01:48:46,814
SPEAKER_0:  I kind of see like friendships and relationships that way.

01:48:47,298 --> 01:48:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  that I'm not in a dark sense, but it's like.

01:48:50,434 --> 01:49:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  the world is full of cruelty and absurdity and unfairness and so on. It's nice to huddle together like the penguins in March of the Penguins against the cold. 100%, and one hundred percent.

01:49:02,850 --> 01:49:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  Especially with the ideology of

01:49:05,602 --> 01:49:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  of Scientology.

01:49:07,586 --> 01:49:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  It, uh...

01:49:08,738 --> 01:49:09,630
SPEAKER_0:  this idea that

01:49:10,370 --> 01:49:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  You can be anything. You can essentially—

01:49:13,474 --> 01:49:17,694
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, you can manifest it essentially through like believing it.

01:49:18,370 --> 01:49:20,606
SPEAKER_0:  uh... manually put into those words

01:49:20,898 --> 01:49:22,398
SPEAKER_0:  but believing that you're

01:49:22,754 --> 01:49:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  You're a god.

01:49:24,674 --> 01:49:27,998
SPEAKER_0:  It's a really like inspiring positive thing to think.

01:49:28,578 --> 01:49:34,718
SPEAKER_1:  If they could figure out how to do all that without destroying families and bankrupting its members, they might actually have a future.

01:49:35,266 --> 01:49:37,406
SPEAKER_1:  That's why like it's funny because sometimes I feel like it's like.

01:49:37,890 --> 01:49:44,766
SPEAKER_1:  Like I'm rooting for them to like succeed and do it right. And I'm not, but it's an interesting academic discussion and a half of like.

01:49:45,538 --> 01:49:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  We can all see how much people will sacrifice in the names of belief and religion. Yeah. We can see how much Scientologists sacrifice.

01:49:52,386 --> 01:49:53,662
SPEAKER_1:  based on what they already believe.

01:49:55,874 --> 01:49:57,406
SPEAKER_1:  If he would just start.

01:49:57,730 --> 01:49:59,582
SPEAKER_1:  treating people less horribly.

01:50:00,098 --> 01:50:02,558
SPEAKER_1:  You know what I'm saying? It might actually have a future.

01:50:03,010 --> 01:50:04,135
SPEAKER_1:  But it's not that I wanted to.

01:50:04,135 --> 01:50:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  It seems like this dark lesson of human nature that

01:50:07,874 --> 01:50:08,286
SPEAKER_0:  date.

01:50:08,514 --> 01:50:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  that like.

01:50:09,634 --> 01:50:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  There's something about

01:50:11,042 --> 01:50:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  you know, to use the word cults, that you just stop seeing reality for what it is. There's a lot of things that could make this a better organization that's actually helping people flourish

01:50:21,698 --> 01:50:22,110
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:50:23,458 --> 01:50:25,182
SPEAKER_0:  and be a little bit more like.

01:50:26,082 --> 01:50:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  uh... loose about membership

01:50:28,450 --> 01:50:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  not dividing families, not causing suffering, not causing financial harm, but actually inspiring people.

01:50:34,434 --> 01:50:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  and helping people, but then maybe it did fundamentally change what the organization is.

01:50:39,650 --> 01:50:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  And maybe that means somebody like David Miscavige loses power too.

01:50:43,266 --> 01:50:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  which might be very difficult or people that are close to him lose power.

01:50:46,306 --> 01:50:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  and people hold onto power. So, yeah.

01:50:48,738 --> 01:50:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  Whatever the human force is here, it seems to...

01:50:53,122 --> 01:50:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  become worse and worse over time.

01:50:55,362 --> 01:50:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  What about, uh...

01:50:57,730 --> 01:51:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  Let me ask a conspiracy question. Is there a chance that Tom Cruise is being blackmailed? That there's information from auditing?

01:51:05,218 --> 01:51:06,343
SPEAKER_0:  So that kind of stuff is

01:51:06,343 --> 01:51:09,246
SPEAKER_1:  That's very conspiratorial. I've actually come out and said definitively.

01:51:09,474 --> 01:51:15,486
SPEAKER_1:  I do not know of a single person who stays in Scientology because they're afraid of being blackmailed. It's just not a thing.

01:51:15,810 --> 01:51:17,342
SPEAKER_1:  It's just not a thing.

01:51:18,402 --> 01:51:23,294
SPEAKER_1:  Does Scientology have enough information to blackmail someone if they wanted to? Well sure!

01:51:23,842 --> 01:51:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, and it doesn't have to be true. It could just be lies. Who cares? Who knows? I can say whatever the hell they want.

01:51:28,770 --> 01:51:30,398
SPEAKER_1:  So that's the thing, it doesn't even have to be true.

01:51:30,786 --> 01:51:32,958
SPEAKER_1:  And actually that would be the argument against blackmailing.

01:51:33,314 --> 01:51:43,166
SPEAKER_1:  Like in order for Scientology to blackmail you with that information, they'd actually have to represent that, yes, he really did tell us this. And it's like, well, then why are you spilling secrets of members, right? That's a bad precedent.

01:51:43,618 --> 01:51:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  What are some of the sins according to Scientology?

01:51:46,786 --> 01:51:53,534
SPEAKER_1:  Most of the sins from a Scientology perspective are just doing or saying anything that brings repute to Scientology itself.

01:51:54,114 --> 01:51:54,462
SPEAKER_1:  Right.

01:51:54,914 --> 01:51:55,358
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:51:56,674 --> 01:52:01,118
SPEAKER_1:  Remember, it's not like Christianity where there's rules. If you break this rule, you're not getting into heaven.

01:52:01,730 --> 01:52:02,855
SPEAKER_1:  to scientists and think about things.

01:52:02,855 --> 01:52:05,105
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, there's the drug. You can't do drugs, right?

01:52:05,105 --> 01:52:05,854
SPEAKER_1:  can't do.

01:52:06,274 --> 01:52:07,166
SPEAKER_1:  are drugs.

01:52:08,258 --> 01:52:11,070
SPEAKER_1:  and you can't take any psychotropic medications.

01:52:11,554 --> 01:52:12,990
SPEAKER_1:  and no medications almost at all.

01:52:13,314 --> 01:52:19,422
SPEAKER_1:  you're allowed to take medications. It's just, there's no rules expressly prohibiting it. It's just most Scientologists tend not to.

01:52:20,034 --> 01:52:21,054
SPEAKER_1:  You can take Advil.

01:52:21,346 --> 01:52:22,622
SPEAKER_1:  but many Scientologists won't.

01:52:24,226 --> 01:52:29,886
SPEAKER_1:  You just can't take anything prescribed by a psychiatrist, a psychologist or any drugs that are.

01:52:30,146 --> 01:52:32,798
SPEAKER_1:  psychotropic drugs. I mean SSRIs are considered

01:52:33,026 --> 01:52:34,398
SPEAKER_1:  Probably the closest thing too.

01:52:34,818 --> 01:52:35,486
SPEAKER_1:  Pure evil.

01:52:36,034 --> 01:52:37,406
SPEAKER_1:  in the world of Scientology.

01:52:37,570 --> 01:52:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  What about weird question? What about sex?

01:52:40,034 --> 01:52:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  Is there boundaries on what's...

01:52:41,922 --> 01:52:44,830
SPEAKER_1:  They're used to not be. It's become very puritanical.

01:52:45,314 --> 01:52:48,478
SPEAKER_1:  in the last many decades for a reason I can't actually explain.

01:52:48,930 --> 01:52:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  Like, Miscavige does seem to be infatuated.

01:52:52,802 --> 01:52:53,854
SPEAKER_1:  with controlling sex.

01:52:55,138 --> 01:53:00,030
SPEAKER_1:  Like that is one thing about Miscavige version of Scientology that's gotten very strange.

01:53:00,418 --> 01:53:03,134
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, L. Ron Hubbard even specifically wrote a policy that says...

01:53:03,362 --> 01:53:04,862
SPEAKER_1:  We are no longer going to.

01:53:06,114 --> 01:53:06,942
SPEAKER_1:  regulate in

01:53:07,202 --> 01:53:08,190
SPEAKER_1:  Anyway.

01:53:08,578 --> 01:53:09,950
SPEAKER_1:  the bedroom activities of people.

01:53:10,178 --> 01:53:17,214
SPEAKER_1:  He literally said, from this point on, no one is allowed to be subject to any justice actions of any kind whatsoever for anything they do.

01:53:17,442 --> 01:53:18,430
SPEAKER_1:  in their sexual lives.

01:53:19,202 --> 01:53:23,742
SPEAKER_1:  but that still did not give permission for gay relationships. That was still referring to straight stuff.

01:53:23,874 --> 01:53:25,982
SPEAKER_0:  and monogamous only.

01:53:26,914 --> 01:53:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  Can you do open marriages and open relationships?

01:53:30,434 --> 01:53:32,309
SPEAKER_1:  According to that over on Hubbard Policy, you can...

01:53:32,309 --> 01:53:33,598
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, but you know

01:53:33,794 --> 01:53:39,806
SPEAKER_1:  I think he wrote that policy before he created the C organization. And then what happened is this is actually how this came into effect.

01:53:40,418 --> 01:53:41,982
SPEAKER_1:  He created this new organization.

01:53:42,370 --> 01:53:43,454
SPEAKER_1:  You had a lot of people on a ship.

01:53:43,778 --> 01:53:45,950
SPEAKER_1:  and everybody was just banging each other and it created.

01:53:46,178 --> 01:53:54,238
SPEAKER_1:  just a nightmare of personal relationship. It was making production impossible. Not because everybody was spending so much time banging, but because everybody was so upset.

01:53:54,466 --> 01:53:55,591
SPEAKER_1:  about who was paying.

01:53:55,591 --> 01:53:57,438
SPEAKER_0:  I was like, yeah.

01:53:57,858 --> 01:54:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  I mean sex and that kind of dynamic is really...

01:54:03,010 --> 01:54:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, humans do what humans do, and then there's drama and all that. It's understandable, because everybody's so intimate, it's a closed...

01:54:10,690 --> 01:54:11,326
SPEAKER_0:  tribe.

01:54:11,682 --> 01:54:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  It makes sense to limit sex otherwise everyone's but otherwise it becomes a sex cult. Yeah, which a lot of them

01:54:18,370 --> 01:54:22,334
SPEAKER_0:  becoming on that topic, would you classify Scientology as a cult?

01:54:22,722 --> 01:54:23,454
SPEAKER_1:  100%.

01:54:24,098 --> 01:54:25,150
SPEAKER_1:  but not because I'm like.

01:54:25,538 --> 01:54:27,518
SPEAKER_1:  fully conversant with the academic.

01:54:28,002 --> 01:54:36,670
SPEAKER_1:  differentiations between what's a religion and what's a cult. I mean, Scientology would say, well, all small new religions are cults. And I don't know, that's probably true. Some people would say all religions are cults. And I'd be like.

01:54:36,962 --> 01:54:41,502
SPEAKER_1:  depends on how you define religion and it depends on how you define cult. But I just fall back on my thing of like...

01:54:41,762 --> 01:54:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  If you're destroying families and bankrupting your members.

01:54:45,378 --> 01:54:46,142
SPEAKER_1:  You're a cult.

01:54:46,818 --> 01:54:47,230
SPEAKER_1:  That's all.

01:54:47,586 --> 01:54:47,966
SPEAKER_1:  That's.

01:54:48,706 --> 01:54:50,718
SPEAKER_0:  How I look at it. Versus them and.

01:54:51,490 --> 01:54:55,166
SPEAKER_0:  to them could be your family, could be your loved ones that...

01:54:56,770 --> 01:55:05,918
SPEAKER_0:  that's deeply destructive and one of the things you would probably throw into the definition of a cult is something that's actually destructive. It's like I do a lot of stuff that's cult-like, like Jiu-Jitsu.

01:55:06,466 --> 01:55:09,214
SPEAKER_0:  Like there's a lot of really close knit tribes.

01:55:09,954 --> 01:55:13,150
SPEAKER_0:  but there's no negative toxicity to it. There's no-

01:55:13,570 --> 01:55:14,494
SPEAKER_0:  divide.

01:55:15,074 --> 01:55:16,830
SPEAKER_0:  divisions or if there is

01:55:17,378 --> 01:55:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  It's more.

01:55:19,586 --> 01:55:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  Boy.

01:55:21,090 --> 01:55:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  Try being a fan of a certain soccer team and then becoming a fan of another soccer team. That's hardcore. N designing your photography version without any editing involved.

01:55:27,266 --> 01:55:31,838
SPEAKER_1:  But I'll tell you, I trained jiu-jitsu as well and I have found...

01:55:32,130 --> 01:55:33,854
SPEAKER_1:  that community of people.

01:55:34,242 --> 01:55:36,478
SPEAKER_1:  to be one of the most loving.

01:55:37,282 --> 01:55:39,038
SPEAKER_1:  and helpful.

01:55:39,682 --> 01:55:40,958
SPEAKER_1:  a group of people.

01:55:41,218 --> 01:55:43,838
SPEAKER_1:  Shout out to John Keller, Gracie Baja Clearwater.

01:55:44,226 --> 01:55:48,990
SPEAKER_1:  No, but seriously, it's one of the reasons I continue to do it.

01:55:49,314 --> 01:55:49,950
SPEAKER_1:  despite.

01:55:50,722 --> 01:55:54,741
SPEAKER_1:  my back, my hip, my shoulder. It's like, it's just such a cool group of guys.

01:55:54,741 --> 01:56:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  on. It used to not, I think it was much more divisive in the beginning from those Brazilian roots.

01:56:01,666 --> 01:56:04,958
SPEAKER_0:  One of the things that's really hard is the team oriented.

01:56:05,666 --> 01:56:11,486
SPEAKER_0:  If you're this team, you're out of die with this team and there's no, there's the Crayonches, they go to another team.

01:56:12,162 --> 01:56:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that aspect, that was actually a turnoff for me in the beginning, that the toxicity of that because

01:56:17,250 --> 01:56:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  I understand that.

01:56:18,690 --> 01:56:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  a little bit for the elites.

01:56:21,570 --> 01:56:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  for the highest of the highest.

01:56:23,426 --> 01:56:35,902
SPEAKER_0:  That there is, I like the brotherhood and the loyalty of the people, like the Olympic gold medalists, the best in the world, yes, but for recreational fun. I know. This is ultimately about the camaraderie of all human beings together, not some.

01:56:36,418 --> 01:56:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  whatever label you put on it.

01:56:38,466 --> 01:56:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  and yourself.

01:56:39,778 --> 01:56:44,254
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think we actually talked about the organization itself. We talked about tax exempt status.

01:56:44,642 --> 01:56:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  which is really important.

01:56:46,370 --> 01:56:49,822
SPEAKER_0:  We talked about some of the control, like through the propaganda control.

01:56:50,530 --> 01:56:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  of what's out there.

01:56:51,842 --> 01:56:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  It's actually interesting that you said that like.

01:56:55,298 --> 01:56:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  Scientologists pretty much lost the battle with the internet

01:56:58,402 --> 01:56:59,006
SPEAKER_0:  Oh yeah.

01:57:00,290 --> 01:57:03,486
SPEAKER_0:  Which is kind of inspiring that it's hard to defeat the internet.

01:57:05,410 --> 01:57:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  but then there's like.

01:57:06,626 --> 01:57:07,390
SPEAKER_0:  botster.

01:57:08,066 --> 01:57:10,430
SPEAKER_0:  I think if you're sophisticated, I'm not sure that's true.

01:57:10,626 --> 01:57:18,430
SPEAKER_1:  But if you're not, it's kind of remarkable. They haven't been able to capitalize on these bot armies because there's one thing that they have. It's a lot of tax-free money that they got nothing else better to do. Yeah, right.

01:57:18,658 --> 01:57:22,783
SPEAKER_1:  You know, they just, they should give you a call. Like they just don't have the right people apparently.

01:57:22,783 --> 01:57:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  Heh.

01:57:23,682 --> 01:57:24,158
SPEAKER_0:  uh

01:57:24,482 --> 01:57:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  But that said, how do they wield?

01:57:26,594 --> 01:57:35,605
SPEAKER_0:  influence with government agencies with you've talked about the local police enforcement also federal agencies anything

01:57:35,605 --> 01:57:40,350
SPEAKER_1:  That is the one way they effectively put their money to use is lobbyists and attorneys.

01:57:40,770 --> 01:57:45,342
SPEAKER_1:  Um, you know, judges very rarely have they ever ever been able just to get a politician on their side.

01:57:45,666 --> 01:57:47,038
SPEAKER_1:  It's the behind the scenes people.

01:57:47,490 --> 01:57:50,430
SPEAKER_1:  You know, Greta Van Susteren's a very high-level, long-term Scientologist.

01:57:50,658 --> 01:57:54,270
SPEAKER_1:  and her husband, I always get it wrong, either Jim Cole or John Cole, I always get it wrong.

01:57:54,818 --> 01:57:56,574
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, he's a very powerful attorney.

01:57:56,802 --> 01:57:57,982
SPEAKER_1:  who has a lot.

01:57:58,210 --> 01:58:00,542
SPEAKER_1:  wields a lot of influence behind the scenes.

01:58:01,378 --> 01:58:08,894
SPEAKER_1:  And that's just one example. Like the reason why that's an interesting example is because he's actually a Scientologist and he travels in those circles.

01:58:09,250 --> 01:58:11,166
SPEAKER_1:  Scientology though, it's money.

01:58:11,490 --> 01:58:12,542
SPEAKER_1:  goes to good use.

01:58:12,802 --> 01:58:17,374
SPEAKER_1:  by hiring non-scientologists, retired judges, attorneys, lobbyists. It really is.

01:58:17,762 --> 01:58:19,326
SPEAKER_1:  how they get almost anything done.

01:58:19,682 --> 01:58:24,286
SPEAKER_1:  Like, Miscavige himself is not hobnobbing and glad-hanging and shaking hands and meeting these folks. It's...

01:58:24,674 --> 01:58:26,622
SPEAKER_1:  the non-scientologist professionals.

01:58:27,362 --> 01:58:29,950
SPEAKER_1:  who work behind the scenes on Scientology.

01:58:30,338 --> 01:58:30,718
SPEAKER_1:  behalf.

01:58:31,810 --> 01:58:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  Can you describe the dynamics of how that actually happens?

01:58:35,010 --> 01:58:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  Like why would the police department work on behalf of Scientology?

01:58:39,234 --> 01:58:45,630
SPEAKER_1:  I meant more the courts and regulators, not the police department. But well, for example, it can come down to something as simple as this.

01:58:45,858 --> 01:58:47,614
SPEAKER_1:  In Clearwater, Scientology.

01:58:48,098 --> 01:58:50,334
SPEAKER_1:  hires Clearwater Police to do off-duty work for them.

01:58:50,850 --> 01:58:53,118
SPEAKER_1:  They pay like three times the normal off-duty rate.

01:58:53,698 --> 01:58:54,110
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:58:54,370 --> 01:58:59,230
SPEAKER_1:  They will, even though I'm not aware of anyone on the Clearwater PD who's actually a Scientologist.

01:58:59,554 --> 01:59:03,870
SPEAKER_1:  They basically end up with, they would call them allies or safe points. Got it. Right. People.

01:59:04,290 --> 01:59:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  Who?

01:59:04,930 --> 01:59:07,902
SPEAKER_1:  like will literally operate a Scientology spies.

01:59:08,386 --> 01:59:08,734
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

01:59:08,962 --> 01:59:17,726
SPEAKER_1:  someone comes in and follows a report about some child sex case, someone in the Clearwater PD is calling Sarah Heller at the Office of Special Affairs at the Flying Gladden Base to let her know.

01:59:18,018 --> 01:59:18,622
SPEAKER_1:  Hey, heads up.

01:59:18,914 --> 01:59:26,078
SPEAKER_1:  We got a thing coming in and then Scientology can run around and go talk to all the Scientologists who have knowledge about this and either get them out of Clearwater.

01:59:26,626 --> 01:59:31,198
SPEAKER_0:  But you know, so it's not like a direct explicit corruption, but more.

01:59:31,714 --> 01:59:37,566
SPEAKER_0:  just friends and coworkers integrated deeply in the community. Yeah.

01:59:37,666 --> 01:59:38,814
SPEAKER_1:  I call it soft corruption.

01:59:39,394 --> 01:59:41,982
SPEAKER_1:  So another example, you have...

01:59:42,338 --> 01:59:44,446
SPEAKER_1:  the mayor of Clearwater, Frank Hibbard.

01:59:45,026 --> 01:59:45,438
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:59:45,762 --> 01:59:46,878
SPEAKER_1:  Well, he used to...

01:59:46,978 --> 01:59:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  Hello.

01:59:47,490 --> 01:59:48,254
SPEAKER_1:  when you

01:59:48,802 --> 01:59:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  won his recent election, he stepped down from some of these nonprofits that he served on.

01:59:52,482 --> 01:59:54,302
SPEAKER_1:  but the nonprofits that he served on also gets.

01:59:54,530 --> 01:59:58,142
SPEAKER_1:  millions of dollars of donations from some of Scientology's richest Clearwater.

01:59:58,594 --> 02:00:01,534
SPEAKER_1:  members right you have one of the mayors.

02:00:01,826 --> 02:00:02,814
SPEAKER_1:  best friends.

02:00:03,202 --> 02:00:03,806
SPEAKER_1:  Chobordet.

02:00:04,226 --> 02:00:06,142
SPEAKER_1:  Literally a paid lobbyist for Scientology.

02:00:06,850 --> 02:00:09,886
SPEAKER_1:  So that creates a chilling effect.

02:00:10,754 --> 02:00:15,646
SPEAKER_1:  on to anyone who's gonna be talking smack about Scientology because

02:00:17,122 --> 02:00:18,782
SPEAKER_1:  his friends are on their damn payroll.

02:00:19,650 --> 02:00:22,686
SPEAKER_1:  So I call it soft corruption. It's not illegal.

02:00:23,490 --> 02:00:24,126
SPEAKER_1:  It's not illegal.

02:00:24,802 --> 02:00:25,342
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:00:25,826 --> 02:00:27,742
SPEAKER_1:  but it's how Scientology wields influence.

02:00:27,970 --> 02:00:32,606
SPEAKER_1:  And what's ironic is that a lot of these people who work on Scientology's behalf actually secretly hate Scientology.

02:00:33,474 --> 02:00:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  They kind of see.

02:00:34,690 --> 02:00:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  through it but...

02:00:36,098 --> 02:00:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  It's part of the community. I mean, it's deeply integrated in the community in this financial leverage.

02:00:40,898 --> 02:00:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:00:41,474 --> 02:00:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  Are you ever?

02:00:42,818 --> 02:00:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  Afraid?

02:00:45,058 --> 02:00:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, afraid for your well-being, afraid for your...

02:00:47,874 --> 02:00:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  ability to function in society because of the pressures from Scientology? NO.

02:00:52,354 --> 02:00:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  Is that because you're genetically malfunctioning or?

02:00:55,138 --> 02:01:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  or mentally or is there speaking out as a kind of protection?

02:01:00,386 --> 02:01:05,342
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's one of those things that once you've seen behind the curtain, you see the Wizard of Oz is just a silly man.

02:01:05,762 --> 02:01:06,782
SPEAKER_1:  You just don't.

02:01:07,042 --> 02:01:09,822
SPEAKER_1:  have any fear. Now it's one of these things like people say, oh, you're so brave.

02:01:10,050 --> 02:01:10,686
SPEAKER_1:  And I go, eh.

02:01:11,010 --> 02:01:12,286
SPEAKER_1:  What's that quote? 80th century is b-

02:01:12,738 --> 02:01:15,774
SPEAKER_1:  you know, being a soldier and being afraid and going in any way.

02:01:16,354 --> 02:01:18,782
SPEAKER_1:  It's not brave to run in if you don't think nothing's gonna happen to you.

02:01:19,138 --> 02:01:23,966
SPEAKER_1:  Like I'm just trying to like I do not hold myself up as an example of bravery because

02:01:24,514 --> 02:01:29,022
SPEAKER_1:  It's not like, oh, they could destroy me, but I don't care. No, there's not a damn thing they can do to me.

02:01:29,314 --> 02:01:33,342
SPEAKER_1:  And it's one of, that's one of the reasons I continue to put out content every day.

02:01:33,730 --> 02:01:34,526
SPEAKER_1:  So just basically go.

02:01:35,138 --> 02:01:35,646
SPEAKER_1:  Hey!

02:01:36,002 --> 02:01:41,150
SPEAKER_1:  Still here. I dare you to try to do something about it, but you can't and hope.

02:01:41,378 --> 02:01:43,998
SPEAKER_1:  that that also serves as kind of an example for other people to go.

02:01:44,482 --> 02:01:45,694
SPEAKER_1:  If this shmo can do it.

02:01:46,082 --> 02:01:48,798
SPEAKER_1:  and they can't do anything else to him, then maybe I can do it too.

02:01:49,442 --> 02:01:52,094
SPEAKER_1:  because I would love it. I would love there for me to be a 20.

02:01:52,386 --> 02:01:55,166
SPEAKER_1:  channels where former Scientologists talk about their experience.

02:01:55,714 --> 02:02:01,278
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, that is bravery because what happens is fear seeps in even if it's not grounded in reality.

02:02:01,634 --> 02:02:03,870
SPEAKER_0:  But at the same time, like, you know...

02:02:04,578 --> 02:02:05,918
SPEAKER_0:  My grandfather who...

02:02:06,530 --> 02:02:07,006
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

02:02:07,394 --> 02:02:09,022
SPEAKER_0:  in World War II.

02:02:09,698 --> 02:02:11,166
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, the story.

02:02:11,490 --> 02:02:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  is very convinced and sure most of the people he fought alongside with died.

02:02:16,642 --> 02:02:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  Use the machine gutter.

02:02:18,114 --> 02:02:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  But he believes that bullets can't hit him.

02:02:20,610 --> 02:02:21,214
SPEAKER_0:  Right.

02:02:21,474 --> 02:02:21,790
SPEAKER_0:  Mm-hmm.

02:02:22,050 --> 02:02:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  What?

02:02:22,882 --> 02:02:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

02:02:23,554 --> 02:02:23,966
SPEAKER_0:  Sir.

02:02:24,514 --> 02:02:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  He was right.

02:02:25,986 --> 02:02:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  We'll see you next time.

02:02:26,690 --> 02:02:27,998
SPEAKER_0:  Right? Because you survived.

02:02:28,258 --> 02:02:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:02:29,058 --> 02:02:33,301
SPEAKER_1:  There's some sense like you're ever biased that he's like, just like you are. I was like.

02:02:33,301 --> 02:02:35,582
SPEAKER_0:  See, I'm not brave, I just, the bullets can't hit me.

02:02:35,874 --> 02:02:36,574
SPEAKER_0:

02:02:37,666 --> 02:02:42,206
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, there's a dark kind of truth to that. There's some, you know, it's like a.

02:02:42,754 --> 02:02:46,814
SPEAKER_0:  It's a feedback loop where if you have the confidence and you push on forward,

02:02:47,106 --> 02:02:51,614
SPEAKER_0:  and you're brave in that way to not let your and three

02:02:52,098 --> 02:02:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  gives you less things to be scared about. Yeah, I mean, but that initial few steps might be.

02:02:57,538 --> 02:02:58,814
SPEAKER_0:  uh... for people

02:02:59,330 --> 02:03:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  It might be a very difficult step to take to talk about.

02:03:02,434 --> 02:03:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  The fear.

02:03:03,650 --> 02:03:04,574
SPEAKER_1:  was.

02:03:05,250 --> 02:03:07,262
SPEAKER_1:  knowing how the family was going to be destroyed.

02:03:07,522 --> 02:03:08,542
SPEAKER_1:  and trying to prevent that.

02:03:09,026 --> 02:03:09,566
SPEAKER_1:  I was.

02:03:09,890 --> 02:03:11,166
SPEAKER_1:  terrified of that happening.

02:03:12,482 --> 02:03:13,182
SPEAKER_1:  But it happened.

02:03:14,370 --> 02:03:15,710
SPEAKER_1:  There's nothing left to be afraid of.

02:03:16,418 --> 02:03:18,494
SPEAKER_1:  And that's kind of the thing, like they created this beast.

02:03:18,818 --> 02:03:21,438
SPEAKER_1:  And the same is true for Mark Headley. The same is true for Mike Reinder.

02:03:21,762 --> 02:03:27,198
SPEAKER_1:  I said they've essentially created a Scientology proof virus, a Scientology resistant strain.

02:03:27,426 --> 02:03:29,982
SPEAKER_1:  by throwing everything they have.

02:03:30,210 --> 02:03:31,998
SPEAKER_1:  at us for so many years.

02:03:32,738 --> 02:03:33,982
SPEAKER_1:  They have just

02:03:34,338 --> 02:03:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  through natural selection.

02:03:36,546 --> 02:03:37,726
SPEAKER_1:  created people who just.

02:03:38,178 --> 02:03:48,574
SPEAKER_1:  do not give a damn about anything they could or would do. And maybe there is something a little wrong with me, because when I get a phone call from someone like, I just got this phone call about you, and it's clear that it's Scientology PIs doing work behind the scenes.

02:03:48,866 --> 02:03:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  I get really excited.

02:03:50,818 --> 02:03:59,966
SPEAKER_1:  I get really excited. I don't get nervous. I'm like, oh no, what's happening? I'm like, oh yeah, this is gonna be exciting. I'm like, okay, because everything they try to do to me.

02:04:00,866 --> 02:04:01,854
SPEAKER_1:  I'm gonna figure out.

02:04:02,434 --> 02:04:04,894
SPEAKER_1:  how to reflect it back on them and make them look ridiculous.

02:04:04,994 --> 02:04:08,222
SPEAKER_0:  And that pales in comparison to the separating from family. Exactly.

02:04:08,738 --> 02:04:11,518
SPEAKER_0:  Is there parts of your family that...

02:04:12,034 --> 02:04:13,662
SPEAKER_0:  You've lost because of Scientology.

02:04:20,194 --> 02:04:20,702
SPEAKER_0:  If you...

02:04:24,674 --> 02:04:25,502
SPEAKER_1:  Most.

02:04:26,978 --> 02:04:29,502
SPEAKER_1:  of my episode.

02:04:30,050 --> 02:04:31,902
SPEAKER_1:  on the Leah Remini in the Aftermath show.

02:04:33,186 --> 02:04:34,718
SPEAKER_1:  was talking about me and my twin brother.

02:04:38,178 --> 02:04:39,582
SPEAKER_1:  It's just a pretty horrible story.

02:04:40,002 --> 02:04:44,478
SPEAKER_1:  This is a pretty horrible story. So I do have a younger brother who's still in Scientology and disconnected from me.

02:04:44,706 --> 02:04:47,742
SPEAKER_1:  but I never had much of a relationship with that brother.

02:04:48,226 --> 02:04:48,638
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:04:50,050 --> 02:04:51,102
SPEAKER_1:  Really, to begin with.

02:04:51,522 --> 02:04:51,966
SPEAKER_1:  Right.

02:04:52,418 --> 02:04:53,502
SPEAKER_1:  Um, ahem.

02:04:54,018 --> 02:04:55,294
SPEAKER_1:  But my twin brother died.

02:04:55,554 --> 02:04:57,182
SPEAKER_1:  when I was like 23 or 24.

02:04:58,978 --> 02:05:02,078
SPEAKER_1:  And that was without any question a direct result.

02:05:02,562 --> 02:05:03,550
SPEAKER_1:  of um.

02:05:04,866 --> 02:05:06,462
SPEAKER_1:  our Scientology experience.

02:05:06,978 --> 02:05:07,294
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

02:05:07,554 --> 02:05:11,646
SPEAKER_1:  He died in a car accident that wasn't technically his fault or anything. He wasn't even the one driving.

02:05:11,938 --> 02:05:12,254
SPEAKER_1:  Bye!

02:05:13,730 --> 02:05:22,142
SPEAKER_1:  The specific fact of his death was not meaning, the fact and the manner of his death was not specifically because of Scientology.

02:05:22,882 --> 02:05:24,382
SPEAKER_1:  but our story.

02:05:24,770 --> 02:05:25,502
SPEAKER_1:  and how.

02:05:25,954 --> 02:05:27,646
SPEAKER_1:  where our relationship got to.

02:05:28,546 --> 02:05:30,494
SPEAKER_1:  and how he was even in a position.

02:05:31,426 --> 02:05:34,110
SPEAKER_1:  of having something like that happen to him is directly attributable

02:05:34,754 --> 02:05:35,422
SPEAKER_1:  to Scientology.

02:05:37,250 --> 02:05:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  Do you think about them?

02:05:38,530 --> 02:05:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  Miss him?

02:05:41,538 --> 02:05:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  is part of what you're doing in memory of him.

02:05:44,962 --> 02:05:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  for short.

02:05:47,650 --> 02:05:48,775
SPEAKER_0:  And this is such a...

02:05:48,775 --> 02:05:51,006
SPEAKER_1:  You know, we were identical twins. Can you imagine two of me?

02:05:51,746 --> 02:05:52,414
SPEAKER_1:  Hahahah!

02:05:53,282 --> 02:05:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  Barely handled one.

02:05:55,746 --> 02:05:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  I love it.

02:05:57,410 --> 02:05:57,982
SPEAKER_0:  Ugh.

02:05:58,242 --> 02:06:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  losing him, would that be the darkest moment in this whole journey of Scientology for you?

02:06:03,618 --> 02:06:04,702
SPEAKER_1:  Two moments would.

02:06:05,314 --> 02:06:06,430
SPEAKER_1:  equal the darkest moment.

02:06:07,298 --> 02:06:08,030
SPEAKER_1:  It would be that.

02:06:09,506 --> 02:06:10,462
SPEAKER_1:  and also just

02:06:10,882 --> 02:06:11,230
SPEAKER_1:  The

02:06:11,458 --> 02:06:12,862
SPEAKER_1:  period of, you know.

02:06:13,954 --> 02:06:16,414
SPEAKER_1:  6, 9, 12 months of impending doom.

02:06:19,458 --> 02:06:23,070
SPEAKER_1:  knowing that my wife's whole family was going to be obliterated.

02:06:24,770 --> 02:06:26,334
SPEAKER_1:  and that there's nothing we could do about it.

02:06:28,898 --> 02:06:29,534
SPEAKER_1:  and uh

02:06:31,330 --> 02:06:34,398
SPEAKER_1:  and kind of telling ourselves every step of the way it wasn't really going to happen.

02:06:35,426 --> 02:06:35,870
SPEAKER_1:  You know?

02:06:37,154 --> 02:06:39,166
SPEAKER_1:  And I really felt like.

02:06:40,482 --> 02:06:41,502
SPEAKER_1:  You ever watch the Ozarks?

02:06:42,594 --> 02:06:43,614
SPEAKER_1:  I felt like Marty Byrd.

02:06:44,226 --> 02:06:47,070
SPEAKER_1:  Now this was happening before the Ozarks, but when I watched the Ozarks...

02:06:48,002 --> 02:06:49,150
SPEAKER_1:  and I see that character.

02:06:50,562 --> 02:06:53,534
SPEAKER_1:  the entire world is crumbling down around him and all he can-

02:06:54,210 --> 02:06:55,038
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, I did, like...

02:06:55,778 --> 02:06:57,118
SPEAKER_1:  All right, what's the next step?

02:06:57,794 --> 02:07:01,406
SPEAKER_1:  I watch Marty Bird and I go, that's my fucking spirit animal.

02:07:03,074 --> 02:07:05,054
SPEAKER_1:  because you can only control what you can control.

02:07:06,178 --> 02:07:07,102
SPEAKER_1:  And, um...

02:07:07,682 --> 02:07:10,014
SPEAKER_1:  You can't keep Scientology from destroying your family.

02:07:10,466 --> 02:07:16,830
SPEAKER_1:  And literally, like, it's funny, I mention this show a lot because I watch that and I go like, that's exactly how I felt.

02:07:17,538 --> 02:07:17,918
SPEAKER_1:  You know?

02:07:18,722 --> 02:07:24,318
SPEAKER_1:  I talk about this six months or nine, 12 months, whatever it was of impending doom. It's not like I was an emotional wreck during that time.

02:07:24,866 --> 02:07:27,006
SPEAKER_1:  you know, in private I was, but it's not like...

02:07:28,066 --> 02:07:29,886
SPEAKER_1:  I was just freaking out. It was like.

02:07:30,562 --> 02:07:31,806
SPEAKER_1:  The sun's gonna come up tomorrow.

02:07:32,258 --> 02:07:33,374
SPEAKER_1:  The world's gonna keep spinning?

02:07:33,826 --> 02:07:37,118
SPEAKER_1:  I can't control it. This is horrible. I can't believe this is happening.

02:07:39,266 --> 02:07:40,286
SPEAKER_1:  but tomorrow's a new day.

02:07:41,762 --> 02:07:42,174
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:07:42,978 --> 02:07:47,870
SPEAKER_1:  I've never personally, even at the darkest times, I've never experienced anything.

02:07:48,130 --> 02:07:52,030
SPEAKER_1:  that I would characterize as depression. Certainly not ever any suicidal thoughts or anything.

02:07:52,674 --> 02:07:54,494
SPEAKER_1:  and even in the darkest of times.

02:07:55,138 --> 02:07:58,142
SPEAKER_1:  And again, this one thing I go, is it because of Scientology or is it just me?

02:07:58,370 --> 02:08:00,094
SPEAKER_1:  There really is an emotional detachment.

02:08:01,794 --> 02:08:02,110
SPEAKER_1:  There-

02:08:02,242 --> 02:08:03,678
SPEAKER_0:  almost has to be.

02:08:04,098 --> 02:08:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  And it's a cold calculation. What are my options?

02:08:07,938 --> 02:08:08,798
SPEAKER_0:  What do I do here?

02:08:09,250 --> 02:08:11,454
SPEAKER_1:  And then once I figure out the answer to that question.

02:08:12,002 --> 02:08:13,566
SPEAKER_1:  I'm actually quite chipper and happy.

02:08:14,306 --> 02:08:15,806
SPEAKER_1:  You know, like that's sort of my default.

02:08:16,226 --> 02:08:21,278
SPEAKER_1:  Like you could give me six horrible options. Once I figure out the best of those six, I'm going to feel like

02:08:21,506 --> 02:08:22,910
SPEAKER_1:  I just had a pretty good day.

02:08:23,298 --> 02:08:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  Brilliant.

02:08:24,098 --> 02:08:27,198
SPEAKER_0:  Because just watching Ozarks is so stressful.

02:08:27,490 --> 02:08:29,502
SPEAKER_0:  It is, right? So stressful watching it.

02:08:30,178 --> 02:08:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  Is it?

02:08:32,002 --> 02:08:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  and he usually finds a way.

02:08:35,042 --> 02:08:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  And usually it is a set of really bad options is one of the bad options.

02:08:39,426 --> 02:08:40,551
SPEAKER_0:  What's the best of the bad o-

02:08:40,551 --> 02:08:40,990
SPEAKER_1:  options.

02:08:41,250 --> 02:08:44,894
SPEAKER_1:  and he almost gets pissed off at everyone around him for being so pouty about it.

02:08:45,506 --> 02:08:46,174
SPEAKER_1:  BYE

02:08:48,226 --> 02:08:51,038
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, but you know, it's the show again the same way again.

02:08:51,426 --> 02:08:58,430
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, that's beautiful. But you know, it's like, you know, it's still simmering there right under the surface, like pretty damn close to the surface. Do you know what I mean?

02:08:59,106 --> 02:09:00,222
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. And, um.

02:09:01,250 --> 02:09:08,030
SPEAKER_1:  people sometimes ask about recovery and whatnot and like, what does that look like and what does that mean? And sort of goes back to kind of the emotional detachment as I go.

02:09:08,994 --> 02:09:10,494
SPEAKER_1:  the fuck does recovery even mean?

02:09:10,914 --> 02:09:15,230
SPEAKER_1:  If you're an alcoholic and you're recovering, you know what that means. I used to drink, I don't drink now.

02:09:15,522 --> 02:09:17,694
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I used to be an occult and I'm not an occult now.

02:09:17,986 --> 02:09:23,326
SPEAKER_1:  How else am I supposed to feel about this for someone to be like, it seems like you've recovered. What the fuck does that even mean?

02:09:24,034 --> 02:09:26,878
SPEAKER_1:  Like, I'm sure some academic has an answer to that question.

02:09:27,266 --> 02:09:29,694
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not someone who particularly, I don't spend any time thinking about that.

02:09:30,178 --> 02:09:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  My recovery is success.

02:09:32,354 --> 02:09:33,790
SPEAKER_1:  and a little bit of trolling and revenge.

02:09:34,338 --> 02:09:35,422
SPEAKER_1:  but mostly success.

02:09:35,874 --> 02:09:36,350
SPEAKER_1:  You know?

02:09:36,962 --> 02:09:40,670
SPEAKER_1:  What does it mean to be a recovered former cult member? What, you don't cry when people ask you about your brother?

02:09:41,282 --> 02:09:42,494
SPEAKER_1:  know what it means.

02:09:42,914 --> 02:09:47,806
SPEAKER_1:  I've never had therapy, but not because I'm still like against it from Scientology.

02:09:48,258 --> 02:09:48,862
SPEAKER_1:  I just like.

02:09:49,986 --> 02:09:51,550
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not gonna pay to talk to someone.

02:09:52,194 --> 02:09:53,886
SPEAKER_1:  Do you know where else I could do that? That is where I'm gonna sign up for Scientology.

02:09:54,210 --> 02:09:56,350
SPEAKER_1:  Now I know there's a lot of people going like, oh boy.

02:09:56,642 --> 02:09:57,214
SPEAKER_1:  I know there's a lot.

02:09:57,634 --> 02:09:58,686
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not shitting on therapy.

02:09:59,938 --> 02:10:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  I would rather have a beer with my friend and talk about this shit than talk to a professional for $200 an hour.

02:10:05,762 --> 02:10:07,326
SPEAKER_0:  That's the kind of therapy, yeah.衛健ENTE forecasting, yes.

02:10:07,650 --> 02:10:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, listen, that's the important part of the reason I do this podcast. It's talking to people they care about.

02:10:14,594 --> 02:10:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  that you're close with, it's a really powerful, powerful thing.

02:10:17,794 --> 02:10:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know what recovery looks like. Success to you is defined.

02:10:21,890 --> 02:10:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  Just be, find happiness, find happiness outside the.

02:10:25,730 --> 02:10:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  closed bubble.

02:10:27,202 --> 02:10:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  that defines what happiness looks like, or Scientology.

02:10:30,498 --> 02:10:32,382
SPEAKER_1:  If I can make my kids happy, that's success to me.

02:10:33,602 --> 02:10:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  What advice would you give to your kids on how to live?

02:10:36,546 --> 02:10:40,053
SPEAKER_0:  travel the world. A life they can be proud of. Travel the world.

02:10:40,053 --> 02:10:40,670
SPEAKER_1:  the world.

02:10:41,378 --> 02:10:44,990
SPEAKER_1:  Um, get rid of friends who don't push you up and.

02:10:45,410 --> 02:10:50,302
SPEAKER_1:  Don't celebrate your success. It's hard to give that advice to young children because kids are always so catty.

02:10:51,746 --> 02:10:52,798
SPEAKER_1:  But honestly, it's like.

02:10:53,378 --> 02:10:54,494
SPEAKER_1:  when I see.

02:10:55,234 --> 02:10:58,686
SPEAKER_1:  uh... that that really is i i just think not just a nice to my kids but some of the best advice

02:10:59,458 --> 02:11:00,574
SPEAKER_1:  If you got anyone.

02:11:01,890 --> 02:11:03,966
SPEAKER_1:  around you who doesn't celebrate your success.

02:11:05,090 --> 02:11:05,790
SPEAKER_1:  Spend less time.

02:11:06,466 --> 02:11:08,254
SPEAKER_1:  With those people.

02:11:08,546 --> 02:11:10,142
SPEAKER_1:  Surround yourself with people who actually.

02:11:10,626 --> 02:11:21,950
SPEAKER_1:  want to celebrate your success and push you to succeed. I think that's true. I think it's even more important at a young age because if at a young age you get used to being around people who kind of take joy in tearing you down, then that's what you become accustomed to.

02:11:22,690 --> 02:11:23,134
SPEAKER_1:  You know?

02:11:23,650 --> 02:11:24,766
SPEAKER_1:  And I just think, you know.

02:11:25,922 --> 02:11:27,614
SPEAKER_1:  Having friends will love you in support use.

02:11:27,842 --> 02:11:28,798
SPEAKER_1:  just about.

02:11:29,826 --> 02:11:30,686
SPEAKER_1:  closest thing to.

02:11:31,618 --> 02:11:32,542
SPEAKER_1:  the true meaning of life.

02:11:33,506 --> 02:11:38,590
SPEAKER_0:  and who believe in you, who believe in your potential. And some of those ideas underlie...

02:11:39,074 --> 02:11:41,246
SPEAKER_0:  the good parts of Scientology.

02:11:41,730 --> 02:11:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  and accept.

02:11:43,810 --> 02:11:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  There's a lot of dark parts of Scientology that separate you from the people that believe in you and that love you.

02:11:52,098 --> 02:11:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  Well, this is a beautiful conversation. You're a beautiful human being.

02:11:55,266 --> 02:11:56,478
SPEAKER_0:  who I came full of.

02:11:56,962 --> 02:11:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  gifts.

02:11:58,946 --> 02:12:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  And I mean, I genuinely, first of all, you're an aspiring human being.

02:12:03,906 --> 02:12:07,358
SPEAKER_0:  uh... but most important i can't wait until i can purchase a bobblehead

02:12:07,682 --> 02:12:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  On the store.

02:12:09,698 --> 02:12:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  So I can keep that inspiration on my desktop.

02:12:13,410 --> 02:12:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  Aaron, thank you so much for talking to me. Thank you for being you, for being brave. I know you said you're not, but.

02:12:19,554 --> 02:12:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  Thank you for being brave, for talking about this. You're an inspiration and you help a lot of people. Thank you, brother. Alright.

02:12:26,754 --> 02:12:29,150

02:12:33,890 --> 02:12:36,446
SPEAKER_0:  Let me leave you with some words from Ralph Waldo Emerson.

02:12:37,570 --> 02:12:39,710
SPEAKER_0:  Be not the slave of your own past.

02:12:40,674 --> 02:12:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  plunge into the sublime seas.

02:12:42,818 --> 02:12:44,478
SPEAKER_0:  Dive deep and swim far.

02:12:45,186 --> 02:12:47,390
SPEAKER_0:  so you will come back with new self-respect.

02:12:47,938 --> 02:12:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  with new power.

02:12:49,282 --> 02:12:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  and with an advanced experience.

02:12:51,234 --> 02:12:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  that will explain.

02:12:52,354 --> 02:12:53,150
SPEAKER_0:  and overlook.

02:12:53,666 --> 02:12:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  old.

02:12:55,298 --> 02:12:56,126
