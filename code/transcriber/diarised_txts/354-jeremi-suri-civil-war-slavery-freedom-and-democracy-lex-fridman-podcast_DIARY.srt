00:00:00,098 --> 00:00:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  war continues after the battles and this is something that's hard for Americans understand our system is built with the presumption when war is over when we sign a piece of paper everyone can go home

00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  It's not what happens.

00:00:12,866 --> 00:00:15,070
SPEAKER_1:  The following is a conversation with Jeremy Surrey.

00:00:15,426 --> 00:00:17,374
SPEAKER_1:  The Historian at UT Austin.

00:00:17,986 --> 00:00:19,646
SPEAKER_1:  This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

00:00:19,874 --> 00:00:22,590
SPEAKER_1:  To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:00:23,042 --> 00:00:23,550
SPEAKER_1:  And now...

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:24,670
SPEAKER_1:  Dear friends

00:00:25,186 --> 00:00:25,982
SPEAKER_1:  Here's Jeremy.

00:00:26,274 --> 00:00:26,718
SPEAKER_1:  Sorry.

00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:36,286
SPEAKER_1:  What is the main idea, the main case that you make in your new book, Civil War by Other Means, America's Long and Unfinished Fight for Democracy?

00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  So our democratic institutions in the United States, they are filled with many virtues and many elements in their design.

00:00:44,226 --> 00:00:46,750
SPEAKER_0:  that improve our society and allow for innovation.

00:00:47,074 --> 00:00:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  but they also have many flaws in them, as any institutions created by human beings have.

00:00:51,522 --> 00:00:57,118
SPEAKER_0:  and the flaws in our institutions go back to a number of judgments and perspectives.

00:00:57,826 --> 00:01:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  that people in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries had.

00:01:01,314 --> 00:01:03,966
SPEAKER_0:  and those flaws have been built into our institutions.

00:01:04,258 --> 00:01:06,078
SPEAKER_0:  and they continue to hinder.

00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  innovation and growth in our society.

00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  Three of the flaws that I emphasize in this book are flaws of exclusion.

00:01:14,178 --> 00:01:17,118
SPEAKER_0:  The ways our institutions exclude people, not just African Americans.

00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  many different groups.

00:01:19,522 --> 00:01:24,478
SPEAKER_0:  the ways our institutions also give power to certain people who have position

00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  rather than skill or intelligence or quality.

00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  And third, and most of all, the ways our institutions embed certain myths in our society.

00:01:33,378 --> 00:01:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  myths that prevent us from gaining the knowledge we need to improve our world.

00:01:37,986 --> 00:01:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  In all of these ways, our democracy is hindered.

00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,070
SPEAKER_0:  by the false reverence.

00:01:43,682 --> 00:01:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  for institutions that actually need to be reformed.

00:01:46,754 --> 00:01:50,129
SPEAKER_0:  just as we need to highlight the good elements of them. that's really what my book is about

00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:53,118
SPEAKER_1:  And then the myth, the false reverence.

00:01:53,698 --> 00:01:54,750
SPEAKER_1:  What are we talking about there?

00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  So there's a way in which we believe that if we love our country...

00:01:59,298 --> 00:02:03,550
SPEAKER_0:  It's somehow wrong to criticize our institutions. I believe if you love your country.

00:02:03,938 --> 00:02:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  You want to encourage your institutions to get better and better. I love my university where I work, but I want it to be better. We have many flaws. I love my family, but I'm constantly telling family members how they can be better.

00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,022
SPEAKER_0:  uh... that's what true knowledge leadership is about

00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  not just cheerleading.

00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,382
SPEAKER_1:  What's the counterpoint to that? Cuz'

00:02:20,802 --> 00:02:23,582
SPEAKER_1:  The other extreme is a deep

00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,390
SPEAKER_1:  all-encompassing cynicism towards institutions.

00:02:28,226 --> 00:02:28,990
SPEAKER_1:  So for me...

00:02:29,538 --> 00:02:31,582
SPEAKER_1:  I like the idea of loving America.

00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:35,358
SPEAKER_1:  which seems to be sometimes a politicized statement these days.

00:02:36,258 --> 00:02:38,206
SPEAKER_1:  that you believe in the ideals of this country.

00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,094
SPEAKER_1:  That seems to be...

00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  that seems to be either a naive or a political statement the way it's interpreted. So the flip side of that.

00:02:45,506 --> 00:02:51,038
SPEAKER_1:  Having a healthy skepticism of institutions is good, but having a complete paralyzing cynicism seems to be...

00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:54,462
SPEAKER_0:  Absolutely, both are ahistorical positions.

00:02:54,722 --> 00:02:58,238
SPEAKER_0:  What I try to do as a historian is work in between those spaces. I try to do as a historian is work in between those spaces.

00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:01,086
SPEAKER_0:  is in the middle ground for better or for worse.

00:03:01,346 --> 00:03:07,678
SPEAKER_0:  And what we have to recognize is that our institutions are necessary. There's a reason government exists.

00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  There's a reason our union was created. That's what Abraham Lincoln was heroically fighting for.

00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  So we have to believe in our union, we have to believe in our government, and we as business people as intellectuals, we have to be part of the solution, not the problem.

00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  but that doesn't mean just ignoring.

00:03:26,146 --> 00:03:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  deep flaws in our institutions even if we find personally ways to get around them.

00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:31,646
SPEAKER_0:  What really worries me...

00:03:31,906 --> 00:03:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  is that there are a lot of very intelligent, well-intentioned people in our society who have figured out

00:03:37,602 --> 00:03:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  how to live with the flaws in our institutions.

00:03:40,098 --> 00:03:43,614
SPEAKER_0:  rather than how to use their skills to correct the flaws in our institutions.

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,126
SPEAKER_1:  There's folks like somebody that lives next door to me, like a malice as an anarchist.

00:03:48,898 --> 00:03:53,886
SPEAKER_1:  philosophically, maybe more than practically, just sort of argues for that position.

00:03:54,338 --> 00:03:57,086
SPEAKER_1:  It's an interesting thought experiment, I would say.

00:03:57,346 --> 00:03:57,886
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:03:58,658 --> 00:04:02,110
SPEAKER_1:  So if you have these flaws as institutions, one thing to do.

00:04:02,946 --> 00:04:06,334
SPEAKER_1:  as the communists did at the beginning of the 20th century, to burn the thing down.

00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:07,870
SPEAKER_1:  and starting you.

00:04:08,258 --> 00:04:09,726
SPEAKER_1:  and the other is to...

00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,486
SPEAKER_1:  fixed from within.

00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:16,126
SPEAKER_1:  One step, one slow step at a time. What's the case for both?

00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:17,607
SPEAKER_1:  from a history perspective.

00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:24,030
SPEAKER_0:  Sure, so historically there has always been an urge to burn down the institutions and start again, start with a blank slate.

00:04:24,354 --> 00:04:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  The historical record is that almost never works.

00:04:26,882 --> 00:04:29,854
SPEAKER_0:  Because what happens when you destroy the institutions you gave the example?

00:04:30,274 --> 00:04:31,902
SPEAKER_0:  of the Bolshevik Revolution.

00:04:32,226 --> 00:04:33,854
SPEAKER_0:  when you destroy the institutions.

00:04:34,178 --> 00:04:37,150
SPEAKER_0:  All you do is in the jungle that's left behind.

00:04:37,474 --> 00:04:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  you give advantages to those who are the most powerful.

00:04:40,162 --> 00:04:42,526
SPEAKER_0:  Institutions always place certain limits.

00:04:42,914 --> 00:04:49,918
SPEAKER_0:  upon the most powerful in the jungle. If you go back to the jungle, the most powerful are actually going to have the most influence and most control.

00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  So, the revolutionaries who are usually the vulnerable.

00:04:53,282 --> 00:04:56,286
SPEAKER_0:  turn out to then be the victims of the revolution. This is exactly.

00:04:56,514 --> 00:04:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  what we saw with the French Revolution, with the Russian Revolution.

00:04:59,074 --> 00:05:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  So the record for that is not a great record. There still might be times to do that.

00:05:02,818 --> 00:05:07,742
SPEAKER_0:  But I think we should be very cautious about that. The record for working through institutions is a much better record.

00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  Now, what we have to be careful about is as we're working through institutions, not to become bought into them.

00:05:13,218 --> 00:05:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  not to become of those institutions.

00:05:15,522 --> 00:05:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  So what I've written about in this book and in other books, my book on Henry Kissinger, for example.

00:05:19,906 --> 00:05:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  is how it's important when in an institution to still bring an outsider perspective.

00:05:24,578 --> 00:05:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  I believe in being an inside outsider.

00:05:27,682 --> 00:05:31,646
SPEAKER_0:  And I think most of your listeners are inside outsiders. They're people who care about what's going on inside.

00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  but they're bringing some new ideas from the outside.

00:05:34,178 --> 00:05:38,622
SPEAKER_1:  I think the correct statement to say is most of the listeners, most people aspire to be inside.

00:05:39,074 --> 00:05:39,838
SPEAKER_1:  outsiders.

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,438
SPEAKER_1:  But...

00:05:41,698 --> 00:05:45,374
SPEAKER_1:  We, human nature, such that we easily become insider insiders.

00:05:45,986 --> 00:05:49,438
SPEAKER_1:  So like, we like that idea, but the reality is...

00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,006
SPEAKER_1:  and I've been.

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,846
SPEAKER_1:  very fortunate because of this podcast to talk to certain folks.

00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,574
SPEAKER_1:  that live in certain bubbles.

00:05:57,634 --> 00:05:58,238
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:00,894
SPEAKER_1:  It's very hard to know.

00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:02,558
SPEAKER_1:  when you're in a bubble.

00:06:03,586 --> 00:06:04,958
SPEAKER_1:  that you should get out of the bubble.

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:05,662
SPEAKER_1:  thought.

00:06:06,402 --> 00:06:10,398
SPEAKER_1:  And that's a really tricky thing because like, yeah, when you're, when there's politics.

00:06:10,626 --> 00:06:11,710
SPEAKER_1:  whether it's science.

00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  whether it's...

00:06:14,178 --> 00:06:15,902
SPEAKER_1:  and any pursuits in life.

00:06:17,154 --> 00:06:19,038
SPEAKER_1:  because everybody around you, all your friends...

00:06:19,426 --> 00:06:21,822
SPEAKER_1:  You have like a little rat race and you're competing with each other.

00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:26,398
SPEAKER_1:  and then you get promotion, you get excited, and you can see how you can get more and more power.

00:06:26,722 --> 00:06:29,150
SPEAKER_1:  It's not like a dark, cynical.

00:06:29,602 --> 00:06:31,134
SPEAKER_1:  rat race. It's fun.

00:06:31,618 --> 00:06:33,086
SPEAKER_1:  That's the process of life.

00:06:33,378 --> 00:06:34,718
SPEAKER_1:  and then you forget.

00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:35,710
SPEAKER_1:  that.

00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:37,310
SPEAKER_1:  There you just.

00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:43,582
SPEAKER_1:  collectively have created a set of rules for the game that you're playing. You forget that this game doesn't have to have these rules.

00:06:43,842 --> 00:06:44,606
SPEAKER_1:  You can break them.

00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,398
SPEAKER_1:  This happens in the...

00:06:46,754 --> 00:06:47,294
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

00:06:47,714 --> 00:06:48,606
SPEAKER_1:  in Wall Street.

00:06:49,026 --> 00:06:58,622
SPEAKER_1:  Like the financial, the financial system, everybody starts to like collectively agree on a set of rules that they play and they don't realize like, we don't have to be playing this game. It's tough. It's really tough.

00:06:59,522 --> 00:07:02,270
SPEAKER_1:  it takes a special kind of human being as opposed to being a

00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:07,134
SPEAKER_1:  anti-establishment on everything, which also gets a lot of attention.

00:07:07,938 --> 00:07:10,462
SPEAKER_1:  but being just enough anti-establishment.

00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:14,398
SPEAKER_1:  to figure out ideas how to improve the establishment.

00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:16,702
SPEAKER_1:  That's such a tricky place to operate.

00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  I agree.

00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  I like the word iconoclastic.

00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's important to be an iconoclast.

00:07:22,594 --> 00:07:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  Which is to say...

00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,862
SPEAKER_0:  You love ideas.

00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  You're serious about ideas?

00:07:27,106 --> 00:07:29,758
SPEAKER_0:  But you're never comfortable with consensus.

00:07:30,594 --> 00:07:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  And I write about that in this book. I've written about that actually a lot in the New York Times too. I think-

00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  Consensus is overstated.

00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:41,054
SPEAKER_0:  as someone who's half Jewish and half Hindu.

00:07:41,314 --> 00:07:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  I don't want to live in a society where everyone agrees, because my guess is they're going to come after people like me.

00:07:45,954 --> 00:07:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  I want to live in a society.

00:07:47,522 --> 00:07:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  That's pluralistic. This is what Abraham Lincoln was really fighting for in the Civil War. What the war is really about.

00:07:52,482 --> 00:07:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  I want my books about, which is that.

00:07:54,338 --> 00:07:57,438
SPEAKER_0:  We need a society where institutions encourage

00:07:57,858 --> 00:07:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  As you say, different modes of thought.

00:08:00,162 --> 00:08:09,790
SPEAKER_0:  and respect different modes of thought and work through disagreement. So a society should not be a society where everyone agrees. A democratic society should be a society where people disagree, but can still work together.

00:08:10,146 --> 00:08:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  That's the Lincoln vision.

00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  And how do you get there? I think you get there by having a historical perspective, always knowing.

00:08:16,674 --> 00:08:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  that no matter what moment you're in and no matter what room you're in with really smart people

00:08:20,962 --> 00:08:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  There are always things they're missing.

00:08:22,786 --> 00:08:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  We know that as historians.

00:08:24,514 --> 00:08:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  No one is clairvoyant, and the iconoclast is looking for the things that have been forgotten, the silences in the room.

00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  And also...

00:08:33,026 --> 00:08:33,630
SPEAKER_1:  I wonder what...

00:08:33,922 --> 00:08:37,726
SPEAKER_1:  what kind of skill, what kind of processes required for that kind of class.

00:08:38,306 --> 00:08:40,990
SPEAKER_1:  to reveal what is missing to the rest of the room. the room.

00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:46,206
SPEAKER_1:  because it's not just shouting with a megaphone that something is missing because nobody will listen to you

00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:48,094
SPEAKER_1:  You have to convince them.

00:08:49,186 --> 00:08:53,630
SPEAKER_0:  It's honestly where I have trouble myself, because I often find myself in that iconoclastic role.

00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,358
SPEAKER_0:  and people like to hear it

00:08:56,034 --> 00:08:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I like to believe.

00:08:57,858 --> 00:09:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  that people are acting out of goodwill, which I think they usually are, and that people are open to new ideas, but you find very quickly.

00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  even those who you think are open-minded once they've committed themselves.

00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  put their money.

00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  and their reputation on the line.

00:09:10,722 --> 00:09:15,134
SPEAKER_0:  they don't want to hear otherwise so in a sense what you say is the bigger than even being

00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,510
SPEAKER_0:  and iconoclasts.

00:09:16,738 --> 00:09:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  being able to persuade and work with people.

00:09:19,202 --> 00:09:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  who are afraid of your ideas.

00:09:20,738 --> 00:09:23,646
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I think the key is like in conversations is to.

00:09:24,002 --> 00:09:25,790
SPEAKER_1:  get people out of a defensive position.

00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:28,734
SPEAKER_1:  Like, make them realize we're on the same side.

00:09:29,314 --> 00:09:31,742
SPEAKER_1:  or brothers and sisters and from that place.

00:09:32,482 --> 00:09:34,878
SPEAKER_1:  I think you just raised the question. It's like a little.

00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:37,214
SPEAKER_1:  It's a little thought.

00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:38,494
SPEAKER_1:  that just lands?

00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:39,422
SPEAKER_1:  And then.

00:09:39,714 --> 00:09:41,278
SPEAKER_1:  I've noticed this time and time again.

00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  Just a little subtle thing and then months later.

00:09:45,698 --> 00:09:48,958
SPEAKER_1:  It percolates, somewhere in the mind, it's like, all right, that little doubt.

00:09:49,474 --> 00:09:54,590
SPEAKER_1:  Because I also realized in these battles, especially political battles,

00:09:55,746 --> 00:09:57,246
SPEAKER_1:  People often don't.

00:09:58,338 --> 00:10:00,286
SPEAKER_1:  have folks on their side.

00:10:00,994 --> 00:10:02,910
SPEAKER_1:  like that they can really trust.

00:10:04,194 --> 00:10:05,790
SPEAKER_1:  as a fellow human being.

00:10:06,178 --> 00:10:06,878
SPEAKER_1:  Challenge them.

00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:08,798
SPEAKER_1:  That's a very difficult role to be in.

00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  And because in these battles, you kind of have a tribe and you have a set of ideas and there's another tribe and you have a set of ideas. And when somebody says something, that doesn't Collaborate,

00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:20,990
SPEAKER_1:  You almost always want to put them in the other tribe as opposed to having

00:10:21,986 --> 00:10:24,574
SPEAKER_1:  truly listening to another person that takes.

00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:26,174
SPEAKER_1:  but ultimately I think...

00:10:26,594 --> 00:10:30,302
SPEAKER_1:  That's the way to bridge these divides, is having these kinds of conversations.

00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,222
SPEAKER_1:  That's why I'm actually.

00:10:33,186 --> 00:10:38,110
SPEAKER_1:  Again, optimistically believe in the power of social media to do that if you design it well

00:10:38,434 --> 00:10:39,326
SPEAKER_1:  but currently.

00:10:39,714 --> 00:10:41,182
SPEAKER_1:  The battle rages on.

00:10:41,378 --> 00:10:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  on Twitter. Well, I think what you're getting at, which is so important is storytelling.

00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:50,718
SPEAKER_0:  and all the great leaders I've studied.

00:10:51,138 --> 00:10:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  some of whom are in this book, some of whom are not right, whether they're politicians.

00:10:55,426 --> 00:10:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  social activists, technologists.

00:10:58,914 --> 00:11:00,318
SPEAKER_0:  It's the story.

00:11:00,546 --> 00:11:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  that gets people in.

00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:05,150
SPEAKER_0:  People don't respond to an argument. We're trained.

00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  at least in the United States, were often trained to argue.

00:11:09,154 --> 00:11:13,310
SPEAKER_0:  uh... you're used to told in a class okay this part of the room take this position

00:11:13,698 --> 00:11:18,142
SPEAKER_0:  this part of the room take this position and that's helpful because it forces you to see different sides of the argument

00:11:18,466 --> 00:11:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  But in fact...

00:11:19,362 --> 00:11:21,694
SPEAKER_0:  Those on one side never convince those on the other side.

00:11:22,274 --> 00:11:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  argument. It's through a story that people can identify with.

00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  It's when you bring your argument to life in human terms.

00:11:28,802 --> 00:11:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  And someone again like Abraham Lincoln was a master at that.

00:11:32,386 --> 00:11:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  He told stories. He found ways to disarm people.

00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:40,478
SPEAKER_0:  and to move them without their even realizing they were being moved.

00:11:42,722 --> 00:11:46,110
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, not make it a debate, make it a...

00:11:46,978 --> 00:11:47,870
SPEAKER_1:  Tell a story.

00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,998
SPEAKER_1:  That's fascinating, because yes, some of the most convincing politicians.

00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:55,070
SPEAKER_1:  I don't feel like they're arguing a point, they're just telling a story.

00:11:55,778 --> 00:11:56,958
SPEAKER_1:  and it gets in there, right?

00:11:57,602 --> 00:11:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  That's right. That's right. When we look at

00:11:59,938 --> 00:12:05,886
SPEAKER_0:  what the lindsay is done in ukraine response to the uh... russian invasion and i know you you were there on the front lines yourself

00:12:06,306 --> 00:12:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:12:07,586 --> 00:12:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  It's not that he's arguing a position that persuade us. We already believe what we believed about Russia.

00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  But he's bringing the story of Ukrainian suffering to life.

00:12:16,098 --> 00:12:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  and making us see the behavior of the Russians.

00:12:18,978 --> 00:12:20,702
SPEAKER_0:  that is moving opinion.

00:12:21,506 --> 00:12:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  around the world.

00:12:23,266 --> 00:12:26,046
SPEAKER_1:  Well, the interesting stuff, sometimes it's not actually the story.

00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:32,158
SPEAKER_1:  told by the person, but the story told about the person. And some of that could be propaganda, some of that could be.

00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:32,926
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:37,278
SPEAKER_1:  Legitimate stories, which is the fascinating thing the power of story

00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:38,494
SPEAKER_1:  is the very

00:12:38,946 --> 00:12:40,990
SPEAKER_1:  power that's leveraged by propaganda.

00:12:41,442 --> 00:12:42,622
SPEAKER_1:  to convince the populace.

00:12:42,978 --> 00:12:44,062
SPEAKER_1:  But the idea...

00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  one of the most powerful ideas when I traveled in Ukraine.

00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:48,766
SPEAKER_1:  and in general to me personally.

00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,926
SPEAKER_1:  the idea that President Zelensky stayed in Kiev.

00:12:53,218 --> 00:12:57,214
SPEAKER_1:  in the early days of war, when everybody from his inner circle.

00:12:57,602 --> 00:13:01,118
SPEAKER_1:  to the United States, everybody in the West, and NATO, everybody was telling him.

00:13:01,506 --> 00:13:04,510
SPEAKER_1:  And even on the Russian side, I assume...

00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,806
SPEAKER_1:  They thought he would leave, he would escape, and he didn't.

00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:08,862
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:13:09,346 --> 00:13:11,774
SPEAKER_1:  from foolishness or from heroism, I don't know.

00:13:12,194 --> 00:13:13,726
SPEAKER_1:  But that's a story.

00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:18,175
SPEAKER_1:  That I think United country and it's such a small thing, but.

00:13:18,175 --> 00:13:25,566
SPEAKER_0:  It's the most basic of all human stories, the story of human courage. And I remember watching his social media feed on that.

00:13:26,146 --> 00:13:27,070
SPEAKER_0:  and he was standing.

00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  Outside, not even in a bunker.

00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:33,854
SPEAKER_0:  standing outside in Kiev as the Russian forces are attacking and saying, I'm here.

00:13:34,402 --> 00:13:37,662
SPEAKER_0:  And this minister is here. And this minister is here. We're not corrupt.

00:13:38,306 --> 00:13:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  We're not stooges of the Americans who told us to leave. We're staying.

00:13:42,178 --> 00:13:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  because we care about Ukraine and the story of courage.

00:13:45,026 --> 00:13:46,910
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, that's the story that, you know.

00:13:47,138 --> 00:13:52,013
SPEAKER_0:  babies grow up seeing their parents as courageous, right? It's the most natural of all stories.

00:13:52,013 --> 00:13:55,102
SPEAKER_1:  And that's also the stories for better or worse that are told throughout history.

00:13:55,426 --> 00:13:57,214
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. Uh, because.

00:13:57,698 --> 00:13:59,966
SPEAKER_1:  stories of courage and uh...

00:14:00,802 --> 00:14:01,918
SPEAKER_1:  stories of evil.

00:14:02,146 --> 00:14:03,806
SPEAKER_1:  Those are the two extremes.

00:14:04,034 --> 00:14:05,182
SPEAKER_1:  are the ones that are kind of...

00:14:05,538 --> 00:14:08,350
SPEAKER_1:  It's a nice mechanism to tell the stories of wars.

00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:09,502
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

00:14:09,762 --> 00:14:10,750
SPEAKER_1:  of conflicts.

00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,094
SPEAKER_1:  of struggles.

00:14:12,322 --> 00:14:12,798
SPEAKER_1:  All of it.

00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,495
SPEAKER_1:  The attachment between those two.

00:14:15,495 --> 00:14:16,350
SPEAKER_0:  And the reason...

00:14:16,674 --> 00:14:19,966
SPEAKER_0:  I believe studying history and writing about history is so essential.

00:14:20,418 --> 00:14:21,854
SPEAKER_0:  It's because it gives us more stories.

00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  The problem with much of our world, I think, is that we're confronted by data.

00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,046
SPEAKER_0:  we're confronted by information. And of course it's valuable.

00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  but it's easy to manipulate or misuse information.

00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  It's the stories that give us a structure. It's the stories where we find morality. It's the stories where we find political value.

00:14:40,706 --> 00:14:44,798
SPEAKER_0:  And what do you get from studying history? You learn more stories about more people.

00:14:45,698 --> 00:14:48,702
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I'm a sucker for courage, for stories of courage.

00:14:48,994 --> 00:14:51,774
SPEAKER_1:  Like I've been in too many rooms.

00:14:52,802 --> 00:14:54,398
SPEAKER_1:  often seen too many people.

00:14:55,714 --> 00:14:56,126
SPEAKER_1:  sort of.

00:14:56,386 --> 00:14:59,422
SPEAKER_1:  in subtle ways sacrificed their integrity and did nothing.

00:15:00,002 --> 00:15:01,214
SPEAKER_1:  and people that step up.

00:15:01,986 --> 00:15:02,654
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhh...

00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:05,150
SPEAKER_1:  when the opinion is unpopular.

00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:10,238
SPEAKER_1:  and they do something where they really put themselves on the line, where there's their money, where there's their well-being.

00:15:10,498 --> 00:15:10,974
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know.

00:15:11,554 --> 00:15:13,278
SPEAKER_1:  That gives me hope about humanity.

00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:14,110
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:17,630
SPEAKER_1:  And of course, during the war like Ukraine, you see that more and more.

00:15:18,594 --> 00:15:24,766
SPEAKER_1:  Now other people have a very cynical perspective of it that's saying, oh, those are just narratives that are constructive.

00:15:25,026 --> 00:15:27,742
SPEAKER_1:  for propaganda purposes and so on, but I've seen it with my own eyes.

00:15:28,034 --> 00:15:29,054
SPEAKER_1:  There's heroes out there.

00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,974
SPEAKER_1:  Both small and big

00:15:31,522 --> 00:15:33,822
SPEAKER_1:  So just regular citizens and leaders.

00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  one set of heroes I learned about writing this book that I didn't know about that I should have.

00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  or, uh...

00:15:39,618 --> 00:15:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  more than 100,000 former slaves who become Union soldiers during the Civil War.

00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  It's an extraordinary story. We think of it as...

00:15:47,362 --> 00:15:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  North vs. South, White Northern Troops vs. White Southern Troops.

00:15:51,074 --> 00:15:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  There are as I said more than a hundred thousand slaves

00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  No education.

00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  never uh

00:15:57,186 --> 00:15:58,558
SPEAKER_0:  anything other than slaves.

00:15:58,882 --> 00:16:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  who flee their plantations join the Union Army.

00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:07,678
SPEAKER_0:  what I found in the research and other historians have written about this too is they become some of the most courageous soldiers

00:16:08,002 --> 00:16:11,582
SPEAKER_0:  Because they know what they're fighting for but there's something more to it than that

00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  It seems in their stories that there is a humanity, a human desire,

00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  for freedom.

00:16:18,274 --> 00:16:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  and a human desire to improve oneself.

00:16:21,634 --> 00:16:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  even for those who have been denied even the most basic rights for all their lives.

00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that's story.

00:16:28,642 --> 00:16:31,198
SPEAKER_0:  should be inspiring to all of us as a story of courage.

00:16:31,522 --> 00:16:32,798
SPEAKER_0:  because we all deal with difficulties.

00:16:33,474 --> 00:16:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  but none of us are starting from slavery.

00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:41,086
SPEAKER_1:  That's really powerful, that flame, the longing for freedom can't be extinguished.

00:16:41,762 --> 00:16:44,894
SPEAKER_1:  through the generations of slavery. So that's something you talk about. There's some.

00:16:45,122 --> 00:16:46,270
SPEAKER_1:  deep sense in which.

00:16:47,138 --> 00:16:50,430
SPEAKER_1:  uh... while the war was about impart about slavery

00:16:51,298 --> 00:16:52,222
SPEAKER_1:  It's not.

00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:55,006
SPEAKER_1:  The slaves themselves

00:16:55,746 --> 00:16:56,702
SPEAKER_1:  fought for their freedom.

00:16:57,122 --> 00:16:58,270
SPEAKER_1:  and they won their freedom.

00:16:58,498 --> 00:17:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  i don't think it's a war about slavery and it's a war about freedom

00:17:01,826 --> 00:17:03,486
SPEAKER_0:  Because if you say it's a war about slavery...

00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:07,422
SPEAKER_0:  then it sounds like it's an argument between the slave masters.

00:17:07,874 --> 00:17:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  and the other white guys.

00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  who didn't want slavery to exist. And of course that argument did exist.

00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:20,638
SPEAKER_0:  But it wasn't, it was a war over freedom, especially after 1863 into the second year of the war.

00:17:20,866 --> 00:17:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  when Lincoln because of war pressures.

00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  Science Emancipation Proclamation.

00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  which therefore says that the contraband, the property of southerners

00:17:31,874 --> 00:17:32,894
SPEAKER_0:  i.e. they're slaves.

00:17:33,634 --> 00:17:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  will now be freed and brought into the Union Army.

00:17:37,186 --> 00:17:41,150
SPEAKER_0:  That makes it about freedom. Already the slaves were leaving the plantations.

00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  They knew what was going on and they were going to get out of slavery as soon as they could.

00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  But now it becomes a war over freeing them.

00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  over opening that.

00:17:49,538 --> 00:17:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  opportunity for them.

00:17:51,426 --> 00:17:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  uh... and and that's how the war ends that's really important right and that's where we are in our politics today it's the same debate is why i wrote this book

00:17:58,306 --> 00:18:00,030
SPEAKER_0:  the challenge of our time.

00:18:00,482 --> 00:18:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  is to understand how do we make our society open to more freedom for more people.

00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:06,526
SPEAKER_1:  So.

00:18:06,882 --> 00:18:07,902
SPEAKER_1:  Let's go to the beginning.

00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,558
SPEAKER_1:  How did the American Civil War start?

00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,062
SPEAKER_1:  and why.

00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  So the American Civil War starts because of our flawed institutions. The founders had mixed views of slavery.

00:18:20,226 --> 00:18:23,550
SPEAKER_0:  but they wanted a system that would eventually work its way.

00:18:23,906 --> 00:18:30,654
SPEAKER_0:  toward opening for more people of more kinds. Not necessarily equality, but they wanted a more open democratic system.

00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:35,294
SPEAKER_0:  Our institutions were designed in ways that gave disproportionate power.

00:18:35,938 --> 00:18:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  slaveholders in particular states in the Union.

00:18:39,362 --> 00:18:40,030
SPEAKER_0:  through the Senate.

00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  the electoral college, through many of the institutions we talk about in our politics today.

00:18:45,378 --> 00:18:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  therefore that part of the country.

00:18:47,746 --> 00:18:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  was in the words of Abraham Lincoln.

00:18:49,698 --> 00:18:51,294
SPEAKER_0:  holding the rest of the country hostage.

00:18:52,194 --> 00:18:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  Far poor.

00:18:53,314 --> 00:18:56,958
SPEAKER_0:  White man like Abraham Lincoln, born in Kentucky, who makes his way in Illinois.

00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  Slavery was an evil, not just for moral reasons.

00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  It was an evil because it denied him democratic opportunity.

00:19:04,194 --> 00:19:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  Why would anyone hire?

00:19:05,762 --> 00:19:08,670
SPEAKER_0:  poor Abe to do something if they could get a slave to do it for free.

00:19:09,474 --> 00:19:13,374
SPEAKER_0:  and his economy of opportunity for him had to be an economy that was open.

00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:17,310
SPEAKER_0:  and that did not have slavery, particularly in the new states that were coming into the Union.

00:19:18,114 --> 00:19:20,446
SPEAKER_0:  Lincoln was one of the creators of the Republican Party.

00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:24,446
SPEAKER_0:  which was a party dedicated to making sure all new territory.

00:19:25,186 --> 00:19:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  was open.

00:19:26,786 --> 00:19:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  to anyone who was willing to work.

00:19:28,578 --> 00:19:29,470
SPEAKER_0:  any male figure.

00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,422
SPEAKER_0:  who would be paid for their work. free labor?

00:19:31,746 --> 00:19:33,630
SPEAKER_0:  free soil, free men, basic capitalism.

00:19:34,178 --> 00:19:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  Southerners, Southern plantation owners were an aristocracy.

00:19:37,922 --> 00:19:42,494
SPEAKER_0:  that did not want that. They wanted to use slavery and expand slavery into the new territories.

00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,574
SPEAKER_0:  What caused the Civil War? The clash.

00:19:44,994 --> 00:19:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  and our institutions.

00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  that were unable to adapt and continue to give disproportionate power.

00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:55,070
SPEAKER_0:  to these Southern plantation slave owners. Supreme Court.

00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  was dominated by them?

00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  Senate was dominated by them.

00:19:58,914 --> 00:20:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  and so the republican party

00:20:00,962 --> 00:20:03,102
SPEAKER_0:  came into power as a critique of that?

00:20:04,386 --> 00:20:05,534
SPEAKER_0:  and southerners.

00:20:05,826 --> 00:20:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  unwilling to accept, Southern Confederates unwilling to accept that change.

00:20:10,498 --> 00:20:11,614
SPEAKER_0:  went to war with the Union.

00:20:12,322 --> 00:20:14,782
SPEAKER_1:  So who was on each side? The Union Confederates.

00:20:15,522 --> 00:20:18,494
SPEAKER_1:  What are we talking about? What are the states? How many people?

00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:19,838
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

00:20:20,354 --> 00:20:21,662
SPEAKER_1:  What's like the...

00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,886
SPEAKER_1:  the demographics and the dynamics of each side.

00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  the union side is much much larger.

00:20:28,578 --> 00:20:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  Right in terms of population, I think about 22 million people.

00:20:31,682 --> 00:20:37,470
SPEAKER_0:  uh... and it is uh... what we were today recognizes all the states uh... basically uh... north of virginia

00:20:37,794 --> 00:20:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  The South is the States.

00:20:39,394 --> 00:20:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  in the south of the Mason Dixon line. So Virginia and there on south.

00:20:44,002 --> 00:20:45,022
SPEAKER_0:  west through Tennessee.

00:20:45,282 --> 00:20:48,734
SPEAKER_0:  So Texas, for example, is in the Confederacy. Tennessee is in the Confederacy.

00:20:49,154 --> 00:20:51,902
SPEAKER_0:  uh... but other states like missouri or border

00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:52,766
SPEAKER_0:  border states.

00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:57,342
SPEAKER_0:  and the Confederacy is a much smaller entity.

00:20:58,018 --> 00:21:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  It's made up of about 9 million people plus about 4 million slaves.

00:21:02,306 --> 00:21:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  And it is a

00:21:04,194 --> 00:21:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  agricultural economy whereas the northern economy is a more industrializing economy.

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,158
SPEAKER_0:  Interestingly enough, the Confederate states are in some ways

00:21:12,674 --> 00:21:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  more international than the northern states.

00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  because they are exporters of cotton.

00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:19,454
SPEAKER_0:  exporters of tobacco.

00:21:20,098 --> 00:21:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  So they actually have very strong international economic ties, very strong ties to Great Britain.

00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,390
SPEAKER_0:  uh... united states was the largest source of cotton to the world

00:21:27,714 --> 00:21:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  before the Civil War. Egypt replaces that a little bit during the Civil War.

00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  but all the English textiles were American cotton from the south.

00:21:36,642 --> 00:21:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  And so it is.

00:21:38,626 --> 00:21:43,390
SPEAKER_0:  the southern half of what we would call the eastern part of the United States today with far fewer people.

00:21:43,618 --> 00:21:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  It's made up the Confederacy is.

00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  of landed families.

00:21:47,554 --> 00:21:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  Wealth in the Confederacy.

00:21:49,346 --> 00:21:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  was land and slaves.

00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  the northern United States is made up predominantly of small

00:21:55,074 --> 00:21:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  business owners, and then larger financial interests.

00:21:58,306 --> 00:21:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  such as the banks in New York.

00:22:02,018 --> 00:22:05,182
SPEAKER_1:  And what about the military? Who are the people that picked out guns?

00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:08,638
SPEAKER_1:  What are the numbers there? So the union also outnumbered.

00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:13,374
SPEAKER_0:  By far, but it is a really interesting question because there's no conscription in the Constitution.

00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  Unlike most other countries, our democracy is formed on the presumption that human beings should not be forced to go into the military if they don't want to.

00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  Most democracies in the world today actually still.

00:22:24,162 --> 00:22:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  require military service.  Lahaina's

00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,182
SPEAKER_0:  very rarely in its history. Done that, it's not in our Constitution.

00:22:29,634 --> 00:22:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  So, um.

00:22:31,138 --> 00:22:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  during the Civil War in the first months and years of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln has to go to The Martian

00:22:36,802 --> 00:22:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

00:22:37,698 --> 00:22:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  the different states to the governors and ask the governors for volunteers.

00:22:41,954 --> 00:22:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  So the men who take up arms, especially in the first months of the war.

00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  are volunteers in the North.

00:22:48,258 --> 00:22:50,046
SPEAKER_0:  In the south, they're actually conscripted.

00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,414
SPEAKER_0:  And then as the war goes on...

00:22:52,834 --> 00:22:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  the union will pass the conscription acts of 1862 and 1863.

00:22:58,114 --> 00:23:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  which for the first time, and this is really important because it creates new presidential powers.

00:23:01,634 --> 00:23:06,622
SPEAKER_0:  for the first time Lincoln will have presidential power to force men into the army.

00:23:06,946 --> 00:23:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  which is what leads to all kinds of draft riots in New York.

00:23:10,114 --> 00:23:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  and elsewhere.

00:23:11,298 --> 00:23:15,998
SPEAKER_0:  But suffice it to say the Union Army throughout the war is often three times the size of the infantry.

00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,846
SPEAKER_1:  What's the relationship?

00:23:19,714 --> 00:23:22,686
SPEAKER_1:  between this no conscription and.

00:23:22,978 --> 00:23:25,214
SPEAKER_1:  People standing up to fight for ideas.

00:23:25,794 --> 00:23:27,006
SPEAKER_1:  and the Second Amendment.

00:23:27,362 --> 00:23:35,230
SPEAKER_1:  a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.

00:23:35,938 --> 00:23:39,710
SPEAKER_1:  or in Texas. Yeah, yes. What's the role of that?

00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,150
SPEAKER_1:  in this story.

00:23:41,538 --> 00:23:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  The American population is already armed before the war.

00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  And so even though the Union and the Confederate armies will...

00:23:48,322 --> 00:23:49,822
SPEAKER_0:  manufacturer and purchase arms.

00:23:50,082 --> 00:23:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  it is already non population so uh... the american presumption going into the war

00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  is that citizens will not be forced to serve.

00:23:57,858 --> 00:24:00,318
SPEAKER_0:  but they will serve in militias to protect their own property.

00:24:00,738 --> 00:24:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  And so the Second Amendment, the key part of the Second Amendment for me as a historian, is the well-regulated militia.

00:24:05,698 --> 00:24:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  presumption.

00:24:06,722 --> 00:24:11,774
SPEAKER_0:  that citizens, as part of their civic duty, do not have a duty to join a national army.

00:24:12,226 --> 00:24:12,990
SPEAKER_0:  impression style.

00:24:13,858 --> 00:24:16,702
SPEAKER_0:  but are supposed to be involved in defending their communities.

00:24:17,538 --> 00:24:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  And that's the reality, it's also a bit of a myth.

00:24:20,802 --> 00:24:22,686
SPEAKER_0:  And so Americans have.

00:24:22,978 --> 00:24:24,670
SPEAKER_0:  throughout their history, been gun owners.

00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,582
SPEAKER_0:  Not AK-47 owners, but gun owners.

00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:31,806
SPEAKER_0:  and gun ownership has been for the purpose of community self-defense.

00:24:32,258 --> 00:24:37,566
SPEAKER_0:  The question coming out of that is, what does that mean in terms of, do you have access to everything?

00:24:38,146 --> 00:24:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  uh... antonin scalia even himself asked this question on the supreme court you know he said uh...

00:24:43,362 --> 00:24:45,438
SPEAKER_0:  in one of their gun cases.

00:24:45,698 --> 00:24:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  You have the right to defend yourself but you don't have the right to own an Uzi.

00:24:50,466 --> 00:24:53,278
SPEAKER_0:  You don't have the right to have a tank. I don't think they'd let you park a tank.

00:24:53,506 --> 00:24:55,381
SPEAKER_0:  Lex in your parking spot, right?

00:24:55,381 --> 00:24:58,302
SPEAKER_1:  I looked into this. I think there's a gray area around.

00:24:58,594 --> 00:24:59,902
SPEAKER_1:  Tanks, actually.

00:25:00,226 --> 00:25:03,358
SPEAKER_1:  I think you're legit allowed to own a tank.

00:25:03,874 --> 00:25:08,254
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, you really? I think that somebody look into this. Somebody told me, but I could see like.

00:25:09,186 --> 00:25:16,126
SPEAKER_1:  because it's very difficult for that to get out of hand. Right, right. Okay, maybe one guy in a tank, you could be breaking laws in terms of...

00:25:16,354 --> 00:25:19,070
SPEAKER_1:  the width of the vehicle that you're using to operate.

00:25:19,426 --> 00:25:28,766
SPEAKER_1:  Anyway, that's a hilarious discussion. But to make the case, speaking of AK-47s and rifles, and back to Ukraine for a second, that's one of the fascinating things about AK-47s and rifles.

00:25:29,026 --> 00:25:31,038
SPEAKER_1:  social experiments that happen in Ukraine.

00:25:31,586 --> 00:25:32,734
SPEAKER_1:  at the beginning of the war.

00:25:32,962 --> 00:25:33,566
SPEAKER_1:  is they.

00:25:33,986 --> 00:25:35,422
SPEAKER_1:  handed out guns to everybody.

00:25:35,746 --> 00:25:36,350
SPEAKER_1:  rifles

00:25:36,962 --> 00:25:37,662
SPEAKER_1:  and crime.

00:25:38,082 --> 00:25:38,686
SPEAKER_1:  went down.

00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:40,734
SPEAKER_1:  which I think is really interesting.

00:25:42,978 --> 00:25:47,038
SPEAKER_1:  I hope somebody does a kind of psychological data collection.

00:25:47,362 --> 00:25:49,790
SPEAKER_1:  analysis effort here to try to understand why.

00:25:50,306 --> 00:25:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  because it's not obvious to me.

00:25:52,706 --> 00:25:54,270
SPEAKER_1:  that in a time of war.

00:25:54,722 --> 00:25:57,790
SPEAKER_1:  If you give guns to the entire populace, anyone who wants a gun.

00:25:58,082 --> 00:26:02,430
SPEAKER_1:  it's not going to, especially in a country who has historically suffered from corruption

00:26:02,882 --> 00:26:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  NOT

00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:10,910
SPEAKER_1:  Result in robberies and assaults and all that kind of stuff. There's a deep lesson there now I don't know if you can extend that lesson beyond wartime though.

00:26:11,138 --> 00:26:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  That's the question, what happens after the war? I mean, my inclination would be to say

00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:17,438
SPEAKER_0:  That can work during war, but you have to take the guns back.

00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  after the war.

00:26:20,066 --> 00:26:29,502
SPEAKER_0:  They might be very upset when you try to take the- That's the problem. No, that's precisely the problem. That's actually part of the story here. I mean, what happens after the Civil War, after Appomattox in 1865?

00:26:29,794 --> 00:26:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  is that many uh... southern soldiers go home with their guns

00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,390
SPEAKER_0:  and they misuse their weapons.

00:26:35,874 --> 00:26:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  Ah, too.

00:26:37,474 --> 00:26:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  quite frankly, shoot and intimidate.

00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:45,438
SPEAKER_0:  uh... former slaves who are now citizens is a big problem i talk about this in the book in memphis in eighteen sixty six

00:26:45,794 --> 00:26:50,238
SPEAKER_0:  It is former Confederate soldiers and police officers and judges

00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  who are responsible for hundreds of rapes.

00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  within a two-day period and destroying an entire community of African Americans.

00:26:58,722 --> 00:26:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  and they're able to do that.

00:26:59,874 --> 00:27:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  Because they brought their guns home.

00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:02,590
SPEAKER_1:  but underneath.

00:27:03,138 --> 00:27:06,942
SPEAKER_1:  Underneath the issue of guns there is just the fundamental issue of

00:27:07,394 --> 00:27:07,902
SPEAKER_1:  Wow.

00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  hatred and

00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,710
SPEAKER_1:  inability to see.

00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:16,542
SPEAKER_1:  other humans in this world as having equal value.

00:27:16,962 --> 00:27:18,302
SPEAKER_1:  as another human being.

00:27:18,562 --> 00:27:23,998
SPEAKER_1:  What was the election of 1860 like that brought Lincoln to power?

00:27:24,418 --> 00:27:26,334
SPEAKER_0:  So the election of 1860.

00:27:26,722 --> 00:27:31,198
SPEAKER_0:  was a very divisive election. We have divisive, contested elections.

00:27:31,746 --> 00:27:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  from 1860 really until 1896. The 1860 election is the first election where...

00:27:37,474 --> 00:27:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  uh... a republican is elected president that is lincoln but he's elected president with less than forty percent of the vote

00:27:43,202 --> 00:27:45,630
SPEAKER_0:  because you have two sets of Democrats running.

00:27:46,434 --> 00:27:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  Democrats who are

00:27:47,938 --> 00:27:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  out to defend the Confederacy and everything.

00:27:50,274 --> 00:27:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  and then Democrats who want to compromise.

00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  but still keep slavery, most famous Stephen Douglas.

00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  who argues for basically allowing each state to make its own decisions, popular sovereignty, as it called it.

00:28:02,786 --> 00:28:06,014
SPEAKER_0:  And then you still have traditional wigs who are running. That was the party that proceeded.

00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,574
SPEAKER_0:  uh... the republican party to four candidates

00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  Lincoln wins a plurality. Lincoln is elected largely because

00:28:12,418 --> 00:28:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  of the states that are anti-slavery or anti-expansion of slavery are not a majority but they're a plurality.

00:28:19,842 --> 00:28:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  and the other states have basically factionalized. And so they're unable to have a united front against him.

00:28:26,594 --> 00:28:28,254
SPEAKER_1:  was the main topic of hand.

00:28:28,482 --> 00:28:29,054
SPEAKER_1:  Slavery.

00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,062
SPEAKER_0:  I think the main topic at hand at that time was...

00:28:32,354 --> 00:28:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  the expansion of slavery into new territories. Into new territories. Right, it was not, whether to abolish slavery or not, Lincoln is very careful in his correspondences.

00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:41,150
SPEAKER_0:  clear.

00:28:41,442 --> 00:28:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  He wants no one on his side during the election to say that he's arguing for abolitionism.

00:28:46,114 --> 00:28:47,742
SPEAKER_0:  even though he personally supported that.

00:28:48,386 --> 00:28:50,590
SPEAKER_0:  What he wants to say is the Republican Party

00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  is for no new slave territories.

00:28:54,306 --> 00:28:55,518
SPEAKER_1:  Did he make it clear?

00:28:56,418 --> 00:28:58,334
SPEAKER_1:  that he was for abolition.

00:28:58,594 --> 00:29:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  No, he was intentionally unclear about that.

00:29:03,138 --> 00:29:04,286
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think he was?

00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:05,790
SPEAKER_1:  throughout his life.

00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,422
SPEAKER_1:  Was there a deep...

00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,358
SPEAKER_1:  because that takes quite a vision. Like you look at society today.

00:29:12,354 --> 00:29:13,438
SPEAKER_1:  and you.

00:29:13,698 --> 00:29:15,166
SPEAKER_1:  It takes quite a man.

00:29:16,098 --> 00:29:17,342
SPEAKER_1:  to see.

00:29:17,762 --> 00:29:20,830
SPEAKER_1:  that there's something deeply broken where a lot of people take for granted.

00:29:21,154 --> 00:29:23,678
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, in modern day, you could see factory farming.

00:29:24,418 --> 00:29:27,262
SPEAKER_1:  That's one of those things that in a hundred years Using Google seemed as easy as that

00:29:27,522 --> 00:29:30,366
SPEAKER_1:  like the torture, the mass torture of animals could be.

00:29:30,786 --> 00:29:31,806
SPEAKER_1:  could be seen as evil.

00:29:32,066 --> 00:29:35,742
SPEAKER_1:  but just to look around and wake up to that, especially in a leadership position.

00:29:36,514 --> 00:29:37,598
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, was he able to see that?

00:29:38,242 --> 00:29:41,886
SPEAKER_0:  In some ways yes, in some ways no. I mean the premise of your question is really important.

00:29:42,786 --> 00:29:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  To us, it's obvious that slavery is a horror.

00:29:46,338 --> 00:29:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  but to those who had grown up with it, who had grown up seeing that.

00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  It was hard to imagine a different world. So, you're right.

00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:57,182
SPEAKER_0:  Lincoln's imagination like everyone else's was limited by his time.

00:29:57,794 --> 00:30:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think Lincoln imagined a world of equality between the races.

00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,934
SPEAKER_0:  But he had come to see that slavery...

00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  was horrible and historians have differed in how he came to this.

00:30:08,866 --> 00:30:09,406
SPEAKER_0:  Ah.

00:30:09,762 --> 00:30:10,238
SPEAKER_0:  part of it.

00:30:10,658 --> 00:30:13,694
SPEAKER_0:  is that he had a father who treated him like a slave.

00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:19,294
SPEAKER_0:  And you can see in his early correspondence how much he hates that his father, who was a struggling farmer.

00:30:19,906 --> 00:30:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  was basically trying to control Lincoln's life.

00:30:22,722 --> 00:30:25,182
SPEAKER_0:  and he came to understand personally.

00:30:25,602 --> 00:30:28,990
SPEAKER_0:  I think how horrible it is to have someone else tell you what you should do with your labor.

00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:32,126
SPEAKER_0:  not giving you your own choices.

00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  uh... but lincoln was also a pragmatist is what made him a great politician he wanted to work through institutions not to burn them down

00:30:39,714 --> 00:30:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  And he famously said...

00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  that if he could.

00:30:43,938 --> 00:30:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  Preserve the Union.

00:30:45,314 --> 00:30:46,750
SPEAKER_0:  and stop the spread of slavery.

00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  by allowing slavery to stay in the South he would.

00:30:49,378 --> 00:30:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  If he could do it by eliminating slavery in the South, if he could do it by buying the slaves and sending them somewhere else, he would.

00:30:55,234 --> 00:30:56,126
SPEAKER_0:  His main goal.

00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  What he ran on.

00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  was that the new territories west of Illinois

00:31:00,578 --> 00:31:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  that they would be areas for free.

00:31:02,498 --> 00:31:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  poor.

00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,190
SPEAKER_0:  white men like him.

00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  not slavery.

00:31:08,194 --> 00:31:15,550
SPEAKER_1:  What do you learn about human nature if you step back and look at the big picture of it? Slavery has been a part of human civilization for thousands of years.

00:31:15,938 --> 00:31:16,510
SPEAKER_1:  at this.

00:31:16,802 --> 00:31:19,390
SPEAKER_1:  American slavery is not new.

00:31:19,874 --> 00:31:20,350
SPEAKER_1:  phenomenon.

00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  I think history teaches us a very pessimistic and a very optimistic lesson. The pessimistic lesson is that human beings are capable of doing enormous...

00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  harm.

00:31:30,754 --> 00:31:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  and brutality to their fellow man and woman.

00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:35,838
SPEAKER_0:  And we see that with genocide in our world today.

00:31:36,546 --> 00:31:37,982
SPEAKER_0:  that human beings are capable.

00:31:38,306 --> 00:31:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  with the right.

00:31:39,202 --> 00:31:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  Stimuli.

00:31:40,418 --> 00:31:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  the right incentives.

00:31:43,106 --> 00:31:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  of of of enslaving others i mean

00:31:45,986 --> 00:31:47,646
SPEAKER_0:  genocide is in the same category.

00:31:49,442 --> 00:31:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  The optimistic side.

00:31:52,002 --> 00:31:53,662
SPEAKER_0:  is that human beings are also capable.

00:31:54,082 --> 00:31:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  with proper leadership and governance.

00:31:56,418 --> 00:31:57,790
SPEAKER_0:  of resisting those urges.

00:31:58,722 --> 00:32:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  of putting those energies.

00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  into productive uses for other people.

00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  But I don't think that comes naturally.

00:32:05,442 --> 00:32:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  I think that's where leadership and institutions matter.

00:32:08,258 --> 00:32:13,150
SPEAKER_0:  But leadership and institutions can tame us. We can tame, we can civilize ourselves.

00:32:13,474 --> 00:32:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  And for a long time we stopped using that verb to civilize. I believe in-

00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:23,678
SPEAKER_0:  civilization. I believe there's a civilizing role. Lincoln spoke of that, right? So did Franklin Roosevelt, the civilizing role.

00:32:23,906 --> 00:32:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  that government plays education is only a part of that

00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  It's creating laws, minimal laws, but laws nonetheless.

00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  that incentivize and penalize.

00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  us for going to the dark side.

00:32:34,434 --> 00:32:39,646
SPEAKER_0:  But if we allow that to happen or we have leaders who encourage us to go to the dark side, we can very quickly

00:32:40,034 --> 00:32:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  go down a deep dark tunnel.

00:32:43,202 --> 00:32:45,918
SPEAKER_1:  I believe that most people want to do good.

00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:49,342
SPEAKER_1:  and the power of institutions if done well.

00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:53,694
SPEAKER_1:  They encourage and protect you if you want to do good.

00:32:54,498 --> 00:32:56,222
SPEAKER_1:  So if you're just in the jungle.

00:32:57,602 --> 00:32:59,998
SPEAKER_1:  the from a game theoretic perspective.

00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:02,142
SPEAKER_1:  You get punished for doing good.

00:33:02,818 --> 00:33:08,094
SPEAKER_1:  So being extremely self-centered and greedy and even violent and manipulative

00:33:08,482 --> 00:33:11,454
SPEAKER_1:  can have from a game theory perspective benefits.

00:33:11,682 --> 00:33:13,406
SPEAKER_1:  But I don't think that's what most humans want.

00:33:13,986 --> 00:33:20,958
SPEAKER_1:  institutions allow you to do what you actually want, which is to do good for the world, do good for others, and actually in so doing.

00:33:21,698 --> 00:33:22,622
SPEAKER_1:  too good for yourself.

00:33:23,266 --> 00:33:26,494
SPEAKER_1:  Institutions protect that natural human instinct, I think.

00:33:26,818 --> 00:33:30,782
SPEAKER_0:  and what you just articulated, which I think the historical record is very strong on.

00:33:31,074 --> 00:33:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  is the classic liberal position.

00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,838
SPEAKER_0:  That's what liberalism means in a 19th century sense.

00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  right, that you believe in civilizing human beings through institutions. That begins with education. Kindergarten is an institution.

00:33:44,418 --> 00:33:45,214
SPEAKER_0:  laws.

00:33:45,634 --> 00:33:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  uh... and and just basic

00:33:48,162 --> 00:33:50,238
SPEAKER_0:  habits that are enforced.

00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:51,294
SPEAKER_0:  by society.

00:33:53,218 --> 00:33:55,102
SPEAKER_1:  How do you think people thought about the idea?

00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:01,566
SPEAKER_1:  How do they square the idea of all men are created equal? Those very powerful words.

00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,454
SPEAKER_1:  the founding of this nation.

00:34:04,546 --> 00:34:05,950
SPEAKER_1:  How did they square that with slavery?

00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:10,878
SPEAKER_0:  many Americans saying all men were created equal required slavery.

00:34:11,554 --> 00:34:15,518
SPEAKER_0:  because it meant that the equality of white people was dependent upon.

00:34:15,938 --> 00:34:18,750
SPEAKER_0:  others doing the work for us. In the way, some people.

00:34:19,234 --> 00:34:19,966
SPEAKER_0:  view.

00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:21,246
SPEAKER_0:  animal labor today.

00:34:21,506 --> 00:34:22,846
SPEAKER_0:  and maybe in 50 years.

00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  We'll see that as a contradiction.

00:34:25,666 --> 00:34:33,342
SPEAKER_0:  But the notion among many Americans in the 17th, 18th century, and this would also be true for those in other societies, was that equality

00:34:33,762 --> 00:34:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  for white men.

00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  meant

00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  that you had access to the labor of others.

00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  that would allow you to equalize other differences.

00:34:42,626 --> 00:34:44,318
SPEAKER_0:  So you could.

00:34:44,738 --> 00:34:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  produce enough food.

00:34:46,498 --> 00:34:47,742
SPEAKER_0:  so your family could live.

00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  equally well nourished as other families.

00:34:50,594 --> 00:34:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  because you had slaves on the land.

00:34:52,706 --> 00:34:55,070
SPEAKER_0:  doing the farming for you. This is Thomas Jefferson's world.

00:34:55,810 --> 00:35:00,163
SPEAKER_1:  So it's like animal farm, all animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.

00:35:00,163 --> 00:35:01,022
SPEAKER_0:  That's right.

00:35:01,378 --> 00:35:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that's still the way people view things.

00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,574
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:35:05,218 --> 00:35:09,662
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if that's a liberal position or it's just a human position that um...

00:35:10,594 --> 00:35:12,766
SPEAKER_1:  that all humans have equal value.

00:35:13,698 --> 00:35:16,510
SPEAKER_1:  just on the basic level of humanity.

00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:23,006
SPEAKER_0:  But do we really believe that? We want to. I don't know if our society really believes that yet.

00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:31,262
SPEAKER_1:  And I don't know exactly, I mean, it's super complicated, of course, when you realize the amount of suffering that's going on in the world.

00:35:31,682 --> 00:35:34,622
SPEAKER_1:  or there's children dying from starvation in Africa.

00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:39,198
SPEAKER_1:  and to say that all humans are equal, well, a few dollars can save their life.

00:35:39,586 --> 00:35:39,934
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:35:40,194 --> 00:35:42,302
SPEAKER_1:  and instead we buy a Starbucks coffee.

00:35:42,786 --> 00:35:44,638
SPEAKER_1:  and are willing to pay 10.

00:35:45,026 --> 00:35:51,646
SPEAKER_1:  $50,000, $100,000 to save a child, our child, like somebody from our family, and don't want to spend $2.

00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,886
SPEAKER_1:  to save a child over in Africa.

00:35:54,434 --> 00:35:55,038
SPEAKER_1:  So there's...

00:35:55,394 --> 00:35:58,302
SPEAKER_1:  And I think Sam Harris or others have talked about like.

00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,574
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I don't want to live in a world where...

00:36:01,186 --> 00:36:02,334
SPEAKER_1:  we'd rather send.

00:36:02,754 --> 00:36:03,518
SPEAKER_1:  $2

00:36:04,002 --> 00:36:04,670
SPEAKER_1:  to Africa.

00:36:04,994 --> 00:36:09,342
SPEAKER_1:  There's something deeply human about saving those that are really close to you, the ones we love.

00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:11,294
SPEAKER_1:  So that like hypocrisy.

00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,118
SPEAKER_1:  that seems to go.

00:36:13,346 --> 00:36:17,150
SPEAKER_1:  attention with the basic ethics of alleviating suffering in the world.

00:36:17,474 --> 00:36:18,654
SPEAKER_1:  That's also really human.

00:36:19,138 --> 00:36:20,862
SPEAKER_1:  That's also part of this ideal.

00:36:21,922 --> 00:36:23,326
SPEAKER_1:  of all men are created equal.

00:36:23,778 --> 00:36:25,653
SPEAKER_1:  It's a complicated messy world.

00:36:25,653 --> 00:36:29,630
SPEAKER_0:  It is, but I mean, I think, at least the way I think about it is.

00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:30,558
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:36:30,786 --> 00:36:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  What are the things even within our own society?

00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,422
SPEAKER_0:  where we choose to do.

00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  something with our resources.

00:36:37,602 --> 00:36:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  that actually doesn't help the lives of many people.

00:36:40,386 --> 00:36:48,638
SPEAKER_0:  So we invest in all kinds of things that are often because someone is lobbying for them. This happens on both sides of the aisle. This is not a political statement, right?

00:36:49,026 --> 00:36:51,006
SPEAKER_0:  rather than saying, you know, if we invested.

00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  A little more of our money, really a little more, we can make sure every child in this country had decent healthcare.

00:36:57,218 --> 00:36:58,878
SPEAKER_0:  We can make sure every child in this country.

00:36:59,362 --> 00:37:02,014
SPEAKER_0:  had what they needed to start life healthy.

00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:07,070
SPEAKER_0:  uh... and that would not requires to sacrifice a lot but it would require us to sacrifice

00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  A few things.

00:37:09,154 --> 00:37:12,958
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, there's a balance there. And I also noticed the passive aggressive.

00:37:13,346 --> 00:37:16,721
SPEAKER_1:  statement you're making about how I'm spending my money.

00:37:16,721 --> 00:37:18,221
SPEAKER_0:  Me too. Spending it.

00:37:18,221 --> 00:37:18,971
SPEAKER_1:  little more watch

00:37:18,971 --> 00:37:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  I like to eat nice meals at nice restaurants, so I'm as guilty of this as you are.

00:37:27,394 --> 00:37:29,269
SPEAKER_1:  I got a couch and that couch says.

00:37:29,269 --> 00:37:34,519
SPEAKER_0:  It looks nice though. No, it's a nice looking cow. It's actually very clean. I got it for-

00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:36,830
SPEAKER_1:  occasional Instagram photos to look like an adult.

00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:37,470
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

00:37:38,434 --> 00:37:40,766
SPEAKER_1:  because everything else in my life is a giant mess.

00:37:42,914 --> 00:37:45,502
SPEAKER_1:  What role did the ideas at the founding documents?

00:37:46,018 --> 00:37:48,062
SPEAKER_1:  of this country play in this war.

00:37:48,578 --> 00:37:51,006
SPEAKER_1:  the war between the Union and the Confederate states.

00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:57,406
SPEAKER_1:  and the founding ideas that were supposed to be unifying to this country. Is there interesting tensions there?

00:37:57,634 --> 00:38:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  Well, there were certainly tensions because built into the founding documents, of course, is slavery.

00:38:02,594 --> 00:38:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  and inequality and women's exclusion from voting and things of that sort.

00:38:06,722 --> 00:38:09,214
SPEAKER_0:  uh... but the real brilliance of abraham lincoln

00:38:09,986 --> 00:38:12,190
SPEAKER_0:  is to build on the brilliance of the founders.

00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  and turn the union position into the defense of the core ideas of the country.

00:38:18,466 --> 00:38:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  So, the Confederacy is defending one idea.

00:38:21,314 --> 00:38:22,142
SPEAKER_0:  The idea of slavery.

00:38:23,394 --> 00:38:23,934
SPEAKER_0:  Lincoln

00:38:24,322 --> 00:38:27,742
SPEAKER_0:  takes the basket of all the deeper ideas and puts them together.

00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  three things the war is about for Lincoln. And this is why his speeches still resonate with us today. Every time I'm in Washington, I go to the Lincoln Memorial.

00:38:35,682 --> 00:38:39,102
SPEAKER_0:  It's the best memorial, the best monument, I think in the world actually.

00:38:39,586 --> 00:38:40,638
SPEAKER_0:  And, um...

00:38:41,058 --> 00:38:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  There are always people there.

00:38:43,202 --> 00:38:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  reading.

00:38:44,226 --> 00:38:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  Gettysburg Address and the second inaugural.

00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  Lincoln had two years of education yet he found the words to describe what our country was about better than anyone and it's because he went back to these

00:38:53,922 --> 00:38:56,542
SPEAKER_0:  founding values, three values, we already talked about one, freedom.

00:38:58,114 --> 00:39:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  that and freedom is actually complex, but it's also simple.

00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  the simple Lincoln definition.

00:39:04,674 --> 00:39:08,190
SPEAKER_0:  is that freedom is the right of each person to work for himself.

00:39:09,026 --> 00:39:09,630
SPEAKER_0:  or herself.

00:39:10,146 --> 00:39:11,678
SPEAKER_0:  Which is to say, it doesn't mean you own your own company.

00:39:12,034 --> 00:39:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  It means you control your labor.

00:39:14,338 --> 00:39:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  and no one can tell you you have to work for a certain wage.

00:39:17,794 --> 00:39:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  You might not have a job, but you decide.

00:39:20,162 --> 00:39:22,590
SPEAKER_0:  you decide, right? You can see where that comes from his own background.

00:39:23,074 --> 00:39:26,046
SPEAKER_0:  as a poor man, right? So freedom is control of your own labor.

00:39:27,042 --> 00:39:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  Second, democracy.

00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  government of the people by the people for the people.

00:39:31,266 --> 00:39:33,342
SPEAKER_0:  The government is to serve the people, to come from the people.

00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,870
SPEAKER_0:  And then the third point.

00:39:36,386 --> 00:39:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  justice in helping all human beings.

00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  He at the end of his life.

00:39:41,218 --> 00:39:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  as the Civil War is ending.

00:39:42,594 --> 00:39:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  He never declares that the South should be punished.

00:39:46,402 --> 00:39:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  His argument is that we shouldn't apologize for their misdeeds.

00:39:50,626 --> 00:39:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  but that all should be part of this future. He's not arguing for consensus. He's arguing for...

00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  a society where everyone has a stake going forward.

00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,358
SPEAKER_0:  So justice.

00:39:59,586 --> 00:40:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  democracy freedom.

00:40:01,058 --> 00:40:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  Those are the gifts.

00:40:03,586 --> 00:40:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  I talked about the flaws in our system, those are the-

00:40:06,178 --> 00:40:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  the virtues in our system that our founders.

00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  coming out of the Enlightenment.

00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:13,758
SPEAKER_0:  and Lincoln carries them forward. He gives us the 2.0 version.

00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  of them.

00:40:15,394 --> 00:40:20,030
SPEAKER_1:  So a few tangent questions about each of those. The one on democracy.

00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:25,246
SPEAKER_1:  Um, people often bring up the United States is not a democracy. It's a republic.

00:40:25,858 --> 00:40:31,038
SPEAKER_1:  uh... that this representative is there some interesting tensions there in terminology or is

00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,398
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, can you maybe kind of expand on the?

00:40:34,722 --> 00:40:36,702
SPEAKER_1:  different versions of democracy.

00:40:37,346 --> 00:40:40,286
SPEAKER_1:  So the philosophy of democracy, but also the practical implementations of it.

00:40:40,866 --> 00:40:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  Sure, the founders intended for us to be a democracy. This argument that they want us to be a republic instead of a democracy is one of these made up myths.

00:40:48,706 --> 00:40:50,046
SPEAKER_0:  uh... they believed

00:40:50,498 --> 00:40:52,478
SPEAKER_0:  that fundamentally what they were creating.

00:40:52,994 --> 00:40:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  was a society very few of which had existed before.

00:40:56,258 --> 00:41:03,070
SPEAKER_0:  a society where the government would be of the people by the people for the people. That's what they expected, right? That's what I meant. So the legitimacy.

00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  of our government was not going to be that the person in charge

00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,454
SPEAKER_0:  was of royal blood.

00:41:08,034 --> 00:41:09,118
SPEAKER_0:  That's what Europeans did it.

00:41:09,378 --> 00:41:10,686
SPEAKER_0:  Order the person in charge.

00:41:11,522 --> 00:41:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  killed enough people, a la Genghis Khan, or that the person in charge...

00:41:16,066 --> 00:41:21,214
SPEAKER_0:  uh... was serving a particular class it was that the person in charge the institutions were to serve

00:41:21,602 --> 00:41:22,142
SPEAKER_0:  The people.

00:41:22,498 --> 00:41:25,214
SPEAKER_0:  they adopted Republican tools to get there.

00:41:26,146 --> 00:41:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  because they were fearful appropriately.

00:41:29,602 --> 00:41:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  of simply throwing every issue up to the masses.

00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  Democracy is not mob rule.

00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:38,270
SPEAKER_0:  Democracy is where you create procedures.

00:41:38,786 --> 00:41:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  to assess the public will.

00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  and to act in ways that serve the public.

00:41:44,194 --> 00:41:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  without harming other elements of the public that are not in the majority.

00:41:48,098 --> 00:41:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  That's why we have a constitution and a bill of rights.

00:41:50,754 --> 00:41:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  and it that for their time the founders did not believe that women should be part of this discussion that they were not capable.

00:41:56,738 --> 00:42:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  They were wrong about that in their time, that's how they thought. We've of course changed that.

00:42:00,898 --> 00:42:02,366
SPEAKER_0:  They believed you had to have property.

00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  to have a steak.

00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  We don't believe that anymore. So we can argue over the details and, and those 50 years from now will criticize us right for the way we think about these things.

00:42:12,482 --> 00:42:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  but it was fundamentally about

00:42:14,434 --> 00:42:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  This is the radicalism of the American experiment.

00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  that government should serve the people.

00:42:20,194 --> 00:42:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  all people.

00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:26,270
SPEAKER_1:  So democracy means of the people, by the people, for the people, and then it doesn't actually.

00:42:27,522 --> 00:42:30,897
SPEAKER_1:  give any details of how you implement that because you could implement all kinds of

00:42:30,897 --> 00:42:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  voice. And I think what we've learned as historians, I think what the founders knew, because they were very well read in the history of Rome and Greece.

00:42:36,738 --> 00:42:40,446
SPEAKER_0:  was that democracy will always have unique characteristics for the culture that it's in.

00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:42:42,562 --> 00:42:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  If coming out of the war against Russia, Ukraine is able to build a better democracy than it before.

00:42:47,618 --> 00:42:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  It's never gonna look like the United States.

00:42:50,338 --> 00:42:51,902
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not saying this is going to be worse or better.

00:42:52,354 --> 00:42:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  A culture matters, the particular history of societies.

00:42:55,874 --> 00:42:59,134
SPEAKER_0:  matters. Japan is a vibrant democracy.

00:42:59,522 --> 00:43:03,518
SPEAKER_0:  I've been there many times. It does not look at all like the American.

00:43:03,874 --> 00:43:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  democracy. So democracy is a set of values.

00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:14,110
SPEAKER_0:  The implementation of those values is a set of practical institutional decisions one makes based on one's cultural.

00:43:14,498 --> 00:43:15,038
SPEAKER_0:  position.

00:43:15,298 --> 00:43:18,494
SPEAKER_1:  So just the one on that topic is there, if you do representative.

00:43:18,754 --> 00:43:19,358
SPEAKER_1:  You said like...

00:43:20,002 --> 00:43:21,470
SPEAKER_1:  You know, democracy should not.

00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:22,878
SPEAKER_1:  One failure.

00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:24,894
SPEAKER_1:  Mode is Mob Rule.

00:43:25,986 --> 00:43:29,438
SPEAKER_1:  So it should not descend into that. Not every issue should be up to everybody. Correct.

00:43:29,698 --> 00:43:31,102
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so you have representation.

00:43:31,618 --> 00:43:33,470
SPEAKER_1:  but you know.

00:43:34,338 --> 00:43:35,166
SPEAKER_1:  Stalin.

00:43:35,778 --> 00:43:36,702
SPEAKER_1:  Similarly.

00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:40,094
SPEAKER_1:  felt that he could represent the interests of the public.

00:43:40,386 --> 00:43:41,662
SPEAKER_1:  He was also helping

00:43:41,954 --> 00:43:45,598
SPEAKER_1:  represent the interest of the public. So that's a failure mode too.

00:43:45,954 --> 00:43:49,534
SPEAKER_1:  the if if the people representing the public become more more powerful

00:43:50,146 --> 00:43:51,838
SPEAKER_1:  they start becoming detached.

00:43:52,706 --> 00:43:57,598
SPEAKER_1:  from actually being able to represent or having just a basic human sense of what the public wants.

00:43:57,794 --> 00:44:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  I think being of the people, by the people, for the people.

00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:03,262
SPEAKER_0:  means you are in some way accountable to the

00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  and the problem with the communist party of the Soviet Union.

00:44:06,914 --> 00:44:08,830
SPEAKER_0:  This was already evident before Stalin.

00:44:09,186 --> 00:44:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  came into power.

00:44:10,306 --> 00:44:12,862
SPEAKER_0:  is the same problem the Communist Party of China has today.

00:44:13,378 --> 00:44:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  which is that you have leadership that's non-accountable.

00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:25,438
SPEAKER_1:  Well, let me go then to one of the other three principles of freedom, because one of the ways to keep government accountable is the freedom of the press.

00:44:26,338 --> 00:44:30,526
SPEAKER_1:  So there's the internet and on the internet there's social networks and one of them is

00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:33,758
SPEAKER_1:  call Twitter, I think you have an account there, people should follow you.

00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:36,126
SPEAKER_1:  And recently people have been.

00:44:36,418 --> 00:44:37,630
SPEAKER_1:  throwing around recently.

00:44:37,954 --> 00:44:40,190
SPEAKER_1:  for a while the words of freedom of speech.

00:44:40,834 --> 00:44:41,278
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:44:41,634 --> 00:44:46,622
SPEAKER_1:  Just out of curiosity, for tangent upon a tangent, what do you think of-

00:44:46,978 --> 00:44:48,702
SPEAKER_1:  Freedom of Speech, as it is today.

00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:53,918
SPEAKER_1:  And as it was at that time during the civil war, after the civil war and throughout the history of America.

00:44:54,402 --> 00:44:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  So freedom of speeches.

00:44:55,842 --> 00:44:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  always been one of the core tenets of American democracy.

00:44:59,362 --> 00:45:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm near absolutist on it.

00:45:01,506 --> 00:45:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  Because I think that people should have the right to speak what what makes our democracy function

00:45:08,962 --> 00:45:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  is that there is always room for

00:45:11,522 --> 00:45:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  Quite frankly, people like you and me.

00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  who like to disagree.

00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:17,694
SPEAKER_0:  and have reasons to disagree.

00:45:18,242 --> 00:45:23,166
SPEAKER_0:  So I am against almost all forms of censorship. The only time I believe in censorship...

00:45:23,522 --> 00:45:31,678
SPEAKER_0:  is if somehow an individual or a newspaper has stolen the Ukrainian plans for their next military movements in the next week.

00:45:32,066 --> 00:45:33,758
SPEAKER_0:  You should not be able to publish that.

00:45:34,306 --> 00:45:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  right now maybe after they act but yeah criticism opinion interpretation should be wide open

00:45:41,122 --> 00:45:44,926
SPEAKER_0:  Now, that doesn't mean, though, that...

00:45:45,346 --> 00:45:47,966
SPEAKER_0:  you have the right to come to my classroom.

00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:53,310
SPEAKER_0:  and start shouting and saying whatever you want. Yeah. Right on the street corner to do that.

00:45:54,146 --> 00:45:55,166
SPEAKER_0:  But my classroom...

00:45:55,554 --> 00:45:58,179
SPEAKER_0:  is a classroom for my students with a particular purpose.

00:45:58,179 --> 00:46:13,749
SPEAKER_1:  Sorry about that from last week. I'll never do it again. I apologize. I'm really sorry. It's okay. Never happened. I get drunk. So the people who don't know you're a professor at UT Austin, it's just, it's nearby. So sometimes I get a little drunk and wander in there. I apologize.

00:46:13,749 --> 00:46:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  Not the only one. Was that you? I didn't even know it was you. Oh, sorry. Okay.

00:46:18,466 --> 00:46:19,838
SPEAKER_0:  The point is that...

00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  Free speech is not licensed to invade.

00:46:23,234 --> 00:46:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  someone else's space and I also believe in private enterprise. So I think that

00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  You know, if I owned a social media network, I don't.

00:46:33,122 --> 00:46:35,422
SPEAKER_0:  It would be up to me to decide.

00:46:36,194 --> 00:46:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  who gets to speak on that network and who doesn't, and then people could decide not to use it.

00:46:41,154 --> 00:46:41,918
SPEAKER_0:  They don't want to use it.

00:46:42,434 --> 00:46:45,470
SPEAKER_1:  But there's a, so yes, that's one of the founding principles. So.

00:46:45,698 --> 00:46:49,342
SPEAKER_1:  often does he talk about censorship does government censorship.

00:46:49,634 --> 00:46:52,094
SPEAKER_1:  So social media, if you run a social media.

00:46:52,322 --> 00:46:54,078
SPEAKER_1:  company you should be able to decide.

00:46:54,434 --> 00:46:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  from a technical perspective of what freedom of speech means. But there's some deeper ethical philosophical.

00:47:00,322 --> 00:47:01,150
SPEAKER_1:  sense of...

00:47:01,442 --> 00:47:01,950
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:47:02,562 --> 00:47:04,158
SPEAKER_1:  How do you create a world where...

00:47:04,962 --> 00:47:08,862
SPEAKER_1:  Every voice is heard of the people by the people for the people. That's not a-

00:47:09,858 --> 00:47:11,582
SPEAKER_1:  That's a complicated technical problem.

00:47:12,002 --> 00:47:13,342
SPEAKER_1:  when you have a public square.

00:47:13,666 --> 00:47:15,230
SPEAKER_1:  How do you have a productive conversation?

00:47:15,522 --> 00:47:17,502
SPEAKER_1:  where critics aren't silenced but the same.

00:47:17,954 --> 00:47:20,254
SPEAKER_1:  whoever has the bigger megaphone is not gonna

00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:21,694
SPEAKER_1:  Proud of everybody else.

00:47:22,146 --> 00:47:26,174
SPEAKER_0:  So I think it's very important to create rules of the game.

00:47:26,562 --> 00:47:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  that'll give everyone a chance to get started.

00:47:29,058 --> 00:47:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  and that allow for guideposts to be created from the will of the community, which is to say.

00:47:36,738 --> 00:47:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  that we as a community can say we can't stop people from speaking.

00:47:41,602 --> 00:47:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  but we as a community can say that in certain forms, we're going to create certain rules.

00:47:46,402 --> 00:47:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  who gets to speak and who doesn't under what terms.

00:47:49,186 --> 00:47:53,502
SPEAKER_0:  but they can still have somewhere else to go. So I believe in opening space for everyone.

00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:57,022
SPEAKER_0:  but creating certain spaces within those spaces.

00:47:57,634 --> 00:48:00,414
SPEAKER_0:  that are designed for certain purposes. That's what a school does.

00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  So I will not bring someone to speak to my students.

00:48:04,962 --> 00:48:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  Who is unqualified?

00:48:06,786 --> 00:48:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  It's not a political judgment.

00:48:08,322 --> 00:48:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  the rules at a university.

00:48:09,858 --> 00:48:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  are we're an educational institution you need to have the educational credentials to come speak about artificial intelligence i'm not going to bring some

00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  bum off the street to do that, right? We have certain rules, but that bum on the street can still...

00:48:21,378 --> 00:48:27,230
SPEAKER_0:  in his own space or her own space can still say what he or she wants to say about artificial intelligence. This is how newspapers work.

00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:30,206
SPEAKER_0:  When I write for the New York Times, they have an editorial.

00:48:30,882 --> 00:48:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  Team?

00:48:31,586 --> 00:48:34,814
SPEAKER_0:  The editorial team makes certain decisions. They check facts.

00:48:35,458 --> 00:48:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  uh... and there's certain points of view they don't allow anti-semitic comments

00:48:40,162 --> 00:48:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  You're not going to be able to publish an anti-Semitic screed, whether you think it's true or not true.

00:48:45,538 --> 00:48:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  in the New York Times, but that doesn't prevent you from finding somewhere else.

00:48:49,186 --> 00:48:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  So we allow entities to create certain rules of the game. We make transparent what those rules are.

00:48:55,426 --> 00:48:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  and then we as citizens know where to go to get our information what's

00:48:58,562 --> 00:49:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  What's been a problem the last few decades, I think, is it hasn't been clear.

00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  what the rules are in different places, and what are the legitimate places to get information.

00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:16,350
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, the transparency seems to be very critical there. Even for the New York Times, I think there's a lot of skepticism about which way the editorial processes lean.

00:49:16,674 --> 00:49:18,462
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, there's a public perception that it's...

00:49:18,978 --> 00:49:22,974
SPEAKER_1:  especially for opinions, is going to be very left leaning in the New York Times.

00:49:23,554 --> 00:49:23,998
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:49:24,258 --> 00:49:25,566
SPEAKER_1:  without transparency.

00:49:26,274 --> 00:49:28,766
SPEAKER_1:  about what the process is like about the people involved.

00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:31,646
SPEAKER_1:  All you do, like, conspiracy theories and...

00:49:32,034 --> 00:49:35,646
SPEAKER_1:  And the general public opinion about that is going to go wild.

00:49:36,418 --> 00:49:36,766
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:49:37,218 --> 00:49:42,014
SPEAKER_1:  I think that's okay for the New York Times people can in a collective way figure stuff out

00:49:42,434 --> 00:49:43,966
SPEAKER_1:  Like they could say, okay, New York Times.

00:49:44,546 --> 00:49:50,750
SPEAKER_1:  uh... seventy three percent of the time is going to lean left in their head to have like a loose estimation or whatever

00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:51,422
SPEAKER_1:  uh.

00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:54,526
SPEAKER_1:  But for a platform like Twitter, it seems like they're...

00:49:55,298 --> 00:49:56,638
SPEAKER_1:  It's more complicated.

00:49:57,026 --> 00:49:59,550
SPEAKER_1:  of course it should be rules of the game but i think there's uh...

00:50:00,738 --> 00:50:02,622
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe I want to say a responsibility.

00:50:02,882 --> 00:50:04,670
SPEAKER_1:  to also create incentives.

00:50:05,154 --> 00:50:06,398
SPEAKER_1:  for people to do.

00:50:07,202 --> 00:50:09,374
SPEAKER_1:  High effort, empathetic debate.

00:50:10,274 --> 00:50:11,134
SPEAKER_1:  versus

00:50:11,586 --> 00:50:12,926
SPEAKER_1:  throwing poop at each other. YEAH!

00:50:13,186 --> 00:50:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  I think those are two slightly different things, so I agree.

00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:17,022
SPEAKER_0:  I think that.

00:50:17,442 --> 00:50:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  My view is that the failure of Facebook and Twitter and others in recent years.

00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:25,950
SPEAKER_0:  has been that they have been completely untransparent about their rules.

00:50:26,402 --> 00:50:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:50:26,978 --> 00:50:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  What I would-

00:50:27,842 --> 00:50:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  think would advance us.

00:50:30,018 --> 00:50:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  is if they had a set of rules that were clear, that were consistently followed.

00:50:34,658 --> 00:50:36,094
SPEAKER_0:  and we understood what they were.

00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:38,814
SPEAKER_0:  That would also tell us as consumers.

00:50:39,586 --> 00:50:40,222
SPEAKER_0:  how much.

00:50:40,514 --> 00:50:41,662
SPEAKER_0:  what the biases are.

00:50:41,986 --> 00:50:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  how to understand what's going on. It seems if I might say that since Elon Musk has taken over Twitter, it's been arbitrary who's thrown off and who's not thrown off.

00:50:49,186 --> 00:50:51,614
SPEAKER_0:  whisper and and that's a that's a real problem arbitrariness

00:50:51,874 --> 00:50:53,726
SPEAKER_0:  is in some ways the opposite of democracy.

00:50:54,274 --> 00:50:55,134
SPEAKER_1:  But there's also...

00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,246
SPEAKER_1:  a hidden arbitrariness.

00:50:57,858 --> 00:50:58,782
SPEAKER_1:  in a

00:50:59,618 --> 00:51:01,918
SPEAKER_1:  interpretation of the rules. So for example,

00:51:02,722 --> 00:51:04,606
SPEAKER_1:  What comment incites violence?

00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,830
SPEAKER_1:  That's really, really difficult to figure out to me. Like, there's a gray area.

00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:11,550
SPEAKER_1:  Obviously there's very clear versions of that.

00:51:12,514 --> 00:51:15,454
SPEAKER_1:  If I know anything about people that try to incite violence.

00:51:15,874 --> 00:51:16,766
SPEAKER_1:  They're usually not.

00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:19,742
SPEAKER_1:  coming out and clearly saying it. They're usually kind of.

00:51:20,162 --> 00:51:20,990
SPEAKER_1:  dog whistling it.

00:51:21,346 --> 00:51:25,790
SPEAKER_1:  And same with racism and anti-Semitism, all of that. It's usually dog whistles. Like packing a fucking son of a bitch.

00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  and they usually...

00:51:27,842 --> 00:51:35,646
SPEAKER_1:  I have fun playing with the rules, playing around the rules. So it's a great area. Same with during COVID, misinformation. What's misinformation, right?

00:51:36,034 --> 00:51:48,926
SPEAKER_0:  I agree. And some of these are age old problems. Our legal system, common law, has been struggling with what is incitement to violence since the first Supreme Court decisions in the 18th century. So you're absolutely right.

00:51:49,218 --> 00:51:50,110
SPEAKER_0:  But I will say this.

00:51:50,562 --> 00:51:52,670
SPEAKER_0:  there are certain things that are clearly incitement to violence.

00:51:53,282 --> 00:51:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  I'll give you very clear examples.

00:51:56,002 --> 00:51:59,166
SPEAKER_0:  I'll just make it personal, right? My wife is an elected official here in Austin.

00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  There have been people who have put things up on Twitter.

00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:05,022
SPEAKER_0:  Calling for her to be hanged or calling for her to be attacked.

00:52:05,442 --> 00:52:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  that's incitement of violence when you specifically call for violence against them

00:52:10,274 --> 00:52:12,254
SPEAKER_0:  I agree there's a lot of other stuff where it's a gray area.

00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,630
SPEAKER_0:  But we could start.

00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:16,190
SPEAKER_0:  if we're applying these rules.

00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:19,294
SPEAKER_0:  by getting that material off of these sites.

00:52:19,426 --> 00:52:20,254
SPEAKER_1:  So some of that.

00:52:20,482 --> 00:52:23,646
SPEAKER_1:  is a problem of scale too, but the gray area is still...

00:52:24,354 --> 00:52:27,614
SPEAKER_1:  forever problem that we may never be able to solve and maybe

00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  the tension within the gray area is the very process of democracy.

00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:34,046
SPEAKER_1:  but saying like we need to take our country back.

00:52:35,266 --> 00:52:36,391
SPEAKER_1:  Is that incitement of violence?

00:52:36,391 --> 00:52:38,846
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think that. I think we need to take our country back. Just that? No.

00:52:39,714 --> 00:52:43,089
SPEAKER_0:  But then, you know, because I might say that I might say we need to take care. I said it all the time.

00:52:43,089 --> 00:52:45,749
SPEAKER_1:  I go again. I walk around drunk just screaming

00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  everybody.

00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:57,278
SPEAKER_0:  I thought you wanted, I wanted to take you back. Exactly. I was very confused. My messaging needs to work. But let's go to the January 6th example, right? To say, hang Mike Pence, that's incitement to violence.

00:52:57,954 --> 00:52:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:52:58,978 --> 00:52:59,486
SPEAKER_0:  to say.

00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  Go get Nancy.

00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:03,486
SPEAKER_0:  That's incitement to violence.

00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:08,286
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, yeah, it's very clear. I, again, I don't think that's the big problem. The big problem is the gray area.

00:53:08,578 --> 00:53:09,022
SPEAKER_1:  But yeah.

00:53:09,698 --> 00:53:15,582
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, and the other problem is just how to get, how to technically find the large scale of

00:53:15,842 --> 00:53:17,758
SPEAKER_1:  comments and posts and so on.

00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:18,558
SPEAKER_1:  that are.

00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:19,975
SPEAKER_1:  doing this kind of clear

00:53:19,975 --> 00:53:23,725
SPEAKER_0:  something for you to solve. You're the... I understand. I mean, don't ask me those questions.

00:53:23,725 --> 00:53:24,798
SPEAKER_1:  I have to say

00:53:25,058 --> 00:53:32,030
SPEAKER_1:  Some of that is motivation some of that is vision and some of that is execution so for example just to go out briefly on a dark topic

00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:33,278
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

00:53:33,602 --> 00:53:35,486
SPEAKER_1:  Something I've recently became aware of is...

00:53:36,866 --> 00:53:37,470
SPEAKER_1:  Facebook.

00:53:37,858 --> 00:53:39,326
SPEAKER_1:  and twitter and so on people post

00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:42,654
SPEAKER_1:  violence on there, like little videos of violence.

00:53:43,042 --> 00:53:43,774
SPEAKER_1:  Child porn.

00:53:44,162 --> 00:53:44,510
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:53:44,962 --> 00:53:47,230
SPEAKER_1:  some of the darkest things in this world.

00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,150
SPEAKER_1:  and to find them at scale.

00:53:49,762 --> 00:53:50,974
SPEAKER_1:  is a difficult problem.

00:53:51,778 --> 00:53:52,254
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:53:52,482 --> 00:53:54,718
SPEAKER_1:  to act in it aggressively is a difficult problem.

00:53:55,202 --> 00:53:55,998
SPEAKER_1:  but uh...

00:53:58,210 --> 00:53:58,814
SPEAKER_1:  I think.

00:53:59,554 --> 00:54:03,806
SPEAKER_1:  Part of this motivation, like saying, this is a big problem. We need to take this on. We need to...

00:54:04,066 --> 00:54:10,142
SPEAKER_1:  uh... find all the darkest aspects of human nature that rise and appear in our platform and remove them

00:54:10,402 --> 00:54:11,582
SPEAKER_1:  so that we can create.

00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  a place like for it.

00:54:13,762 --> 00:54:21,150
SPEAKER_1:  humanity to flourish through the process of conversation. But it's just hard, it's just really hard. When you look at millions of posts, trillions of interactions,

00:54:21,538 --> 00:54:24,222
SPEAKER_1:  It's wild, with like the amount of data.

00:54:24,738 --> 00:54:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  But where we are now with-

00:54:26,338 --> 00:54:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  with social media seemed wild and impossible five years ago, right? Yes. I actually what frustrates me.

00:54:33,698 --> 00:54:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  is I think they're people who have politicized this issue in unnecessary ways.

00:54:37,666 --> 00:54:38,494
SPEAKER_0:  Everyone.

00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  regardless of their politics, should support what you just said.

00:54:42,082 --> 00:54:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  investing our money.

00:54:44,034 --> 00:54:46,206
SPEAKER_0:  maybe grants from the federal government.

00:54:46,626 --> 00:54:47,742
SPEAKER_0:  in AI.

00:54:48,002 --> 00:54:49,278
SPEAKER_0:  skilled people like you.

00:54:49,506 --> 00:54:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  figuring out ways to get violent videos.

00:54:52,194 --> 00:54:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  off of it. That shouldn't be political.

00:54:54,914 --> 00:54:59,134
SPEAKER_1:  Well, some of that also requires being transparent from a social media company perspective.

00:54:59,618 --> 00:55:01,790
SPEAKER_1:  and protrasperm in a way that really resists

00:55:02,114 --> 00:55:03,070
SPEAKER_1:  being political.

00:55:03,746 --> 00:55:07,294
SPEAKER_1:  to be able to be transparent about your fight against these.

00:55:08,162 --> 00:55:09,214
SPEAKER_1:  evils.

00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:12,734
SPEAKER_1:  while still not succumbing to the sort of the political.

00:55:13,186 --> 00:55:14,110
SPEAKER_1:  narratives of it.

00:55:14,562 --> 00:55:15,358
SPEAKER_1:  That's tricky.

00:55:15,714 --> 00:55:16,766
SPEAKER_1:  But you have to do that kind of...

00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:19,070
SPEAKER_1:  and walk calmly through the fire.

00:55:19,426 --> 00:55:21,918
SPEAKER_1:  That's what Twitter feels like if you're being political.

00:55:22,178 --> 00:55:26,303
SPEAKER_1:  It's like a firing squad from every side. As a leader, you have to kind of walk home.

00:55:26,303 --> 00:55:29,918
SPEAKER_0:  Right, and that is where we need a new generation.

00:55:30,466 --> 00:55:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  of people who will have diverse politics.

00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  but we'll stand up against that, right? I mean, that's the lesson from after the Civil War is where progress is made.

00:55:39,458 --> 00:55:41,406
SPEAKER_0:  The war doesn't solve problems or hate.

00:55:41,762 --> 00:55:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  Where progress is made is where you have local leaders and others who stand up and say, we can differ.

00:55:46,562 --> 00:55:47,998
SPEAKER_0:  but we're not going, we're going to stop.

00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  calling people from certain backgrounds monkeys, which was a common thing to do.

00:55:52,418 --> 00:55:55,166
SPEAKER_0:  that time. Jews are still called monkeys in certain places, right?

00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:56,702
SPEAKER_0:  uh... people have to stand up

00:55:56,962 --> 00:55:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  while still maintaining their political differences.

00:56:00,322 --> 00:56:02,494
SPEAKER_1:  Several hundred thousand people died.

00:56:03,362 --> 00:56:04,510
SPEAKER_1:  What made this war?

00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:05,598
SPEAKER_0:  Such a deadly war.

00:56:06,562 --> 00:56:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  It's extraordinary how many people died, more than half a million. And this was without a single automatic rifle, without a single bomb.

00:56:14,754 --> 00:56:17,438
SPEAKER_0:  It was mostly in hand-to-hand combat, which is to say.

00:56:17,986 --> 00:56:18,814
SPEAKER_0:  that these

00:56:19,266 --> 00:56:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  600,000 or so people who died, they died where the person who killed them was standing within a few feet of them.

00:56:25,538 --> 00:56:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  That's really hard.

00:56:26,978 --> 00:56:30,046
SPEAKER_0:  Most of the killing that happens in wars today is actually from a distance.

00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  It's by a drone, it's by a bomb, it's by a rocket.

00:56:33,186 --> 00:56:35,390
SPEAKER_0:  or buy an automatic weapon.

00:56:35,842 --> 00:56:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  And just to make this even more...

00:56:37,954 --> 00:56:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  focused.

00:56:38,946 --> 00:56:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  To this day, the deadliest day in American history was during the Civil War.

00:56:43,874 --> 00:56:45,854
SPEAKER_0:  September 1862 in Antietam.

00:56:46,498 --> 00:56:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  More than 22,000 Americans killed one another.

00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:56,190
SPEAKER_0:  uh... hand-to-hand there hasn't been a day that deadly in american history since that's amazing considering

00:56:56,482 --> 00:56:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  the technological changes.

00:56:58,434 --> 00:57:04,094
SPEAKER_1:  What was in the mind of those soldiers on each side? Was there conviction for ideas? Did they hate the other side?

00:57:04,738 --> 00:57:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  I think actually they were fighting out of fear.

00:57:08,322 --> 00:57:12,414
SPEAKER_0:  what we know from reading their letters, what we know from the accounts.

00:57:12,834 --> 00:57:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  is that yes, there are ideas that are.

00:57:15,874 --> 00:57:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  promoted to them to get them to the battlefield. They believe in what they're doing.

00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  But here it's the same as World War I, and I think the Civil War and World War I are very similar as wars.

00:57:25,058 --> 00:57:29,758
SPEAKER_0:  You are in these horrible conditions, you're attacked, and you have the chance to either

00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:31,422
SPEAKER_0:  kill the other side and live?

00:57:32,098 --> 00:57:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  or die.

00:57:33,442 --> 00:57:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  and you fight to live and you fight to save the people next to you.

00:57:38,338 --> 00:57:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  what is true about war, what is both good and dangerous about it.

00:57:42,146 --> 00:57:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  as you form an almost unparalleled bond.

00:57:45,634 --> 00:57:50,014
SPEAKER_0:  with those on your side. This is the men under arms scenario, right?

00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:53,502
SPEAKER_0:  And that's where the killing goes and it's a civil war which means...

00:57:53,922 --> 00:57:55,550
SPEAKER_0:  Sometimes it's brother against brother.

00:57:56,066 --> 00:57:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhhh...

00:57:56,962 --> 00:57:58,814
SPEAKER_0:  quite literally and what it teaches us.

00:57:59,426 --> 00:58:02,526
SPEAKER_0:  is how human beings can be put into fighting.

00:58:03,074 --> 00:58:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  and will commit enormous damage. And that's why this happens. It goes on for four years.

00:58:07,682 --> 00:58:08,126
SPEAKER_1:  and just

00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:10,654
SPEAKER_1:  the extensive research you've done.

00:58:11,522 --> 00:58:13,118
SPEAKER_1:  on this war for this book.

00:58:13,602 --> 00:58:14,654
SPEAKER_1:  What are some?

00:58:14,946 --> 00:58:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  some of the worst and some of the best aspects of human nature that you found.

00:58:19,618 --> 00:58:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  Like I said, brother against brother.

00:58:22,242 --> 00:58:23,198
SPEAKER_1:  That's pretty powerful.

00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:24,990
SPEAKER_0:  They're both, right?

00:58:25,218 --> 00:58:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  So the level of violence that human beings are capable of, how long they're able to sustain it.

00:58:29,826 --> 00:58:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  The South should not have, the Confederacy should not have lasted in this war as long as it did.

00:58:34,498 --> 00:58:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  By the end, I mean, there-

00:58:36,738 --> 00:58:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  They're starving.

00:58:38,178 --> 00:58:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  and they keep fighting.

00:58:39,906 --> 00:58:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  So the resilience in war of societies.

00:58:43,714 --> 00:58:44,574
SPEAKER_0:  And um...

00:58:45,282 --> 00:58:46,206
SPEAKER_0:  The power of hate.

00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  to move people.

00:58:48,034 --> 00:58:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  What are the bright sides?

00:58:49,666 --> 00:58:52,382
SPEAKER_0:  you see in Lincoln and Grant.

00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  who I talk about a lot in the book as well, Ulysses Grant.

00:58:55,266 --> 00:59:00,254
SPEAKER_0:  You see the ability of empathetic figures to still rise above this in spite of all the things we've seen.

00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:05,214
SPEAKER_0:  Lincoln went to visit more soldiers in war than any president ever.

00:59:06,402 --> 00:59:08,990
SPEAKER_0:  often at personal peril because he was close to the lines.

00:59:09,538 --> 00:59:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  And he connected. It wasn't propaganda.

00:59:12,098 --> 00:59:13,982
SPEAKER_0:  there weren't always reporters following him.

00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  He was able to build empathy in this context.

00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  And I think, as I said.

00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  war as horrible as it is often gives opportunities to certain groups.

00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  so African Americans, former slaves, are able to prove themselves as citizens.

00:59:29,154 --> 00:59:33,470
SPEAKER_0:  Jews did this, an enormous number in World War II. Henry Kissinger wrote about it before.

00:59:33,762 --> 00:59:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  he really only gets recognized as an american is a german jewish immigrant

00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:40,542
SPEAKER_0:  He's seen as an American because of his service in World War II.

00:59:41,058 --> 00:59:44,542
SPEAKER_0:  So the bright side of this is that often in the case of war...

00:59:44,866 --> 00:59:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  On your own side.

00:59:46,434 --> 00:59:48,510
SPEAKER_0:  you will let go of some of your prejudices.

00:59:49,122 --> 00:59:52,350
SPEAKER_0:  Ulysses Grant has a total transformation. He goes into the Civil War.

00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:55,102
SPEAKER_0:  an anti-semite and a racist.

00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  He comes out with actually very enlightened views because he sees

00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  what Jewish soldiers and what African American soldiers did.

01:00:02,242 --> 01:00:04,190
SPEAKER_1:  What's Ulysses Grant's story?

01:00:04,738 --> 01:00:06,078
SPEAKER_1:  what uh... what you learn from him

01:00:06,338 --> 01:00:08,254
SPEAKER_1:  Is he a hero or a villain of this war?

01:00:08,866 --> 01:00:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  I think he's a hero, though he's a flawed hero, as all heroes are.

01:00:12,898 --> 01:00:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:00:13,442 --> 01:00:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  He's a man from Ohio and Illinois.

01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  who was really a failed businessman time and again.

01:00:21,922 --> 01:00:22,558
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:00:22,882 --> 01:00:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  And, uh...

01:00:24,098 --> 01:00:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  had an ability.

01:00:26,114 --> 01:00:27,678
SPEAKER_0:  to command people in war.

01:00:28,002 --> 01:00:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  uh... where did this come from

01:00:29,442 --> 01:00:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  He was a clear communicator and an empathetic figure.

01:00:32,482 --> 01:00:33,662
SPEAKER_0:  He tended to drink too much.

01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  but he was the kind of person people wanted to follow. They trusted him.

01:00:38,882 --> 01:00:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  And so in battle, that became very important.

01:00:41,794 --> 01:00:43,710
SPEAKER_0:  And the second thing is he did his homework.

01:00:44,162 --> 01:00:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  He had a sense of the terrain, he had a sense of the environment he was operating in, and he was ruthless in pursuing what he had studied.

01:00:52,194 --> 01:00:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  so he turns out it

01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  battles as like Vicksburg and elsewhere.

01:00:55,874 --> 01:00:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  to actually undertake some pretty revolutionary maneuvers.

01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:03,166
SPEAKER_0:  Then he figures out that the advantage now.

01:01:03,458 --> 01:01:05,534
SPEAKER_0:  is on his side in numbers and he just...

01:01:05,986 --> 01:01:06,814
SPEAKER_0:  Houndly.

01:01:07,522 --> 01:01:11,710
SPEAKER_0:  pounds him to death, similar to what the United States does at the end of World War II with Germany.

01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:14,046
SPEAKER_0:  and Japan. He comes out of the war, Grant does.

01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:15,454
SPEAKER_0:  He's a believer in union.

01:01:15,778 --> 01:01:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  He wants to protect...

01:01:17,794 --> 01:01:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  Former Slaves

01:01:19,298 --> 01:01:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  and other groups and he tries to use the military for that purpose. He's limited.

01:01:23,522 --> 01:01:25,630
SPEAKER_0:  And then as president, he tries to do that as well.

01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  Right now, we still use many of the laws that were passed during Grant's presidency to prosecute insurrectionists. So the 900 or so people...

01:01:35,042 --> 01:01:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  who have been prosecuted for breaking into the Capitol attacking police on January 6th. Those insurrectionists.

01:01:41,378 --> 01:01:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  They've been prosecuted under the 1871 anti Ku Klux Klan.

01:01:45,986 --> 01:01:49,246
SPEAKER_0:  So that's a big accomplishment by Grant and we still benefit from it.

01:01:49,602 --> 01:01:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  The problem is Grant was not a great politician, unlike Lincoln.

01:01:53,506 --> 01:01:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  He didn't give.

01:01:54,562 --> 01:01:57,278
SPEAKER_0:  good speeches. He wasn't a persuasive figure.

01:01:57,506 --> 01:01:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  in a political space.

01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:02,398
SPEAKER_0:  And so he had trouble building support for what he was doing.

01:02:02,978 --> 01:02:04,734
SPEAKER_0:  even though he was trying to do.

01:02:05,026 --> 01:02:06,654
SPEAKER_0:  what in the end I think were the right things.

01:02:07,266 --> 01:02:09,141
SPEAKER_1:  What was the role of the KKK at that time?

01:02:09,141 --> 01:02:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  The Ku Klux Klan is formed at the end of the Civil War by Confederate veterans.

01:02:13,538 --> 01:02:19,966
SPEAKER_0:  first in Tennessee, in Pulaski, Tennessee, and then it spreads elsewhere, and there are other groups that are similar, the red shirts and various others.

01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  These are veterans of the Confederate Army.

01:02:24,482 --> 01:02:25,310
SPEAKER_0:  who come home.

01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:27,678
SPEAKER_0:  and are committed to continuing the war.

01:02:28,226 --> 01:02:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  They're gonna use their power at home.

01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:35,742
SPEAKER_0:  and their weapons to intimidate and if necessary kill people who challenge their authority.

01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  not just African Americans, Jews.

01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  Catholics.

01:02:39,362 --> 01:02:42,302
SPEAKER_0:  uh... various others they're going to basically protect

01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  the continued rule of the same families who owned the slaves before.

01:02:47,074 --> 01:02:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  in post slavery, Tennessee in post slavery.

01:02:50,402 --> 01:02:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  South Carolina.

01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  And when we get to voting...

01:02:53,378 --> 01:02:56,190
SPEAKER_0:  they're often the groups that are preventing people from voting.

01:02:56,706 --> 01:03:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  The white sheets and the ritual around that was all an effort to provide a certain ritualistic legitimacy.

01:03:04,706 --> 01:03:06,654
SPEAKER_0:  and hide identity though everyone knew.

01:03:06,978 --> 01:03:13,353
SPEAKER_1:  who they were. Also that whole brand, that whole practice was there from the very beginning. Have you studied the KKK's history a little bit?

01:03:13,353 --> 01:03:17,022
SPEAKER_0:  I have and there are a number of other historians who have too, so I've used their research as well.

01:03:17,538 --> 01:03:19,646
SPEAKER_1:  I'm kind of curious. I have to admit that.

01:03:19,906 --> 01:03:25,246
SPEAKER_1:  my knowledge of it is very kind of caricature knowledge. I'm sure there's interesting stories and threads because I think there's

01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:30,782
SPEAKER_1:  different competing organizations or something like that within the United States. And I feel like they...

01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:34,014
SPEAKER_1:  Through that lens, you can tell a story of the United States also.

01:03:34,594 --> 01:03:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  of these different, they're often business associations. I mean, there's a lot of work.

01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  showing that actually people join the KKK.

01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  for the reasons I just laid out, but also because it was networking for your business.

01:03:45,282 --> 01:03:49,278
SPEAKER_0:  you gain legitimacy in the area that you that you were in so this these were

01:03:50,082 --> 01:03:52,414
SPEAKER_0:  community groups that were formed to help.

01:03:52,802 --> 01:03:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  white business people, they helped white sheriffs get elected.

01:03:56,386 --> 01:03:59,902
SPEAKER_0:  What we have to understand today is when we're debating policing...

01:04:00,546 --> 01:04:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  This history matters enormously, right?

01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  I have nothing against-

01:04:04,738 --> 01:04:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  police. My cousin, one of my closest relatives, just retired from 25 years in the New York police department. Thank God he survived.

01:04:11,042 --> 01:04:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  I have deep respect, he's one of the best public servants I know.

01:04:14,082 --> 01:04:16,926
SPEAKER_0:  but what we also have to recognize as we respect police officers.

01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:18,526
SPEAKER_0:  is that for many communities.

01:04:19,394 --> 01:04:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  in our country.

01:04:20,578 --> 01:04:22,686
SPEAKER_0:  They know this history and the KKK

01:04:23,074 --> 01:04:28,894
SPEAKER_0:  in the 1870s and in the 1930s, you look at any KKK organization as I have in my research and you find

01:04:29,474 --> 01:04:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  police chiefs.

01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  Or are they KKK members?

01:04:32,482 --> 01:04:34,750
SPEAKER_0:  the local police officers, local judges.

01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:37,150
SPEAKER_0:  because it was how you became police chief.

01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:42,947
SPEAKER_1:  So these groups infiltrated some of the main institutions in our nation.

01:04:42,947 --> 01:04:45,918
SPEAKER_0:  I don't even think they infiltrated it. I think they were part of those institutions.

01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:48,894
SPEAKER_1:  The deeper question today in the 21st century is.

01:04:49,538 --> 01:04:55,163
SPEAKER_1:  One, how much of that is still there and how much of the history of that reverberates to the

01:04:55,163 --> 01:04:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  institutions. And I'm making the latter point that it's not there that much now.

01:04:59,202 --> 01:05:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  But people remember it.

01:05:00,738 --> 01:05:03,646
SPEAKER_1:  As some people would even say, it's not there at all.

01:05:04,098 --> 01:05:07,070
SPEAKER_1:  that there is not institutional racism and policing.

01:05:07,906 --> 01:05:08,542
SPEAKER_1:  but

01:05:08,866 --> 01:05:14,974
SPEAKER_1:  If that's the case, then you can also say that if there is not direct institutional racism there...

01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:18,142
SPEAKER_1:  What is it the echoes of history still have effects?

01:05:18,338 --> 01:05:24,158
SPEAKER_0:  Of course, and that's really important, and that we have to take that seriously. That's not an excuse for people then saying.

01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  nasty things about the police. But it is what we have to recognize. Look, I'm Jewish.

01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  And there are certain...

01:05:32,322 --> 01:05:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  elements of Russian behavior today I see in Ukraine that reverberate with the history of how

01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:41,406
SPEAKER_0:  My grandparents dealt with pogroms in Russia, right?

01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  Even though what Putin is doing in Ukraine might not technically be a pogrom.

01:05:46,338 --> 01:05:50,142
SPEAKER_0:  That history matters in how I view these issues. And that's a reality.

01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:52,670
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I had, I went to 7-Eleven recently.

01:05:54,018 --> 01:05:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  and uh...

01:05:55,298 --> 01:05:57,534
SPEAKER_1:  What did I eat? I ate one of their salads?

01:05:58,818 --> 01:06:00,094
SPEAKER_1:  I'm sorry, I love 7-Eleven.

01:06:00,418 --> 01:06:00,734
SPEAKER_1:  I'm sorry.

01:06:01,058 --> 01:06:04,414
SPEAKER_1:  ate one of the cells and got like terrible food poisoning.

01:06:04,674 --> 01:06:07,166
SPEAKER_1:  I was suffering for like four days and now I can't.

01:06:07,554 --> 01:06:09,886
SPEAKER_1:  I love 7-11, I love going to 7-11 late at night.

01:06:10,402 --> 01:06:14,302
SPEAKER_1:  in sweatpants and just I escaped the world. I'm listening to an audio book.

01:06:14,722 --> 01:06:16,478
SPEAKER_1:  And now every time I pass that salad.

01:06:17,186 --> 01:06:18,270
SPEAKER_1:  for the rest of my life.

01:06:18,818 --> 01:06:20,478
SPEAKER_1:  I would have hate for that salad.

01:06:20,994 --> 01:06:24,638
SPEAKER_1:  So history matters, even if the salad is no longer.

01:06:25,218 --> 01:06:28,542
SPEAKER_1:  have any bad stuff in it. It's probably the lettuce or something, whatever.

01:06:28,866 --> 01:06:29,502
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

01:06:29,922 --> 01:06:34,526
SPEAKER_1:  Mostly for humor's sake, but I'm also giving a kind of metaphor that

01:06:34,914 --> 01:06:35,582
SPEAKER_1:  Um

01:06:35,906 --> 01:06:36,414
SPEAKER_1:  History.

01:06:36,866 --> 01:06:37,758
SPEAKER_1:  can have.

01:06:38,082 --> 01:06:41,022
SPEAKER_1:  an individual and a large-scale society effect.

01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:42,974
SPEAKER_1:  on human interactions.

01:06:43,778 --> 01:06:44,894
SPEAKER_1:  both the good and the bad.

01:06:45,762 --> 01:06:47,390
SPEAKER_1:  if you actually recommended me offline.

01:06:47,682 --> 01:06:49,822
SPEAKER_1:  Books on the KKK. They'll be very happy to.

01:06:50,178 --> 01:06:53,310
SPEAKER_0:  There were a few mentioned in the footnotes in my book here.

01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:56,318
SPEAKER_1:  And also in part, because I also want to understand the

01:06:56,738 --> 01:07:01,342
SPEAKER_1:  white nationalism, white supremacists, christian supremacists, or christian nationalism.

01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:02,430
SPEAKER_1:  All those different.

01:07:02,722 --> 01:07:03,646
SPEAKER_1:  subgroups.

01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:05,630
SPEAKER_1:  in the United States and elsewhere in the world.

01:07:06,050 --> 01:07:06,590
SPEAKER_1:  a bit.

01:07:07,394 --> 01:07:12,382
SPEAKER_1:  my mind has been focused on some of the better aspects of human nature that it's nice to also understand

01:07:12,834 --> 01:07:14,398
SPEAKER_1:  some of the darker aspects.

01:07:14,722 --> 01:07:15,070
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:07:15,426 --> 01:07:17,694
SPEAKER_1:  Let me ask you sort of a personal question for me.

01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:19,454
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think it's possible?

01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:25,310
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think it's useful to do a podcast conversation with somebody like David Duke?

01:07:26,338 --> 01:07:26,846
SPEAKER_1:  or

01:07:27,266 --> 01:07:29,086
SPEAKER_1:  somebody.

01:07:29,666 --> 01:07:31,326
SPEAKER_1:  This was somebody that everybody knows.

01:07:32,258 --> 01:07:35,646
SPEAKER_1:  So it's not like you're giving a platform to somebody that's hidden.

01:07:36,354 --> 01:07:36,990
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:07:37,858 --> 01:07:44,158
SPEAKER_1:  member of the KKK or like a, it's a sort of putting a pretty face on some dark ideas, but everybody knows.

01:07:44,546 --> 01:07:46,014
SPEAKER_1:  And so now you're just exploring.

01:07:46,274 --> 01:07:48,478
SPEAKER_1:  You're sitting across the table, maybe not in his case.

01:07:48,962 --> 01:07:49,502
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

01:07:49,986 --> 01:07:52,414
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe somebody who's an active KKK member.

01:07:52,738 --> 01:07:54,622
SPEAKER_1:  sitting across from a person that.

01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:56,094
SPEAKER_1:  literally hates me.

01:07:56,898 --> 01:07:57,374
SPEAKER_1:  Lex.

01:07:57,666 --> 01:07:58,046
SPEAKER_1:  Mm-hmm.

01:07:58,370 --> 01:08:00,245
SPEAKER_1:  i think that's fascinating to explore them out

01:08:00,245 --> 01:08:00,638
SPEAKER_0:  I

01:08:00,898 --> 01:08:04,254
SPEAKER_0:  I think so long as what you are doing.

01:08:05,154 --> 01:08:05,758
SPEAKER_0:  is not.

01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  boosting someone, so taking an obscure figure.

01:08:09,410 --> 01:08:11,838
SPEAKER_0:  And making that figure now famous. Yes.

01:08:12,162 --> 01:08:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  But if it's someone who's already infamous

01:08:16,322 --> 01:08:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  and it helps us to understand them and as so long as your effort

01:08:20,418 --> 01:08:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  is to ask them tough questions, which you do.

01:08:22,978 --> 01:08:24,862
SPEAKER_0:  Right? You don't, you don't give them.

01:08:25,090 --> 01:08:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  All the questions in advance, you don't have limitations on what you can ask.

01:08:28,802 --> 01:08:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  So long as it is a real interview, not Pablum.

01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:43,390
SPEAKER_0:  then I'm for it. What I'm against is a softball interview that allows someone to sound reasonable when they're not. But the way I've seen you do this when you've had figures like that, I won't name who I have in mind, so when I've seen that...

01:08:43,682 --> 01:08:46,526
SPEAKER_0:  is I think that's useful because honestly.

01:08:46,946 --> 01:08:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  the historian in me and the citizen in me wants to understand.

01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:57,886
SPEAKER_0:  My Jewish grandfather always was the first to be against any effort to suppress anti-Semites.

01:08:58,530 --> 01:09:00,958
SPEAKER_0:  because his view was he wanted to know who they were.

01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:03,934
SPEAKER_0:  and he wanted to know what they thought so he could be prepared.

01:09:04,738 --> 01:09:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  And I also see like perhaps the historian.

01:09:10,082 --> 01:09:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  You may be able to appreciate this kind of thing. That's probably how you see the world, but.

01:09:14,402 --> 01:09:16,702
SPEAKER_1:  There's several ways to see a human being.

01:09:17,122 --> 01:09:18,590
SPEAKER_1:  like Vladimir Putin is an example.

01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:19,678
SPEAKER_1:  One is...

01:09:20,258 --> 01:09:21,342
SPEAKER_1:  A political figure?

01:09:21,794 --> 01:09:22,462
SPEAKER_1:  that's currently

01:09:23,714 --> 01:09:25,502
SPEAKER_1:  doing actions in the world.

01:09:25,762 --> 01:09:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  geopolitics internally, the politics of Russia.

01:09:28,578 --> 01:09:28,894
SPEAKER_1:  but...

01:09:29,218 --> 01:09:32,222
SPEAKER_1:  There is also that human being in a historical context.

01:09:33,026 --> 01:09:37,022
SPEAKER_1:  And collecting information about that person in the historical context is also very valuable.

01:09:37,538 --> 01:09:39,550
SPEAKER_1:  So you could see interviews with Hitler.

01:09:40,258 --> 01:09:43,326
SPEAKER_1:  in 39, 40, 41 as being.

01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:45,406
SPEAKER_1:  very bad and detrimental.

01:09:47,202 --> 01:09:51,870
SPEAKER_1:  to all that is good in the world. But at the same time, it's important to understand that human mind.

01:09:52,514 --> 01:09:57,694
SPEAKER_1:  how power affects that mind, how power corrupts it, how they see the world. Absolutely.

01:09:57,954 --> 01:10:02,750
SPEAKER_0:  Absolutely. I would be all in favor, and maybe he will, if Vladimir Putin would sit down with you.

01:10:03,330 --> 01:10:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  Absolutely. I don't think you're boosting someone like that when you ask them tough questions. In fact, I think that's what we need to do.

01:10:09,474 --> 01:10:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  Those sorts of figures tend to insulate themselves into some tough questions.

01:10:13,122 --> 01:10:15,518
SPEAKER_0:  So just to restate, I am for.

01:10:15,938 --> 01:10:23,006
SPEAKER_0:  the Lex Fridman interview of those sorts of figures. I am not for the puff piece on Fox and Friends.

01:10:23,522 --> 01:10:30,865
SPEAKER_0:  uh... where they just come on and they're asked always met that tell us what you think of this yes what you think of that

01:10:30,865 --> 01:10:32,958
SPEAKER_1:  So there's a balance there because...

01:10:33,986 --> 01:10:36,222
SPEAKER_1:  a lot of people they interview some of the clatter of Putin

01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:38,750
SPEAKER_1:  All they do is hard-hitting questions.

01:10:39,202 --> 01:10:47,678
SPEAKER_1:  They often demonstrate a lack of knowledge of the perspective of the Russian people and the president. This is not an empathy to understanding that this is a popularly elected.

01:10:48,098 --> 01:10:52,126
SPEAKER_1:  You can criticize that notion, but this is still the error that represents

01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:54,238
SPEAKER_1:  the beliefs of a large number of people.

01:10:54,466 --> 01:10:57,950
SPEAKER_1:  and they have their own life story, they see the world, they believe they're doing good for the world.

01:10:58,466 --> 01:10:59,262
SPEAKER_1:  And I don't.

01:10:59,842 --> 01:11:00,414
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,526
SPEAKER_1:  That idea.

01:11:03,298 --> 01:11:08,158
SPEAKER_1:  seems to not permeate the questions and the thoughts that people have said because they're afraid.

01:11:08,386 --> 01:11:10,494
SPEAKER_1:  of being attacked by the people back home.

01:11:10,786 --> 01:11:12,862
SPEAKER_1:  fellow journalists for not being hard enough.

01:11:13,058 --> 01:11:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  Well, maybe. I think that's probably true. I think in my experience with interviewers is that a lot of them are.

01:11:20,034 --> 01:11:21,909
SPEAKER_0:  lazy you're not which is why I like to talk

01:11:21,909 --> 01:11:22,590
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, the...

01:11:23,234 --> 01:11:26,142
SPEAKER_1:  Can I just say, okay, this is not you saying it. Can I just rant?

01:11:26,978 --> 01:11:29,118
SPEAKER_1:  If you're sitting across from Xi Jinping,

01:11:29,698 --> 01:11:30,494
SPEAKER_1:  Vladimir Putin

01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:31,518
SPEAKER_1:  You.

01:11:32,546 --> 01:11:37,246
SPEAKER_1:  You should be fired if you have not read at least several books on the guy.

01:11:37,858 --> 01:11:38,590
SPEAKER_1:  the fact

01:11:39,106 --> 01:11:43,998
SPEAKER_1:  surprising lack of research that people do leading up to it. So you need to be a historian.

01:11:44,482 --> 01:11:48,190
SPEAKER_1:  or a biographer. You need to be the kind of person that writes biographies or histories.

01:11:48,578 --> 01:11:52,158
SPEAKER_1:  before you sit in front of the person, not a...

01:11:52,482 --> 01:11:55,358
SPEAKER_1:  not a low effort journalist and it's so surprising to me.

01:11:55,810 --> 01:11:58,974
SPEAKER_1:  that I think they're probably really busy and it's probably not part of the culture.

01:11:59,394 --> 01:12:04,574
SPEAKER_1:  of the people that do interviews to do deep, deep, like investigative, you need to be the kind of person that.

01:12:04,898 --> 01:12:05,630
SPEAKER_1:  lives.

01:12:06,082 --> 01:12:15,550
SPEAKER_1:  that idea, like see it as a documentary that you work on for three years kind of thing. Anyway, of course some journalists do do that and they do that masterfully and that's the best of journalism.

01:12:15,906 --> 01:12:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  But I think a lot of the times when the questions are, as you said.

01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  out of touch with the society that person is leading.

01:12:22,850 --> 01:12:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  It's because the interviewer hasn't taken the time. And I understand.

01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  You can't be an expert on every subject, but you can do what you do, right? You read my book to prepare for this. You look things up. You had a sense.

01:12:33,954 --> 01:12:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  of the person you're talking to and you put the time in to do that.

01:12:37,506 --> 01:12:39,646
SPEAKER_0:  This is what I always tell my students, right?

01:12:39,906 --> 01:12:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  The secret to success in anything.

01:12:41,794 --> 01:12:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  is outworking other people. Be more prepared.

01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:52,643
SPEAKER_0:  Right? What you show is like an iceberg. It's the tip of the iceberg, right? Is what people see. It's all the work that goes on below the surface. And if you work hard, you'll be able to do that.

01:12:52,643 --> 01:12:54,462
SPEAKER_1:  hard enough which I aspired to do.

01:12:54,850 --> 01:13:02,001
SPEAKER_1:  At the end of the day, just like an animal farm, you'll be like the horse boxer and slaughtered unjustly by those that are much more p-

01:13:02,001 --> 01:13:04,638
SPEAKER_0:  par for the new but you'll be happy when you're slurred.

01:13:05,026 --> 01:13:09,470
SPEAKER_1:  You have lived for the right ideal and history will remember you fondly.

01:13:09,762 --> 01:13:10,110
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

01:13:10,338 --> 01:13:15,838
SPEAKER_1:  What about Robert Lee Lee? So he's the confederate generally that you mentioned. Yeah, was he a hero or villain?

01:13:15,938 --> 01:13:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  To me, he's a villain. Many people treat Robert E. Lee as a hero.

01:13:18,914 --> 01:13:20,254
SPEAKER_0:  of the points I make in the book.

01:13:20,738 --> 01:13:28,702
SPEAKER_0:  is we have to rethink that and it's very important for our society because Robert E. Lee pops up all over our society names of schools names of streets

01:13:29,026 --> 01:13:32,798
SPEAKER_0:  And he also embeds and justify certain behaviors that I think are really bad.

01:13:33,282 --> 01:13:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  Lee was a tremendous general.

01:13:35,714 --> 01:13:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  He had the weaker side and he managed to use maneuver, secrecy and circumstance.

01:13:42,018 --> 01:13:45,246
SPEAKER_0:  to give himself so many advantages and win so many battles he should have lost.

01:13:45,570 --> 01:13:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  So in terms of the technical general ship...

01:13:48,034 --> 01:13:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  He's a great general.

01:13:49,954 --> 01:13:51,998
SPEAKER_0:  But leave at the end of the war.

01:13:52,322 --> 01:13:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  never wants to really acknowledge defeat.

01:13:55,042 --> 01:13:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  what he acknowledges at Appomattox.

01:13:57,090 --> 01:14:02,206
SPEAKER_0:  is that his soldiers will have to leave the battlefield because they have not won on the battlefield.

01:14:02,594 --> 01:14:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  But he refuses.

01:14:04,258 --> 01:14:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  to do what Grant asks him.

01:14:05,954 --> 01:14:10,686
SPEAKER_0:  which is to help sell his side on the fact that we're going into a post-war moment.

01:14:11,266 --> 01:14:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  where they don't have to see themselves as losers.

01:14:13,826 --> 01:14:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  but they have to get on board with change.

01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  Real Leadership.

01:14:17,474 --> 01:14:18,782
SPEAKER_0:  is convincing people.

01:14:19,010 --> 01:14:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  who follow you that they have to change when they don't want to change.

01:14:22,498 --> 01:14:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  Lee refuses to do that.

01:14:24,354 --> 01:14:27,486
SPEAKER_0:  He says to Grant, I quote this in the book, He says to Grant at Appomattox,

01:14:27,842 --> 01:14:31,870
SPEAKER_0:  If you want to change the south, you have to run your army over the south three or four times.

01:14:32,642 --> 01:14:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  He's not going to do anything. He's not going to help.

01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  and he becomes a figure who people rally around.

01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:41,982
SPEAKER_0:  in the rest of his life and even after he dies.

01:14:42,338 --> 01:14:43,806
SPEAKER_0:  So it is as if.

01:14:44,674 --> 01:14:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  at the end of World War II.

01:14:47,874 --> 01:14:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  Hitler had been allowed to just retire.

01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  and he didn't go back into politics.

01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  But yet he was there and he continued to have meetings with former Nazis.

01:14:57,890 --> 01:15:03,870
SPEAKER_0:  and people would rally around the idea of bringing back or going back to Hitler's ideas. Think of how harmful that would be.

01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:07,550
SPEAKER_0:  Lee played that kind of role after the war.

01:15:07,938 --> 01:15:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  And I think it's one of the problems we have now. I don't think.

01:15:11,266 --> 01:15:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  we should continue to revere him because it justifies too much of what the confederates did.

01:15:17,794 --> 01:15:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  And that's the difference that you highlight between World War II and the Civil War, that in the case of Hitler, there was an end to that war. There's a very distinctive, clear end to that war. And you also…

01:15:28,578 --> 01:15:30,718
SPEAKER_1:  make the case that World War II is not.

01:15:31,074 --> 01:15:31,646
SPEAKER_1:  A good.

01:15:32,290 --> 01:15:34,686
SPEAKER_1:  Example, not a good model of a war.

01:15:35,042 --> 01:15:36,446
SPEAKER_1:  to help us analyze history.

01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  it's given americans the wrong idea what war is because world war two ends as most wars don't end world war two ends with a complete defeat

01:15:44,162 --> 01:15:48,414
SPEAKER_0:  of the German army and German society and the near complete defeat of Japan.

01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  and wear both sides in different ways.

01:15:51,906 --> 01:15:52,894
SPEAKER_0:  except defeat.

01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:57,278
SPEAKER_0:  What I'm pointing out in the book is that most wars don't accept with one side.

01:15:57,538 --> 01:15:59,230
SPEAKER_0:  Don't end with one side accepting defeat.

01:15:59,714 --> 01:16:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  and uh... generally the war continues after the battles and this is something that's hard for americans understand our system is built with the presumption wars over when we signed a piece of paper

01:16:08,802 --> 01:16:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  everyone can go home.

01:16:10,786 --> 01:16:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  It's not what happens.

01:16:12,002 --> 01:16:15,006
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, civil war is a special case, especially...

01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:22,755
SPEAKER_1:  I'm strong case of that because the people that fought the war still living in that land. That's exactly right. In this case, some of them are leaders.

01:16:22,755 --> 01:16:26,974
SPEAKER_0:  leaders also. Many of them become the leaders of the very areas that they were leading before.

01:16:27,522 --> 01:16:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  uh... and i think that's another lesson here too

01:16:30,178 --> 01:16:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  uh... that we did

01:16:31,394 --> 01:16:35,326
SPEAKER_0:  undertake after world war two, though in a flawed way. We had a Nuremberg system.

01:16:35,714 --> 01:16:41,150
SPEAKER_0:  We did prohibit at least Nazi leaders from coming back into power. We made an exception for the Emperor in Japan.

01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:45,182
SPEAKER_0:  but we generally follow the same rule in Japan, whereas in the United States.

01:16:45,954 --> 01:16:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  As I point out, many of the leaders of the Confederacy, first of all, don't surrender. They flee to Mexico.

01:16:52,290 --> 01:16:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  then they come back after they lose in Mexico a second time.

01:16:55,394 --> 01:16:57,726
SPEAKER_0:  They come back to the United States and they get elected to office.

01:16:58,466 --> 01:17:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  uh... the guy who writes the election laws in texas alexander walk-ins to realm of people don't know this even in texas

01:17:05,218 --> 01:17:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  He was a Confederate general.

01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:09,342
SPEAKER_0:  fled to Mexico so he committed treason by joining the

01:17:09,698 --> 01:17:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  army of maximilian emperor of mexico was put in power by louis napoleon

01:17:14,178 --> 01:17:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  After Max Millian's defeated.

01:17:16,034 --> 01:17:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  Alexander Watkins Terrell comes back to Texas, runs for the state legislature.

01:17:20,418 --> 01:17:22,110
SPEAKER_0:  and then writes the election laws.

01:17:22,594 --> 01:17:27,166
SPEAKER_1:  crazy. Can you make the case for that that that that's a feature of the American system not a bug?

01:17:27,458 --> 01:17:30,494
SPEAKER_1:  that that is an implementation of justice, that you forgive.

01:17:31,074 --> 01:17:32,894
SPEAKER_1:  that you don't persecute.

01:17:33,154 --> 01:17:34,279
SPEAKER_1:  everybody and the other.

01:17:34,279 --> 01:17:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  side of the war.

01:17:35,714 --> 01:17:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe, and I think that's a good feature in terms of...

01:17:38,658 --> 01:17:41,918
SPEAKER_0:  lower level individuals, but I think a bad feature of our system.

01:17:42,370 --> 01:17:44,478
SPEAKER_0:  is we do allow.

01:17:45,634 --> 01:17:49,342
SPEAKER_0:  elite figures who have committed wrongdoing. We give them many ways to get out of.

01:17:50,306 --> 01:17:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  You are more likely to be punished in this society if you do something wrong.

01:17:54,242 --> 01:17:56,867
SPEAKER_0:  and you're not an elite figure than if you are an elite figure.

01:17:56,867 --> 01:17:59,867
SPEAKER_1:  there should be a proportional like forgiveness should be equally

01:17:59,867 --> 01:18:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  distributed across the sky. It's not.

01:18:01,474 --> 01:18:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, and it's not.

01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  but we could change it.

01:18:04,738 --> 01:18:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  We could fix that.

01:18:06,274 --> 01:18:08,149
SPEAKER_1:  How do we fix that? How do we fix that?

01:18:08,149 --> 01:18:13,694
SPEAKER_0:  What do we fix? What I think was argued at the end, this is one of the really important things about studying history, you learn about...

01:18:13,954 --> 01:18:16,830
SPEAKER_0:  ideas that were not pursued that could be pursued today.

01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:19,998
SPEAKER_0:  at the end of the civil war there was there was an effort

01:18:20,482 --> 01:18:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  to ban anyone who was in a leadership position in the confederacy from ever serving in federal office again.

01:18:26,882 --> 01:18:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  That's the third element of the 14th Amendment. It's in the 14th Amendment, the 14th Amendment Clause 3.

01:18:33,378 --> 01:18:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  says that if you took an oath of office, meaning you were elected to office, you're an elite figure.

01:18:38,722 --> 01:18:40,158
SPEAKER_0:  and you violated that oath.

01:18:40,642 --> 01:18:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  You can still live in the country.

01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,038
SPEAKER_0:  You can still get rich.

01:18:43,362 --> 01:18:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  but you can't run for elected office again.

01:18:46,114 --> 01:18:48,414
SPEAKER_0:  And that what we've never really.

01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  implemented.

01:18:50,402 --> 01:18:54,654
SPEAKER_1:  Is it obvious that everybody who is in a leadership position on the Confederate side?

01:18:56,098 --> 01:18:58,654
SPEAKER_1:  is a bad person for the future of the United States.

01:18:59,426 --> 01:19:01,662
SPEAKER_1:  Or is that just a safe thing to assume?

01:19:02,082 --> 01:19:03,134
SPEAKER_1:  for the future of the nation.

01:19:03,714 --> 01:19:08,286
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's the latter. Maybe people do things for all kinds of reasons and sometimes they have regrets.

01:19:08,962 --> 01:19:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  That's also why we have the pardoning capability. You could pardon someone individually.

01:19:13,026 --> 01:19:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  if they show you that they've changed.

01:19:15,362 --> 01:19:17,694
SPEAKER_0:  and it would only create fairness because right now

01:19:18,114 --> 01:19:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  Let's say Lex you take out a huge huge loan.

01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  and you don't pay your loan back.

01:19:24,098 --> 01:19:25,214
SPEAKER_0:  That will go on your credit.

01:19:25,954 --> 01:19:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  and you won't get a big loan again.

01:19:28,066 --> 01:19:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  You don't get to say.

01:19:29,922 --> 01:19:31,870
SPEAKER_0:  Just give me another chance. You're gonna have to prove.

01:19:33,346 --> 01:19:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  I think about.

01:19:34,434 --> 01:19:36,030
SPEAKER_0:  holding public office in the same way.

01:19:36,738 --> 01:19:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  If you violated...

01:19:38,466 --> 01:19:40,318
SPEAKER_0:  your credit rating on that.

01:19:40,674 --> 01:19:42,302
SPEAKER_0:  you should have a much higher

01:19:42,562 --> 01:19:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  road to go to prove to us that you should be back in office.

01:19:48,194 --> 01:19:49,470
SPEAKER_1:  How did the war end?

01:19:51,106 --> 01:19:51,934
SPEAKER_1:  in quotes.

01:19:52,898 --> 01:20:00,798
SPEAKER_1:  What was the, so you said, and you make this case in the book that in some sense, the elements, the tensions behind this will continue to this day.

01:20:01,058 --> 01:20:01,502
SPEAKER_1:  But...

01:20:01,890 --> 01:20:03,038
SPEAKER_1:  officially halted the war end.

01:20:03,362 --> 01:20:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  So officially the war ends at Appomattox in the early spring of 1865.

01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  when Grant has pretty much smashed Robert E. Lee's army.

01:20:14,178 --> 01:20:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  Appomattox Courthouse is a small town in Virginia.

01:20:17,858 --> 01:20:22,206
SPEAKER_0:  and the two men meet and uh... there as their portraits of this is a

01:20:22,466 --> 01:20:23,902
SPEAKER_0:  painting of it we have in the book.

01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  and Grant and Lee sign a paper which basically

01:20:27,554 --> 01:20:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  allows Lee's soldiers to leave the battlefield.

01:20:30,786 --> 01:20:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  and leave with their sidearms to go back home.

01:20:33,282 --> 01:20:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  That's pretty much...

01:20:34,754 --> 01:20:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  the end. Jefferson Davis, who's the president of the Confederacy, goes into hiding.

01:20:39,682 --> 01:20:40,798
SPEAKER_0:  He's later captured.

01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  and then not convicted.

01:20:43,266 --> 01:20:48,222
SPEAKER_0:  but there's no formal settlement in the way there is at the end of World War II where

01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  uh... they need a new com a bay u s and japanese leaders inside that this is not

01:20:53,794 --> 01:20:57,022
SPEAKER_1:  So what stands out to you as brilliant ideas during this time?

01:20:57,634 --> 01:21:00,734
SPEAKER_1:  and actions too of Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln.

01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  So I mentioned that his values, I think a number of the things that he does that are

01:21:05,378 --> 01:21:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  quite extraordinary first.

01:21:07,586 --> 01:21:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  in

01:21:08,354 --> 01:21:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  emancipating the slaves. Now the slaves were freeing themselves.

01:21:11,682 --> 01:21:13,150
SPEAKER_0:  But Lincoln recognizes.

01:21:13,538 --> 01:21:15,518
SPEAKER_0:  that he needs more labor in the Union Army.

01:21:16,034 --> 01:21:19,230
SPEAKER_0:  and he recognizes that there's still a lot of resistance.

01:21:20,066 --> 01:21:24,222
SPEAKER_0:  What he does is he makes the case for freeing the slaves.

01:21:24,834 --> 01:21:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  based on the argument not just of the moral value of that.

01:21:28,578 --> 01:21:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  but based on how that will benefit the North.

01:21:31,202 --> 01:21:33,534
SPEAKER_0:  he's able to convince non-abolitionists.

01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  to pursue abolitionists.

01:21:35,714 --> 01:21:36,446
SPEAKER_0:  policies.

01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  uh... that

01:21:37,986 --> 01:21:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  by serving their own interests.

01:21:39,426 --> 01:21:41,662
SPEAKER_0:  What he's basically saying by 1863 or 64 is...

01:21:42,274 --> 01:21:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  I can ask for more white soldiers?

01:21:44,386 --> 01:21:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  or I can bring in former slaves. Would you like me to take your son or would you like me to put in? It's the same thing Franklin Roosevelt does during World War II.

01:21:51,362 --> 01:21:53,502
SPEAKER_0:  He says we need to build more planes and more tanks.

01:21:53,954 --> 01:22:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm sending all the soldiers off to Europe. I've got all this African-American population in the South. Wouldn't you like me to move them up to Chicago so we can win this war and build things in the-

01:22:02,306 --> 01:22:03,454
SPEAKER_0:  in the factories.

01:22:04,066 --> 01:22:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  Lincoln uses the war.

01:22:06,786 --> 01:22:08,766
SPEAKER_0:  to move the country forward morally.

01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:11,678
SPEAKER_0:  even if at times he's convincing people by using other.

01:22:12,098 --> 01:22:13,973
SPEAKER_0:  other reasons. I think that's great politics.

01:22:13,973 --> 01:22:16,414
SPEAKER_1:  I guess that's one of the components of great leadership.

01:22:16,898 --> 01:22:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  is uh...

01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:20,510
SPEAKER_1:  is do the right thing.

01:22:21,026 --> 01:22:22,014
SPEAKER_1:  for the...

01:22:22,754 --> 01:22:23,838
SPEAKER_1:  wrong reasons.

01:22:24,130 --> 01:22:26,755
SPEAKER_1:  We're not publicly sounding wrong.

01:22:26,755 --> 01:22:30,206
SPEAKER_0:  Find ways to move people. What we talked about before.

01:22:30,626 --> 01:22:32,382
SPEAKER_0:  Different stories move different people.

01:22:32,738 --> 01:22:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  So you can tell different stories. He tells one set of stories to the religious leaders who are abolitionists.

01:22:38,274 --> 01:22:40,638
SPEAKER_0:  and a different set of stories to the New York bankers.

01:22:41,538 --> 01:22:45,278
SPEAKER_0:  And that's leadership. You tell different kinds of stories to move people to a new

01:22:45,666 --> 01:22:50,110
SPEAKER_0:  a new position. The other thing Lincoln is really brilliant at

01:22:50,434 --> 01:22:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  is managing the international side of this. So one of the real dangers.

01:22:55,746 --> 01:22:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  for the Union.

01:22:56,738 --> 01:23:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  is that the british will come in on the side of the confederacy confederates expected the british workers again the confederates was selling all their cotton to britain

01:23:04,066 --> 01:23:06,558
SPEAKER_0:  and they knew that the british leadership first of all

01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:10,878
SPEAKER_0:  was very happy to work with slave-holding societies, even though they didn't have slaves. And Number 2,

01:23:11,138 --> 01:23:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  that they believed the Union was getting too strong and threatening the British and Canada.

01:23:15,458 --> 01:23:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  So there were many reasons the British might have gone in with the Confederates. Lincoln mixes sticks and carrots with the British.

01:23:23,522 --> 01:23:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  He threatens them.

01:23:24,930 --> 01:23:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  And when the British actually try to send diplomats to negotiate with Southerners, he interdicts that. He basically initiates a quarantine of the South.

01:23:33,986 --> 01:23:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  On the other hand, he reaches out to them.

01:23:36,514 --> 01:23:41,054
SPEAKER_0:  and tries to show that he wants better relations and makes the argument that they will actually benefit more.

01:23:41,378 --> 01:23:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  from having the industrial capability of the union on their side.

01:23:44,738 --> 01:23:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  He's a very good diplomat.

01:23:47,394 --> 01:23:51,486
SPEAKER_1:  He is considered to be one of the great presidents in the history of the United States.

01:23:52,194 --> 01:23:54,110
SPEAKER_1:  Are there ways that he failed?

01:23:54,818 --> 01:23:56,542
SPEAKER_1:  Is there things he could have done better?

01:23:56,866 --> 01:23:59,902
SPEAKER_0:  So he failed in the ways that most great leaders fail.

01:24:00,546 --> 01:24:02,718
SPEAKER_0:  which is that he had a terrible succession plan.

01:24:04,162 --> 01:24:09,630
SPEAKER_0:  his vice president, who I spend a lot of time on in the book, Andrew Johnson, who is probably our worst president ever.

01:24:10,306 --> 01:24:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  Andrew Johnson had no business being anywhere.

01:24:13,698 --> 01:24:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  near the presidency.

01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  Andrew Johnson was the only...

01:24:17,122 --> 01:24:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  Southern.

01:24:18,338 --> 01:24:20,446
SPEAKER_0:  Senator who did not secede.

01:24:21,026 --> 01:24:23,678
SPEAKER_0:  And so even though he was a Democrat, Lincoln...

01:24:24,034 --> 01:24:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  wanted to show that he was creating a unity ticket when he ran for re-election in 1864.

01:24:29,410 --> 01:24:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  This happens today, right? So he puts someone on as vice president.

01:24:33,314 --> 01:24:34,270
SPEAKER_0:  We didn't even like.

01:24:34,530 --> 01:24:36,222
SPEAKER_0:  but who we thought was politically useful.

01:24:36,898 --> 01:24:37,630
SPEAKER_0:  Problem is...

01:24:37,954 --> 01:24:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  when Lincoln was assassinated.

01:24:39,970 --> 01:24:43,582
SPEAKER_0:  This guy took over. Andrew Johnson was drunk at his own inauguration.

01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:45,598
SPEAKER_0:  The guy was a true drunkard.

01:24:45,922 --> 01:24:49,950
SPEAKER_0:  he was not prepared to lead in any sense intellectually.

01:24:50,434 --> 01:24:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  politically.

01:24:51,362 --> 01:24:53,950
SPEAKER_0:  and he was against most of the principles Lincoln was for.

01:24:55,234 --> 01:24:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  and the irony

01:24:56,994 --> 01:25:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  uh... is that when lincoln is assassinated in april of eighteen sixty five

01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  Andrew Johnson takes over and he has all the war powers Lincoln has.

01:25:05,442 --> 01:25:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  That was not good planning by Lincoln. And we can look back on it now and say, even though Lincoln is the first president who was assassinated.

01:25:12,898 --> 01:25:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  uh... he should have known that there were people coming from it wasn't inevitable that he'd be assassinated but he should have had a backup plan for who would take over

01:25:19,586 --> 01:25:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  hopefully someone who was capable of doing the job and Andrew Johnson was not capable.

01:25:23,810 --> 01:25:29,310
SPEAKER_1:  So for me, for a person, if I were to put myself in Lincoln's shoes or any leadership position to choose...

01:25:29,986 --> 01:25:31,166
SPEAKER_1:  It is difficult to think.

01:25:31,618 --> 01:25:35,454
SPEAKER_1:  about what happens after my death, after I'm gone, right? to plan well.

01:25:36,002 --> 01:25:36,798
SPEAKER_1:  same time.

01:25:38,210 --> 01:25:39,070
SPEAKER_1:  If you care about...

01:25:39,874 --> 01:25:43,198
SPEAKER_1:  your actions to have a long-term impact.

01:25:43,618 --> 01:25:45,950
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like you should have a succession plan.

01:25:46,402 --> 01:25:48,190
SPEAKER_1:  that continues on the path.

01:25:48,802 --> 01:25:51,710
SPEAKER_1:  that continues to carry the ideals that you've implemented.

01:25:52,546 --> 01:25:55,422
SPEAKER_1:  So I'm not, I'm unsure why people don't do that more often.

01:25:55,714 --> 01:25:56,862
SPEAKER_1:  Like I wonder how much.

01:25:57,410 --> 01:25:59,902
SPEAKER_1:  Vladimir Putin spends percentage of time

01:26:00,802 --> 01:26:01,310
SPEAKER_1:  per day.

01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:02,494
SPEAKER_1:  thinking.

01:26:03,074 --> 01:26:04,734
SPEAKER_1:  what happens after he's gone.

01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:07,518
SPEAKER_1:  to help flourish the nation and the region.

01:26:07,874 --> 01:26:09,054
SPEAKER_1:  that he deeply cares for.

01:26:09,730 --> 01:26:12,414
SPEAKER_1:  I wonder in the same list for other presidents. Donald Trump?

01:26:12,802 --> 01:26:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  Joe Biden.

01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:19,326
SPEAKER_1:  They might think politically, like how do I guarantee that it's a Democrat or Republican?

01:26:19,842 --> 01:26:21,438
SPEAKER_1:  Do they think like, um...

01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:23,925
SPEAKER_1:  visionary for the country. I don't know. I want

01:26:23,925 --> 01:26:30,334
SPEAKER_0:  I think that's very rare and I think what I understand from the literature among business people who talk about this a lot

01:26:30,754 --> 01:26:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  is what ends up happening is you become so powerful.

01:26:35,170 --> 01:26:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  do you assume you're always gonna be in power?

01:26:37,058 --> 01:26:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  You convince yourself of that. You convince yourself that the end is far away.

01:26:40,898 --> 01:26:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  And of course, Vilenk in the end could have been far away. He was healthy.

01:26:43,618 --> 01:26:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  who was only in his fifties?

01:26:45,122 --> 01:26:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  He could have lived a lot longer.

01:26:47,330 --> 01:26:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  but it also ended fast as it could.

01:26:50,274 --> 01:26:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  And my understanding is that most Americans.

01:26:53,346 --> 01:26:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  don't prepare their wills and estates, and it doesn't matter whether they're rich or poor.

01:26:57,378 --> 01:27:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  They assume things are just gonna go on because it's not fun to think about this.

01:27:02,402 --> 01:27:02,718
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:27:04,034 --> 01:27:05,470
SPEAKER_1:  but I feel like it's freeing.

01:27:06,082 --> 01:27:07,774
SPEAKER_1:  Like you know what I did, which is interesting?

01:27:08,322 --> 01:27:11,934
SPEAKER_1:  Well, before I went to Ukraine and recorded a video, I set up a whole thing where

01:27:12,226 --> 01:27:14,078
SPEAKER_1:  I record a video, what happens if I die?

01:27:14,466 --> 01:27:16,606
SPEAKER_1:  I recorded a video to release and I gave my

01:27:16,994 --> 01:27:19,326
SPEAKER_1:  Brother access to my passwords

01:27:19,810 --> 01:27:29,054
SPEAKER_1:  so that, and I gave him instructions, you're not allowed to look at this, but please publish this if I die. And you know that made me, it sounds silly and ridiculous, but.

01:27:29,378 --> 01:27:30,526
SPEAKER_1:  that make me feel free.

01:27:31,362 --> 01:27:32,766
SPEAKER_1:  to do the best thing I want to do.

01:27:33,570 --> 01:27:35,262
SPEAKER_1:  It's like, it's a liberating, so like.

01:27:35,586 --> 01:27:37,278
SPEAKER_1:  I guess that's for your will, but also...

01:27:37,666 --> 01:27:41,182
SPEAKER_1:  Like do the best possible damn job you can. I feel like as a leader.

01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  having a plan what happens if you fail if you die if you

01:27:47,874 --> 01:27:49,278
SPEAKER_1:  or are you lose?

01:27:49,858 --> 01:27:56,126
SPEAKER_1:  some of the oomph, some of the power, some of the momentum that is driving you currently, that there's going to be a handoff.

01:27:56,450 --> 01:27:56,894
SPEAKER_1:  Where

01:27:57,186 --> 01:28:00,158
SPEAKER_1:  You will still be remembered as a great man or woman that

01:28:00,258 --> 01:28:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  But you identify one of the other problems, right?

01:28:03,170 --> 01:28:08,990
SPEAKER_0:  which is one of the other reasons why someone like Lincoln or certainly Henry Kissinger doesn't create a successor.

01:28:09,570 --> 01:28:13,278
SPEAKER_0:  because you're afraid they're going to steal your passwords. You're afraid they're going to steal the power from you.

01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  That's true. You had to find someone in your brother, hopefully, who you could trust.

01:28:17,154 --> 01:28:18,279
SPEAKER_0:  No, no, no. Let's just be.

01:28:18,279 --> 01:28:18,974
SPEAKER_1:  clear.

01:28:19,202 --> 01:28:23,678
SPEAKER_1:  I love my brother, but he's a troll. So there's a feature.

01:28:24,034 --> 01:28:27,486
SPEAKER_1:  on the pass on whatever password manager I may or may not use.

01:28:27,778 --> 01:28:29,918
SPEAKER_1:  And this is there's a bunch of services like this.

01:28:30,146 --> 01:28:33,470
SPEAKER_1:  It's interesting, I don't know if you know about this, I've learned about all of this.

01:28:34,242 --> 01:28:34,718
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

01:28:35,426 --> 01:28:35,870
SPEAKER_1:  is

01:28:36,162 --> 01:28:36,734
SPEAKER_1:  You can.

01:28:37,346 --> 01:28:39,390
SPEAKER_1:  have them request access.

01:28:39,810 --> 01:28:42,334
SPEAKER_1:  and it's going to wait 30 days before it gives them access.

01:28:42,786 --> 01:28:44,798
SPEAKER_1:  So it's kind of has this.

01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:54,814
SPEAKER_1:  built in trust, trust padding. But it's interesting, I mean, to me on that aspect is just to have a plan in all aspects of life. This is for leadership.

01:28:55,106 --> 01:28:56,126
SPEAKER_1:  in your private life.

01:28:56,802 --> 01:28:58,078
SPEAKER_1:  Like what happens?

01:28:58,850 --> 01:29:02,430
SPEAKER_1:  to not just your will and your wealth or whatever.

01:29:02,914 --> 01:29:06,078
SPEAKER_1:  but what happens to other stuff like social media and all that.

01:29:06,370 --> 01:29:07,495
SPEAKER_1:  Right. white.

01:29:07,495 --> 01:29:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  And anything you care about if you wanted to live on and that's the problem, but if you

01:29:12,738 --> 01:29:13,982
SPEAKER_0:  Unless you can devise.

01:29:14,754 --> 01:29:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  a technical solution like that.

01:29:16,834 --> 01:29:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  You have to give someone power now.

01:29:19,298 --> 01:29:25,918
SPEAKER_1:  And that's the tricky thing. I mean, democracy is a kind of technology. You're gonna have to figure out how to do it correctly, how to have.

01:29:26,306 --> 01:29:27,742
SPEAKER_1:  I don't have that power, propagate.

01:29:28,002 --> 01:29:29,150
SPEAKER_1:  especially during war.

01:29:29,410 --> 01:29:29,950
SPEAKER_1:  Hi you

01:29:30,402 --> 01:29:33,502
SPEAKER_1:  get everybody together into this warmongering mood.

01:29:34,338 --> 01:29:37,662
SPEAKER_1:  And then how do you, how do you like calm, come down from that?

01:29:38,178 --> 01:29:39,742
SPEAKER_1:  and just relax. Precisely.

01:29:40,130 --> 01:29:41,438
SPEAKER_1:  So in some sense that's...

01:29:42,370 --> 01:29:44,990
SPEAKER_1:  with their jobs and those of the promise is the

01:29:45,346 --> 01:29:46,622
SPEAKER_1:  over centralization of power.

01:29:46,914 --> 01:29:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  It was the over-centralization of power, but it was also

01:29:50,018 --> 01:29:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  that Lincoln...

01:29:51,682 --> 01:29:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  had a designated successor.

01:29:54,306 --> 01:29:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  who was going to do and tried to do everything that ran against what Lincoln was doing.

01:29:58,562 --> 01:30:03,166
SPEAKER_0:  and it set the country back. We went forward at the end of the Civil War, and then we went backward.

01:30:03,906 --> 01:30:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  More so than we would have if there had been a new election.

01:30:06,914 --> 01:30:14,046
SPEAKER_0:  Because if there had been a new election, there still would be reason for that person running, even if they were on the other side, to try to find some compromised positions.

01:30:14,338 --> 01:30:16,222
SPEAKER_0:  Andrew Johnson inherited power.

01:30:16,962 --> 01:30:20,958
SPEAKER_0:  with very few limitations on how he used that power. Congress wasn't even in session.

01:30:21,922 --> 01:30:27,710
SPEAKER_0:  And so this became very directly a problem because Andrew Johnson started pardoning Southerners, allowing them to come back into power.

01:30:28,514 --> 01:30:30,389
SPEAKER_1:  So he had like a few months where he just went.

01:30:30,389 --> 01:30:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  wild.

01:30:32,098 --> 01:30:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  It's giving the car keys to someone who's not prepared to drive, but decided that they're going to do what they want with the car.

01:30:39,522 --> 01:30:40,446
SPEAKER_1:  All right.

01:30:41,602 --> 01:30:44,350
SPEAKER_1:  Is there any level to which power corrupted?

01:30:44,834 --> 01:30:45,246
SPEAKER_1:  Lincoln.

01:30:45,858 --> 01:30:46,654
SPEAKER_1:  a war president.

01:30:46,754 --> 01:30:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, I do think there were some areas and I think that even though he was a great president, if not our greatest president,

01:30:53,058 --> 01:30:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  maybe one of the greatest figures of our history.

01:30:56,130 --> 01:30:57,246
SPEAKER_0:  uh... he was fought

01:30:57,474 --> 01:31:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  One is problem of succession, but also...

01:31:01,186 --> 01:31:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  I think Lincoln.

01:31:02,722 --> 01:31:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:31:03,394 --> 01:31:07,422
SPEAKER_0:  over invested in the power of the presidency. He came to believe too much.

01:31:08,450 --> 01:31:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  in the role of one man.

01:31:10,562 --> 01:31:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  and not in creating.

01:31:13,378 --> 01:31:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  a more balanced approach to governance. And that's a function of war. That's where war is dangerous.

01:31:18,274 --> 01:31:20,958
SPEAKER_0:  War has an inherent centralizing power.

01:31:21,346 --> 01:31:22,302
SPEAKER_0:  in a democracy.

01:31:22,882 --> 01:31:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  And that is dangerous because even when you have the best of people running a war.

01:31:27,490 --> 01:31:29,365
SPEAKER_0:  that gives them a lot of power to make decisions.

01:31:29,365 --> 01:31:35,710
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, how do you come down from that? I see that was the Lensky and Putin currently. Yep. It's a war How do you come down to because uh? You?

01:31:36,770 --> 01:31:42,142
SPEAKER_1:  Ukraine and everybody, anybody in a war, kind of, especially if you're fighting for the ideal of democracy.

01:31:43,010 --> 01:31:44,958
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like war is anti-democratic.

01:31:45,538 --> 01:31:45,950
SPEAKER_1:  It is.

01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:46,590
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:31:46,882 --> 01:31:50,014
SPEAKER_1:  How do you come down from that? What's the interesting mechanism?

01:31:50,690 --> 01:31:56,315
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, some of it is leadership. You have to be like a George Washington type figure, be able to walk away from power.

01:31:56,315 --> 01:31:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  I think you gave the answer right there.

01:31:58,850 --> 01:32:05,406
SPEAKER_0:  You need to walk away from power or you need to be forced to walk away from power. Historically, one of the things that democracies have tended to do

01:32:05,890 --> 01:32:09,118
SPEAKER_0:  when they have a chance is to vote out of office the victor.

01:32:09,922 --> 01:32:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  Think about Winston Churchill.

01:32:12,930 --> 01:32:16,126
SPEAKER_0:  Roosevelt is elected to his fourth term when he's still in the war.

01:32:16,706 --> 01:32:17,406
SPEAKER_0:  It's not clear.

01:32:17,826 --> 01:32:20,446
SPEAKER_0:  that he would have been elected again, let's say he lived on.

01:32:20,866 --> 01:32:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  because there is a sensibility that the person has become too powerful.

01:32:25,282 --> 01:32:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  in this role.

01:32:26,594 --> 01:32:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  and that they someone else should now step in someone else who's also not a war president but has other interests.

01:32:33,218 --> 01:32:34,974
SPEAKER_0:  Let's hope Ukraine wins this war.

01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:36,222
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:32:36,546 --> 01:32:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  Zelinsky should then step down.

01:32:39,298 --> 01:32:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  or someone else should be voted in.

01:32:41,186 --> 01:32:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  It will be dangerous if he remains.

01:32:43,490 --> 01:32:45,054
SPEAKER_0:  Let's say he wins somehow.

01:32:45,506 --> 01:32:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  and a true victory, just as a hypothetical.

01:32:48,546 --> 01:32:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  He should not be proud, he should be.

01:32:50,562 --> 01:32:51,166
SPEAKER_0:  praised.

01:32:52,098 --> 01:32:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe give it a nice villa.

01:32:54,242 --> 01:32:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:32:55,010 --> 01:32:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  but someone else should take over.

01:32:57,218 --> 01:32:59,774
SPEAKER_0:  because the problem is that he's gonna have too much power.

01:33:00,578 --> 01:33:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  And honestly, he's going to be.

01:33:02,562 --> 01:33:04,894
SPEAKER_0:  out of touch with what the country needs after the war.

01:33:06,338 --> 01:33:09,182
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think would have happened if Lincoln had lived? That's the sort of-

01:33:09,634 --> 01:33:16,759
SPEAKER_1:  counterfactual view of history is an interesting question that probably you think about a lot this case is a lot or would it would have happened if you didn't get it it's a

01:33:16,759 --> 01:33:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  reasonable question because it was not inevitable he'd be assassinated. He could have had more protection that night.

01:33:21,826 --> 01:33:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  He'd invited Ulysses Grant to go to the theater with him, and Grant and his wife didn't go. If they had been there, there would have been more protection for Grant.

01:33:28,482 --> 01:33:36,254
SPEAKER_0:  So you would have had at least double the security there. So there are many ways in which he might not have died. I think it still would have been a difficult.

01:33:36,738 --> 01:33:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  transition.

01:33:37,954 --> 01:33:44,222
SPEAKER_0:  but I think there were a few things that would have been better. First of all, Lincoln would not have pardoned all of these Confederate leaders and allowed them to come back into power.

01:33:44,738 --> 01:33:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  Lincoln also would have been a better politician at holding his Republican coalition together.

01:33:49,602 --> 01:33:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  And I think.

01:33:50,850 --> 01:33:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  Lincoln was more committed to empowering former slaves and others. So we still would have had a lot of conflicts, but I think.

01:33:57,666 --> 01:34:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  What would have been a degree of difficulty was doubled or tripled because

01:34:02,050 --> 01:34:06,494
SPEAKER_0:  Lincoln was was removed and the opposite came into power with Andrew Johnson.

01:34:06,914 --> 01:34:09,630
SPEAKER_1:  So you don't think there's a case you made that the entry jostles

01:34:10,626 --> 01:34:11,454
SPEAKER_1:  turned out to be a

01:34:12,994 --> 01:34:15,838
SPEAKER_1:  a bad decision, but the spirit of the decision is the correct one.

01:34:16,258 --> 01:34:22,974
SPEAKER_0:  No, I think it was a terrible decision because you should never put someone one step away from enormous power who's not prepared.

01:34:23,778 --> 01:34:30,750
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, in that sense. Yeah. So, uh, in that sense, I got it. But the other, the spirit of the decision, meaning you put somebody who's an

01:34:32,130 --> 01:34:35,166
SPEAKER_1:  represents a very opposing viewpoint than you.

01:34:35,490 --> 01:34:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I'm for that so long as that person.

01:34:37,538 --> 01:34:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  is

01:34:38,274 --> 01:34:40,446
SPEAKER_0:  on board with some of the basic values.

01:34:40,770 --> 01:34:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  that you're pursuing.

01:34:42,018 --> 01:34:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  and that person is capable of doing the job.

01:34:44,034 --> 01:34:47,413
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think that was obvious to him that Andrew Johnson was not capable of doing it?

01:34:47,413 --> 01:34:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

01:34:49,218 --> 01:34:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  It's in the right, I mean, everyone recognized that.

01:34:51,842 --> 01:34:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  But it made sense. I mean, what Lincoln has to be praised for.

01:34:55,298 --> 01:34:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  is in the midst of a war.

01:34:57,570 --> 01:35:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  when at that point he was not doing well, the war was not going well.

01:35:00,642 --> 01:35:07,614
SPEAKER_0:  He ran for reelection. He didn't try to postpone the election. He didn't try to do anything. Yeah. And so he needed all the help he could get when running.

01:35:08,162 --> 01:35:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  And so he wanted to have someone on there who looked like a unity candidate who could appeal to some

01:35:12,674 --> 01:35:15,678
SPEAKER_0:  southerners. So it made sense from a political point of view.

01:35:16,418 --> 01:35:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  but it created a really big problem.

01:35:19,298 --> 01:35:20,190
SPEAKER_0:  and um

01:35:20,546 --> 01:35:25,822
SPEAKER_0:  There were people who said he should have removed Johnson as soon as he was elected, and in retrospect he probably should have.

01:35:26,402 --> 01:35:29,310
SPEAKER_1:  How gangster is that to during a war still run the election?

01:35:30,018 --> 01:35:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  It's extraordinary. It's extraordinary $20C is in the chat

01:35:32,674 --> 01:35:37,150
SPEAKER_0:  Lincoln believed in democratic values. He also believed he would win, but he knew it was not guaranteed.

01:35:37,410 --> 01:35:41,886
SPEAKER_0:  yeah and it's interesting for for people know this the reason we have mail in balloting in the US is because of that

01:35:42,626 --> 01:35:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:35:43,458 --> 01:35:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:35:44,962 --> 01:35:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  Almost.

01:35:45,986 --> 01:35:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:35:47,106 --> 01:35:49,342
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's almost a million.

01:35:50,082 --> 01:35:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  union voters are away from their homes.

01:35:53,154 --> 01:35:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  And so how do they vote? As soldiers? As nurses?

01:35:56,002 --> 01:36:00,382
SPEAKER_0:  They vote by mail. The post office delivers their ballots. That's why we have mail-in balloting.

01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:05,982
SPEAKER_1:  What about the other counterfactual question of what would have happened if Confederate states won the war?

01:36:06,530 --> 01:36:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  The Confederate states had won the war. You would have seen, I think, a separate.

01:36:10,434 --> 01:36:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  country.

01:36:11,682 --> 01:36:13,790
SPEAKER_0:  and the South, you would have seen two countries.

01:36:14,210 --> 01:36:16,798
SPEAKER_0:  and that confederate country would have been a smaller country.

01:36:17,122 --> 01:36:27,646
SPEAKER_0:  but it probably would have been able to defend itself because it would have actually gotten much richer than it was was poor at the time but through its cotton trade and other things that would have been recognized by great britain by france by other societies

01:36:27,970 --> 01:36:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  and you would have seen.

01:36:30,626 --> 01:36:32,542
SPEAKER_0:  A southern republic, I don't think.

01:36:32,802 --> 01:36:39,614
SPEAKER_0:  you would have seen that southern republic dominate the continent the union had the men and people and had the resources

01:36:40,002 --> 01:36:40,446
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:36:40,898 --> 01:36:45,773
SPEAKER_0:  but you would have seen a rival republic to the united states in the south

01:36:45,773 --> 01:36:46,782
SPEAKER_1:  to head interest?

01:36:47,234 --> 01:36:49,758
SPEAKER_1:  to dominate the continent, to take over the Union.

01:36:49,890 --> 01:36:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  they had a foreign policy plan uh... many written about this they had plans many southerners did

01:36:55,010 --> 01:36:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  of expanding into the Caribbean.

01:36:57,506 --> 01:37:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  which was actually more feasible. They did not have the personnel to occupy so much territory going out west. If you think about the amount of land that had to be covered.

01:37:05,858 --> 01:37:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  but they had nautical capabilities and naval power and the money.

01:37:10,178 --> 01:37:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  uh... to dominate islands in the caribbean and those islands were important for their trade

01:37:15,522 --> 01:37:17,982
SPEAKER_0:  So there were many southerners who wanted to take control of Cuba.

01:37:18,402 --> 01:37:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  wanted to take control of Haiti and the Dominican Republic.

01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  So you probably would have seen.

01:37:24,866 --> 01:37:26,974
SPEAKER_0:  southern warfare in those areas.

01:37:28,418 --> 01:37:33,022
SPEAKER_1:  from a counterfactual history perspective, can you make the case?

01:37:33,730 --> 01:37:34,782
SPEAKER_1:  that succession.

01:37:35,170 --> 01:37:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  would have been.

01:37:36,354 --> 01:37:38,814
SPEAKER_1:  created a better world. Like if we're sitting today.

01:37:39,266 --> 01:37:44,414
SPEAKER_1:  and do back to the future thing. This session in this context, if we put aside the

01:37:44,738 --> 01:37:45,502
SPEAKER_1:  the suffering.

01:37:46,018 --> 01:37:47,390
SPEAKER_1:  and the loss of life.

01:37:47,906 --> 01:37:48,542
SPEAKER_1:  in the war.

01:37:49,186 --> 01:37:50,814
SPEAKER_1:  that we'll be in a better world today.

01:37:51,362 --> 01:37:57,406
SPEAKER_1:  Just look into that political climate. And can you also make the case that actually this outcome of the union winning the war?

01:37:57,954 --> 01:37:58,814
SPEAKER_1:  is the better one.

01:37:59,298 --> 01:38:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  I think the Union victory is by far the better outcome, because I think what you would have had otherwise is you would have had a slave republic.

01:38:06,722 --> 01:38:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  in the south that would have encouraged slavery in other parts of the world would have exported slavery

01:38:13,218 --> 01:38:16,574
SPEAKER_0:  and would have necessarily been hostile.

01:38:17,122 --> 01:38:27,550
SPEAKER_0:  to many of the positive changes that occur in the union, the movement toward progressive reforms, creating cities with health codes and public education and many of those things. Public education really develops in the north.

01:38:28,002 --> 01:38:32,382
SPEAKER_0:  as a way of training workers who are being paid to be better workers in a factory.

01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:35,614
SPEAKER_0:  There's a reason you don't educate slaves, because if you educate slaves, they'll rebel.

01:38:36,162 --> 01:38:38,206
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so don't you think there'll be a huge...

01:38:38,850 --> 01:38:40,350
SPEAKER_1:  pressure from the north.

01:38:40,834 --> 01:38:42,782
SPEAKER_1:  to abolish slavery anyway.

01:38:43,138 --> 01:38:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  There would have, but I think the South could have survived.

01:38:45,474 --> 01:38:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  without another war.

01:38:46,498 --> 01:38:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I think the way that...

01:38:47,874 --> 01:38:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  Slavery would have

01:38:49,666 --> 01:38:50,238
SPEAKER_0:  would have.

01:38:50,754 --> 01:38:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  ended in the South.

01:38:52,258 --> 01:38:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  If it didn't end with the Civil War, it would have been with another war.

01:38:55,522 --> 01:38:57,534
SPEAKER_1:  I guess the deeper question is, is it?

01:38:58,402 --> 01:39:02,430
SPEAKER_1:  better to work through your problems together or is it better to get a divorce?

01:39:03,554 --> 01:39:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  I think in this case it was better to-

01:39:05,378 --> 01:39:09,278
SPEAKER_0:  work through the problems, not even working through them together, it's better to work through the problems where...

01:39:09,602 --> 01:39:14,110
SPEAKER_0:  One side has the resources to incentivize you to work through the problem.

01:39:14,498 --> 01:39:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  rather than leaving you on your own to go your own direction. I think the argument against the union winning...

01:39:21,538 --> 01:39:25,982
SPEAKER_0:  would be the argument that would be made by those who believe they suffered from union power later.

01:39:26,754 --> 01:39:27,998
SPEAKER_0:  So you could argue.

01:39:28,418 --> 01:39:30,366
SPEAKER_0:  if you're a historian of Native Americans.

01:39:31,298 --> 01:39:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  if you are a historian of the Philippines.

01:39:33,826 --> 01:39:43,806
SPEAKER_0:  You could argue some of the areas where this newly united nation coming out of the civil war was able to use its power to spread its influence, it would have been harder for the union to do that.

01:39:44,066 --> 01:39:46,878
SPEAKER_0:  uh... if the union had to deal with a rival to the south

01:39:47,906 --> 01:39:49,374
SPEAKER_1:  So as a historian.

01:39:49,922 --> 01:39:50,814
SPEAKER_1:  Union 1.

01:39:51,522 --> 01:39:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  to which degree.

01:39:53,122 --> 01:39:57,950
SPEAKER_1:  are the people from the Union, there is now the United States, the writers of the history.

01:39:58,818 --> 01:40:02,526
SPEAKER_1:  that color, the perspective of who's the good guys and the bad guys.

01:40:02,914 --> 01:40:06,289
SPEAKER_0:  So this is such an interesting question because I like how you

01:40:06,289 --> 01:40:16,789
SPEAKER_1:  you take every question I ask and make it into a better question? I deeply appreciate it. I'll ask, every time I ask some ridiculous question, and you go, that's really interesting.

01:40:16,789 --> 01:40:21,950
SPEAKER_0:  They're really good questions. They're thoughtful questions. You know, actually the best questions are not the simple ones, right?

01:40:22,498 --> 01:40:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:40:25,762 --> 01:40:30,206
SPEAKER_0:  The axiom is that the winner is right history. And that's usually the case.

01:40:31,394 --> 01:40:34,270
SPEAKER_0:  Most of the history I learned about Ukraine when I was growing up was

01:40:34,658 --> 01:40:36,990
SPEAKER_0:  written by Russians, it was Russian history of Ukraine.

01:40:37,730 --> 01:40:48,574
SPEAKER_0:  Most of the history of Europe has been written by Germans and French and British citizens, right? I mean, so usually it's that way. And for the most part, our history has been written from a sort of Northeastern point of view.

01:40:48,834 --> 01:40:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  But it's very interesting, the history of the years after the Civil War that I focus on in this book.

01:40:53,986 --> 01:40:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  has largely been written by the losers.

01:40:56,354 --> 01:41:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  because the Union and its legacies, and I grew up in New York, so I'm growing up as a legacy of that, right?

01:41:02,818 --> 01:41:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  Those were individuals who wanted to write about what happened long after the Civil War.

01:41:06,754 --> 01:41:07,838
SPEAKER_0:  when the North got rich.

01:41:08,610 --> 01:41:14,686
SPEAKER_0:  All those beautiful buildings in New York, all that wealth in New York is 1880s, 90s, late 19th centuries, the Gilded Age.

01:41:15,298 --> 01:41:16,798
SPEAKER_0:  and that's what northerners want to write about

01:41:17,026 --> 01:41:18,302
SPEAKER_0:  right, because there's glory there.

01:41:19,202 --> 01:41:24,478
SPEAKER_0:  uh... the twenty years or so after the civil war the years that really count eighteen sixty five eighteen eighty or so

01:41:25,122 --> 01:41:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, those ears are ugly.

01:41:27,042 --> 01:41:27,550
SPEAKER_0:  It's messy.

01:41:28,386 --> 01:41:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  And so who wrote about them?

01:41:29,826 --> 01:41:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  Southern.

01:41:31,170 --> 01:41:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  and they wrote a story.

01:41:32,642 --> 01:41:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  that was about Northern carpetbaggers and corrupt African Americans.

01:41:38,914 --> 01:41:42,814
SPEAKER_0:  And this is the story that Americans learned until a few years ago.

01:41:43,234 --> 01:41:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  I've gone around the country talking about this book, and the number of people who've told me they never learned this basic history.

01:41:48,258 --> 01:41:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  because they grew up in Chicago, not because they grew up in Texas, but because they grew up in Chicago.

01:41:52,706 --> 01:41:59,870
SPEAKER_0:  And the story they were told, the Civil War ended. Oh, now let's talk about the Chicago World's Fair in 1893 and how Chicago is coming of age as this great city.

01:42:00,258 --> 01:42:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  We don't like to write.

01:42:02,210 --> 01:42:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  history in our country that's not about glory.

01:42:05,570 --> 01:42:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  I'm all for the greatness of our country, but you become great by studying your failures as well as your successes.

01:42:11,938 --> 01:42:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  And that's a real problem we have.

01:42:13,570 --> 01:42:16,830
SPEAKER_1:  And I would love to see a kind of humility from.

01:42:17,058 --> 01:42:21,406
SPEAKER_1:  from a history perspective, one of the things that surprised me just coming from the Soviet Union to

01:42:21,890 --> 01:42:22,910
SPEAKER_1:  to the United States.

01:42:23,234 --> 01:42:25,118
SPEAKER_1:  as you've I think spoken about.

01:42:25,794 --> 01:42:30,206
SPEAKER_1:  is the perspective on World War II and who was the critical component of winning the war.

01:42:30,562 --> 01:42:32,126
SPEAKER_1:  Obviously in the Soviet Union.

01:42:32,642 --> 01:42:38,270
SPEAKER_1:  It's a great patriotic war. It's, you know, the Soviet Union is the ones that suffered.

01:42:38,530 --> 01:42:42,014
SPEAKER_1:  and often actually don't emphasize the suffering, they emphasize the glory.

01:42:42,466 --> 01:42:46,910
SPEAKER_1:  that they defeated this huge evil. But then you listen to the United States perspective on this.

01:42:47,234 --> 01:42:48,446
SPEAKER_1:  And it's almost like...

01:42:49,090 --> 01:42:58,942
SPEAKER_1:  The I mean there's several ways of phrasing it but basically the United States won the war without the United States It would be impossible to win the war there at the turning point there were the you

01:42:59,202 --> 01:43:00,222
SPEAKER_1:  The lat- the- the-

01:43:00,514 --> 01:43:00,862
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

01:43:01,154 --> 01:43:09,982
SPEAKER_1:  What, my last, my everything, that song, my first, my last, my everything. So that, and I'm sure I went through it, what, what, growing up.

01:43:10,754 --> 01:43:11,806
SPEAKER_1:  in a...

01:43:12,162 --> 01:43:14,270
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe after Warren in Britain.

01:43:14,594 --> 01:43:22,398
SPEAKER_1:  I wonder if there's history books written there that basically say, and they could also make a pretty strong case, that Britain was central to the turning point.

01:43:22,658 --> 01:43:24,478
SPEAKER_1:  You can really make a strong case that...

01:43:25,122 --> 01:43:28,862
SPEAKER_1:  Churchill and Britain were like the turning point of the war.

01:43:29,282 --> 01:43:34,398
SPEAKER_1:  that they're responsible for some of the first failures, major failures of Hitler from a military strategy perspective.

01:43:34,722 --> 01:43:35,486
SPEAKER_1:  But, uh...

01:43:35,970 --> 01:43:38,910
SPEAKER_1:  That's interesting to look at that very recent history.

01:43:39,170 --> 01:43:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  different perspectives. And it's the same problem with the Civil War. We want to tell the story of the Union winning the war.

01:43:44,002 --> 01:43:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  and then everything is good.

01:43:46,146 --> 01:43:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  And it's not the way it worked.

01:43:49,826 --> 01:43:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  What I'm really trying to get at is.

01:43:52,354 --> 01:43:55,134
SPEAKER_0:  When you love your country, you have to study the failures.

01:43:55,746 --> 01:43:57,342
SPEAKER_0:  Because by studying the failures...

01:43:57,794 --> 01:44:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  That's how you improve yourself. And that's where you see where real courage is.

01:44:01,698 --> 01:44:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  It's actually that Lincoln failed for so long.

01:44:04,642 --> 01:44:05,758
SPEAKER_0:  that makes him a great president.

01:44:06,370 --> 01:44:07,742
SPEAKER_0:  He lost more battles than he won.

01:44:08,482 --> 01:44:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  But he learned.

01:44:09,922 --> 01:44:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  And he got it right in the end. Same with Ulysses Grant. I don't want generals. I'm just echoing Lincoln here. I don't want generals. I don't want leaders who think they're gonna get it right the first time, but they're never gonna get it right the first time.

01:44:19,266 --> 01:44:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  you never get right the first time in a experiment right it's

01:44:22,146 --> 01:44:24,478
SPEAKER_0:  Those who can work through failure learn from failure.

01:44:25,122 --> 01:44:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  And we as a society have to start doing that better.

01:44:28,770 --> 01:44:35,614
SPEAKER_0:  We have to not just trumpet the successes. Let's talk about where we failed as Republicans, as Democrats, as independents.

01:44:36,194 --> 01:44:37,342
SPEAKER_0:  and let's move forward from there.

01:44:37,666 --> 01:44:39,710
SPEAKER_1:  in recent years have been a kind of...

01:44:41,154 --> 01:44:42,910
SPEAKER_1:  movement of highlighting.

01:44:43,266 --> 01:44:46,238
SPEAKER_1:  some of the hypocrisy instead of highlighting the racism.

01:44:46,594 --> 01:44:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  the fact that many of the fighting fathers were slave owners, that kind of thing.

01:44:49,922 --> 01:44:52,094
SPEAKER_1:  uh... serve highlighting from the current

01:44:52,834 --> 01:44:54,654
SPEAKER_1:  ethics of our world.

01:44:54,914 --> 01:44:55,294
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:44:55,586 --> 01:44:56,318
SPEAKER_1:  showing that

01:44:56,738 --> 01:45:00,030
SPEAKER_1:  many of the people involved in the war on each side were evil.

01:45:00,450 --> 01:45:02,494
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think about that perspective on history?

01:45:02,722 --> 01:45:04,830
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's super valuable. I think we should.

01:45:05,282 --> 01:45:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, expose the-

01:45:06,786 --> 01:45:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  the gap.

01:45:07,458 --> 01:45:09,278
SPEAKER_0:  between ideals and practice.

01:45:10,242 --> 01:45:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  That doesn't mean we should throw away.

01:45:12,738 --> 01:45:14,590
SPEAKER_0:  the great people who were also hypocrites.

01:45:15,010 --> 01:45:19,134
SPEAKER_0:  because everyone I've studied is a hypocrite. I'm a hypocrite. I think I'm a pretty good father.

01:45:19,394 --> 01:45:32,126
SPEAKER_0:  Luckily, my son is an even better mother, but they're parts of me. I mean, I often find myself telling our children to do things that I didn't do, right? But they're smart and they recognize that and they learn something from that.

01:45:32,482 --> 01:45:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  So let's not cover over.

01:45:34,690 --> 01:45:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  The hypocrisy.

01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  But let's not throw people away for being hypocritical. Here's my view of Thomas Jefferson, which is similar to my view of Abraham Lincoln, right? These are incredibly insightful, thoughtful people.

01:45:44,418 --> 01:45:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  who added so much to our country.

01:45:47,394 --> 01:45:48,222
SPEAKER_0:  but they also

01:45:48,738 --> 01:45:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  created flawed systems.

01:45:51,170 --> 01:45:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  and one of link one of Excuse me, Jefferson's flaws.

01:45:54,210 --> 01:45:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  was even though he saw all the evils of slavery, he was a terrible farmer and he could not imagine.

01:45:58,242 --> 01:46:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  living the lifestyle you live without slaves.

01:46:00,418 --> 01:46:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  He could never work his way out of that.

01:46:02,786 --> 01:46:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  But that doesn't make the Declaration of Independence less valuable. In fact, it makes it more valuable. There's more that we can learn.

01:46:08,706 --> 01:46:09,054
SPEAKER_0:  from that.

01:46:09,218 --> 01:46:10,078
SPEAKER_1:  and to me.

01:46:10,850 --> 01:46:15,454
SPEAKER_1:  On the hypocrisy side, many of the people that participate in cancel culture and these kinds of movements direction always know how to do it.

01:46:16,130 --> 01:46:18,078
SPEAKER_1:  uh... they call everything is racist

01:46:18,338 --> 01:46:19,390
SPEAKER_1:  and so on.

01:46:20,226 --> 01:46:21,342
SPEAKER_1:  Sometimes they're highlighting.

01:46:21,986 --> 01:46:22,622
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:46:23,106 --> 01:46:23,774
SPEAKER_1:  properly.

01:46:24,482 --> 01:46:26,014
SPEAKER_1:  the evils in our current society.

01:46:26,754 --> 01:46:30,782
SPEAKER_1:  but the hypocrisy they have is not realizing if they were placed.

01:46:31,266 --> 01:46:32,222
SPEAKER_1:  in Germany.

01:46:32,770 --> 01:46:33,662
SPEAKER_1:  in the 40s.

01:46:34,178 --> 01:46:36,798
SPEAKER_1:  if they were placed in the position of being.

01:46:37,346 --> 01:46:38,846
SPEAKER_1:  A white Christian.

01:46:39,490 --> 01:46:41,790
SPEAKER_1:  during slavery at the fighting of this country.

01:46:42,114 --> 01:46:45,598
SPEAKER_1:  they would do the same thing. They would do the evils they're not criticizing.

01:46:46,114 --> 01:46:47,518
SPEAKER_1:  uh, most of them.

01:46:47,778 --> 01:46:50,430
SPEAKER_1:  that it takes a truly heroic human.

01:46:51,106 --> 01:46:55,390
SPEAKER_1:  to think outside, to be aware of all the evils going on.

01:46:55,842 --> 01:46:57,278
SPEAKER_1:  around you and

01:46:57,538 --> 01:46:58,238
SPEAKER_1:  Take action.

01:46:58,466 --> 01:47:01,662
SPEAKER_1:  It's easy now on Twitter to call people as racist.

01:47:02,082 --> 01:47:05,182
SPEAKER_1:  What's hard is to see the racism when you're living in it.

01:47:05,474 --> 01:47:06,599
SPEAKER_1:  and your wellbeing is.

01:47:06,599 --> 01:47:07,134
SPEAKER_0:  funded by it.

01:47:08,098 --> 01:47:12,926
SPEAKER_0:  I think that's right. I think to analyze ourselves and look honestly in the mirror is very hard.

01:47:13,410 --> 01:47:16,190
SPEAKER_0:  I also think I make this point in actually all of my books.

01:47:16,610 --> 01:47:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:47:17,506 --> 01:47:19,454
SPEAKER_0:  the real and it's an Eli Vizel point.

01:47:20,098 --> 01:47:24,446
SPEAKER_0:  that a lot of the evil in our world is the evil of silence and just looking away.

01:47:25,314 --> 01:47:27,582
SPEAKER_0:  And one form of that on Twitter is just.

01:47:27,810 --> 01:47:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  hitting like.

01:47:29,346 --> 01:47:31,582
SPEAKER_0:  It's a cheap way.

01:47:31,810 --> 01:47:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  of pretending you're doing something that's important, right?

01:47:35,170 --> 01:47:39,518
SPEAKER_0:  After the Civil War, there's all sorts of bad stuff that happens. I talk about it a lot.

01:47:40,002 --> 01:47:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  there always are people there who could stop it.

01:47:43,426 --> 01:47:48,510
SPEAKER_0:  Most people are not responsible for the bad activities, but most don't do something to stop it.

01:47:49,538 --> 01:47:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  And when I say do something, I mean really do something.

01:47:52,386 --> 01:47:55,102
SPEAKER_1:  And that's also to push back and push back.

01:47:56,066 --> 01:47:57,502
SPEAKER_1:  Silence on Twitter.

01:47:57,794 --> 01:47:59,870
SPEAKER_1:  is not what Eli Oselle was talking about.

01:48:00,418 --> 01:48:07,134
SPEAKER_1:  So sometimes silence on Twitter is the courageous action because you wait and think and learn.

01:48:07,426 --> 01:48:11,902
SPEAKER_1:  and have patience to truly understand the situation before you take actual action.

01:48:12,130 --> 01:48:15,166
SPEAKER_1:  not participate in the outrage crowds on Twitter.

01:48:15,394 --> 01:48:16,286
SPEAKER_1:  the hysteria.

01:48:16,578 --> 01:48:21,453
SPEAKER_1:  of cancellation was hard to do is to speak up when everybody else is silent that's what's hard

01:48:21,453 --> 01:48:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  to do. Right. And to speak up against those who you thought were on your side.

01:48:25,378 --> 01:48:25,758
SPEAKER_1:  Yes.

01:48:26,210 --> 01:48:26,878
SPEAKER_1:  Exactly.

01:48:27,202 --> 01:48:30,078
SPEAKER_1:  Good luck to those on the left who speak up against the left.

01:48:30,754 --> 01:48:34,206
SPEAKER_1:  and the same good luck to those on the right who speak up against the right

01:48:34,818 --> 01:48:35,262
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:48:35,682 --> 01:48:36,862
SPEAKER_1:  It's a lonely place.

01:48:37,218 --> 01:48:42,933
SPEAKER_1:  It's a painful place. That's why walking in the center is tough. You get attacked by both sides. It's a wonderful place.

01:48:42,933 --> 01:48:43,966
SPEAKER_0:  wonderful

01:48:44,514 --> 01:48:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  journey.

01:48:47,842 --> 01:48:53,214
SPEAKER_0:  And what I learned writing this book, every book is a journey. What I learned in this, in the laboratory of this book, right?

01:48:53,922 --> 01:48:54,334
SPEAKER_0:  was.

01:48:54,818 --> 01:48:56,958
SPEAKER_0:  a lot of those figures who do stand up.

01:48:57,922 --> 01:48:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:48:58,498 --> 01:49:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  Even in their own lifetime, they don't get the accolades they deserve, but they make a difference. And that's maybe not enough comfort.

01:49:05,698 --> 01:49:12,158
SPEAKER_0:  because you want to see benefits in your own lifetime. But I think it really matters. And many of the figures I talk about were not even well known in their time.

01:49:12,674 --> 01:49:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  So you can make a difference. You do.

01:49:15,810 --> 01:49:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  Impart something small in the universe that can grow into something better and we shouldn't forget that

01:49:20,770 --> 01:49:24,414
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, that's why I admire Boxer, the horse. I will work harder even if he gets-

01:49:24,770 --> 01:49:26,974
SPEAKER_1:  sent to the slaughter by the evil pigs.

01:49:27,714 --> 01:49:28,839
SPEAKER_0:  You're on Orwell today.

01:49:28,839 --> 01:49:29,758
SPEAKER_1:  Allah Umreen

01:49:30,082 --> 01:49:33,374
SPEAKER_1:  Recently, I mean, it's animal farm is one of my favorite

01:49:33,730 --> 01:49:35,550
SPEAKER_1:  favorite books. I've been recently...

01:49:35,778 --> 01:49:37,758
SPEAKER_1:  Just Emory reading 1984 now.

01:49:38,178 --> 01:49:44,030
SPEAKER_1:  It's been politicized, that book in general, but to me it's a love story. It is a love story. There's a...

01:49:44,258 --> 01:49:45,854
SPEAKER_1:  Like love is the.

01:49:46,466 --> 01:49:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  Thank you.

01:49:47,170 --> 01:49:54,462
SPEAKER_1:  It's a story of an oppressive government, its surveillance state, and the nature of truth being manipulated by wartime.

01:49:55,266 --> 01:49:56,830
SPEAKER_1:  The beacon of hope.

01:49:57,442 --> 01:49:58,622
SPEAKER_1:  in the human heart.

01:49:59,074 --> 01:50:02,526
SPEAKER_1:  that pulls you out, that wakes you up in a world like that.

01:50:02,818 --> 01:50:04,638
SPEAKER_1:  is the love of another human being.

01:50:04,898 --> 01:50:06,494
SPEAKER_0:  It's transcendence. I totally agree.

01:50:06,914 --> 01:50:11,006
SPEAKER_0:  My understanding, you would know better than I would, is that it's now a best-selling book in Russia again.

01:50:11,330 --> 01:50:15,455
SPEAKER_0:  1984? Yeah, it's actually being downloaded more. There was a piece on NPR I heard about.

01:50:15,455 --> 01:50:16,094
SPEAKER_1:  this actually. Yeah.

01:50:16,770 --> 01:50:19,125
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, well, I hope it's because they're looking for love.

01:50:19,125 --> 01:50:22,718
SPEAKER_0:  That's what I was just gonna say. Hopefully not in all the wrong places.

01:50:23,362 --> 01:50:25,566
SPEAKER_1:  Hey, there's no such thing as the wrong places.

01:50:25,922 --> 01:50:29,297
SPEAKER_1:  That's my opinion. I'm the one that showed up naked and drunk to you.

01:50:29,297 --> 01:50:32,309
SPEAKER_0:  classroom. I still surprise that was you.

01:50:32,309 --> 01:50:34,430
SPEAKER_1:  I was wearing a wig, I'm sorry.

01:50:34,946 --> 01:50:37,886
SPEAKER_1:  Quick pause can't take a breath

01:50:39,938 --> 01:50:40,990
SPEAKER_1:  And we're back.

01:50:41,698 --> 01:50:44,766
SPEAKER_1:  John Wilkes Booth assassinated Abraham Lincoln.

01:50:45,474 --> 01:50:48,958
SPEAKER_1:  In his diary, as you write in your book, he wrote about Lincoln.

01:50:49,346 --> 01:50:52,126
SPEAKER_1:  Our country owed all her troubles to him.

01:50:52,642 --> 01:50:55,838
SPEAKER_1:  and God simply made me the instrument of His punishment.

01:50:56,482 --> 01:50:58,270
SPEAKER_1:  The country is not what it was.

01:50:58,946 --> 01:51:06,686
SPEAKER_1:  What was the idea of the country that John Willis Booth believed in? We talked about this country that is constantly being repeated in his writing.

01:51:07,010 --> 01:51:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  For John Wilkes Booth and many other people who are close to the southern part of the country in the Confederacy

01:51:13,570 --> 01:51:16,510
SPEAKER_0:  They believe the country should be a democracy for white people.

01:51:17,058 --> 01:51:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  a bounded democracy.

01:51:19,138 --> 01:51:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  And Booth was horrified and we have to empathize with it, not sympathize, but recognize how strange it seemed to him.

01:51:26,370 --> 01:51:29,758
SPEAKER_0:  that all of a sudden those who were slaves were now soldiers with guns.

01:51:30,626 --> 01:51:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  and he was particularly offended when he saw in Washington DC.

01:51:35,234 --> 01:51:39,422
SPEAKER_0:  a group of African American Union soldiers holding Southern prisoners of war.

01:51:40,258 --> 01:51:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  and um... the world was turned upside down for him democracy for him he believed in democracy but democracy for white people

01:51:46,562 --> 01:51:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  And that justified.

01:51:48,258 --> 01:51:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  uh... mistreating

01:51:49,954 --> 01:51:50,814
SPEAKER_0:  black people for him.

01:51:53,186 --> 01:51:54,910
SPEAKER_1:  So country means.

01:51:55,202 --> 01:51:56,318
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhhhhh B R Y Bye.

01:51:56,738 --> 01:51:57,278
SPEAKER_1:  Wait.

01:51:57,410 --> 01:51:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  people. Yeah.

01:51:58,402 --> 01:52:01,022
SPEAKER_0:  And I don't think it's that different from.

01:52:01,314 --> 01:52:07,006
SPEAKER_0:  And white Christians. White Christians, yes. Yeah, he was not arguing for Jewish emancipation either.

01:52:07,458 --> 01:52:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

01:52:08,450 --> 01:52:12,190
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think that's really different from what we've seen in the 20th century.

01:52:12,514 --> 01:52:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  for people who justify ethnic cleansing or genocide.

01:52:15,842 --> 01:52:20,734
SPEAKER_0:  Let's go to the extreme example of Hitler again that we've talked about before.

01:52:21,858 --> 01:52:25,726
SPEAKER_0:  His view was actually he claimed he wanted a democracy.

01:52:26,018 --> 01:52:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  for Germany.

01:52:26,978 --> 01:52:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  He wanted a democracy of the right Germans.

01:52:29,442 --> 01:52:31,294
SPEAKER_0:  and he wanted those we saw infecting.

01:52:31,778 --> 01:52:35,582
SPEAKER_0:  and mongrelizing the society out. That's in essence what John Wilkes Booth.

01:52:37,090 --> 01:52:40,830
SPEAKER_1:  The scary thing is those kinds of ideas, you can put a pretty face on them.

01:52:41,538 --> 01:52:42,686
SPEAKER_1:  Like you don't have to use...

01:52:43,074 --> 01:52:46,974
SPEAKER_1:  and maybe Hitler didn't until the war started or even

01:52:47,362 --> 01:52:48,158
SPEAKER_1:  parts of the war.

01:52:48,674 --> 01:52:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  make it so clear.

01:52:50,114 --> 01:52:50,910
SPEAKER_1:  that you just want.

01:52:51,682 --> 01:52:54,110
SPEAKER_1:  the certain kind of Germans that have made Germany.

01:52:54,434 --> 01:52:55,294
SPEAKER_1:  a great nation.

01:52:55,778 --> 01:52:58,878
SPEAKER_1:  to be the people that are running that nation and other people who are.

01:52:59,202 --> 01:53:02,718
SPEAKER_1:  not truly interested in the, don't hold the interest of the country at heart.

01:53:03,074 --> 01:53:08,958
SPEAKER_1:  They should go elsewhere where they can flourish also. It's wonderful. But like the good Germans.

01:53:09,346 --> 01:53:13,278
SPEAKER_1:  They've built all these amazing things. We should give them the power and not to the others.

01:53:13,570 --> 01:53:16,213
SPEAKER_1:  and you can put a bunch of flowery language around that.

01:53:16,213 --> 01:53:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  Precisely. It's the argument that's made all the time today against immigration.

01:53:21,154 --> 01:53:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  that the wrong people are coming into our society. It's ironic.

01:53:24,354 --> 01:53:26,526
SPEAKER_0:  because it's often made by those who themselves are immigrants.

01:53:27,266 --> 01:53:33,342
SPEAKER_0:  History teaches us that those who have arrived as immigrants are no more likely to like those who come. In fact, they might be against the next group.

01:53:33,762 --> 01:53:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  for just this reason, because they think they're the right group.

01:53:36,098 --> 01:53:36,638
SPEAKER_1:  Can you?

01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:39,390
SPEAKER_1:  Describe to me if it's useful at all.

01:53:39,874 --> 01:53:41,054
SPEAKER_1:  to know the difference.

01:53:41,762 --> 01:53:43,678
SPEAKER_1:  if there's a difference between white nationalism.

01:53:44,354 --> 01:53:45,918
SPEAKER_1:  white supremacism.

01:53:46,402 --> 01:53:48,446
SPEAKER_1:  and Christian nationalism.

01:53:48,962 --> 01:53:52,830
SPEAKER_1:  Is there an intersection between them? I've heard these terms.

01:53:53,122 --> 01:53:55,870
SPEAKER_1:  used, oh, separatism too, right?

01:53:56,322 --> 01:53:56,766
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:53:57,026 --> 01:54:01,086
SPEAKER_1:  Is there an interesting distinction that permeated that history that still lasts today?

01:54:01,826 --> 01:54:05,534
SPEAKER_0:  I think there's a long history in the United States.

01:54:05,986 --> 01:54:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  of a belief in white supremacy.

01:54:08,354 --> 01:54:10,878
SPEAKER_0:  and it's not unique to the United States, we actually inherit this.

01:54:11,234 --> 01:54:11,710
SPEAKER_0:  from Europe.

01:54:12,354 --> 01:54:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  and white supremacy is the belief that

01:54:16,962 --> 01:54:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  For whatever reason, those with lighter color skin.

01:54:20,866 --> 01:54:23,262
SPEAKER_0:  usually of northern European extraction.

01:54:23,810 --> 01:54:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  are superior, have more rights, are the better people to make decisions.

01:54:28,130 --> 01:54:34,110
SPEAKER_0:  all sorts of things. It's an aesthetic judgment as much as it is a political judgment, and like it's embedded in our society.

01:54:34,370 --> 01:54:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  Right, we inherit that.

01:54:35,970 --> 01:54:36,414
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:54:36,706 --> 01:54:38,270
SPEAKER_0:  Christian nationalism?

01:54:39,042 --> 01:54:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  is the presumption that it's not just your race, but now it's also your Christian belief.

01:54:44,962 --> 01:54:49,214
SPEAKER_0:  and that is actually relatively new there are little pieces of that in our history

01:54:50,498 --> 01:54:56,350
SPEAKER_0:  But many of those who are white supremacists, even those in the Confederacy, are not Christian nationalists.

01:54:56,866 --> 01:55:04,958
SPEAKER_0:  because they don't agree on which kind of Christianity and they don't view those who are from a different denomination of Christianity as being good Christians.

01:55:05,314 --> 01:55:08,190
SPEAKER_0:  There isn't this big tent Christianity in the 19th century.

01:55:08,866 --> 01:55:13,918
SPEAKER_0:  This notion that there is one Christian nation and that we're all part of it.

01:55:14,274 --> 01:55:21,214
SPEAKER_0:  That's actually really a 20th century creation. It precedes the evangelical movement, but it's been made even more popular.

01:55:22,018 --> 01:55:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  but it would not make sense to a confederate.

01:55:24,226 --> 01:55:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  to say we're a white Christian nation. It would make sense to say we're a white.

01:55:28,674 --> 01:55:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  Protestant nation.

01:55:30,210 --> 01:55:33,950
SPEAKER_0:  because they didn't consider Catholics good Christians or a white Presbyterian nation.

01:55:34,690 --> 01:55:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  And so that's something new and I think what's.

01:55:39,362 --> 01:55:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  particularly dangerous about this notion of Christian nationalism.

01:55:43,202 --> 01:55:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  is it creates this false history.

01:55:45,890 --> 01:55:51,358
SPEAKER_0:  saying we've always been together as Christians, that's always how we've defined ourselves, and that's not accurate.

01:55:51,522 --> 01:55:54,558
SPEAKER_1:  Well, one interesting thing. So I recently talked to

01:55:55,074 --> 01:55:55,678
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:55:55,970 --> 01:56:00,382
SPEAKER_1:  a left leaning or maybe a far left political streamer named Destiny.

01:56:00,930 --> 01:56:03,262
SPEAKER_1:  Steven Benell, I don't know if you're familiar with him.

01:56:03,810 --> 01:56:07,935
SPEAKER_1:  He does live streaming debates with people. It's very passionate.

01:56:07,935 --> 01:56:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  I've heard of this, my students have told me.

01:56:10,850 --> 01:56:12,725
SPEAKER_0:  My students are always up on the most hip thing.

01:56:12,725 --> 01:56:15,294
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, that is no the funny thing about him

01:56:15,618 --> 01:56:25,054
SPEAKER_1:  He's already considered like a boomer. He's already the old streamer because he's been doing it for 10 years. He's not the cool kids anymore. Anyway, he goes into some difficult political territory.

01:56:25,442 --> 01:56:28,606
SPEAKER_1:  And he actually had a mini conversation with Nick Fuentes.

01:56:29,410 --> 01:56:30,910
SPEAKER_1:  And he says, I mean.

01:56:31,458 --> 01:56:35,102
SPEAKER_1:  Some of it is humor, but some of it is pretty dark.

01:56:35,650 --> 01:56:40,094
SPEAKER_1:  Hard-hitting sort of criticism is he says that anyone who claims to be a Christian

01:56:40,386 --> 01:56:42,014
SPEAKER_1:  Nationalists. Ask them.

01:56:42,306 --> 01:56:43,902
SPEAKER_1:  If they would rather.

01:56:44,578 --> 01:56:45,182
SPEAKER_1:  have.

01:56:45,538 --> 01:56:46,558
SPEAKER_1:  A million people.

01:56:47,106 --> 01:56:49,598
SPEAKER_1:  or atheists from Sweden who are white.

01:56:50,658 --> 01:56:53,854
SPEAKER_1:  or if you would rather have a million.

01:56:54,338 --> 01:56:55,806
SPEAKER_1:  people from Africa

01:56:56,354 --> 01:56:57,278
SPEAKER_1:  who are Christian come.

01:56:57,826 --> 01:56:59,166
SPEAKER_1:  and the truth comes out.

01:56:59,394 --> 01:57:06,142
SPEAKER_1:  that this is a very surface level, this kind of idea of Christian nationalism is still, underneath it is a deep racism.

01:57:06,530 --> 01:57:08,405
SPEAKER_1:  uh... toward the teacher to his black

01:57:08,405 --> 01:57:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  I think that's, I'm sure that's right.

01:57:10,434 --> 01:57:13,886
SPEAKER_1:  I'm sure that's that's the sense I got into is does not seem to have deep.

01:57:14,370 --> 01:57:17,086
SPEAKER_1:  kind of a historical context to it.

01:57:17,314 --> 01:57:18,110
SPEAKER_1:  It's just, it's just.

01:57:18,466 --> 01:57:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  a different rebranding of the old kind of hate.

01:57:21,122 --> 01:57:26,974
SPEAKER_0:  What I think is important though in drawing this distinction and why it really matters beyond the history of it.

01:57:27,266 --> 01:57:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  is

01:57:28,258 --> 01:57:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  Someone like Lincoln.

01:57:30,018 --> 01:57:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  quotes scripture all the time.

01:57:32,066 --> 01:57:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  The second inaugural is filled, second inaugural address.

01:57:35,330 --> 01:57:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  Gettysburg address filled with biblical references.

01:57:38,338 --> 01:57:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  but he does it in a way that's not Christian nationalist.

01:57:41,858 --> 01:57:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  because he's using the text to bring people together.

01:57:45,314 --> 01:57:47,358
SPEAKER_0:  He's using it as a fable of humanity.

01:57:48,066 --> 01:57:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  And you could say...

01:57:49,506 --> 01:57:52,798
SPEAKER_0:  He's not open to Islamic thinking he's ignorant of the Islamic world.

01:57:53,282 --> 01:57:54,622
SPEAKER_0:  But as a Jew, I'm a Jew.

01:57:54,914 --> 01:57:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  reading and studying Lincoln.

01:57:57,154 --> 01:57:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  I know he's a Christian.

01:57:58,434 --> 01:58:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  But I don't feel excluded from his rhetoric.

01:58:01,186 --> 01:58:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  Because I share that Bible.

01:58:03,458 --> 01:58:04,606
SPEAKER_0:  We have different views.

01:58:04,834 --> 01:58:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  but I don't feel excluded. It actually brings people together. The Christian nationalist approach that we've seen in the 20th century and especially in recent decades

01:58:12,994 --> 01:58:14,590
SPEAKER_0:  is intended to divide people.

01:58:15,426 --> 01:58:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  It excludes juice.

01:58:17,186 --> 01:58:18,174
SPEAKER_0:  It excludes.

01:58:18,690 --> 01:58:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  Christians who don't interpret Christianity their way.

01:58:21,698 --> 01:58:25,630
SPEAKER_0:  And to say that's what we've always done is an entire distortion of our country.

01:58:26,338 --> 01:58:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  and it also hides why this is so dangerous.

01:58:29,186 --> 01:58:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  Insofar as Christianity matters to our country, it should be in the way Lincoln uses it as a set of common texts that many of us resonate with.

01:58:36,674 --> 01:58:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  knowing that we have different rituals and different understandings.

01:58:39,618 --> 01:58:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  not as a way to exclude people.

01:58:41,922 --> 01:58:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  and not as a cover for racism.

01:58:43,650 --> 01:58:55,934
SPEAKER_1:  which is what it is. It's kind of interesting that you could talk about, I've talked to a lot of people, Muslim folks, Jewish folks, Christian folks, there's a way to talk about religion that's inclusive and then that's exclusive. And it's just been...

01:58:56,386 --> 01:59:00,126
SPEAKER_1:  I've been listening to a lot of these interfaith conversations.

01:59:00,386 --> 01:59:01,246
SPEAKER_1:  And they're awesome.

01:59:01,986 --> 01:59:08,638
SPEAKER_1:  They like celebrate the beauty of each religion. They banter and argue with each other about details and so on. But like it feels like love.

01:59:09,026 --> 01:59:11,550
SPEAKER_1:  Like it feels like anybody from any of those religions.

01:59:11,938 --> 01:59:12,510
SPEAKER_1:  uh

01:59:12,898 --> 01:59:14,526
SPEAKER_1:  would feel welcome at that party.

01:59:14,754 --> 01:59:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  and i think that's possible

01:59:17,186 --> 01:59:20,382
SPEAKER_1:  Can you tell me about the disputed election of 1876?

01:59:20,578 --> 01:59:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  So this is fascinating. The 1876 election is one of many elections. We've had some recently.

01:59:25,986 --> 01:59:27,806
SPEAKER_0:  that are intensely controversial.

01:59:28,258 --> 01:59:30,590
SPEAKER_0:  and they're controversial because they're so close?

01:59:31,362 --> 01:59:33,630
SPEAKER_0:  They're controversial because it's not always clear who's won.

01:59:34,498 --> 01:59:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  In 1876, Samuel Tilden, the governor of New York,

01:59:38,690 --> 01:59:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  who's running as a Democratic candidate.

01:59:41,314 --> 01:59:43,070
SPEAKER_0:  uh... wins more votes across the country

01:59:44,130 --> 01:59:45,918
SPEAKER_0:  So everyone knows he becomes president, right?

01:59:46,338 --> 01:59:48,062
SPEAKER_0:  wrong. He doesn't become president because

01:59:48,354 --> 01:59:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  In three states.

01:59:49,730 --> 01:59:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  South Carolina, Louisiana and Florida.

01:59:52,226 --> 01:59:53,662
SPEAKER_0:  It's very, very close.

01:59:54,530 --> 01:59:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  And even though Tilden has more total votes, if he loses those states...

01:59:59,074 --> 02:00:02,366
SPEAKER_0:  the electors in those states, all of which go to the winner of the state.

02:00:02,754 --> 02:00:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  would actually make rutherford be haze the republican candidate president

02:00:06,594 --> 02:00:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  In all three of those states, you also have Republican governors who have just lost, but are still the people who have to certify the election.

02:00:13,634 --> 02:00:15,646
SPEAKER_0:  All three states say that Hays won.

02:00:16,098 --> 02:00:17,694
SPEAKER_0:  even though it's very close and disputed.

02:00:18,178 --> 02:00:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  So Hayes has one more electoral vote.

02:00:21,186 --> 02:00:22,590
SPEAKER_0:  Of course, the Democrats don't accept that.

02:00:23,010 --> 02:00:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  And so we go into February that the inauguration was done in March, not in January, we go from November to February.

02:00:29,858 --> 02:00:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  without clear agreement on who the president is.

02:00:32,546 --> 02:00:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  In the end, there's an agreement that they come to a deal.

02:00:35,810 --> 02:00:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  which is where the Democrats will accept Hayes as president in return for Hayes doing all the things the Democrats want in the South.

02:00:42,850 --> 02:00:43,966
SPEAKER_0:  And so in essence,

02:00:44,290 --> 02:00:45,598
SPEAKER_0:  You have a deal made.

02:00:46,050 --> 02:00:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  that one side will get all its all at once.

02:00:49,762 --> 02:00:51,838
SPEAKER_0:  while allowing the other side to have the figurehead.

02:00:52,802 --> 02:00:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  And so in a certain way, this marks a moment when the Confederacy wins.

02:00:58,338 --> 02:01:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  For example, Hayes has to agree to pull out all federal force from the South.

02:01:02,850 --> 02:01:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  which means there's no protection for fair elections going forward.

02:01:06,178 --> 02:01:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  and you'll see in states like Mississippi.

02:01:08,514 --> 02:01:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  uh... the number of african-american voters will uh... declined and not recover again until the late twentieth century

02:01:16,002 --> 02:01:22,142
SPEAKER_0:  So that's what that election does. And from 1876 until 1896, we have a series of elections that are very close. It happens also.

02:01:22,978 --> 02:01:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  in

02:01:23,714 --> 02:01:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  1888.

02:01:25,058 --> 02:01:30,782
SPEAKER_0:  that the person with the most popular vote loses, that's Grover Cleveland who loses to Benjamin Harrison.

02:01:31,138 --> 02:01:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  And again, we'll have the same issue.

02:01:34,018 --> 02:01:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  where there's a dispute. And so what that election shows us, 1876, 1888,

02:01:39,586 --> 02:01:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  is that our election system and the problem of having an electoral college really complicates things and makes it harder for us to come to any kind of consensus, any kind of agreement.

02:01:47,906 --> 02:01:49,150
SPEAKER_0:  on who's won an election.

02:01:49,378 --> 02:01:50,590
SPEAKER_0:  super important for today.

02:01:51,042 --> 02:01:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  Because...

02:01:51,906 --> 02:01:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  Most of the 20th century we don't have close elections, so it doesn't matter.

02:01:55,074 --> 02:02:00,830
SPEAKER_0:  When we come to a world today where our elections are very close, our system is not well designed to deal with those issues.

02:02:01,474 --> 02:02:07,774
SPEAKER_1:  Do you draw any parallels with our time and what are some key differences? There's been contested elections.

02:02:08,226 --> 02:02:10,174
SPEAKER_1:  Florida Florida Florida

02:02:10,690 --> 02:02:17,534
SPEAKER_1:  uh, so the Al Gore and this, but just contest the election after contested election and of course, most famously recently

02:02:18,082 --> 02:02:22,270
SPEAKER_1:  with the contested election that led to January 6th.

02:02:22,754 --> 02:02:24,222
SPEAKER_0:  So I think...

02:02:24,450 --> 02:02:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  a couple of parallels and a couple of differences. One parallel is that when you have close elections

02:02:29,314 --> 02:02:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  uh... the losing sides never happy

02:02:32,034 --> 02:02:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  It's a myth.

02:02:33,730 --> 02:02:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  when you have a close election, the other side just accepts it and it's not that doesn't happen.

02:02:38,370 --> 02:02:42,910
SPEAKER_0:  and we need to be attentive to that and ready for that. January 6th actually should surprise us.

02:02:43,138 --> 02:02:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  Not because it happened.

02:02:44,642 --> 02:02:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  but because it hadn't happened before.

02:02:46,882 --> 02:02:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:02:48,034 --> 02:02:51,518
SPEAKER_0:  People who lose a close election are never happy and they always think that something has been done.

02:02:51,842 --> 02:02:52,670
SPEAKER_0:  That's one parallel.

02:02:53,058 --> 02:02:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  Second parallel is elections are violent.

02:02:55,938 --> 02:02:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  We have this myth that our elections are peaceful.

02:02:58,530 --> 02:03:03,262
SPEAKER_0:  There's always violence involved in one way or another, violence in either trying to prevent people from voting.

02:03:03,746 --> 02:03:05,534
SPEAKER_0:  or violence in preventing people from preventing.

02:03:06,210 --> 02:03:10,654
SPEAKER_0:  people from voting, right? elections are not peaceful walks in the park.

02:03:11,202 --> 02:03:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  And that's why most countries have a centralized system to manage elections and provide protection for people.

02:03:18,050 --> 02:03:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  We need to think about that. A lot of people don't vote because they're afraid.

02:03:22,626 --> 02:03:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  They don't want to take the time, but they're also afraid that they're going to anger someone or...

02:03:26,338 --> 02:03:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  that they're going to be seen as politicizing an issue.

02:03:28,930 --> 02:03:32,126
SPEAKER_0:  differences. In 1876, there was fraud in the election.

02:03:32,738 --> 02:03:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  uh... there were people who voted two three times one of the things that Ku Klux Klan did

02:03:37,122 --> 02:03:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  Is it prevented black people from voting?

02:03:39,266 --> 02:03:41,662
SPEAKER_0:  and that it helped white people go to multiple voting booths.

02:03:42,722 --> 02:03:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  uh... and this was quite common in the eighteen eighties if you want to vote

02:03:46,338 --> 02:03:49,150
SPEAKER_0:  uh... here's how it happened in a place like chicago new york

02:03:49,634 --> 02:03:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  The Union Boss.

02:03:51,138 --> 02:03:53,470
SPEAKER_0:  from your factory would come and get you at the factory.

02:03:54,146 --> 02:03:54,878
SPEAKER_0:  give you lunch?

02:03:55,202 --> 02:03:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  Get you drunk.

02:03:56,258 --> 02:04:02,526
SPEAKER_0:  and then drive you from one voting booth to another and give you a ballot that you would bring in just and he would watch you deposit that ballot.

02:04:03,426 --> 02:04:06,375
SPEAKER_1:  Sounds pretty nice, not gonna lie. Gotta take that Ch dislike, I wrote the word and we pretty much took five days and we

02:04:06,375 --> 02:04:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  So that's a difference that that is not how our elections work now one of our great accomplishments has been to eliminate

02:04:13,058 --> 02:04:15,806
SPEAKER_0:  virtually all the fraud in our elections. How have we done that?

02:04:16,162 --> 02:04:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  uh... by creating safeguards uh... it is very difficult uh... all the evidence we have is that the minimal fraud that's occurred in elections are onesies and twosies

02:04:26,114 --> 02:04:30,622
SPEAKER_0:  And it's never in the last 20 years had any big difference in the outcome of elections. So that's a-

02:04:31,010 --> 02:04:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  That's a big difference.

02:04:32,258 --> 02:04:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  And then another big difference, I think, is that...

02:04:35,810 --> 02:04:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  In that time, the Democrats and Republicans are on the opposite sides of where they are now and that changes everything. So the Democrats then are the party of the Confederacy.

02:04:44,578 --> 02:04:48,958
SPEAKER_0:  The Democrats are the party of exclusion. The Republicans are more the party of economic expansion.

02:04:49,858 --> 02:04:52,382
SPEAKER_0:  uh... and the republicans of the big ten party

02:04:52,802 --> 02:04:53,662
SPEAKER_0:  We're reversed today.

02:04:54,210 --> 02:04:55,326
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think, uh...

02:04:55,970 --> 02:04:58,078
SPEAKER_1:  because there's much less election fraud.

02:04:59,298 --> 02:05:00,734
SPEAKER_1:  Now, like you described.

02:05:01,794 --> 02:05:07,326
SPEAKER_1:  One of the lessons we want to maybe learn from that is that it doesn't actually have to be election fraud.

02:05:07,682 --> 02:05:12,190
SPEAKER_1:  for either side to claim there's election fraud. It seems like it's more and more common.

02:05:12,802 --> 02:05:15,230
SPEAKER_1:  And it seems to me that in 2024 election.

02:05:15,842 --> 02:05:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  in the United States.

02:05:17,506 --> 02:05:20,222
SPEAKER_1:  If a Republican wins, they would also

02:05:20,706 --> 02:05:21,150
SPEAKER_1:  be.

02:05:21,570 --> 02:05:22,238
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

02:05:23,010 --> 02:05:23,678
SPEAKER_1:  Just

02:05:23,906 --> 02:05:26,398
SPEAKER_1:  maybe just as likely as, as, uh.

02:05:26,850 --> 02:05:29,278
SPEAKER_1:  If a Democrat wins.

02:05:29,634 --> 02:05:30,398
SPEAKER_1:  Adobe.

02:05:31,394 --> 02:05:32,926
SPEAKER_1:  nuanced claims.

02:05:33,506 --> 02:05:34,846
SPEAKER_1:  of election fraud.

02:05:35,714 --> 02:05:37,589
SPEAKER_1:  because it's become more and more normal.

02:05:37,589 --> 02:05:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  I think what this history shows is that our election system

02:05:41,858 --> 02:05:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  makes it easy for people to claim fraud because it's so unnecessarily complex.

02:05:46,946 --> 02:05:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  First of all.

02:05:47,778 --> 02:05:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  We don't have a system where the person who gets the most votes is necessarily the winner.

02:05:51,394 --> 02:05:52,926
SPEAKER_0:  So that already creates one problem.

02:05:53,186 --> 02:05:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  Second problem is everything I talk about this in the book.

02:05:55,938 --> 02:05:57,374
SPEAKER_0:  is controlled at the county level.

02:05:58,434 --> 02:06:01,342
SPEAKER_0:  So what happens with Hayes and Tilden in 1876?

02:06:01,666 --> 02:06:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  is you have one county official who says they think one person won another county official thinks as the other person won there's no centralized system.

02:06:09,154 --> 02:06:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  It would be as if we allowed every airport to control safety in airplanes. Our airplanes would not be safe. Our airplanes are safe because the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board have strict universal guidelines for what makes for a safe plane. And therefore, our planes generally don't fall out of the sky.

02:06:24,066 --> 02:06:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  Our system is very complex.

02:06:26,594 --> 02:06:30,654
SPEAKER_0:  It has complex rules and has too many people who have authority in too many different places.

02:06:31,266 --> 02:06:35,710
SPEAKER_0:  Complexity makes it easier for someone to make an argument that the wrong thing has been done.

02:06:36,066 --> 02:06:39,422
SPEAKER_0:  We should simplify the system. In Brazil, they had a very close election.

02:06:40,322 --> 02:06:45,278
SPEAKER_0:  And it's very hard for Bolsonaro who lost that close election to claim there was fraud.

02:06:45,570 --> 02:06:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  Because there's a central authority run by the judiciary that counted the votes and it's just simple.

02:06:50,114 --> 02:06:51,518
SPEAKER_0:  It's not about which states.

02:06:51,842 --> 02:06:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  It's not about who the county officials were. Did he claim?

02:06:55,586 --> 02:06:57,086
SPEAKER_1:  He has not acknowledged that he lost.

02:06:58,594 --> 02:06:59,646
SPEAKER_1:  to push back on your stuff.

02:07:00,194 --> 02:07:01,118
SPEAKER_1:  on your statement.

02:07:01,346 --> 02:07:05,566
SPEAKER_1:  I'm undefeated in monopoly and risk because anytime I lose, I walk away.

02:07:05,922 --> 02:07:06,718
SPEAKER_1:  C-claim.

02:07:07,010 --> 02:07:09,054
SPEAKER_1:  claiming there was fraud and cheating involved.

02:07:09,506 --> 02:07:12,414
SPEAKER_1:  and I refuse to believe otherwise. I just think that.

02:07:13,122 --> 02:07:15,614
SPEAKER_1:  Accusations of fraud is a narrative.

02:07:15,970 --> 02:07:19,345
SPEAKER_1:  that's disjoint from the reality of whether there was enough fro- 6 i used Frankie jean at the Creating the Movie

02:07:19,345 --> 02:07:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, yeah, I agree. But I think we make it a little easier for that narrative by having a complex convoluted system.

02:07:25,890 --> 02:07:34,462
SPEAKER_1:  And I wonder if there's other improvements that take us into the 21st century that allow for electronic voting. There's all kinds of improvements that seems our system is dragging their feet on.

02:07:34,914 --> 02:07:37,054
SPEAKER_1:  uh... renters for voting on that

02:07:37,314 --> 02:07:38,270
SPEAKER_0:  Let's make this clear.

02:07:38,690 --> 02:07:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  We claim to be the greatest 21st century democracy and we still vote like the 19th century. We're not even in the 20th century.

02:07:45,314 --> 02:07:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  Most people when they went to vote.

02:07:47,202 --> 02:07:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  they actually like.

02:07:48,930 --> 02:07:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  you know, checked a box.

02:07:50,466 --> 02:07:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  and put a piece of paper in a box, right? I mean, that's not 21st century.

02:07:55,042 --> 02:07:59,934
SPEAKER_0:  We can move millions of dollars, maybe billions for you Lex, in bank accounts.

02:08:00,610 --> 02:08:07,326
SPEAKER_0:  From our keyboard. Thank you. From our keyboards. Billions of rubles. Billions of pennies. Not a penny.

02:08:07,618 --> 02:08:10,686
SPEAKER_0:  Why can we move money safely and not vote in the same?

02:08:11,234 --> 02:08:19,070
SPEAKER_1:  And at the same time, so there's security there in the movement of money. And then there's the actual engagement. Most of us, depending on your age demographic.

02:08:19,522 --> 02:08:23,166
SPEAKER_1:  Click like on Facebook or Twitter or TikTok.

02:08:23,618 --> 02:08:24,190
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

02:08:24,930 --> 02:08:26,590
SPEAKER_1:  tens of thousands of times a year.

02:08:27,074 --> 02:08:31,774
SPEAKER_1:  I think this kind of mechanism constantly, and alike is a vote.

02:08:32,226 --> 02:08:35,582
SPEAKER_1:  So you're constantly voting, voting, voting, voting. We love voting. We love-

02:08:35,874 --> 02:08:37,182
SPEAKER_1:  giving our opinion and stuff.

02:08:37,442 --> 02:08:40,510
SPEAKER_1:  It just seems obvious that gamifying the system.

02:08:40,834 --> 02:08:46,238
SPEAKER_1:  which is essential with the election is making it fun to be engaged in different issues. There's also be a case.

02:08:46,882 --> 02:08:51,806
SPEAKER_1:  Now I don't understand these things deeply, but it always seemed to me that issue-based voting...

02:08:52,738 --> 02:08:53,854
SPEAKER_1:  should be the future.

02:08:54,242 --> 02:08:56,190
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like too complicated to vote for.

02:08:56,546 --> 02:08:58,750
SPEAKER_1:  singular people versus on ideas?

02:08:59,394 --> 02:09:00,382
SPEAKER_1:  You know, on Twitter we don't...

02:09:01,154 --> 02:09:04,958
SPEAKER_1:  necessarily vote for people, we vote for ideas. if you like a tweet or not you like it.

02:09:05,378 --> 02:09:06,014
SPEAKER_1:  and so on.

02:09:06,338 --> 02:09:09,475
SPEAKER_1:  Um, that too seems to be like a possibility for improvement.

02:09:09,475 --> 02:09:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  There's certainly a way to improve polling. We could measure public opinion better. We still poll as if we're in the early 20th century. They still actually call people. It's amazing to me.

02:09:18,562 --> 02:09:22,686
SPEAKER_0:  i was talking to one poster they uh... will call a hundred people get one person

02:09:23,170 --> 02:09:24,030
SPEAKER_0:  But they still do that.

02:09:24,386 --> 02:09:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  That makes no sense. You don't mind, right?

02:09:26,498 --> 02:09:29,310
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, well, they try to get cell phones too, but they do call land.

02:09:30,050 --> 02:09:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  But one could create a system that would be far better in the way you're describing it seems to me, Lex.

02:09:34,690 --> 02:09:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  to actually assess what people like and don't like.

02:09:38,050 --> 02:09:38,430
SPEAKER_1:  So.

02:09:38,882 --> 02:09:40,254
SPEAKER_1:  Your book, your work.

02:09:40,578 --> 02:09:43,742
SPEAKER_1:  In general, your perspective on history is.

02:09:44,450 --> 02:09:47,006
SPEAKER_1:  I would say, at least from my perspective, non-partisan.

02:09:47,682 --> 02:09:47,998
SPEAKER_1:  Thank you.

02:09:48,322 --> 02:09:52,894
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, you do exceptionally good job of that despite the attacks and the criticisms.

02:09:53,154 --> 02:10:00,382
SPEAKER_1:  That said, you personally, just the way you speak, my judgment, and you can push back on this, I think you lean left in your politics.

02:10:00,706 --> 02:10:02,846
SPEAKER_1:  on the political spectrum. Maybe you can push back on that.

02:10:03,202 --> 02:10:07,262
SPEAKER_1:  Can you make the case for either perspective or your own personality?

02:10:07,586 --> 02:10:12,030
SPEAKER_1:  as a fan of yours that you do lean left or you don't lean left

02:10:12,674 --> 02:10:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  I think it depends on the kinds of issues we're talking about. I do tend to lean left on the social and cultural issues. Yes.

02:10:18,882 --> 02:10:24,702
SPEAKER_0:  So I'm a believer, a firm believer. I didn't believe this when I was younger. I've come to believe.

02:10:25,154 --> 02:10:33,662
SPEAKER_0:  that people should choose their own lifestyle and that we should get out of the way. I'm a believer, deep believer as a father of a 20 year old woman.

02:10:33,922 --> 02:10:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  that my 20 year old daughter should have the right to make any choice she wants with her body.

02:10:38,370 --> 02:10:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  uh... and if she would again

02:10:40,642 --> 02:10:43,070
SPEAKER_0:  pregnant at a fraternity party at college.

02:10:43,490 --> 02:10:48,702
SPEAKER_0:  uh... she should have the right to decide whether to have a child or not so on those issues that would code me

02:10:49,314 --> 02:10:50,558
SPEAKER_0:  left of center.

02:10:51,042 --> 02:10:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  I'm actually reasonably conservative on fiscal issues.

02:10:56,514 --> 02:10:58,718
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think we should spend money we don't have.

02:10:59,618 --> 02:11:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  I'm skeptical. I've long been skeptical of cryptocurrency and things like that. I know some of your listeners will disagree with me. This part is part of my own ignorance of cryptocurrency.

02:11:07,970 --> 02:11:12,510
SPEAKER_0:  but I'm conservative lowercase c in the way I think about fiscal issues. I worry about that.

02:11:13,506 --> 02:11:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  I am a believer that there are certain areas where the federal government should play more of a role.

02:11:18,818 --> 02:11:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  And there are other areas where things should be left to the localities. And so sometimes that can code me one way or another.

02:11:24,802 --> 02:11:28,927
SPEAKER_0:  but i think i sound sometimes a little more left of center because on the social issues that definitely

02:11:28,927 --> 02:11:39,742
SPEAKER_1:  So that because, well, I mean, there's other explanations not to be grilling you too hard here. No, it's fair. Because you're also an exceptionally respected and successful professor in the university system.

02:11:40,194 --> 02:11:41,950
SPEAKER_1:  where sometimes there is

02:11:42,370 --> 02:11:43,870
SPEAKER_1:  lean towards the left.

02:11:44,546 --> 02:11:47,390
SPEAKER_1:  And the other aspect is, I think, your viewpoints on Trump.

02:11:48,194 --> 02:11:51,998
SPEAKER_1:  uh, where you're a strong critic. Yes. Donald Trump. Yes.

02:11:52,770 --> 02:11:54,718
SPEAKER_1:  And I guess the question I want to ask is...

02:11:55,042 --> 02:11:58,974
SPEAKER_1:  you as a historian, does that color your perspective of history?

02:11:59,778 --> 02:12:00,382
SPEAKER_1:  Can you?

02:12:00,802 --> 02:12:02,142
SPEAKER_1:  Do you ever catch yourself?

02:12:02,402 --> 02:12:02,846
SPEAKER_1:  where

02:12:03,714 --> 02:12:04,862
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe you're...

02:12:05,282 --> 02:12:06,974
SPEAKER_1:  criticism of Donald Trump.

02:12:07,586 --> 02:12:09,566
SPEAKER_1:  might affect how you see the Civil War.

02:12:09,826 --> 02:12:14,014
SPEAKER_1:  Like as you were completely diving in and looking at the Civil War.

02:12:14,562 --> 02:12:17,662
SPEAKER_1:  Are you able to put aside your sort of...

02:12:18,114 --> 02:12:19,934
SPEAKER_1:  the current day political viewpoints.

02:12:20,546 --> 02:12:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  No, I'm not. I think we have to be honest that none of us

02:12:23,842 --> 02:12:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  our objective we strive to be nonpartisan i really like when you said that

02:12:27,586 --> 02:12:28,894
SPEAKER_0:  because I think it's an aspiration.

02:12:29,698 --> 02:12:30,974
SPEAKER_0:  no one is objective

02:12:31,618 --> 02:12:35,582
SPEAKER_0:  We all have our biases. Some people like chocolate, some like vanilla.

02:12:36,194 --> 02:12:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  And it's just, that's just the reality, right? And as far as I know, there's really hard, it's very hard even to biologically explain that.

02:12:43,458 --> 02:12:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

02:12:45,410 --> 02:12:46,334
SPEAKER_0:  My view.

02:12:46,946 --> 02:12:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  is that what a good historian, what a good scholar does, I don't care what their field is.

02:12:50,658 --> 02:12:52,990
SPEAKER_0:  Is your self-conscious of your biases?

02:12:54,082 --> 02:12:56,350
SPEAKER_0:  and you try to...

02:12:56,738 --> 02:12:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  Recognize them as you're doing your research.

02:12:59,746 --> 02:13:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  and you make doubly certain.

02:13:01,698 --> 02:13:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  that where your research seems to reinforce your biases...

02:13:04,770 --> 02:13:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  that you actually have the evidence to make that argument.

02:13:08,034 --> 02:13:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  But I still believe even doing that.

02:13:10,210 --> 02:13:14,270
SPEAKER_0:  that someone with a slightly different perspective might read the same evidence in different ways.

02:13:14,626 --> 02:13:16,190
SPEAKER_0:  That's what makes history vibrant.

02:13:16,706 --> 02:13:20,062
SPEAKER_0:  So I wrote this book in part, as I say in the introduction.

02:13:20,546 --> 02:13:24,222
SPEAKER_0:  Because I was self-critical watching Trump and the things I...

02:13:24,706 --> 02:13:29,470
SPEAKER_0:  quite frankly find deeply dangerous about Donald Trump and about what happened on January 6th.

02:13:29,922 --> 02:13:31,166
SPEAKER_0:  and I found I had not.

02:13:31,842 --> 02:13:34,654
SPEAKER_0:  thought deeply enough about the roots of that in our society.

02:13:35,394 --> 02:13:40,190
SPEAKER_0:  Because I don't believe Trump or any one figure creates these kinds of movements. They come out of a deeper history.

02:13:40,578 --> 02:13:42,430
SPEAKER_1:  just a small site change.

02:13:43,074 --> 02:13:44,286
SPEAKER_1:  I do believe your work.

02:13:44,642 --> 02:13:45,726
SPEAKER_1:  is nonpartisan.

02:13:46,434 --> 02:13:47,774
SPEAKER_1:  But it's also funny.

02:13:48,802 --> 02:13:52,990
SPEAKER_1:  that there are a lot of people on the right that would read your work and say that you're partisan.

02:13:53,442 --> 02:13:53,918
SPEAKER_1:  And I think.

02:13:54,338 --> 02:13:57,022
SPEAKER_1:  I think the reason that can happen sometimes, not strongly though.

02:13:57,346 --> 02:13:58,686
SPEAKER_1:  I think you do a really good job.

02:13:59,074 --> 02:14:02,238
SPEAKER_1:  uh, is like certain the use of certain words also.

02:14:02,914 --> 02:14:07,038
SPEAKER_1:  uh... that i try to be cognizant of that i try not to use words

02:14:07,362 --> 02:14:07,934
SPEAKER_1:  that.

02:14:08,322 --> 02:14:10,078
SPEAKER_1:  trigger people's...

02:14:10,370 --> 02:14:10,910
SPEAKER_1:  tribalism.

02:14:11,170 --> 02:14:11,518
SPEAKER_1:  Mm-hmm.

02:14:11,778 --> 02:14:16,318
SPEAKER_1:  It's kind of interesting, so you have to be also aware of that maybe when you're writing history, when you're writing in general.

02:14:16,610 --> 02:14:18,654
SPEAKER_1:  is if you're interested in remaining.

02:14:18,914 --> 02:14:20,286
SPEAKER_1:  you can put on different hats.

02:14:20,898 --> 02:14:23,646
SPEAKER_1:  You can be carefree and just state your opinion.

02:14:24,098 --> 02:14:27,230
SPEAKER_1:  of criticizing Donald Trump or Joe Biden.

02:14:27,746 --> 02:14:33,493
SPEAKER_1:  or you can be nonpartisan deliberately and that takes skill probably and avoiding certainンドllä

02:14:33,493 --> 02:14:35,998
SPEAKER_0:  And to me it's about choosing your battles.

02:14:36,738 --> 02:14:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  So I tried to write.

02:14:39,362 --> 02:14:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  because I want everyone to read them. I actually think.

02:14:41,762 --> 02:14:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  People on the left and right have a lot to learn from this history. So many people have said to me around the country, this is history I wish I had known before.

02:14:48,450 --> 02:14:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:14:49,698 --> 02:14:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  But there are moments when I use words that I know are controversial because I'm trying to show there's a fact base behind.

02:14:55,522 --> 02:14:55,966
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:14:56,258 --> 02:15:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  white supremacy does exist. I've had people say, I don't think that's, I think that's a politically correct term or it's a woke term.

02:15:03,426 --> 02:15:08,190
SPEAKER_0:  It can be used in the wrong ways. One should not go around calling everything one doesn't like that.

02:15:09,282 --> 02:15:11,582
SPEAKER_0:  But the Confederates were white supremacists.

02:15:11,938 --> 02:15:15,134
SPEAKER_0:  And I use that word because I think it's an accurate descriptor.

02:15:15,458 --> 02:15:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  and we need to recognize that that is.

02:15:17,890 --> 02:15:20,515
SPEAKER_0:  a part of our history, but that does trigger some people.

02:15:20,515 --> 02:15:21,598
SPEAKER_1:  Because that's...

02:15:22,114 --> 02:15:24,894
SPEAKER_1:  that language is used to mean other things currently.

02:15:25,410 --> 02:15:30,206
SPEAKER_1:  So the press will take on certain terms like white supremacists and label everybody white supremacist.

02:15:30,626 --> 02:15:34,974
SPEAKER_1:  Like a lot of people that basically are on the right or something like that. They use this.

02:15:35,202 --> 02:15:40,190
SPEAKER_1:  outraged language and that actually ruins the ability to use the language precisely.

02:15:40,834 --> 02:15:43,006
SPEAKER_1:  Exactly. For historical context. That's exactly right.

02:15:43,234 --> 02:15:46,270
SPEAKER_1:  that's exactly you do have to unfortunately do have to

02:15:46,658 --> 02:15:48,798
SPEAKER_1:  No, actually people disagree, you might disagree with this.

02:15:49,282 --> 02:15:50,430
SPEAKER_1:  but I tend to.

02:15:50,786 --> 02:15:54,046
SPEAKER_1:  try to avoid, like take on responsibility avoiding that language?

02:15:54,722 --> 02:15:55,198
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:15:55,522 --> 02:15:58,270
SPEAKER_1:  Like if the press is using a certain kind of language, I try to avoid it.

02:15:58,658 --> 02:16:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, what I try to do is sometimes avoid it, but where I think the language is necessary. Precise, yeah. To be precise, but also to contextualize.

02:16:06,626 --> 02:16:07,070
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:16:07,362 --> 02:16:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  I don't call all Confederates white supremacists.

02:16:11,426 --> 02:16:13,822
SPEAKER_0:  but I point out where white supremacist ideas.

02:16:14,850 --> 02:16:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  have influenced them.

02:16:16,546 --> 02:16:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  right and i point out where certain individuals are doing things that resonate with that

02:16:20,450 --> 02:16:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  but I'm against these kind of blanket labels and categories.

02:16:24,386 --> 02:16:24,702
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:16:24,994 --> 02:16:28,414
SPEAKER_1:  You also have to speak about white supremacism.

02:16:28,770 --> 02:16:30,846
SPEAKER_1:  in that context in a nuanced way.

02:16:31,106 --> 02:16:35,262
SPEAKER_1:  So people use white supremacists without thinking what that means and they just use it as a slow word.

02:16:35,522 --> 02:16:36,094
SPEAKER_1:  Correct.

02:16:36,354 --> 02:16:37,150
SPEAKER_1:  Evil person.

02:16:37,538 --> 02:16:43,422
SPEAKER_1:  But white supremacy is also just an ideology that a lot of people have believed throughout. Supremacy, whatever, white.

02:16:44,322 --> 02:16:46,366
SPEAKER_1:  black supremacy, whatever supremacy.

02:16:46,722 --> 02:16:50,270
SPEAKER_1:  uh... believing that some people are better than others some group is better than another

02:16:50,722 --> 02:16:52,126
SPEAKER_1:  and there have been nations.

02:16:52,418 --> 02:16:53,918
SPEAKER_1:  built around these kinds of ideas.

02:16:54,242 --> 02:16:57,758
SPEAKER_1:  And a lot of human history is built around those ideas. It's not just.

02:16:57,986 --> 02:16:59,518
SPEAKER_1:  Evil people believe in this.

02:16:59,746 --> 02:17:04,222
SPEAKER_1:  We in the United States of America believe this kind of ideology is not productive.

02:17:04,994 --> 02:17:05,950
SPEAKER_1:  unethical.

02:17:06,434 --> 02:17:07,070
SPEAKER_1:  But those...

02:17:07,298 --> 02:17:08,958
SPEAKER_1:  ideas have been held by a lot of people.

02:17:09,314 --> 02:17:10,910
SPEAKER_1:  and not like fringe groups.

02:17:11,714 --> 02:17:12,286
SPEAKER_1:  but

02:17:12,706 --> 02:17:14,407
SPEAKER_1:  majorities of nations.

02:17:14,407 --> 02:17:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  right i'd say the same about anti-semitism

02:17:17,314 --> 02:17:19,838
SPEAKER_0:  And there are many people who are not anti-Semites.

02:17:20,514 --> 02:17:26,974
SPEAKER_0:  but don't recognize that they're carrying around or promoting anti-semitic ideas or anti-semitic myths.

02:17:27,074 --> 02:17:30,782
SPEAKER_1:  It's a thought that's been held by a lot of people and you need to be convinced out of it.

02:17:31,394 --> 02:17:32,062
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:17:32,578 --> 02:17:35,454
SPEAKER_1:  that requires conversation and being empathetic.

02:17:36,130 --> 02:17:43,710
SPEAKER_1:  It's not just calling somebody an anti-Semite and you're evil because you've ever said something that's kind of a dog whistle against Jewish people.

02:17:44,226 --> 02:17:48,382
SPEAKER_1:  uh... you have to be open-hearted to that that these are these are ideas you have to contend with it that

02:17:48,994 --> 02:17:50,398
SPEAKER_1:  You have to, uh...

02:17:50,914 --> 02:17:52,094
SPEAKER_1:  Ultimately, I think.

02:17:52,674 --> 02:17:57,374
SPEAKER_1:  heal the division behind those ideas by having empathetic conversations with people.

02:17:57,698 --> 02:17:59,102
SPEAKER_1:  Сигурно да скажи redesign или реставрация. Н Bone Mix има poles.Música Agent級

02:18:00,194 --> 02:18:02,686
SPEAKER_1:  I just like saying poop. All right.

02:18:03,298 --> 02:18:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  Ooh, I got a challenge for you.

02:18:05,634 --> 02:18:06,942
SPEAKER_1:  Given that you are.

02:18:07,842 --> 02:18:10,430
SPEAKER_1:  uh, have been an outspoken critic of Donald Trump.

02:18:11,138 --> 02:18:12,638
SPEAKER_1:  Can you say one thing you like?

02:18:12,994 --> 02:18:15,678
SPEAKER_1:  And one thing you don't like about Donald Trump.

02:18:16,162 --> 02:18:19,454
SPEAKER_1:  And perhaps can you do the same for our current president?

02:18:19,842 --> 02:18:21,717
SPEAKER_1:  Joe Biden, one thing you like, one you...

02:18:21,717 --> 02:18:25,982
SPEAKER_0:  thing you dislike. So it's harder for me to do the one thing I dislike because so many things I dislike.

02:18:26,466 --> 02:18:31,678
SPEAKER_0:  But the one thing I like about Donald Trump...

02:18:33,282 --> 02:18:35,422
SPEAKER_0:  he believes that

02:18:36,642 --> 02:18:37,342
SPEAKER_0:  America

02:18:38,434 --> 02:18:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  should be a better country. I disagree on what he thinks it.

02:18:41,602 --> 02:18:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  should be.

02:18:42,498 --> 02:18:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  but he's not someone he's not a decline as to someone who believes the world could be made better

02:18:46,626 --> 02:18:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  I disagree with what he's trying to do. I disagree with how he's trying to do it.

02:18:49,762 --> 02:19:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  But I like the fact that he thinks it can be better. His whole argument for himself is that he can make things better. I don't think he can, but I think things can be made better. So I like the second half of that sentence when he says, I can make things better.

02:19:00,930 --> 02:19:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  take the eye out i like the can be better because there too many people

02:19:04,194 --> 02:19:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  on the left and the right.

02:19:06,018 --> 02:19:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  who think that we can't make things better, we have to accept them as they are, or they're getting worse.

02:19:11,650 --> 02:19:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  I think a world without hope is horrible and I think what he has offered his followers

02:19:16,802 --> 02:19:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  is a kind of hope.

02:19:18,722 --> 02:19:19,390
SPEAKER_1:  So, uh...

02:19:19,650 --> 02:19:21,502
SPEAKER_1:  underneath his message is

02:19:21,986 --> 02:19:23,390
SPEAKER_1:  and a kind of optimism.

02:19:23,650 --> 02:19:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  for the future of this nation. Yeah, it's a narcissistic optimism, but it's still an optimism, yes.

02:19:27,554 --> 02:19:29,470
SPEAKER_0:  that that the he's promising that

02:19:29,762 --> 02:19:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  if you elect him.

02:19:31,362 --> 02:19:32,030
SPEAKER_0:  Again.

02:19:32,354 --> 02:19:33,630
SPEAKER_0:  He will make things better.

02:19:34,530 --> 02:19:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  And I think...

02:19:35,586 --> 02:19:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  people need to be told and we need to believe that we can make things better. So that part I accept and I reject.

02:19:40,962 --> 02:19:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  those who say

02:19:42,594 --> 02:19:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  We can't make things better. My whole historical career is about showing that history gives us tools to make things better.

02:19:48,098 --> 02:19:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  So I like the idea.

02:19:50,210 --> 02:19:55,102
SPEAKER_0:  of trying to make things better and giving people hope and reason to believe that things can be better.

02:19:55,234 --> 02:19:57,950
SPEAKER_1:  What's the main thing you dislike about Donald Trump?

02:19:58,082 --> 02:20:01,630
SPEAKER_0:  I think he has no...

02:20:02,114 --> 02:20:05,182
SPEAKER_0:  concern or care for the welfare of anyone other than himself.

02:20:06,210 --> 02:20:09,182
SPEAKER_1:  So assuming I'm in a basic human psychology perspective.

02:20:12,194 --> 02:20:15,454
SPEAKER_0:  And I think he doesn't even care about his children. I think he's just, I think it's...

02:20:15,874 --> 02:20:23,102
SPEAKER_0:  It's him. I think he's gone into a rabbit hole. He might not always have been this way. I did watch him a long time in New York City when I was growing up in New York.

02:20:23,490 --> 02:20:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  And I think he's been in this path and I think it's an extreme, it's a clinical kind of narcissism.

02:20:29,282 --> 02:20:32,670
SPEAKER_1:  So to you, when you analyze presidents and you've written about presidents.

02:20:32,930 --> 02:20:35,555
SPEAKER_1:  You don't just look at policies and so on, you look at the...

02:20:35,555 --> 02:20:36,734
SPEAKER_0:  You wanna be- You have to.

02:20:37,442 --> 02:20:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  Leadership is about human policy matters. It's one part of the equation. It's not the only part.

02:20:42,274 --> 02:20:43,774
SPEAKER_1:  What about Joe Biden?

02:20:44,066 --> 02:20:45,191
SPEAKER_1:  uh... would you like

02:20:45,191 --> 02:20:47,742
SPEAKER_0:  What do you dislike about Joe Biden? What do you dislike about Joe Biden?

02:20:48,098 --> 02:20:49,726
SPEAKER_0:  is in contrast to Trump.

02:20:49,986 --> 02:20:52,414
SPEAKER_0:  I think Joe Biden really is right now in his career.

02:20:53,250 --> 02:20:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  sees his role as the shepherd of Democ.

02:20:56,130 --> 02:21:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  He really believes that it's his role as president to make our democracy more stable.

02:21:01,058 --> 02:21:02,046
SPEAKER_0:  and more vibrant.

02:21:02,658 --> 02:21:05,982
SPEAKER_0:  I think he really believes, I think that's why he's doing what he's doing right now.

02:21:06,594 --> 02:21:09,182
SPEAKER_1:  And he comes from that system, the political system.

02:21:09,666 --> 02:21:10,622
SPEAKER_1:  That basically...

02:21:11,138 --> 02:21:17,566
SPEAKER_1:  the process of democracy, he's worked there for many decades. It's all he's done. Yeah, that's all he knows that he and he wants.

02:21:17,858 --> 02:21:18,983
SPEAKER_1:  that to propagate from.

02:21:18,983 --> 02:21:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  for what and he's not an extreme democratic partisan at all he's actually

02:21:22,786 --> 02:21:26,878
SPEAKER_0:  He's actually a pretty middle of the road guy on most issues. Some people don't like him for that.

02:21:27,234 --> 02:21:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  but I think he is about democracy.

02:21:30,658 --> 02:21:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  What do I dislike about Biden?

02:21:32,770 --> 02:21:35,838
SPEAKER_0:  I think he does not have the capacity.

02:21:36,450 --> 02:21:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  right now.

02:21:37,954 --> 02:21:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  to provide the language and the...

02:21:41,154 --> 02:21:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  public discussion.

02:21:42,850 --> 02:21:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  of where our country should go.

02:21:45,122 --> 02:21:49,918
SPEAKER_0:  He doesn't have a language to inspire and build.

02:21:50,882 --> 02:21:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  enthusiasm.

02:21:52,546 --> 02:21:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  for the future.

02:21:53,954 --> 02:21:55,646
SPEAKER_1:  That'll probably be one of my.

02:21:56,002 --> 02:21:57,790
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, because I'm a sucker for great speeches.

02:21:58,242 --> 02:22:01,438
SPEAKER_1:  And so for me, that's definitely a thing that stands out.

02:22:01,922 --> 02:22:04,382
SPEAKER_1:  for several reasons, one in a time.

02:22:04,834 --> 02:22:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  Because we've been facing so many challenges like the pandemic.

02:22:08,738 --> 02:22:10,238
SPEAKER_1:  It just seems like a, like...

02:22:10,466 --> 02:22:12,318
SPEAKER_1:  To me, it seems like an easy...

02:22:12,834 --> 02:22:13,502
SPEAKER_1:  like layout.

02:22:14,786 --> 02:22:20,350
SPEAKER_1:  There's so many troubles we're going through that just require a great unifying president or the great

02:22:20,962 --> 02:22:24,126
SPEAKER_1:  It's just, if I were to speak candidly about.

02:22:24,450 --> 02:22:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  kind of the the the speaking ability of obama for example

02:22:27,746 --> 02:22:29,950
SPEAKER_1:  Obama would just destroy this right now.

02:22:30,434 --> 02:22:31,998
SPEAKER_1:  both on the war in Ukraine.

02:22:32,354 --> 02:22:39,230
SPEAKER_1:  on the pandemic, all of it, the unified, there's a hunger for unification, I believe. Maybe people disagree with that, because...

02:22:39,554 --> 02:22:40,670
SPEAKER_1:  They've

02:22:41,058 --> 02:22:44,894
SPEAKER_1:  I think people have become cynical that the divisions that we're experiencing are kind of...

02:22:45,282 --> 02:22:46,910
SPEAKER_1:  already really baked in.

02:22:47,266 --> 02:22:47,934
SPEAKER_1:  They're really...

02:22:48,162 --> 02:22:53,022
SPEAKER_1:  that really planted their feet. But I don't think so. I think there's a huge hunger, maybe a little bit of a quiet hunger.

02:22:53,378 --> 02:22:54,238
SPEAKER_1:  for a unifier.

02:22:54,498 --> 02:22:55,486
SPEAKER_1:  for a great unifier.

02:22:55,906 --> 02:23:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  I agree. I agree. And I think what's what a great speech does is it's like a great piece of music or poetry.

02:23:01,730 --> 02:23:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  It helps you see something in yourself and feel something you didn't feel before.

02:23:06,402 --> 02:23:09,598
SPEAKER_0:  It doesn't overcome all differences. I don't think that speeches are unifying.

02:23:09,954 --> 02:23:11,486
SPEAKER_0:  But I think what they are is they're mobilizing.

02:23:12,130 --> 02:23:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  and you can mobilize people to the same mission.

02:23:14,978 --> 02:23:16,126
SPEAKER_0:  with different points of view.

02:23:19,682 --> 02:23:22,846
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think trauma derangement syndrome is a medical condition?

02:23:23,074 --> 02:23:26,590
SPEAKER_1:  Also, is there such thing as Biden derangement syndrome?

02:23:26,978 --> 02:23:27,966
SPEAKER_1:  What I mean by that?

02:23:28,290 --> 02:23:31,198
SPEAKER_1:  It's a funny kind of question.

02:23:31,458 --> 02:23:32,926
SPEAKER_1:  But why are people so-

02:23:33,314 --> 02:23:34,526
SPEAKER_1:  deeply outraged.

02:23:34,978 --> 02:23:36,638
SPEAKER_1:  seemingly beyond reason.

02:23:37,282 --> 02:23:38,366
SPEAKER_1:  at their hatred.

02:23:39,170 --> 02:23:40,414
SPEAKER_1:  or support on Donald Trump.

02:23:40,834 --> 02:23:41,982
SPEAKER_1:  but hatred in particular.

02:23:42,338 --> 02:23:43,198
SPEAKER_1:  I've seen a lot of.

02:23:43,682 --> 02:23:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  friends and people I respect.

02:23:46,338 --> 02:23:47,870
SPEAKER_1:  lose their mind completely.

02:23:49,186 --> 02:23:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  So I'm not sure it's a medical condition or not because I'm not a medical.

02:23:53,314 --> 02:23:56,689
SPEAKER_0:  doctor so I you know I might my kids say I'm the wrong kind of doctor.

02:23:56,689 --> 02:24:04,670
SPEAKER_1:  I'm a doctor, so let me take you over from here. No, the fact that you get the doctor sign after getting a PhD is a ridiculous hilarity to me.

02:24:05,026 --> 02:24:06,151
SPEAKER_1:  Hilarious, ridiculous.

02:24:06,151 --> 02:24:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  As the wrong kind of doctor, I'm not going to comment on whether it's a medical condition, but I do think you're onto something.

02:24:12,898 --> 02:24:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  I think there is a way in which, um,

02:24:16,226 --> 02:24:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  these men.

02:24:18,402 --> 02:24:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  become.

02:24:19,842 --> 02:24:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  Touchstones of anger.

02:24:22,050 --> 02:24:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  and there's all kinds of anger and anxiety that people have.

02:24:26,242 --> 02:24:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  and I've seen this in other historical periods.

02:24:28,738 --> 02:24:30,334
SPEAKER_0:  You center it on.

02:24:31,042 --> 02:24:31,614
SPEAKER_0:  one person.

02:24:32,898 --> 02:24:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  uh... in a way that's john wilkes booth in lincoln

02:24:36,162 --> 02:24:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  He actually didn't have a personal beef with Lincoln.

02:24:38,690 --> 02:24:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  It was at all the things he feared.

02:24:41,186 --> 02:24:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  were manifest.

02:24:43,010 --> 02:24:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, in that.

02:24:44,514 --> 02:24:45,150
SPEAKER_0:  And I think.

02:24:45,602 --> 02:24:48,638
SPEAKER_0:  That's an old story and then it's made worse by social media.

02:24:49,378 --> 02:24:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  and the way we're bombarded and it's like...

02:24:52,770 --> 02:24:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  It becomes a drug. I mean, there are people I know who hate Trump or Biden so much and just watch them.

02:24:58,850 --> 02:25:06,974
SPEAKER_0:  It's not that they don't watch them, it's that they do watch them, right? And it's just sort of, and it triggers you and, and you get hateful and then you feel like you've done something.

02:25:07,202 --> 02:25:09,246
SPEAKER_0:  by shouting out your hate or typing in.

02:25:09,954 --> 02:25:15,390
SPEAKER_0:  and and so i don't know if it's a derangement center i think it's a it's a way in which our energy gets channeled

02:25:15,810 --> 02:25:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  and expressed in totally useless ways.

02:25:19,682 --> 02:25:24,094
SPEAKER_1:  That's the interesting psychology which reminds me I need to explore that because I've noticed that

02:25:24,354 --> 02:25:25,086
SPEAKER_1:  Believe it or not.

02:25:25,602 --> 02:25:26,686
SPEAKER_1:  It's easy for me to believe.

02:25:26,914 --> 02:25:29,054
SPEAKER_1:  But there's people watching this right now.

02:25:29,602 --> 02:25:30,558
SPEAKER_1:  who really hate me.

02:25:31,298 --> 02:25:38,782
SPEAKER_1:  and they're watching because they hate me. They hate the way I look, the way I speak, the mumbling, all of that, and they're still watching.

02:25:39,298 --> 02:25:39,646
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:25:39,906 --> 02:25:40,286
SPEAKER_1:  I'd like to

02:25:40,546 --> 02:25:43,614
SPEAKER_1:  to say that as I nervous.

02:25:44,034 --> 02:25:45,342
SPEAKER_1:  I'm trying to explain myself.

02:25:45,634 --> 02:25:48,254
SPEAKER_1:  I like to say that that's not a productive way. I get it.

02:25:50,402 --> 02:25:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  I understand, there's a kind of-

02:25:52,450 --> 02:25:53,182
SPEAKER_1:  cus cuz I

02:25:54,018 --> 02:26:01,086
SPEAKER_1:  What is it? Is it the same psychological effect when you see a car crash and you keep staring? Is it some kind of thing that pulls you in? Totally.

02:26:01,314 --> 02:26:02,686
SPEAKER_1:  but I feel like...

02:26:02,978 --> 02:26:07,390
SPEAKER_1:  It's that feeling, this is probably slightly different, but you kinda want to-

02:26:08,002 --> 02:26:12,670
SPEAKER_1:  You want to maybe feel something and there's an anger in you already, frustrations from day to day life.

02:26:12,930 --> 02:26:18,883
SPEAKER_1:  Life is hard and you just want to channel that anger towards something. But the internet really makes that easy for some reason.

02:26:18,883 --> 02:26:22,878
SPEAKER_0:  And it makes sense of your life. That's the problem. For people whose lives are chaos.

02:26:23,746 --> 02:26:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  hating you and blaming you.

02:26:25,506 --> 02:26:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  gives order to their lives.

02:26:27,330 --> 02:26:29,955
SPEAKER_1:  If it makes you happy, please continue.

02:26:29,955 --> 02:26:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  I'm curious, does it bother, it seems to bother you though, doesn't it?

02:26:32,834 --> 02:26:39,198
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, hate of any kind, not towards me, just the people. Because I think about them, and I tend to think that most people are.

02:26:39,714 --> 02:26:43,294
SPEAKER_1:  our amazing human beings that have a capacity to do great things in this world.

02:26:43,618 --> 02:26:44,510
SPEAKER_1:  And so I just think.

02:26:46,082 --> 02:26:48,030
SPEAKER_1:  That's not a productive way of being.

02:26:48,258 --> 02:26:52,318
SPEAKER_1:  psychologically, for anything whatsoever. Everybody has quirks that you can hate.

02:26:52,898 --> 02:26:57,342
SPEAKER_1:  but you just focus on the really positive stuff and you celebrate that stuff and that feels good. Dehza!

02:26:57,666 --> 02:26:58,622
SPEAKER_1:  momentum to it.

02:26:59,138 --> 02:27:05,118
SPEAKER_1:  I guess the hate has a momentum to it too, and that's what I'm trying to highlight. If you follow the momentum of hate, that's...

02:27:05,474 --> 02:27:08,286
SPEAKER_1:  going to maybe feel good in the short term, but it's not.

02:27:08,802 --> 02:27:10,782
SPEAKER_1:  is gonna fuck you over more and more in your life.

02:27:11,202 --> 02:27:13,827
SPEAKER_1:  And you have to be cognizant of that as you interact with each other.

02:27:13,827 --> 02:27:15,646
SPEAKER_0:  I agree with everything you said, but...

02:27:15,874 --> 02:27:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

02:27:16,994 --> 02:27:20,510
SPEAKER_0:  people who do things that are influential and serious.

02:27:21,090 --> 02:27:22,334
SPEAKER_0:  There always are some people who hate them.

02:27:23,266 --> 02:27:26,142
SPEAKER_1:  I suppose that, but I wanted to show the difference between.

02:27:26,818 --> 02:27:27,774
SPEAKER_1:  philosophical

02:27:28,162 --> 02:27:30,526
SPEAKER_1:  disagreement that borders on hate and like.

02:27:30,978 --> 02:27:32,702
SPEAKER_1:  uh... what's called a key watching

02:27:33,346 --> 02:27:36,254
SPEAKER_1:  where you just, which is what I would say TDS is.

02:27:36,546 --> 02:27:38,750
SPEAKER_1:  which is you're almost enjoying.

02:27:39,490 --> 02:27:47,102
SPEAKER_1:  how much you hate this person, you're sitting in their hate and you forgot, you lose all reason, you lose everything, your capacity to think as an individual.

02:27:47,362 --> 02:27:49,886
SPEAKER_1:  to empathize with others, use all of that.

02:27:50,210 --> 02:27:52,574
SPEAKER_1:  You're in the smuck of hate and you.

02:27:52,802 --> 02:27:53,118
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:27:53,730 --> 02:27:56,062
SPEAKER_1:  it somehow it helps you make sense.

02:27:56,290 --> 02:27:58,558
SPEAKER_1:  of this particular difficult moment in your life.

02:27:58,818 --> 02:28:00,254
SPEAKER_1:  but otherwise it just...

02:28:00,770 --> 02:28:02,238
SPEAKER_1:  It just seems like a shitty way to live.

02:28:02,498 --> 02:28:04,894
SPEAKER_1:  But disagreement definitely, I like disagreement.

02:28:05,250 --> 02:28:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  But I guess what I'm saying is, and I think this is your message too, right? Is that, um...

02:28:10,786 --> 02:28:15,582
SPEAKER_0:  Don't let the fact that people don't like you or even that some people hate you stop you from doing the right thing.

02:28:16,130 --> 02:28:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  Think about how you can perhaps trigger them less.

02:28:18,882 --> 02:28:22,590
SPEAKER_0:  but don't stop what you're doing. I see too many and this is why I bring this up.

02:28:23,010 --> 02:28:26,430
SPEAKER_0:  Too many of my students, too many young, very talented people.

02:28:26,914 --> 02:28:28,958
SPEAKER_0:  who are afraid to take risks.

02:28:29,538 --> 02:28:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  because they're afraid that someone will hate them.

02:28:31,874 --> 02:28:33,342
SPEAKER_0:  And that can't get in your way.

02:28:33,794 --> 02:28:35,742
SPEAKER_1:  The reality is most people

02:28:36,450 --> 02:28:38,238
SPEAKER_1:  or there will always be at least one person.

02:28:39,682 --> 02:28:41,438
SPEAKER_1:  that will have you back.

02:28:42,018 --> 02:28:43,710
SPEAKER_1:  and that will support you, just focus on them.

02:28:44,226 --> 02:28:45,694
SPEAKER_1:  as long as you're doing the right thing.

02:28:45,922 --> 02:28:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  I'll focus on them.

02:28:47,074 --> 02:28:47,934
SPEAKER_1:  for the strength.

02:28:48,194 --> 02:28:49,150
SPEAKER_1:  but in general.

02:28:49,570 --> 02:28:54,846
SPEAKER_1:  I'm exaggerating here because most of the time 99% of people are supportive on the internet.

02:28:55,234 --> 02:28:58,046
SPEAKER_1:  is just something about the human psychology.

02:28:58,434 --> 02:29:00,446
SPEAKER_1:  really stands out to you when somebody criticizes.

02:29:00,738 --> 02:29:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  but it's easy on the internet

02:29:02,274 --> 02:29:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  This is historically different from where we were before in a society.

02:29:05,634 --> 02:29:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  It's very easy now to say hurtful things to people and not have to even deal with them looking at you in the face. One of the things that encourages politeness is to be polite.

02:29:14,210 --> 02:29:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  is the fact that we're looking at one another.

02:29:16,706 --> 02:29:19,230
SPEAKER_0:  and I don't, we are naturally programmed.

02:29:19,586 --> 02:29:20,958
SPEAKER_0:  not to want the other person.

02:29:21,538 --> 02:29:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  to react to us in certain ways, but when we don't see their face.

02:29:26,178 --> 02:29:28,053
SPEAKER_0:  It's very easy to say all kinds of things.

02:29:28,053 --> 02:29:30,078
SPEAKER_1:  Let me actually comment on that point.

02:29:30,402 --> 02:29:31,806
SPEAKER_1:  There's a lot of people on the internet.

02:29:32,098 --> 02:29:33,278
SPEAKER_1:  that say that I don't.

02:29:33,890 --> 02:29:34,334
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

02:29:34,882 --> 02:29:38,590
SPEAKER_1:  to push back on points or criticize people or ask the hard questions enough.

02:29:38,882 --> 02:29:40,766
SPEAKER_1:  First of all, oftentimes I disagree with that.

02:29:41,122 --> 02:29:41,598
SPEAKER_1:  assessment.

02:29:42,114 --> 02:29:42,814
SPEAKER_1:  Просо!

02:29:43,874 --> 02:29:47,518
SPEAKER_1:  I don't think you guys realize how hard that is to do when you're sitting with a person.

02:29:48,482 --> 02:29:53,598
SPEAKER_1:  I don't care about access. I don't care about them being famous, just in a basic human level. It's really hard.

02:29:53,858 --> 02:29:54,878
SPEAKER_1:  to ask a hard question.

02:29:55,714 --> 02:29:58,339
SPEAKER_0:  from a place of when i'm sitting here you see me ask me

02:29:58,339 --> 02:30:05,822
SPEAKER_1:  No, this is a super fun when this brilliant people like you there's nothing to push back on that's it that's easy but there's a basic human thing

02:30:06,434 --> 02:30:07,326
SPEAKER_1:  uh... that doesn't

02:30:07,810 --> 02:30:10,846
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's almost easier to be a journalist, like journalists do this well.

02:30:11,074 --> 02:30:13,406
SPEAKER_1:  where they don't have empathy for the person.

02:30:13,762 --> 02:30:15,454
SPEAKER_1:  They're just asking the hard questions.

02:30:15,778 --> 02:30:19,070
SPEAKER_1:  uh... so where were you at this time last night

02:30:19,522 --> 02:30:24,574
SPEAKER_1:  because that's very suspicious, it's in contradiction to what you said, and they're just doing factual stuff.

02:30:24,802 --> 02:30:25,118
SPEAKER_1:  And it.

02:30:25,506 --> 02:30:30,270
SPEAKER_1:  If you actually truly have a conversation with another human being you empathize, it's very difficult.

02:30:31,010 --> 02:30:34,110
SPEAKER_1:  because they have a story, they have a vision of themselves.

02:30:34,338 --> 02:30:36,030
SPEAKER_1:  That they're the good person.

02:30:36,354 --> 02:30:38,078
SPEAKER_1:  and to call somebody a liar.

02:30:38,722 --> 02:30:39,902
SPEAKER_1:  while having empathy.

02:30:40,194 --> 02:30:43,166
SPEAKER_1:  basically imply that they're a liar, that's damn damn hard.

02:30:43,394 --> 02:30:43,742
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:30:44,034 --> 02:30:45,566
SPEAKER_1:  So anyway, but I'm...

02:30:46,370 --> 02:30:48,510
SPEAKER_1:  Well said. I agree. Trying to figure this thing out.

02:30:49,154 --> 02:30:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  Can you make the case that the January 6th storming of the US Capitol

02:30:52,930 --> 02:30:53,854
SPEAKER_1:  is the big deal.

02:30:54,210 --> 02:30:56,350
SPEAKER_1:  and can you make the case that it is not a big deal?

02:30:57,538 --> 02:31:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  I think the case is overwhelming that it was a big deal. I opened the book with this before going back to the end of the Civil War because I think it echoes that moment.

02:31:05,922 --> 02:31:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  Um, you had a group of people who, um, literally

02:31:10,690 --> 02:31:11,646
SPEAKER_0:  tried to stop.

02:31:12,418 --> 02:31:13,982
SPEAKER_0:  The peaceful transfer of power.

02:31:14,786 --> 02:31:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  and we're intending

02:31:16,770 --> 02:31:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  and there's overwhelming evidence of this.

02:31:19,298 --> 02:31:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  if they had caught the vice president.

02:31:21,634 --> 02:31:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  or the Speaker of the House.

02:31:24,194 --> 02:31:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  to do bodily harm to them or to kidnap them.

02:31:27,234 --> 02:31:34,238
SPEAKER_0:  So this was a coup d'etat. That is the definition of a coup d'etat when you try to capture and prevent elected officials from doing their job.

02:31:34,786 --> 02:31:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  That's a huge deal.

02:31:36,066 --> 02:31:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  that had happened before in our country in...

02:31:38,338 --> 02:31:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  States. I talk about this in Louisiana, in Tennessee, and places like that after the Civil War, but it never happened in the Capitol. That's a huge deal. That is, if I might say, that's like third, what we would think of as third world behavior.

02:31:50,274 --> 02:31:56,254
SPEAKER_0:  in our society and no offense to those from other parts of the world. I'm just trying to make a point as how we see that is happening somewhere else not here.

02:31:56,802 --> 02:31:57,726
SPEAKER_0:  That's a big fucking deal.

02:31:58,946 --> 02:32:00,638
SPEAKER_0:  uh... the case is not a big deal

02:32:01,634 --> 02:32:04,030
SPEAKER_0:  I guess the case to make there is that they didn't succeed.

02:32:04,802 --> 02:32:10,878
SPEAKER_0:  The case that it's not a big deal is not that their intentions were not bad. I don't see how you can defend their intentions.

02:32:11,202 --> 02:32:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  the cases that the cases are the deals of a bunch of clowns

02:32:15,554 --> 02:32:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  and uh... yeah they

02:32:17,282 --> 02:32:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  Broke in.

02:32:18,434 --> 02:32:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  uh... but in the end once they got in there that you know what to do which is true

02:32:21,890 --> 02:32:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  And so, you know.

02:32:23,778 --> 02:32:25,630
SPEAKER_0:  I think a professional coup plotter.

02:32:26,146 --> 02:32:27,486
SPEAKER_0:  would say these were the amateurs.

02:32:28,258 --> 02:32:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  and that they had no real chance of succeeding because...

02:32:31,586 --> 02:32:36,670
SPEAKER_0:  Once they got into the capital, they had no plan what to do next. What are they going to do? You know, steal stapler from

02:32:37,026 --> 02:32:38,814
SPEAKER_0:  Nancy Pelosi's office.

02:32:39,234 --> 02:32:41,662
SPEAKER_0:  they didn't seem to have a plan of what ended up happening date

02:32:42,178 --> 02:32:43,070
SPEAKER_0:  They left the building.

02:32:43,522 --> 02:32:45,886
SPEAKER_1:  Well that would be the case, that's not a big deal.

02:32:46,434 --> 02:32:49,758
SPEAKER_1:  because their intention was not to overthrow.

02:32:50,274 --> 02:32:51,454
SPEAKER_1:  Their attention was to...

02:32:51,714 --> 02:32:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  protest.

02:32:52,610 --> 02:32:54,485
SPEAKER_1:  because if the intention was to overthrow, it would be my...

02:32:54,485 --> 02:33:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  more organized. I think the evidence is pretty overwhelming that they intended to stop, that they were there to stop the certification of the election. They were there to prevent Donald Trump from having to leave office.

02:33:04,738 --> 02:33:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  They just didn't have a good plan. This was the Keystone Cops.

02:33:08,802 --> 02:33:14,046
SPEAKER_1:  So you're saying there is some possibly statistically some possibility that this would have

02:33:14,754 --> 02:33:17,379
SPEAKER_1:  succeeded at halting the basic process of demand.

02:33:17,379 --> 02:33:20,638
SPEAKER_0:  You could imagine a scenario where it might have if they had gotten lucky. Sure.

02:33:21,026 --> 02:33:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  if they had caught the vice president.

02:33:23,554 --> 02:33:24,254
SPEAKER_1:  But what could have?

02:33:24,674 --> 02:33:25,799
SPEAKER_1:  If they caught the Vice President...

02:33:25,799 --> 02:33:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  They couldn't go on and certify that.

02:33:27,394 --> 02:33:31,614
SPEAKER_1:  He has to be there. He has to. But don't you think that would resolve itself to police action and so on?

02:33:32,098 --> 02:33:33,406
SPEAKER_1:  My question is how much?

02:33:33,826 --> 02:33:35,838
SPEAKER_1:  How much is this individual hooligans?

02:33:36,546 --> 02:33:38,750
SPEAKER_1:  and how much of this is a gigantic movement.

02:33:39,266 --> 02:33:41,141
SPEAKER_1:  that's challenging the very fabric of.

02:33:41,141 --> 02:33:42,846
SPEAKER_0:  It's not a gigantic movement.

02:33:43,458 --> 02:33:51,006
SPEAKER_0:  but it was a small coup d'etat that could have actually made the transition much more difficult. Was there a scenario where Donald Trump stayed in office legitimately? No.

02:33:51,522 --> 02:33:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  But was there a scenario where they created a great deal of chaos that further undermine our democracy? Absolutely, yes. Here's how it would happen, right?

02:33:58,882 --> 02:33:59,902
SPEAKER_0:  They capture Pence.

02:34:00,546 --> 02:34:02,974
SPEAKER_0:  Right? They either kidnap him and try to ransom him.

02:34:04,066 --> 02:34:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  or they, which is what they were trying to do with the Michigan governor, Governor Whitmer.

02:34:08,322 --> 02:34:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  or they kill him.

02:34:09,762 --> 02:34:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  And then Donald Trump says, okay, well, there's no vice president, so you can't certify.

02:34:14,018 --> 02:34:18,143
SPEAKER_0:  The Senate would choose someone else to be vice president, but Donald Trump says no, that's not legitimate.

02:34:18,143 --> 02:34:20,393
SPEAKER_1:  as possible as Donald Trump would say something like that.

02:34:20,393 --> 02:34:21,022
SPEAKER_0:  Absolutely.

02:34:22,082 --> 02:34:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  I disagree with you. He said...

02:34:24,162 --> 02:34:27,943
SPEAKER_0:  that morning that Penn should not certify. He said that morning.

02:34:27,943 --> 02:34:29,502
SPEAKER_1:  But there's a difference between sort of...

02:34:29,794 --> 02:34:31,838
SPEAKER_1:  No, no, he said it at a rally.

02:34:32,098 --> 02:34:35,486
SPEAKER_1:  Sure, rally rhetoric. And there is a threshold.

02:34:36,002 --> 02:34:37,127
SPEAKER_1:  It feels like a big.

02:34:37,127 --> 02:34:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  He asked people around him.

02:34:39,490 --> 02:34:47,902
SPEAKER_0:  in the Oval Office how he could make that happen. He tried to get a new person appointed attorney general who would do that. He tried to find legal justification for it.

02:34:48,386 --> 02:34:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  I think the evidence is overwhelming.

02:34:51,394 --> 02:34:54,334
SPEAKER_0:  that Trump was supportive of efforts after

02:34:54,978 --> 02:34:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  The election didn't go the way he wanted.

02:34:57,218 --> 02:34:58,334
SPEAKER_0:  to keep him in office.

02:34:59,074 --> 02:35:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:35:00,482 --> 02:35:02,206
SPEAKER_0:  whether that's legally actionable.

02:35:02,434 --> 02:35:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  And whether one thinks that means he's a bad president or not is a matter of opinion. But facts....

02:35:08,130 --> 02:35:09,150
SPEAKER_1:  are facts.

02:35:09,922 --> 02:35:18,430
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I just wonder if it's possible for him to have state president in this, in this kind of context. No, it seems like a heated, just like you said, elections can even be violent.

02:35:18,850 --> 02:35:21,534
SPEAKER_1:  They're heated, people are very upset.

02:35:22,050 --> 02:35:24,702
SPEAKER_1:  When Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016.

02:35:25,378 --> 02:35:27,038
SPEAKER_1:  I was in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

02:35:27,938 --> 02:35:29,822
SPEAKER_1:  the amount of anger

02:35:30,786 --> 02:35:31,486
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhhh...

02:35:31,810 --> 02:35:35,038
SPEAKER_1:  house just get the energy I was getting from people

02:35:37,026 --> 02:35:40,483
SPEAKER_1:  I, if, if there was any way to channel that anger, I think people.

02:35:40,483 --> 02:35:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  be in trouble. But let's but let's anger. Yeah, I agree with that. And that is right. And elections are violent, as I said,

02:35:46,498 --> 02:35:47,422
SPEAKER_0:  But this is different.

02:35:47,842 --> 02:35:53,950
SPEAKER_0:  This is the person in the office of the presidency using the power of the presidency.

02:35:54,274 --> 02:35:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  to try to stay in office.

02:35:56,226 --> 02:36:01,662
SPEAKER_0:  to imperil people's lives, to distort our government out of scale we had not seen before.

02:36:01,954 --> 02:36:11,582
SPEAKER_0:  And these are not opinions of mine. We have the documentary evidence. We have the testimony from people about this. We can differ over what you think of his presidency as a whole.

02:36:12,290 --> 02:36:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  We can differ over whether you think he should be held legally responsible. Those are matters of opinion.

02:36:16,834 --> 02:36:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  But the facts are he sat on January 6th, watched it on TV.

02:36:22,210 --> 02:36:24,094
SPEAKER_0:  did not send ever.

02:36:25,058 --> 02:36:28,542
SPEAKER_0:  ever did he ever send any protection for congress that is his job

02:36:29,794 --> 02:36:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  and throughout asked continued to ask how.

02:36:33,698 --> 02:36:35,870
SPEAKER_0:  this certification could be prevented.

02:36:36,354 --> 02:36:38,686
SPEAKER_1:  To you, that's not incompetence, that's malevolence.

02:36:38,978 --> 02:36:39,518
SPEAKER_0:  Absolutely.

02:36:40,898 --> 02:36:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  If I watch.

02:36:42,146 --> 02:36:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  My children.

02:36:43,650 --> 02:36:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  getting harmed and I don't do something about it. I'm watching it.

02:36:47,266 --> 02:36:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  And in fact, I take action.

02:36:49,698 --> 02:36:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  that tries to help those who are doing the harm.

02:36:53,122 --> 02:36:59,294
SPEAKER_0:  you would not just an incompetent president you would do parent you'd say it was a negligent parent and you call parental support to take away my

02:37:01,218 --> 02:37:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  I was troubled by the way the press covered it, that they politicized the crap out of it.

02:37:06,242 --> 02:37:06,750
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

02:37:07,906 --> 02:37:17,534
SPEAKER_1:  and not just the press, but also Congress itself. It just seemed like impeachment and all of this. There just seemed to be a kind of circus that wasn't interested in democracy.

02:37:18,114 --> 02:37:20,478
SPEAKER_1:  or non-partisanship.

02:37:21,922 --> 02:37:22,334
SPEAKER_1:  I don't.

02:37:22,882 --> 02:37:23,614
SPEAKER_1:  So it's very.

02:37:23,874 --> 02:37:27,166
SPEAKER_1:  difficult for me to see the situation with clear eyes.

02:37:27,586 --> 02:37:31,454
SPEAKER_1:  because it's been colored by the press. It's very difficult for me to know what is even true.

02:37:32,482 --> 02:37:33,534
SPEAKER_0:  Members of Congress.

02:37:34,338 --> 02:37:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  including our members of Congress from our district and others, right?

02:37:38,114 --> 02:37:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  their lives were threatened.

02:37:40,418 --> 02:37:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  They were traumatized.

02:37:42,722 --> 02:37:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  I have a lot of students, at least a dozen who are staff members.

02:37:46,946 --> 02:37:48,510
SPEAKER_0:  more than half for Republicans.

02:37:49,826 --> 02:37:51,838
SPEAKER_0:  part of what traumatized them.

02:37:52,514 --> 02:37:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  Was that the president?

02:37:54,178 --> 02:37:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  did not do his job to protect them. yes.

02:37:56,898 --> 02:37:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  as a child would be traumatized, not only if...

02:38:00,098 --> 02:38:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  harmed by someone but if mom and dad don't do everything they can.

02:38:03,426 --> 02:38:07,550
SPEAKER_0:  One of the things that makes people feel safe is they know their parents, they know their persons and authority.

02:38:07,778 --> 02:38:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  can't always keep them safe but they want to know the person's always trying.

02:38:10,658 --> 02:38:14,398
SPEAKER_1:  I agree with you that there, listen, I'm, I'm, uh, I'm somebody that.

02:38:14,850 --> 02:38:19,966
SPEAKER_1:  believes in this kind of idea of family, especially people I work with, that to me is a high ideal to protect.

02:38:20,578 --> 02:38:22,238
SPEAKER_1:  but that's a little bit different.

02:38:22,434 --> 02:38:23,006
SPEAKER_0:  It's his job.

02:38:23,234 --> 02:38:29,694
SPEAKER_1:  Hold on a second, that's a little bit different than protecting democracy. Those are two different things. Protecting your employees.

02:38:30,018 --> 02:38:34,654
SPEAKER_1:  and protecting democracy as an ideal. You could say he didn't protect either.

02:38:34,914 --> 02:38:35,486
SPEAKER_1:  But I think.

02:38:35,874 --> 02:38:37,749
SPEAKER_1:  uh... the criticism that he didn't protect the employees

02:38:37,749 --> 02:38:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  is one thing.

02:38:45,634 --> 02:38:48,574
SPEAKER_0:  is maybe not protecting his employees, those who are not protecting the war effort.

02:38:49,090 --> 02:38:57,374
SPEAKER_0:  right? It is his, the people we're talking about are the people who are actually doing the work of democracy at that moment, the most basic function of democracy, which is certifying votes.

02:38:58,242 --> 02:39:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  and their lives with her. I'm telling you, I had students, one who works for Senator Romney.

02:39:04,354 --> 02:39:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  for example.

02:39:05,410 --> 02:39:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  who spent hours in a closet.

02:39:08,130 --> 02:39:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  hearing.

02:39:08,994 --> 02:39:09,886
SPEAKER_0:  people outside.

02:39:10,306 --> 02:39:13,278
SPEAKER_0:  Looking on her phone, when is the president sending people?

02:39:13,890 --> 02:39:19,454
SPEAKER_0:  to protect us so we can do our job and she was not happy with the way the election turned out but she was there to do her job.

02:39:19,746 --> 02:39:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  because she believes in democracy.

02:39:21,762 --> 02:39:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  to service the Senate in the Senate's role.

02:39:23,522 --> 02:39:27,349
SPEAKER_1:  What should have Donald Trump done without turning him into a different human being?

02:39:27,349 --> 02:39:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  He should have immediately.

02:39:29,410 --> 02:39:34,974
SPEAKER_0:  that just as we were watching things get breached, the moment they had that the members of the House and the Senate had to

02:39:35,266 --> 02:39:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  evacuate their respective chambers.

02:39:37,890 --> 02:39:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  He should have immediately...

02:39:39,586 --> 02:39:42,654
SPEAKER_0:  gone on TV and Twitter and every space he could.

02:39:43,042 --> 02:39:44,574
SPEAKER_0:  and tell his supporters to leave.

02:39:45,282 --> 02:39:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  and say what he never said.

02:39:47,426 --> 02:39:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  This is un-American what you're doing. This is unacceptable. Never use those words. This is un-American, this is unacceptable. I'm completely against.

02:39:54,434 --> 02:39:56,286
SPEAKER_0:  Anyone storming the Capitol like this?

02:39:56,514 --> 02:39:58,983
SPEAKER_0:  Go home now, please. Or you can use this only.

02:39:58,983 --> 02:39:59,733
SPEAKER_1:  but tell him to leave.

02:39:59,733 --> 02:40:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

02:40:00,482 --> 02:40:03,582
SPEAKER_0:  and immediately as soon as we know he was watching for hours

02:40:03,970 --> 02:40:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  and we have testimony from his own daughter, from Ivanka.

02:40:06,818 --> 02:40:09,630
SPEAKER_0:  saying she tried time and again to get him to say something earlier.

02:40:09,858 --> 02:40:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  and he didn't.

02:40:10,882 --> 02:40:11,678
SPEAKER_0:  He watched it.

02:40:12,610 --> 02:40:14,046
SPEAKER_1:  He can still criticize.

02:40:14,818 --> 02:40:18,193
SPEAKER_1:  all the politicians, he can criticize everyone he wants, but he shoulda told him to leave.

02:40:18,193 --> 02:40:20,446
SPEAKER_0:  is doing that moment is basic.

02:40:20,834 --> 02:40:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  a protecting democracy, protecting the capital.

02:40:23,682 --> 02:40:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  Leaf. Tell them to leave and do everything he can to find any kind of force he can give to go protect him.

02:40:28,194 --> 02:40:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  the capital.

02:40:30,722 --> 02:40:33,630
SPEAKER_1:  I wonder how difficult it is to lose a presidential election.

02:40:34,722 --> 02:40:38,206
SPEAKER_1:  It's happened so many times. We know. I understand that, but it's a

02:40:38,978 --> 02:40:40,094
SPEAKER_1:  Especially when like...

02:40:40,514 --> 02:40:41,790
SPEAKER_1:  What is it, you know?

02:40:42,402 --> 02:40:48,382
SPEAKER_1:  80 million people vote for you or like some Like millions and millions and millions of people vote for you. It's crazy.

02:40:48,802 --> 02:40:50,677
SPEAKER_1:  It's crazy, this democracy thing is crazy.

02:40:50,677 --> 02:40:52,382
SPEAKER_0:  George H.W. Bush.

02:40:52,738 --> 02:40:54,622
SPEAKER_0:  Won a war in the Middle East

02:40:54,850 --> 02:40:58,558
SPEAKER_0:  right he had ninety percent approval rating and a year later lost the election

02:40:59,010 --> 02:41:05,822
SPEAKER_0:  to someone Bill Clinton he thought had none of the experience he had, someone he believed didn't have the right moral character.

02:41:06,594 --> 02:41:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  and Bush.

02:41:07,714 --> 02:41:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  did everything he could to help the next president get started well and they became good friends.

02:41:12,770 --> 02:41:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  George W. Bush.

02:41:14,754 --> 02:41:16,030
SPEAKER_0:  Ape didn't love Obama.

02:41:16,930 --> 02:41:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  That's considered one of the smoothest transitions. George W Bush ordered every single person in his administration.

02:41:23,746 --> 02:41:25,630
SPEAKER_0:  to do everything they could to help the new admins.

02:41:25,922 --> 02:41:27,454
SPEAKER_0:  That's what a leader does.

02:41:27,554 --> 02:41:30,398
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, humility is one of the things I admire in leaders.

02:41:33,186 --> 02:41:34,270
SPEAKER_1:  So that felt heated.

02:41:34,370 --> 02:41:37,310
SPEAKER_0:  Speaking of which...

02:41:37,410 --> 02:41:43,806
SPEAKER_1:  Can you just linger on how do you think we can heal the divide in this country? Do you think it's possible? There feels to be a strong division.

02:41:44,226 --> 02:41:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  I think we can heal the divide. I think.

02:41:46,946 --> 02:41:52,478
SPEAKER_0:  As you said, there's so many opportunities with new technology to bring people together, just as we're using it to tear them apart.

02:41:53,154 --> 02:41:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:41:53,954 --> 02:41:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  I have the best job in the world because I

02:41:57,410 --> 02:42:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  get to teach so many students. I'll have 300 in my class in the spring, in the US history class.

02:42:03,618 --> 02:42:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  And what I found with my students is they're mostly not Democrats or Republicans.

02:42:08,258 --> 02:42:12,158
SPEAKER_0:  They mostly care about the same things. Every one of my students seems to care about climate change.

02:42:12,962 --> 02:42:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, I thought you were going to say TikTok, but okay. Yeah, what do you say? Second to that, time to change.

02:42:18,018 --> 02:42:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  you know and and i think that they uh...

02:42:21,954 --> 02:42:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  I think they offer a new future for us. And here's what I'll say as a historian.

02:42:26,562 --> 02:42:31,006
SPEAKER_0:  We go through cycles of division and cycles of less division, less partisanship.

02:42:31,746 --> 02:42:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  One moment when it seems people agree too much on the mainstream encourages people to go to the extremes.

02:42:37,058 --> 02:42:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  When people see the extremes, they want to come back.

02:42:39,778 --> 02:42:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  to the middle and that is where my students are, most of my students.

02:42:43,106 --> 02:42:44,926
SPEAKER_0:  want lower inflation

02:42:45,858 --> 02:42:52,638
SPEAKER_0:  They agree with Republicans on that, but they want more to be done about climate change. They're in the middle on these issues and I think giving them more

02:42:53,090 --> 02:42:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  more opportunity. So what's the best way to heal our divisions honestly?

02:42:57,890 --> 02:42:59,646
SPEAKER_0:  Get the old men out and the young.

02:42:59,874 --> 02:43:00,702
SPEAKER_0:  Women and men in.

02:43:01,250 --> 02:43:05,022
SPEAKER_1:  because they ultimately don't have that same division and they're like deeply baked in.

02:43:05,154 --> 02:43:09,022
SPEAKER_0:  Not only that, they find it disgusting in the way you and I do.

02:43:09,346 --> 02:43:09,694
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

02:43:10,242 --> 02:43:10,686
SPEAKER_1:  That's true.

02:43:11,074 --> 02:43:15,550
SPEAKER_1:  What's the right way to have conversations? I mean, just to stay on that.

02:43:15,778 --> 02:43:17,214
SPEAKER_1:  with people on the left and the right.

02:43:18,402 --> 02:43:18,878
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

02:43:19,106 --> 02:43:24,222
SPEAKER_1:  yeah i don't know how often you practice this you care about politics often do you talk to people who

02:43:24,610 --> 02:43:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  who voted for Trump or a whore of Republicans.

02:43:27,298 --> 02:43:30,462
SPEAKER_0:  I try, but it's hard. 75% of people I talk to.

02:43:31,330 --> 02:43:32,455
SPEAKER_0:  are not those people.

02:43:32,455 --> 02:43:35,006
SPEAKER_1:  people who are trans supporters in your extended family.

02:43:37,474 --> 02:43:37,982
SPEAKER_1:  Thanksgiving.

02:43:38,434 --> 02:43:40,309
SPEAKER_0:  no i don't in my extent are they

02:43:40,309 --> 02:43:41,630
SPEAKER_1:  I think no longer.

02:43:42,050 --> 02:43:52,798
SPEAKER_0:  They're no longer in my family. It's all in this fashion. I have taken them out of the photograph. They do not exist. You just erase. I do, but I know Pete, I have-

02:43:53,090 --> 02:43:59,870
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, who fall into that, but it's still a minority of my friend group. So I want to be clear that I'm not as good at this as I should.

02:44:00,418 --> 02:44:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  But I think we do have to reach out. But I also-

02:44:03,426 --> 02:44:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  I'm less interested, honestly, in.

02:44:07,490 --> 02:44:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  re-fighting old battles with old dogs.

02:44:11,778 --> 02:44:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  I'm more interested in finding ways to get

02:44:14,754 --> 02:44:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  a new crop of people.

02:44:17,058 --> 02:44:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  educated and involved and engaged.

02:44:20,482 --> 02:44:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  without imparting the same.

02:44:23,266 --> 02:44:24,702
SPEAKER_0:  the same partisanship on them.

02:44:25,410 --> 02:44:27,038
SPEAKER_0:  So I will support.

02:44:27,426 --> 02:44:30,910
SPEAKER_0:  And this I have to, I will support and encourage, especially any student of mine.

02:44:31,362 --> 02:44:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  But any young person who is smart, has good ideas, I don't care whether, I don't ask whether they're a Democrat or Republican. And I have given money to some young candidates who are not Democrats.

02:44:40,930 --> 02:44:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  So that's the way I think it's a generational change.

02:44:45,058 --> 02:44:46,430
SPEAKER_0:  and I think it's reaching out.

02:44:46,850 --> 02:44:48,382
SPEAKER_0:  and trying to

02:44:49,090 --> 02:44:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  get people to see beyond partisan divisions.

02:44:52,354 --> 02:44:58,526
SPEAKER_0:  who are in their twenties and teens rather than that's why we do our podcast. This is democracy Zachary and I do that my son and I.

02:44:58,818 --> 02:45:02,750
SPEAKER_0:  because we're exactly that you will never hear an episode where we take one side or another.

02:45:03,106 --> 02:45:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  Our goal is to explain the issue.

02:45:05,314 --> 02:45:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  whether it's the challenges of democracy in China.

02:45:09,442 --> 02:45:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  or it's climate change or whatever it is.

02:45:13,154 --> 02:45:13,854
SPEAKER_0:  or it's...

02:45:14,082 --> 02:45:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  memory of war in our society and to explain the issue and then offer people an optimistic pathway that's neither one side nor the other.

02:45:21,378 --> 02:45:27,934
SPEAKER_1:  So actually, to push back a little bit on young people, I do see that, the exhaustion with the sort of partisanship.

02:45:28,482 --> 02:45:32,350
SPEAKER_1:  But I've also, and this I think is the case throughout history, and I see it now.

02:45:32,770 --> 02:45:34,814
SPEAKER_1:  especially in the teenage years.

02:45:35,490 --> 02:45:37,374
SPEAKER_1:  Especially if I'm being asked with boys.

02:45:38,498 --> 02:45:40,318
SPEAKER_1:  There's a desire for extremism.

02:45:40,802 --> 02:45:42,462
SPEAKER_1:  in various directions.

02:45:42,754 --> 02:45:44,062
SPEAKER_1:  all kinds of extremism.

02:45:44,322 --> 02:45:45,374
SPEAKER_1:  Like just extreme.

02:45:46,114 --> 02:45:49,150
SPEAKER_1:  Awesomeness or extreme anything just extreme.

02:45:49,474 --> 02:45:50,654
SPEAKER_1:  and F the man.

02:45:50,946 --> 02:45:56,062
SPEAKER_1:  that tries to make me behave this kind of energy. And that's why you can take any ideology.

02:45:56,546 --> 02:46:00,574
SPEAKER_1:  Basically any extreme ideologist starts being exciting, whether you're a Marxist or a communist.

02:46:00,898 --> 02:46:02,206
SPEAKER_1:  You're not just gonna be like...

02:46:02,818 --> 02:46:05,406
SPEAKER_1:  for socialized healthcare, you could be like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:46:06,306 --> 02:46:07,422
SPEAKER_1:  Let's go full!

02:46:07,682 --> 02:46:15,070
SPEAKER_1:  hammer and sickle, I'm gonna wear red. And then the same with white supremacy or uh.

02:46:15,394 --> 02:46:22,878
SPEAKER_1:  just a red pill, the way you see society, the way you see the world, the extremism is there. And part of that

02:46:23,394 --> 02:46:24,158
SPEAKER_1:  It's kind of...

02:46:24,418 --> 02:46:30,398
SPEAKER_1:  uh... to steve map that perspective is can be productive that energy if it's controlled especially if we have

02:46:30,818 --> 02:46:33,342
SPEAKER_1:  Institutions that keep it a little under like.

02:46:33,602 --> 02:46:35,550
SPEAKER_1:  control. One of the criticisms

02:46:35,810 --> 02:46:38,174
SPEAKER_1:  I have with a lot of people have.

02:46:39,330 --> 02:46:45,406
SPEAKER_1:  I'm actually much more moderate than that criticism of universities is they give a little too much power to the 18 year old who just showed up

02:46:45,826 --> 02:46:50,590
SPEAKER_1:  with their Marxist books and so on, and they wanna burn the whole thing down. That's beautiful.

02:46:51,042 --> 02:46:51,358
SPEAKER_1:  but.

02:46:51,778 --> 02:46:56,158
SPEAKER_1:  The whole process of the universities get different viewpoints, educate.

02:46:56,578 --> 02:46:59,390
SPEAKER_1:  more, make that person's viewpoint more.

02:46:59,650 --> 02:47:02,590
SPEAKER_1:  sophisticated, complex, nuanced and all that kind of things.

02:47:02,754 --> 02:47:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  I think you're right, but I think that's more talk than action.

02:47:06,082 --> 02:47:09,598
SPEAKER_0:  In my experience, there is especially among young men.

02:47:10,114 --> 02:47:13,758
SPEAKER_0:  You're absolutely right. There is a valorization of the tough guy.

02:47:14,530 --> 02:47:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  because most men 18 and 19 are still not.

02:47:17,922 --> 02:47:20,926
SPEAKER_0:  fully comfortable in their masculinity, however they're going to define it.

02:47:21,314 --> 02:47:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  And so a way of performing that.

02:47:24,930 --> 02:47:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  is being extreme in one way or another. And I've definitely seen that.

02:47:29,282 --> 02:47:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  but I think it's...

02:47:30,466 --> 02:47:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  It's more often than not.

02:47:32,098 --> 02:47:33,598
SPEAKER_0:  rhetoric and actually

02:47:34,434 --> 02:47:36,030
SPEAKER_0:  there's a very strong power.

02:47:36,290 --> 02:47:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  of peer pressure and conformity that works on young people.

02:47:39,362 --> 02:47:41,246
SPEAKER_0:  And the positive side of that now.

02:47:41,634 --> 02:47:43,166
SPEAKER_0:  is the peer pressure among them.

02:47:43,842 --> 02:47:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  is not to join one party or the other. It's to say this is terrible.

02:47:47,714 --> 02:47:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  look at how our parents are screwing things up.

02:47:50,306 --> 02:47:51,166
SPEAKER_0:  And they're right.

02:47:51,906 --> 02:47:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  And I think we can lean into that.

02:47:54,018 --> 02:47:56,190
SPEAKER_0:  and get a lot of positive creative action.

02:47:56,610 --> 02:48:05,118
SPEAKER_0:  out of that. On universities, you brought this up a few times and I think we have to be careful. I think you and I agree on this. It's not that universities are free of bias.

02:48:05,762 --> 02:48:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  universities, especially large universities, whether it's UT, MIT, Yale, whatever we're talking about.

02:48:11,330 --> 02:48:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  Right, they're large complex empires.

02:48:14,690 --> 02:48:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  and most universities people in the arts.

02:48:18,338 --> 02:48:20,254
SPEAKER_0:  tend to be a little left of center at self-selection.

02:48:20,994 --> 02:48:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  those in engineering tend to be pretty much in the middle.

02:48:23,970 --> 02:48:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  and those at business schools tend to be right of center.

02:48:27,074 --> 02:48:33,758
SPEAKER_0:  And so I think we need to be careful not to generalize. You know, at the University of Texas, there's as much influence.

02:48:34,114 --> 02:48:36,030
SPEAKER_0:  from the Business School in the Athletic Department.

02:48:36,610 --> 02:48:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  as there is from the humanities.

02:48:38,882 --> 02:48:47,102
SPEAKER_0:  So it's not a left leaning campus. And that's also true at Yale. You have the School of Management at Yale. You have a huge medical school.

02:48:47,682 --> 02:48:49,150
SPEAKER_0:  right, people who are very professional.

02:48:49,474 --> 02:48:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  and less political on a lot of these issues. So.

02:48:52,482 --> 02:48:55,134
SPEAKER_0:  So I think we have to be careful. I think there are certain pockets of things.

02:48:55,874 --> 02:48:59,934
SPEAKER_0:  But some of that you're never going to avoid, right? Engineers are always going to be the people.

02:49:00,546 --> 02:49:00,958
SPEAKER_1:  Who?

02:49:01,090 --> 02:49:05,694
SPEAKER_0:  Hey, no, easy now. No, no, no, but do you, I'm sure you've been coming, who want to generally.

02:49:05,986 --> 02:49:11,902
SPEAKER_0:  find some objective measure and avoid political interpretation right they want to find their objective measure I'm surprised

02:49:12,130 --> 02:49:16,255
SPEAKER_1:  how most people in robotics don't seem to, they're afraid of humans they run away from human sight.

02:49:16,255 --> 02:49:16,670
SPEAKER_0:

02:49:16,994 --> 02:49:17,758
SPEAKER_0:  Precisely!

02:49:17,986 --> 02:49:22,942
SPEAKER_0:  and and they are people are always going to be more touchy feely in the business people are always going to like markets I mean

02:49:23,362 --> 02:49:25,086
SPEAKER_1:  and my own personal opinion on this.

02:49:25,634 --> 02:49:28,126
SPEAKER_1:  is uh... this is just me talking

02:49:29,026 --> 02:49:33,694
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if it's grounded in data, but just my own experiences, it seems.

02:49:34,210 --> 02:49:34,654
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of the-

02:49:34,946 --> 02:49:39,230
SPEAKER_1:  things that people criticize about universities comes from administrations from the bureaucracy

02:49:39,458 --> 02:49:42,558
SPEAKER_1:  The faculty and the students are even with biases.

02:49:43,010 --> 02:49:48,958
SPEAKER_1:  are really interesting people and all of their different, I wouldn't call them biases, but different perspectives.

02:49:49,282 --> 02:49:55,518
SPEAKER_1:  Add to the conversation. It's the administrate too much. Of course you need, just like with institutions, you need some.

02:49:55,746 --> 02:49:58,014
SPEAKER_1:  But too much, it becomes too heavy handed.

02:49:58,434 --> 02:49:59,390
SPEAKER_1:  And, um...

02:49:59,906 --> 02:50:00,766
SPEAKER_1:  somehow.

02:50:01,314 --> 02:50:08,094
SPEAKER_1:  that has been getting a little bit out of hand at a bunch of universities, just too much administration. I don't know what the mechanism is to let-

02:50:08,418 --> 02:50:13,694
SPEAKER_1:  to make it more efficient, but that's been always a struggle. Maybe the public criticism is the very mechanism that makes.

02:50:13,922 --> 02:50:14,782
SPEAKER_1:  Universities.

02:50:15,042 --> 02:50:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  the administration is smaller. Absolutely. We have those issues and you can also say athletics has gotten out of control.

02:50:23,106 --> 02:50:29,086
SPEAKER_1:  Like you said, you cohost a podcast with your son, Zachary called this is democracy. What's been?

02:50:30,050 --> 02:50:32,510
SPEAKER_1:  There's a million questions I can ask, but just.

02:50:32,738 --> 02:50:37,406
SPEAKER_1:  that pops to memory, what's been a challenging or maybe an eye-opening conversation you've had on it?

02:50:38,370 --> 02:50:38,814
SPEAKER_1:  Oh.

02:50:38,946 --> 02:50:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  We've had a lot of eye-opening conversations.

02:50:41,250 --> 02:50:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  our most recent episode uh... is an episode on the german right

02:50:46,786 --> 02:50:56,382
SPEAKER_0:  As I'm sure many of your listeners know, there was a group called the Reichsberger. I think they still exist in Germany. They were actually led by a former German prince.

02:50:56,706 --> 02:50:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  And, um...

02:50:58,722 --> 02:50:59,774
SPEAKER_0:  they had been planning.

02:51:00,226 --> 02:51:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  to assassinate the Bundeskanzler?

02:51:02,626 --> 02:51:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  and organizing all sorts of other efforts they do not believe.

02:51:06,562 --> 02:51:15,326
SPEAKER_0:  that the current german government is legitimate they think the last legitimate government was the nazi government they see the whole post-war period is illegitimate since the german far-right correct

02:51:15,586 --> 02:51:20,414
SPEAKER_0:  and we had on a member of the German Bundestag of their parliament.

02:51:20,770 --> 02:51:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  who's been involved in the investigations or in the oversight of the investigations.

02:51:25,218 --> 02:51:37,982
SPEAKER_0:  and talking with her about the depth of these issues and the challenges they face in Germany. It's certainly not a huge part of German society, but it's a significant number of people, probably more than 20,000 people who are part of this.

02:51:38,402 --> 02:51:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:51:39,234 --> 02:51:40,638
SPEAKER_0:  to me brought home.

02:51:41,506 --> 02:51:45,214
SPEAKER_0:  how much of what we thought was the past is still in the present.

02:51:45,666 --> 02:51:50,814
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that's a recurring theme in our show. And our show is optimistic, which is not about...

02:51:51,330 --> 02:51:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  Woe is to the world.

02:51:52,802 --> 02:51:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  It's actually about taking issues. We take a topic each week that's in the news. We go back to understand the history.

02:51:58,466 --> 02:52:04,542
SPEAKER_0:  and we then use that history to make better policy to talk about how to make better policy today and in this case it was clear

02:52:05,058 --> 02:52:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  that even in Germany, there's a lot of unfinished work.

02:52:08,770 --> 02:52:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  in explaining to people.

02:52:10,626 --> 02:52:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  and helping those, for instance, in the former East, where a lot of this group has its support.

02:52:16,226 --> 02:52:24,062
SPEAKER_0:  why this government is legitimate, why it operates the way it does, and addressing their concerns. It was strikingly similar to some of the problems we have in our own.

02:52:24,322 --> 02:52:29,197
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, there's a far right movement in Germany. So you look at different parts of the world as well.

02:52:29,197 --> 02:52:35,806
SPEAKER_0:  We do. We did an episode recently on China, on the effects of zero COVID and the protests in China.

02:52:36,386 --> 02:52:38,686
SPEAKER_0:  We've done a number of episodes on the war in Ukraine.

02:52:39,170 --> 02:52:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  Our role each week is to have on either a policymaker, a scholar, or an activist.

02:52:45,602 --> 02:52:48,414
SPEAKER_0:  who can help us understand an issue and get beyond partisanship.

02:52:48,994 --> 02:52:55,486
SPEAKER_0:  So what's been eye opening are some of the details, but what's also been eye opening, honestly, is how easy it is to have a nonpartisan conversation.

02:52:56,546 --> 02:52:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  It's not hard.

02:52:58,050 --> 02:53:06,686
SPEAKER_0:  uh... we open every episode with a poem that's accurate to write an original poem of brag on my son is the uh... youth poet laureate in austin right now he writes a poem

02:53:06,914 --> 02:53:07,710
SPEAKER_0:  on each topic.

02:53:08,226 --> 02:53:09,694
SPEAKER_1:  What's the style of poetry, usually?

02:53:10,082 --> 02:53:11,207
SPEAKER_1:  You know, is he dark? Is he?

02:53:11,207 --> 02:53:13,918
SPEAKER_0:  No, he's usually he's he's often ironic

02:53:14,402 --> 02:53:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  Ironic.

02:53:15,074 --> 02:53:16,318
SPEAKER_1:  Like with a bit of humor? Yes.

02:53:17,282 --> 02:53:21,918
SPEAKER_1:  And he likes workplace. So he's not like a rebellious dark teenager. That's just.

02:53:22,882 --> 02:53:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  He's a creative know-it-all.

02:53:26,018 --> 02:53:27,143
SPEAKER_0:  Strong words, you'll probably-

02:53:27,143 --> 02:53:27,893
SPEAKER_1:  this a great

02:53:27,893 --> 02:53:29,511
SPEAKER_0:  But what's interesting...

02:53:29,511 --> 02:53:31,011
SPEAKER_1:  like you're the know-it-all on the box.

02:53:31,011 --> 02:53:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  Oh no, oh no, I try.

02:53:33,666 --> 02:53:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  We do have a lot of followers and most of them comment on him. They don't comment on me. So I'm the junior partner.

02:53:38,626 --> 02:53:41,534
SPEAKER_1:  You're the Yoko Ono of the partnership. You're the Yoko Ono of the partnership.

02:53:41,858 --> 02:53:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  But what I will say, and this is a really optimistic thing that I deeply believe.

02:53:45,954 --> 02:53:47,038
SPEAKER_0:  If you frame things...

02:53:47,330 --> 02:53:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  Properly, you open with a poem, you open with questions, not with partisan positions.

02:53:52,322 --> 02:53:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  uh... even when we have someone on who's a known republican or democrat

02:53:55,938 --> 02:54:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  we can have a very nonpartisan conversation with me of course we get criticisms but we're almost never criticized for being

02:54:03,170 --> 02:54:04,254
SPEAKER_0:  partisan one way or the other.

02:54:04,610 --> 02:54:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  It's not hard to do this, you just have to make an effort.

02:54:07,266 --> 02:54:08,766
SPEAKER_0:  to avoid the

02:54:08,994 --> 02:54:11,326
SPEAKER_0:  partisan claptrap that we can all fall into.

02:54:11,682 --> 02:54:12,862
SPEAKER_1:

02:54:13,122 --> 02:54:13,982
SPEAKER_1:  What is your-

02:54:14,370 --> 02:54:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  brilliant popular son Zachary taught you about life.

02:54:18,946 --> 02:54:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, he's taught me so much in his 18 years as has our daughter who's 20. Two things stand out.

02:54:24,514 --> 02:54:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  He's taught me that.

02:54:27,330 --> 02:54:29,470
SPEAKER_0:  A new generation has so much to offer.

02:54:30,466 --> 02:54:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  And I don't just mean because he's smart and engaged as our daughter is too. I also mean that you realize when you have a child.

02:54:36,962 --> 02:54:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  That even though you're doing the same things with them, they see the world differently.

02:54:39,970 --> 02:54:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  and legitimately.

02:54:41,250 --> 02:54:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  And it reminds us that

02:54:42,530 --> 02:54:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  the world can be seen legitimately in different ways.

02:54:45,698 --> 02:54:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  And it's not that he and I disagree on major political issues. It's actually the small stuff.

02:54:50,402 --> 02:54:51,527
SPEAKER_0:  that he sees differently.

02:54:51,527 --> 02:54:57,950
SPEAKER_1:  In the details, you see that you can have very different perspectives. Exactly. You have a very different way to draw.

02:54:58,466 --> 02:55:00,286
SPEAKER_1:  to create a painting of the same scene.

02:55:00,866 --> 02:55:08,766
SPEAKER_0:  And then the other thing he's taught me is, as I said about the poetry, the importance of the arts. I've always been a lover of the arts.

02:55:09,378 --> 02:55:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  But it had always been.

02:55:10,946 --> 02:55:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  in some ways parallel to my historical scholarship.

02:55:13,730 --> 02:55:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  when you do a better job of integrating.

02:55:16,034 --> 02:55:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  As, as, as the Greeks did.

02:55:18,274 --> 02:55:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  right?

02:55:19,010 --> 02:55:32,254
SPEAKER_0:  The artistry, all the things we do, we separate them as disciplines, but they're all deeply connected. This is what I like about your podcast honestly, is that you integrate all these things. You'll have people on with AI, you'll have a guy doing arm wrestling, you have all these things together, right?

02:55:32,482 --> 02:55:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  and it's.

02:55:33,474 --> 02:55:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  It's that.

02:55:34,242 --> 02:55:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  these worlds come together?

02:55:36,290 --> 02:55:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  and there's a lot to gain by bringing the arts and the sciences and all this together. It's an obvious thing to say, but we forget.

02:55:41,666 --> 02:55:43,518
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, and somehow it becomes bit.

02:55:43,970 --> 02:55:45,438
SPEAKER_1:  bigger than the individual parts.

02:55:46,018 --> 02:55:46,558
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:55:46,978 --> 02:55:49,214
SPEAKER_1:  What gives you hope about the future? You looked at-

02:55:49,698 --> 02:55:52,446
SPEAKER_1:  especially with this book at just such a divisive

02:55:53,538 --> 02:55:54,654
SPEAKER_1:  part of our history.

02:55:54,946 --> 02:55:55,838
SPEAKER_1:  and the claim.

02:55:56,514 --> 02:56:02,014
SPEAKER_1:  The idea that you carry through the book, that that division still permeates our society. So what gives you hope?

02:56:02,210 --> 02:56:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  I try to end the book on a very hopeful note because I am hopeful. I'm hopeful that...

02:56:06,690 --> 02:56:07,710
SPEAKER_0:  These divisions.

02:56:08,322 --> 02:56:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  were made by people and can be unmade by people.

02:56:11,682 --> 02:56:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  I do not believe.

02:56:13,570 --> 02:56:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  that what I describe in this book, the division, the hate that we see today as well.

02:56:19,778 --> 02:56:21,790
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think it's inevitable.

02:56:22,402 --> 02:56:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  I think it can be actually corrected quite easily.

02:56:25,922 --> 02:56:27,902
SPEAKER_0:  and correct it easily by

02:56:28,194 --> 02:56:33,950
SPEAKER_0:  Addressing the challenges in our institutions, the ways in which this history has been embodied in our institutions, even though we're different.

02:56:34,786 --> 02:56:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  and uh... through our own recognizing of it the gift of the last few years i don't care whether a democrat or republican the gift of the last few years

02:56:42,146 --> 02:56:44,574
SPEAKER_0:  is that we've been able to see the horror around us.

02:56:45,122 --> 02:56:49,950
SPEAKER_0:  And once you see the horror, you can do something about it. What's dangerous is when the horror is there and you don't see it.

02:56:50,210 --> 02:56:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  It's hidden.

02:56:51,298 --> 02:56:54,334
SPEAKER_0:  It's been unmasked. I don't care where you stand. Hello, everybody.

02:56:54,978 --> 02:56:58,558
SPEAKER_0:  I've spoken in about 25, 30 cities about this book, every audience I've asked.

02:56:59,074 --> 02:57:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  How many of you have been shaken by the last four to five years? Everyone, everywhere has raised their hand.

02:57:04,802 --> 02:57:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  That's a gift.

02:57:06,050 --> 02:57:07,358
SPEAKER_0:  That's consciousness raising.

02:57:08,034 --> 02:57:13,662
SPEAKER_0:  I grew up in a time in the 1980s when we were concerned everyone was apathetic. That was what was being said.

02:57:13,922 --> 02:57:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  We had lower voter turnout than we have now.

02:57:16,482 --> 02:57:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  People then seemed to care.

02:57:18,370 --> 02:57:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  My students when I was a young professor, I'm still young, when I was a very young professor in the early 2000s my students all wanted to work for banks.

02:57:25,250 --> 02:57:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  They just wanted to make money. The best students wanted to go work for Goldman. We're not in that world anymore.

02:57:29,154 --> 02:57:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  has been a consciousness raising.

02:57:31,394 --> 02:57:33,662
SPEAKER_0:  Knowing there's a problem, naming the problem.

02:57:33,922 --> 02:57:35,806
SPEAKER_0:  gives us a chance to fix the problem.

02:57:36,546 --> 02:57:38,718
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that's where we are as a society now.

02:57:39,042 --> 02:57:43,390
SPEAKER_1:  young people are excited to solve the problem. Do you think the individual...

02:57:44,226 --> 02:57:48,318
SPEAKER_1:  Like if a young person is listening to this, do you think the individual has power in this?

02:57:48,482 --> 02:57:49,278
SPEAKER_0:  Absolutely.

02:57:49,698 --> 02:57:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  I think the individual has a huge amount of power now. There's a demographic reason we've got all these old people who have held on too long.

02:57:56,610 --> 02:57:59,358
SPEAKER_0:  president, look at Senate and look at any institution.

02:57:59,810 --> 02:58:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  and they're all we're reaching a demographic cliff. Unlike China, we have a large population that's coming up.

02:58:05,666 --> 02:58:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  So those who are watching now who are in their 20s.

02:58:08,994 --> 02:58:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  they're going to get to move into leadership positions much faster than their parents did.

02:58:13,858 --> 02:58:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  Let's go. Just, yeah. So that's one. And then the second thing is.

02:58:17,314 --> 02:58:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  just what we're doing here.

02:58:18,818 --> 02:58:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, social media when used properly.

02:58:21,666 --> 02:58:23,166
SPEAKER_0:  gives a platform to young people.

02:58:24,898 --> 02:58:27,166
SPEAKER_0:  They don't have to go through the New York Times like I do, right?

02:58:28,450 --> 02:58:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  This is why I do the podcast with my son. Find other ways.

02:58:31,746 --> 02:58:33,470
SPEAKER_0:  uh... you reach millions of people

02:58:34,594 --> 02:58:35,806
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:58:36,034 --> 02:58:40,670
SPEAKER_0:  this can be done you don't need to wait for the old guys to give you the check mark that it's okay

02:58:41,506 --> 02:58:42,110
SPEAKER_1:  Just uh...

02:58:42,658 --> 02:58:43,550
SPEAKER_1:  Put on a suit.

02:58:44,002 --> 02:58:45,822
SPEAKER_1:  Get a haircut.

02:58:46,370 --> 02:58:49,758
SPEAKER_1:  Speaking nonsense to microphone and uh, yeah

02:58:49,986 --> 02:58:52,611
SPEAKER_0:  Well, also, I mean, have a very neat place.

02:58:52,611 --> 02:58:53,310
SPEAKER_1:  Ha ha ha ha!

SPEAKER_1:  Let me leave you with some words from Abraham Lincoln.

02:59:33,794 --> 02:59:34,782
SPEAKER_1:  Nearly all men.

02:59:35,010 --> 02:59:36,158
SPEAKER_1:  can stand adversity.

02:59:36,866 --> 02:59:38,462
SPEAKER_1:  if you want to test a man's character.

02:59:39,234 --> 02:59:39,998
SPEAKER_1:  given power.

02:59:41,474 --> 02:59:42,238
