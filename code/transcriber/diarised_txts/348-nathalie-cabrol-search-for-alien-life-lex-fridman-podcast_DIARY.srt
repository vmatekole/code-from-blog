00:00:00,098 --> 00:00:02,718
SPEAKER_0:  My friend is telling me that the volcano seems to be.

00:00:03,042 --> 00:00:03,934
SPEAKER_0:  starting to erupt.

00:00:04,674 --> 00:00:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  If that volcano goes up, we have nowhere to go.

00:00:08,546 --> 00:00:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  That got my attention.

00:00:10,626 --> 00:00:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  So if you say scared, I would say that.

00:00:14,018 --> 00:00:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  I got the realization that...

00:00:15,842 --> 00:00:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  That meant I went cold for like a fraction of a second.

00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:22,078
SPEAKER_0:  but that meant that just my adrenaline started to kick in.

00:00:22,754 --> 00:00:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  And it was a very, very strange experience because now you have tunnel vision, it's about survival.

00:00:30,626 --> 00:00:32,734
SPEAKER_1:  The following is a conversation with Natalie Cabral.

00:00:33,186 --> 00:00:36,318
SPEAKER_1:  and astrobiologist and scientist at the SETI Institute.

00:00:36,642 --> 00:00:38,142
SPEAKER_1:  directing the Carl Sagan Center.

00:00:38,402 --> 00:00:40,254
SPEAKER_1:  for the study of life in the universe.

00:00:40,834 --> 00:00:43,262
SPEAKER_1:  She explores some of the harshest places on Earth.

00:00:43,554 --> 00:00:44,062
SPEAKER_1:  including.

00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,078
SPEAKER_1:  free diving in volcanic lakes.

00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  all in the pursuit of understanding living organisms beyond Earth.

00:00:50,498 --> 00:00:51,006
SPEAKER_1:  For this,

00:00:51,362 --> 00:00:53,502
SPEAKER_1:  She holds the Women's World Record.

00:00:53,794 --> 00:00:57,182
SPEAKER_1:  for diving at altitude, both scuba and freediving.

00:00:58,146 --> 00:00:58,910
SPEAKER_1:  She's amazing.

00:00:59,714 --> 00:01:03,870
SPEAKER_1:  This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:01:04,162 --> 00:01:05,310
SPEAKER_1:  And now, dear friends.

00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:06,398
SPEAKER_1:  Here's Natalie.

00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:07,262
SPEAKER_1:  about.

00:01:08,418 --> 00:01:16,894
SPEAKER_1:  You are the director of the Carl Sagan Center for Research at the SETI Institute. SETI of course stands for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,454
SPEAKER_1:  One of the things you do is part of...

00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:27,966
SPEAKER_1:  that is travel to some of Earth's most extreme and dangerous environments in search of organisms that live in conditions analogous to those on Mars.

00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,014
SPEAKER_1:  First let me ask.

00:01:30,498 --> 00:01:38,942
SPEAKER_1:  what the job posting for the work you do looks like. Is it like Shackleton's ad in 1900 that said people wanted for hazardous journey to the softball?

00:01:39,426 --> 00:01:41,694
SPEAKER_1:  Small wages, bitter cold, long months of...

00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,646
SPEAKER_1:  Complete darkness, constant danger.

00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  And also, where do I apply?

00:01:45,346 --> 00:01:52,670
SPEAKER_0:  That's funny because there was not really a job application. In fact, when you're a scientist, you have...

00:01:52,994 --> 00:01:54,718
SPEAKER_0:  questions in your mind and.

00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  You have hypotheses and you start to list the kind of thing you need to answer.

00:01:59,074 --> 00:02:02,750
SPEAKER_0:  And then when you see the kind of thing you have to answer, then you...

00:02:03,394 --> 00:02:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  kind of know the places where you need to go to do that.

00:02:06,914 --> 00:02:09,150
SPEAKER_0:  As far as science is concerned...

00:02:09,474 --> 00:02:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  started with analyzing data from Mars missions.

00:02:13,602 --> 00:02:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  And I had written a PhD about water on Mars.

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  first looking at channels and the history evolution of.

00:02:22,754 --> 00:02:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  of water.

00:02:23,778 --> 00:02:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  But then...

00:02:25,442 --> 00:02:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  during my postdoc.

00:02:27,138 --> 00:02:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  I started to look.

00:02:28,706 --> 00:02:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  where that water was ponding.

00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  Interestingly enough, everybody was about channels and water and whether catastrophic or what not or seepage.

00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  But when you are talking about...

00:02:39,938 --> 00:02:41,598
SPEAKER_0:  like

00:02:41,826 --> 00:02:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  Lakes?

00:02:42,754 --> 00:02:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  or ocean, people started waving their arms a little bit. So it was a little bit of a uphill battle, interestingly enough, yeah.

00:02:50,018 --> 00:02:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  but that got us on track with my husband.

00:02:53,378 --> 00:03:00,638
SPEAKER_0:  We were working together and we started developing the idea, the concept of lakes in impact craters.

00:03:01,634 --> 00:03:03,934
SPEAKER_0:  So why an impact crater is just because...

00:03:04,386 --> 00:03:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  the Viking mission at the time.

00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,702
SPEAKER_0:  which is what we were working with.

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:23,806
SPEAKER_0:  The resolution and the topography were so poor that there was really no way of telling where you had a real low in the topography. The only thing you knew was a hole in the ground was an impact crater. So when you saw valleys.

00:03:24,258 --> 00:03:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  What was the Viking mission?

00:03:25,698 --> 00:03:33,438
SPEAKER_0:  The Viking mission landed on Mars in 1976 and there were two landers and two orbiters. So they were really...

00:03:33,762 --> 00:03:39,295
SPEAKER_0:  our first feet on the ground on Mars, but they were under they were not moving. They were not going

00:03:39,295 --> 00:03:40,795
SPEAKER_1:  And that was the data you were looking at.

00:03:40,795 --> 00:03:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  It was already in the 90s, but we didn't have yet.

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:53,125
SPEAKER_0:  Mars Global Surveyor and whatnot. We still work for 20 years. We worked on that. I did my master in my PhD thesis on Viking.

00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:58,046
SPEAKER_1:  You mentioned that the places you go to are defined by the questions you want to ask.

00:03:58,914 --> 00:04:02,686
SPEAKER_1:  Let's just step back. What questions have always tugged at your heart?

00:04:03,298 --> 00:04:09,118
SPEAKER_0:  Well, that's the thing. That's why I was looking at those images and saw some legs.

00:04:09,538 --> 00:04:11,710
SPEAKER_0:  And then came time.

00:04:12,034 --> 00:04:13,694
SPEAKER_0:  where we started talking about.

00:04:14,082 --> 00:04:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  sending landers and rovers on Mars.

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,214
SPEAKER_0:  and looking maybe at the possibility that Mars was habitable.

00:04:21,986 --> 00:04:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  And lakes are particularly good places.

00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:28,030
SPEAKER_0:  look for those questions. So this is how it all ties up.

00:04:28,194 --> 00:04:30,078
SPEAKER_1:  you were always curious about life.

00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  out there.

00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  25 years more in that business.

00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,582
SPEAKER_0:  It's more about understanding the origin and nature of life.

00:04:47,906 --> 00:04:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  rather than whether there is life or not on Mars. I mean...

00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  This was really for me a stepping stone to bigger questions, but they were definitely important because they helped me.

00:04:59,362 --> 00:04:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  frame.

00:05:00,578 --> 00:05:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  my way of thinking about this question. And so.

00:05:03,906 --> 00:05:07,614
SPEAKER_0:  Looking at Mars, at lakes, understanding what the conditions were.

00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  3.5 billion years ago or close to 4 billion years ago.

00:05:11,426 --> 00:05:12,446
SPEAKER_0:  Then I knew.

00:05:12,674 --> 00:05:14,078
SPEAKER_0:  The type of environment.

00:05:14,338 --> 00:05:17,406
SPEAKER_0:  I needed to explore here on Earth as analogous.

00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  to be able to understand what type of life.

00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,646
SPEAKER_0:  still survives in those environments, and what kind of instrument and what kind of resolution do I need?

00:05:28,386 --> 00:05:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  to actually detect it.

00:05:30,626 --> 00:05:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  So this is how the whole thing started. And it started with a small grant, literally 40K. It was a discretionary fund.

00:05:38,882 --> 00:05:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  And this is how I got started in my career.

00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:47,262
SPEAKER_1:  And so many of these questions you can answer by looking at life and extreme conditions here on Earth.

00:05:47,618 --> 00:05:48,062
SPEAKER_1:  What's the-

00:05:48,354 --> 00:05:51,230
SPEAKER_1:  back a little bit and look at Mars.

00:05:51,842 --> 00:05:52,958
SPEAKER_1:  and Lakes on Mars.

00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:57,118
SPEAKER_1:  Going back to your PhD and before, and maybe today.

00:05:57,442 --> 00:05:59,198
SPEAKER_1:  What do we understand about life?

00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,318
SPEAKER_1:  on Mars.

00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:02,590
SPEAKER_1:  What do we understand about lakes?

00:06:03,266 --> 00:06:08,062
SPEAKER_1:  Is there water on Mars? What do we understand about the conditions from 4 billion years ago on Mars?

00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  Well, we've gone a long way. Remember from the Viking where we had no resolution. Well, we'll have a little bit more resolution with them.

00:06:15,554 --> 00:06:19,679
SPEAKER_1:  What did you think at that time? Sorry to interrupt. It was......ா?

00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  It was really the exploration, like your first look.

00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,310
SPEAKER_0:  at a planet.

00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:29,630
SPEAKER_0:  you have to remember that the first mission that successfully

00:06:30,018 --> 00:06:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  snapped some pictures of Martha with Mariner.

00:06:32,962 --> 00:06:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  for.

00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:34,686
SPEAKER_0:  And then.

00:06:34,946 --> 00:06:38,174
SPEAKER_0:  Everybody at that time was still under the spell of...

00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  you know, etched wells and the idea that Mars looked.

00:06:43,554 --> 00:06:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  with telescope.

00:06:44,898 --> 00:06:46,814
SPEAKER_0:  so similar to the earth.

00:06:47,682 --> 00:06:48,574
SPEAKER_0:  quarter caps.

00:06:48,962 --> 00:06:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  We could see them with a telescope.

00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:52,254
SPEAKER_0:  And we knew it had season.

00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:57,022
SPEAKER_0:  the actual tilt is pretty much the same as the one for Earth.

00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:57,982
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  When Mariner 4 left, everybody...

00:07:01,314 --> 00:07:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  Not everybody, but a lot of people thought that we were cities, crystal cities and domes and stuff.

00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:11,486
SPEAKER_0:  that another civilization might have evolved in parallel to us in the source system.

00:07:12,002 --> 00:07:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  And of course, when the first images came back and Mars looked with that kind of resolution, it had a big pause.

00:07:18,274 --> 00:07:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  Like the moon.

00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,830
SPEAKER_0:  It was a huge disappointment.

00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,558
SPEAKER_0:  Then Mariner 9.

00:07:23,202 --> 00:07:23,902
SPEAKER_0:  came.

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,174
SPEAKER_0:  and that changed everything.

00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  There was a little bit of drama.

00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  because...

00:07:30,178 --> 00:07:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  Morris.

00:07:31,106 --> 00:07:33,182
SPEAKER_0:  started one of the biggest dust storms.

00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,390
SPEAKER_0:  it ever experienced.

00:07:35,618 --> 00:07:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  So for three months we had an orbiter circling around Mars and not seeing anything.

00:07:41,314 --> 00:07:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  But then...

00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,646
SPEAKER_0:  when the dust cleared.

00:07:44,354 --> 00:07:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  All of a sudden, we started discovering.

00:07:46,434 --> 00:07:47,358
SPEAKER_0:  Volcanoes.

00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  Valleys, ancient channels.

00:07:50,018 --> 00:07:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  dune fields, polar caps.

00:07:52,194 --> 00:07:55,550
SPEAKER_0:  and see what I'm talking to you. I don't need to invent any words.

00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,598
SPEAKER_0:  to describe Mars.

00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  And although the myth

00:08:00,642 --> 00:08:01,278
SPEAKER_0:  of

00:08:01,602 --> 00:08:03,454
SPEAKER_0:  extraterrestrial civilization.

00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  on Mars.

00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  was gone.

00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,070
SPEAKER_0:  All of a sudden...

00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  The imagination of the scientists started to pick up because right away we were seeing something that was familiar.

00:08:14,434 --> 00:08:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  that we could describe. So look.

00:08:16,738 --> 00:08:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  right away.

00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  Viking with-

00:08:19,394 --> 00:08:24,030
SPEAKER_0:  put on the fast track and the idea was so Mars looks so much like

00:08:24,386 --> 00:08:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  Earth could have been, although it's arid and there is little atmosphere, etc.

00:08:29,794 --> 00:08:30,622
SPEAKER_0:  Could there be life?

00:08:30,882 --> 00:08:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  And of course, behind this.

00:08:33,442 --> 00:08:35,582
SPEAKER_0:  At the time, they were people like...

00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  Klein and Sagan call Sagan.

00:08:38,754 --> 00:08:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  Just you know.

00:08:40,482 --> 00:08:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:08:41,634 --> 00:08:42,686
SPEAKER_0:  thinking about.

00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  How can we test the idea of?

00:08:45,282 --> 00:08:48,414
SPEAKER_0:  biology of life on Mars. So this is what Viking did.

00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,894
SPEAKER_0:  But of course, at the time when the two landers arrived on Mars…

00:08:53,762 --> 00:08:54,718
SPEAKER_0:  We didn't have...

00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  the context of the geology of the environment. We didn't have much data at all.

00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  So the data that Viking.

00:09:02,946 --> 00:09:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  Send back.

00:09:03,906 --> 00:09:04,958
SPEAKER_0:  was very confusing.

00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,862
SPEAKER_0:  Some people still think today that we discovered life on Mars.

00:09:09,154 --> 00:09:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  at the time because some of the experiment turned out.

00:09:12,514 --> 00:09:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  to show a strange signal.

00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  But most of the community think that it can be explained by chemical reaction that we see today.

00:09:20,002 --> 00:09:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  So it was so confusing that NASA decided to say, okay, if we want...

00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  to be serious about looking for life on Mars.

00:09:26,658 --> 00:09:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  we have to understand the environment.

00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:31,614
SPEAKER_0:  because life and environment co-evolve.

00:09:32,482 --> 00:09:34,974
SPEAKER_0:  So as cause or effect.

00:09:35,234 --> 00:09:38,270
SPEAKER_0:  A planet is going to give you the physical chemical environment.

00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  life.

00:09:39,842 --> 00:09:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  happen. These are the boundaries.

00:09:41,602 --> 00:09:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  But once life is here...

00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  is going to change everything. One of

00:09:47,042 --> 00:09:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  The biggest impact of life was to inject oxygen.

00:09:50,978 --> 00:09:54,462
SPEAKER_0:  into the atmosphere of the Earth 2 billion years ago.

00:09:54,786 --> 00:09:58,046
SPEAKER_0:  And that changed everything, including our signature in space.

00:09:58,434 --> 00:09:59,006
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:09:59,746 --> 00:10:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  There is this co-evolution. So if you want to understand one, you have to remove the other from the equation. It's kind of a two-and-none.

00:10:06,114 --> 00:10:10,110
SPEAKER_1:  So even though oxygen changes our signature today.

00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,182
SPEAKER_1:  What if all life on earth died?

00:10:13,602 --> 00:10:15,902
SPEAKER_1:  And now we fast forward a billion years.

00:10:16,578 --> 00:10:18,814
SPEAKER_1:  What would be the traces left? So...

00:10:19,394 --> 00:10:20,862
SPEAKER_1:  The question I'm trying to ask is.

00:10:21,506 --> 00:10:24,094
SPEAKER_1:  if life had existed on Mars.

00:10:24,386 --> 00:10:25,511
SPEAKER_1:  What would be the signs?

00:10:25,511 --> 00:10:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  would look for? That's a very good question. The thing is that if you draw the parallel with Earth,

00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:35,262
SPEAKER_0:  It took 82% of Earth's history.

00:10:35,874 --> 00:10:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  geological history.

00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,318
SPEAKER_0:  to go from very simple life, microbial life.

00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  Complexity. And when I'm saying complexity, I'm not even talking about us. I'm talking about animals.

00:10:46,306 --> 00:10:46,814
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:10:47,394 --> 00:10:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  Mars is smaller, lost its magnetic field.

00:10:50,434 --> 00:10:52,926
SPEAKER_0:  very fast and lost its atmosphere very fast.

00:10:54,114 --> 00:10:55,550
SPEAKER_0:  Live also.

00:10:56,386 --> 00:11:05,886
SPEAKER_0:  appeared on Earth very fast. So the condition being quite similar at that time between the Earth and Mars, let's assume for a moment that life appeared on Mars. It would have been simple life.

00:11:06,754 --> 00:11:09,246
SPEAKER_0:  when conditions started to degrade.

00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  which was.

00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:13,022
SPEAKER_0:  less than a billion years after the planet had formed.

00:11:13,602 --> 00:11:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  So everything at the surface.

00:11:16,354 --> 00:11:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  would have disappeared.

00:11:17,794 --> 00:11:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  except maybe for...

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  morphological traces of the interaction between life and its environment. So on Earth, the best examples are what we call stromatolites.

00:11:28,482 --> 00:11:29,502
SPEAKER_0:  These are.

00:11:30,018 --> 00:11:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  rock formation.

00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,022
SPEAKER_0:  that are built by microbes.

00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  So we know that, we know how to recognize them.

00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:38,686
SPEAKER_0:  You could have chemical traces.

00:11:38,978 --> 00:11:39,710
SPEAKER_0:  as well.

00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:45,630
SPEAKER_0:  There is some interesting question marks right now, but carbon isotopes at Gale Crater.

00:11:45,986 --> 00:11:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  because we found an abundance of C12.

00:11:50,082 --> 00:11:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  which normally is used by life on Earth, but it can be produced by other things. So it's not that it's a real biosignature in itself.

00:11:58,242 --> 00:12:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  But it's intriguing, we have now the C12 and we have math in.

00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:02,718
SPEAKER_0:  But.

00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  Going back

00:12:04,866 --> 00:12:11,774
SPEAKER_0:  It's a time on Mars 3.5 billion years ago where you have lots of destructions, where you have lots of impact cratering etc.

00:12:12,162 --> 00:12:15,390
SPEAKER_0:  But we still have very old rocks.

00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  that survived from that time.

00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:18,814
SPEAKER_0:  So these are good.

00:12:19,074 --> 00:12:26,878
SPEAKER_0:  good places, that's why we're sending the rovers in those places, ancient lakes and impact craters and places where you have very old rocks.

00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:29,534
SPEAKER_1:  So when you say ancient lakes and impact craters.

00:12:29,954 --> 00:12:30,910
SPEAKER_1:  The simple question.

00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,510
SPEAKER_1:  So Impact Creator.

00:12:33,058 --> 00:12:36,433
SPEAKER_1:  Is a crater created by a giant rock hitting the planet?

00:12:36,433 --> 00:12:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, a big rock that can be metal or rock.

00:12:39,938 --> 00:12:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  or it can be a comet as well, mostly ice.

00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,638
SPEAKER_1:  So is that good for life or bad for life?

00:12:45,602 --> 00:12:47,477
SPEAKER_1:  for creating life and destroying.

00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  Both. It's actually both.

00:12:49,922 --> 00:12:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  Interestingly enough...

00:12:52,994 --> 00:12:54,302
SPEAKER_0:  the building blocks of life.

00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  The bricks, the stuff we are made of.

00:12:56,706 --> 00:12:59,870
SPEAKER_0:  carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus.

00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  They were included.

00:13:02,754 --> 00:13:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  on our planet.

00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,118
SPEAKER_0:  They were built in.

00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  just because our planet is made of these kind of rocks, asteroids and comets coming together by what we call accretion.

00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:14,590
SPEAKER_0:  So they were built in.

00:13:14,946 --> 00:13:16,510
SPEAKER_0:  when an asteroid comes.

00:13:17,154 --> 00:13:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  There is a lot of destruction going on.

00:13:19,554 --> 00:13:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  but at the same time.

00:13:21,122 --> 00:13:23,806
SPEAKER_0:  Those rocks they bring with them.

00:13:24,258 --> 00:13:25,534
SPEAKER_0:  Those bricks of life?

00:13:26,114 --> 00:13:28,414
SPEAKER_0:  and they create lots of energy.

00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  and if the environment around

00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  is favorable.

00:13:33,026 --> 00:13:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  You might-

00:13:33,954 --> 00:13:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  possibly have some seeding going on. That's one of the aspects of what we call panspermia.

00:13:40,706 --> 00:13:45,534
SPEAKER_0:  which is the fact that comets and asteroids have the building blocks of life.

00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,910
SPEAKER_0:  and better than them.

00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  and that given favorable conditions, they might be able to see planets. This is a theory.

00:13:52,258 --> 00:13:53,694
SPEAKER_1:  What percent of you?

00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:59,518
SPEAKER_1:  When you're looking up at the stars and wondering about this stuff, think step pass. Romeo has community.

00:14:00,162 --> 00:14:02,814
SPEAKER_1:  is what happened on Mars or on Earth.

00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:06,750
SPEAKER_1:  which is the building blocks of life came from elsewhere.

00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  Well, but you know, that's the thing, panspermia is a vector, potential vector, which means that…

00:14:12,962 --> 00:14:14,398
SPEAKER_0:  it actually distributes.

00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  The stuff of life.

00:14:16,098 --> 00:14:17,022
SPEAKER_0:  Left and right.

00:14:17,602 --> 00:14:21,246
SPEAKER_0:  it doesn't explain the origin of life. It's not the environment.

00:14:21,474 --> 00:14:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  itself.

00:14:22,242 --> 00:14:25,822
SPEAKER_0:  It just promotes maybe, and we still have to prove this.

00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,990
SPEAKER_0:  But what we know is that the stuff we are made of

00:14:29,538 --> 00:14:34,462
SPEAKER_0:  is very abundant all over the place, including in interstellar medium.

00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  So it's all over. It's all over.

00:14:37,474 --> 00:14:39,710
SPEAKER_0:  The idea is that maybe it just waits.

00:14:40,002 --> 00:14:42,078
SPEAKER_0:  to have the proper environment.

00:14:42,402 --> 00:14:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  And we know what it needs here on Earth. It needs water. It needs energy, shelter.

00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:48,158
SPEAKER_0:  a nutrient.

00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,190
SPEAKER_1:  So you're fundamentally interested in the origin of life.

00:14:53,154 --> 00:14:54,942
SPEAKER_1:  and the big leaps.

00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,014
SPEAKER_1:  in evolutionary history.

00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:03,614
SPEAKER_1:  that could be like an origin of something origin of your couriers origin of.

00:15:04,258 --> 00:15:05,854
SPEAKER_1:  for a synthesis origin of.

00:15:06,082 --> 00:15:06,590
SPEAKER_1:  Whatever.

00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:11,006
SPEAKER_1:  I just think if we're a civilization here on earth and we survive another few hundred

00:15:11,234 --> 00:15:11,806
SPEAKER_1:  Years.

00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,134
SPEAKER_1:  I think it would be a good idea to take a big gun.

00:15:15,554 --> 00:15:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  and just shoot life out there.

00:15:17,602 --> 00:15:18,430
SPEAKER_1:  Like a life gun.

00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,886
SPEAKER_1:  Basically try to create pan-spermia. That's a good backup solution.

00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,030
SPEAKER_1:  So one way is to actually.

00:15:24,354 --> 00:15:24,798
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:15:25,186 --> 00:15:27,550
SPEAKER_1:  copy our brains and actual humans some.

00:15:28,098 --> 00:15:30,590
SPEAKER_1:  complex information and send it out there.

00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:33,630
SPEAKER_1:  Another way to preserve life is just to like...

00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:37,150
SPEAKER_1:  Send the basic building blocks. Send them with your bacteria.

00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:38,590
SPEAKER_1:  bunch of

00:15:39,362 --> 00:15:41,987
SPEAKER_1:  Whatever the rugged organisms are in earth, just send a bunch of

00:15:41,987 --> 00:15:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  These are not the building blocks, they are actual organisms.

00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:50,142
SPEAKER_1:  So what is not a nice shortcut? Or do we want to because you said building blocks are.

00:15:50,626 --> 00:15:51,902
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, the bricks have lived a c-

00:15:52,162 --> 00:15:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  carbon, nitrogen, etc., they were produced.

00:15:56,738 --> 00:16:00,574
SPEAKER_0:  by the death of previous stars. So this is how they were produced.

00:16:00,962 --> 00:16:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  And, uh.

00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  Stars like our sun.

00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,494
SPEAKER_0:  started to form 10 billion years ago.

00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  That doesn't mean that the...

00:16:08,386 --> 00:16:10,558
SPEAKER_0:  The sun is the only kind of star that...

00:16:10,882 --> 00:16:14,302
SPEAKER_0:  produce life or enable life.

00:16:14,786 --> 00:16:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  but actually was produced 10 billion years ago.

00:16:18,722 --> 00:16:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  Now what you're talking about is a little different.

00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,934
SPEAKER_0:  Right now there are many...

00:16:25,186 --> 00:16:26,174
SPEAKER_0:  Many efforts.

00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,390
SPEAKER_0:  to.

00:16:28,194 --> 00:16:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  Do the type of thing you are talking about, which is to...

00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:40,158
SPEAKER_0:  put our DNA on whatever kind of substrate and preserve it in vaults, either in different places on Earth.

00:16:40,386 --> 00:16:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  or on the moon.

00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  Some people are already thinking about putting DNA on the moon.

00:16:45,634 --> 00:16:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  As far as brains concern and

00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,814
SPEAKER_0:  It's drawing towards transhumanism.

00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  which is the enhancement of who we are through AI and machine learning.

00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,550
SPEAKER_0:  Of course, having backups is a good thing.

00:17:00,002 --> 00:17:00,606
SPEAKER_0:  For me.

00:17:01,282 --> 00:17:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  I would say that taking care of our planets and going back to a place where we are.

00:17:06,466 --> 00:17:11,646
SPEAKER_0:  in equilibrium with our environment would be also maybe the best backup possible.

00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  and let evolution do its things.

00:17:14,754 --> 00:17:16,446
SPEAKER_0:  Right now we are like teenagers.

00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  with enough brain to create.

00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  cool tools.

00:17:20,738 --> 00:17:25,310
SPEAKER_0:  but we don't have enough brain to understand yet the consequences of what we are doing.

00:17:25,858 --> 00:17:27,806
SPEAKER_0:  And right now we're paying for this.

00:17:28,322 --> 00:17:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  So the question is whether we are going to be able to move.

00:17:34,274 --> 00:17:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  forward.

00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:35,902
SPEAKER_0:  and learn.

00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:36,830
SPEAKER_0:  from.

00:17:37,186 --> 00:17:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  the mistakes we are making.

00:17:38,594 --> 00:17:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  to become a mature civilization.

00:17:41,858 --> 00:17:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  You probably heard of the Drake equation. That would be the L at the very end.

00:17:46,978 --> 00:17:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  The duration.

00:17:48,194 --> 00:17:50,069
SPEAKER_1:  Which iteration of intelligence it was?

00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  Exactly. And, and, or at least.

00:17:53,186 --> 00:17:53,630
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  The length of time.

00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  a civilization remains detectable.

00:17:59,394 --> 00:18:04,574
SPEAKER_0:  It can disappear from the radar screen literally for a number of reasons. The first one is...

00:18:05,538 --> 00:18:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  destroy itself or being destroyed by external...

00:18:10,242 --> 00:18:11,006
SPEAKER_0:  events.

00:18:11,266 --> 00:18:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  or it can become so in tune.

00:18:13,986 --> 00:18:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  and with the universe.

00:18:16,354 --> 00:18:22,206
SPEAKER_0:  and so advanced that it disappears because it melts really in the background and it's not visible anymore.

00:18:22,658 --> 00:18:26,334
SPEAKER_0:  There are some wild theories out there saying that.

00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:18:27,714 --> 00:18:31,006
SPEAKER_0:  Civilization might be so advanced that you cannot distinguish them.

00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:31,870
SPEAKER_0:  from.

00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  physical processes.

00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  And uh

00:18:34,978 --> 00:18:46,430
SPEAKER_0:  That was an example. It doesn't say that this is the case, but some people say, imagine that. In fact, all the dark matter that we see or we theorize about is in fact some sort of a biological.

00:18:46,946 --> 00:18:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  process.

00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  So you can think about a number of things.

00:18:51,106 --> 00:18:51,998
SPEAKER_0:  Personally.

00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  I believe that.

00:18:54,882 --> 00:18:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  What you

00:18:55,618 --> 00:18:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  talk about preserving our information.

00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  It's kind of what life does. We need to look at ourselves.

00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  as not different.

00:19:05,346 --> 00:19:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  of what the little sale that started off.

00:19:08,226 --> 00:19:08,830
SPEAKER_0:  was.

00:19:09,122 --> 00:19:17,342
SPEAKER_0:  And this is what tells you not about the origin of life, but in fact, the nature of life, which is a lot more interesting to me because the nature of life.

00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:20,734
SPEAKER_0:  is really what is going to give you some universal.

00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:25,534
SPEAKER_0:  signature to look for it all over the place and not only around ponds of water.

00:19:25,954 --> 00:19:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  for life as we know it.

00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  But the nature of life is telling you that…

00:19:31,746 --> 00:19:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  life wants.

00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  to.

00:19:34,402 --> 00:19:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  get the most information possible around its surroundings.

00:19:38,146 --> 00:19:40,606
SPEAKER_0:  And complexity is in fact the ability to...

00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,302
SPEAKER_0:  Gather.

00:19:42,722 --> 00:19:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  and exchange.

00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  and preserve the most information possible.

00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,574
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  What you're saying is kind of preserving the kind of information we have.

00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:19:54,338 --> 00:19:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  in the things that we're doing.

00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,326
SPEAKER_0:  as life.

00:19:59,842 --> 00:20:00,414
SPEAKER_0:  happened.

00:20:02,082 --> 00:20:04,350
SPEAKER_0:  And I say happen because we don't know what life is.

00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  We have 123 definitions of life and some people are saying we don't have any definition, we only have descriptions.

00:20:11,362 --> 00:20:11,742
SPEAKER_0:  life.

00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  And that's true.

00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  And that's true.

00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  Think about it for two minutes. We are looking for something we don't know it is. But we have a few clues about the nature of life.

00:20:22,018 --> 00:20:27,230
SPEAKER_0:  There are some really good theories. The first one was Schrodinger, right? In the 40s.

00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:36,478
SPEAKER_0:  Right now there is a guy named Jeremy England. It's another biophysical theory of life. It says life is the inevitable result.

00:20:37,378 --> 00:20:38,814
SPEAKER_0:  of thermophysics.

00:20:40,034 --> 00:20:43,422
SPEAKER_0:  This is the best way to beat entropy, to fight entropy.

00:20:43,874 --> 00:20:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  But when you look at what we are doing, if you want to know what the nature of life is,

00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:55,102
SPEAKER_0:  look at our languages and they can be very different languages but they all have the same purpose right?

00:20:55,682 --> 00:20:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  exchange information.

00:20:57,314 --> 00:21:03,710
SPEAKER_0:  understand, you know, store information and also whether it is with somebody at the outside.

00:21:04,738 --> 00:21:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  or thoughts in yourself.

00:21:07,362 --> 00:21:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  That's the same thing the cell was doing.

00:21:09,794 --> 00:21:11,486
SPEAKER_0:  But now when you're looking at life.

00:21:11,842 --> 00:21:12,894
SPEAKER_0:  and add.

00:21:13,218 --> 00:21:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  the structure of our languages.

00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  Life started with an anthem.

00:21:18,594 --> 00:21:19,294
SPEAKER_0:  So it's another.

00:21:20,098 --> 00:21:23,102
SPEAKER_0:  they got together to create inorganic molecules.

00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  then you have complex inorganic molecules.

00:21:26,658 --> 00:21:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  Then you get to organic molecules, complex organic molecules.

00:21:31,842 --> 00:21:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  And then you have RNA, DNA, et cetera.

00:21:34,562 --> 00:21:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  Look at the structure of our language.

00:21:36,866 --> 00:21:38,174
SPEAKER_0:  We created alphabets.

00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  letters.

00:21:40,642 --> 00:21:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  That's your anthem.

00:21:42,242 --> 00:21:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  then we put them together to create syllables.

00:21:45,506 --> 00:21:45,854
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

00:21:46,146 --> 00:21:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  The syllables get together to create words.

00:21:48,962 --> 00:21:50,462
SPEAKER_0:  Words tell you something.

00:21:51,202 --> 00:21:53,214
SPEAKER_0:  but they are nothing without a verb.

00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  that gives the direction.

00:21:54,978 --> 00:21:56,542
SPEAKER_0:  That's RNA and DNA.

00:21:57,122 --> 00:21:57,598
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  and then you can put all the complements you want.

00:22:00,578 --> 00:22:03,038
SPEAKER_0:  our languages are built exactly.

00:22:03,362 --> 00:22:06,686
SPEAKER_0:  as life is built. We are repeating patterns.

00:22:07,266 --> 00:22:12,382
SPEAKER_0:  I call this the Mandelbrot universe and the fractal universe because this is exactly what it is.

00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:13,310
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  I would say that as much as I do believe to sending probes…

00:22:17,698 --> 00:22:19,038
SPEAKER_0:  to explore the universe.

00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:21,246
SPEAKER_0:  I say we should also look inward.

00:22:21,826 --> 00:22:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  to find.

00:22:23,746 --> 00:22:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  the answer to some of the profound questions of who we are, what's life, what's the nature of life, because we are expressing.

00:22:31,746 --> 00:22:33,310
SPEAKER_1:  So searching not for life.

00:22:34,402 --> 00:22:35,527
SPEAKER_1:  but for the nature of

00:22:35,527 --> 00:22:40,542
SPEAKER_0:  The nature of life, absolutely. I am more interested in that because the day we understand...

00:22:41,058 --> 00:22:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  The nature of life.

00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  Then we have a universal

00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:46,206
SPEAKER_0:  by your signature.

00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  And it doesn't matter whether this life

00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  respond to the same kind of biochemical processes as we do, although it makes sense. I told you about the generational aspect.

00:22:58,914 --> 00:22:59,358
SPEAKER_0:  of

00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,886
SPEAKER_0:  The bricks of life, the stuff we are made of.

00:23:02,338 --> 00:23:05,310
SPEAKER_0:  The sun is part of the youngest generation of stars.

00:23:05,826 --> 00:23:11,166
SPEAKER_0:  And the first two generations of stars didn't produce the kind of elements we are made of.

00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,694
SPEAKER_0:  they were stars that were either

00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  without.

00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  Metal?

00:23:17,122 --> 00:23:19,230
SPEAKER_0:  just made of helium and hydrogen?

00:23:19,778 --> 00:23:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  or poor in metals.

00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,150
SPEAKER_0:  The stars died off.

00:23:25,922 --> 00:23:26,430
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:28,894
SPEAKER_0:  Stars like the sun were born from...

00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  those.

00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:32,126
SPEAKER_0:  And this is why.

00:23:32,482 --> 00:23:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  we have elements like carbon, hydrogen.

00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,926
SPEAKER_0:  oxygen that is running now.

00:23:37,538 --> 00:23:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  And that's the life we're built on. So-

00:23:41,314 --> 00:23:42,654
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's not.

00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  Stupid to be looking for something that looks like us, because right now in the universe this is the stuff that's the most abundant?

00:23:49,058 --> 00:23:51,134
SPEAKER_0:  And we see with the exoplanet.

00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:55,134
SPEAKER_0:  with Kepler, with Tess, and now with JamSwap.

00:23:55,586 --> 00:24:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  we see that there are many, many different types of planets that may be habitable in the habitable zone of their stars.

00:24:02,178 --> 00:24:04,574
SPEAKER_0:  There are countless stars like the sun.

00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:08,670
SPEAKER_0:  But more interestingly enough, there are other types of stars.

00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:14,142
SPEAKER_0:  where you do have habitable zone as well, and where the duration of the stars

00:24:14,882 --> 00:24:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  sometimes a thousand times more than our sun.

00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:21,182
SPEAKER_0:  So you can imagine all sorts of things.

00:24:21,474 --> 00:24:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  and you can imagine what type of life would be.

00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:26,430
SPEAKER_0:  on around those stars.

00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  The biochemistry might be quite similar, in fact, and especially for the simple life.

00:24:33,122 --> 00:24:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  because simple life starts really quickly.

00:24:35,938 --> 00:24:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  on Earth.

00:24:37,218 --> 00:24:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  So my take on this is that the universe is full of cyanobacteria.

00:24:41,218 --> 00:24:43,582
SPEAKER_0:  but as far as intelligence.

00:24:43,906 --> 00:24:44,542
SPEAKER_0:  Life.

00:24:44,994 --> 00:24:46,174
SPEAKER_0:  It takes more time.

00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:47,582
SPEAKER_0:  So that can take...

00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  different, you know, aspect.

00:24:49,986 --> 00:24:51,358
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think it's possible that...

00:24:51,906 --> 00:24:52,798
SPEAKER_1:  The universe.

00:24:53,538 --> 00:24:59,198
SPEAKER_1:  It's full of bacteria and even those stars that last a thousand times longer than the sun.

00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:01,534
SPEAKER_1:  Even even under.

00:25:02,498 --> 00:25:03,198
SPEAKER_1:  planets.

00:25:03,682 --> 00:25:05,022
SPEAKER_1:  that orbit those.

00:25:05,698 --> 00:25:06,430
SPEAKER_1:  stars.

00:25:07,522 --> 00:25:08,830
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe it's bacteria.

00:25:10,146 --> 00:25:13,278
SPEAKER_1:  for billions and billions and billions of years.

00:25:13,794 --> 00:25:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  We actually don't know.

00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  triggered.

00:25:16,898 --> 00:25:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  evolution to complexity on Earth? That's still a big question mark.

00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:23,166
SPEAKER_1:  Is that the most impressive invention on earth to you?

00:25:23,298 --> 00:25:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  That's it.

00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:25,310
SPEAKER_0:  Cambrian Revolution.

00:25:25,922 --> 00:25:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  is really what took us towards what we are.

00:25:29,186 --> 00:25:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  And in the meantime, there were the dinosaurs, et cetera. The dinosaurs were wiped out. So the evolution could have taken the...

00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,734
SPEAKER_0:  completely different turn.

00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:40,638
SPEAKER_0:  It's always, I would say, mass extinction that are going to drive.

00:25:41,154 --> 00:25:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  What's the end game?

00:25:42,914 --> 00:25:43,390
SPEAKER_0:  But...

00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:25:45,154 --> 00:25:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, you take two planets and you change.

00:25:48,226 --> 00:25:51,806
SPEAKER_0:  You know, those asteroid impacts, all those big...

00:25:52,066 --> 00:25:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  geological events.

00:25:53,602 --> 00:25:54,494
SPEAKER_0:  that wipe out.

00:25:54,818 --> 00:25:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  like 90% of life.

00:25:56,674 --> 00:25:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  at any time.

00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  The thing that seemed to be...

00:26:01,698 --> 00:26:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  Interesting. There are two things.

00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:05,982
SPEAKER_0:  The first one is where you are located on

00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  Galaxy.

00:26:07,586 --> 00:26:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:26:08,386 --> 00:26:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  matters a lot.

00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,278
SPEAKER_0:  We actually are in the habitable zone.

00:26:13,602 --> 00:26:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  of our galaxy.

00:26:15,202 --> 00:26:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  And if you are.

00:26:16,802 --> 00:26:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  close to the center then it's a lot denser.

00:26:20,098 --> 00:26:29,406
SPEAKER_0:  And remember, we have the Oort cloud around our solar system. And if you are in the region of the galaxy that's too populated,

00:26:29,698 --> 00:26:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  then you're going to run interaction.

00:26:31,746 --> 00:26:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  gravitational interaction with all these stars.

00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  And since it's more dense, you will have more of the comets that are leaving.

00:26:40,386 --> 00:26:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  in the old cloud being ejected from the old cloud and.

00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  coming towards the inner solar system.

00:26:47,746 --> 00:26:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  and collide with planets. So you will have more of these impacts if you are too close to the center of the galaxy, not to mention the radiation. There is-

00:26:56,994 --> 00:27:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  a place in our galaxy where it's a really bad neighborhood. You don't want to be there. You wouldn't be able to have life.

00:27:03,234 --> 00:27:03,550
SPEAKER_0:  But.

00:27:03,938 --> 00:27:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  What really matters is...

00:27:06,818 --> 00:27:07,614
SPEAKER_0:  Extinctions?

00:27:08,354 --> 00:27:09,342
SPEAKER_0:  but also...

00:27:09,698 --> 00:27:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:27:10,946 --> 00:27:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  Climate History.

00:27:12,962 --> 00:27:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  of a planet has a role to play.

00:27:15,042 --> 00:27:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  And

00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  It seems...

00:27:17,794 --> 00:27:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  that.

00:27:19,682 --> 00:27:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  It's a theory, it still has to be backed up by more observation, but there is a good correlation.

00:27:25,474 --> 00:27:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  between only the passage of the solar system towards the center of the galaxy. There is one place where we get hit by asteroids.

00:27:33,826 --> 00:27:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  because of the interaction I was telling you about.

00:27:36,706 --> 00:27:37,470
SPEAKER_0:  But the other one.

00:27:37,762 --> 00:27:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  is the climate.

00:27:39,394 --> 00:27:41,278
SPEAKER_0:  with the Milankovitch cycles.

00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  Big jumps.

00:27:43,266 --> 00:27:46,334
SPEAKER_0:  in life's evolution seem to be associated.

00:27:46,626 --> 00:27:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  with

00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  Snowball Earth episodes.

00:27:51,682 --> 00:27:52,414
SPEAKER_0:  We don't know.

00:27:53,058 --> 00:27:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  Why yet?

00:27:54,914 --> 00:27:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  Snowball episode.

00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:59,774
SPEAKER_0:  intuitively you would think that they are connected.

00:28:00,002 --> 00:28:00,702
SPEAKER_0:  to.

00:28:01,154 --> 00:28:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  decrease in life because the whole Earth is covered in ice.

00:28:06,658 --> 00:28:07,614
SPEAKER_0:  but for some reason.

00:28:07,874 --> 00:28:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  there were big jumps in evolution right after.

00:28:10,946 --> 00:28:12,158
SPEAKER_0:  each of those episodes.

00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  And today there are other things like...

00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:21,246
SPEAKER_0:  Why all of a sudden you have mutation that seems to be responsible for a big jump in evolution?

00:28:21,506 --> 00:28:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  We are not clear yet. So all of those sayings when you're thinking about life elsewhere.

00:28:26,306 --> 00:28:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  are going to come into play.

00:28:28,418 --> 00:28:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  And I cannot tell you.

00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:35,998
SPEAKER_0:  that a planet that remains habitable for much longer than the Earth

00:28:36,418 --> 00:28:37,310
SPEAKER_0:  will have.

00:28:37,762 --> 00:28:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  an evolutionary path that's the same or different.

00:28:41,058 --> 00:28:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  depends on extension, depends on climate, depends on...

00:28:45,154 --> 00:28:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  but not.

00:28:45,794 --> 00:28:48,510
SPEAKER_1:  It's a little bit surreal that we're two descendants of apes.

00:28:50,402 --> 00:28:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  I think that's some

00:28:52,322 --> 00:28:53,447
SPEAKER_0:  some people. girl.

00:28:53,447 --> 00:28:59,134
SPEAKER_1:  what the heck is going on. And I mean we're very biased even as a so you.

00:28:59,618 --> 00:29:00,926
SPEAKER_1:  We're biased as humans.

00:29:01,378 --> 00:29:03,262
SPEAKER_1:  You're less biased as a scientist.

00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:09,310
SPEAKER_1:  But we still love earth. We still don't know anything but this earth

00:29:09,794 --> 00:29:12,158
SPEAKER_1:  And so even though you try to get escape.

00:29:12,738 --> 00:29:14,782
SPEAKER_1:  from thinking of what life is.

00:29:15,298 --> 00:29:18,334
SPEAKER_1:  in the search for the nature of life we still kind of connected to.

00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:20,702
SPEAKER_1:  the way we understand the nature of life here on Earth.

00:29:20,834 --> 00:29:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  So...

00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  I think that it's a little different than that.

00:29:24,578 --> 00:29:27,166
SPEAKER_0:  We are biased when it comes to the origin.

00:29:27,522 --> 00:29:27,998
SPEAKER_0:  of life.

00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  Yes. Becauseă

00:29:30,146 --> 00:29:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  Well, we are the only model we know.

00:29:33,186 --> 00:29:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  And as I said, it makes sense.

00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:35,934
SPEAKER_0:  because

00:29:36,418 --> 00:29:37,342
SPEAKER_0:  It seems that

00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of...

00:29:39,298 --> 00:29:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  you know, stars like the sun.

00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  appeared 10 billion years ago.

00:29:43,906 --> 00:29:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  and there are lots of words that really resemble the Earth.

00:29:48,258 --> 00:29:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  and lots of water out there and lots of conditions that could be a repeat of what we know.

00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  and we know that this biochemistry works.

00:29:56,834 --> 00:30:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  So, again, as I mentioned, what is going to change is really the evolution of a planet, extinction, geology, etc.

00:30:05,314 --> 00:30:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  But our model...

00:30:06,882 --> 00:30:09,790
SPEAKER_0:  is probably very abundant. I'm not saying that the endgame

00:30:10,082 --> 00:30:13,566
SPEAKER_0:  is going to resemble us because of all these extinctions, etc.

00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  But this is...

00:30:15,394 --> 00:30:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  A good bias, it's one that has the number for it.

00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  You know the principle of mediocrity. I think that in that case

00:30:24,962 --> 00:30:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  It really applies.

00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  where the Earth

00:30:28,546 --> 00:30:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  is representative.

00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  of an abundance.

00:30:31,778 --> 00:30:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  of other words.

00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:37,470
SPEAKER_0:  Now, of course, there can be other biochemistry. We have

00:30:37,826 --> 00:30:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  Some examples in our own source system Titan might be

00:30:41,282 --> 00:30:42,526
SPEAKER_0:  representative of that.

00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:46,494
SPEAKER_0:  We are not very clear the kind of biochemistry that can come out.

00:30:46,882 --> 00:30:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  of a world where you have hydrocarbon lakes and rains and things like that.

00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  But we're going there.

00:30:55,394 --> 00:30:57,438
SPEAKER_0:  So we will learn something about this.

00:30:58,594 --> 00:31:00,766
SPEAKER_0:  So the bias is right there.

00:31:01,058 --> 00:31:02,558
SPEAKER_0:  The nature of life is different.

00:31:03,426 --> 00:31:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  If really.

00:31:04,802 --> 00:31:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  Life.

00:31:06,018 --> 00:31:06,654
SPEAKER_0:  is

00:31:07,202 --> 00:31:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  the best way the universe has to fight entropy.

00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  There is no bias there.

00:31:12,418 --> 00:31:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  Because physics is the same all across the universe, at least the universe we know, there might be other universes.

00:31:18,434 --> 00:31:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  but the one we know works with the same physics.

00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,206
SPEAKER_1:  So if life is the-

00:31:22,562 --> 00:31:24,414
SPEAKER_1:  the best way to fight entropy.

00:31:25,154 --> 00:31:27,838
SPEAKER_1:  You can imagine that life permeates.

00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:29,982
SPEAKER_1:  the entire universe.

00:31:30,338 --> 00:31:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  and then the question might change to.

00:31:33,122 --> 00:31:36,510
SPEAKER_1:  like flavors of ice cream, what are the flavors of complexity?

00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:37,694
SPEAKER_1:  that.

00:31:37,922 --> 00:31:38,238
SPEAKER_1:  this

00:31:38,498 --> 00:31:41,086
SPEAKER_1:  process this nature of life leads to.

00:31:41,378 --> 00:31:42,878
SPEAKER_1:  and there we might have bias.

00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  about what complexity.

00:31:45,378 --> 00:31:45,950
SPEAKER_1:  Looks like.

00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:50,174
SPEAKER_1:  what beautiful complexity looks like. We'll look at humans that operate a certain.

00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:52,638
SPEAKER_1:  physical scale and uh...

00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:53,854
SPEAKER_1:  time scale.

00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:55,870
SPEAKER_1:  And we think this is intelligence.

00:31:56,194 --> 00:31:57,118
SPEAKER_0:  We have another problem.

00:31:57,346 --> 00:32:04,542
SPEAKER_0:  We don't know what life is, we don't know what intelligence is, and we don't know what consciousness is, but we are trying to tackle the big question.

00:32:04,866 --> 00:32:07,198
SPEAKER_1:  But do we know what complexity is also?

00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  You know, no, I think that we have to be honest and as a scientist.

00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,558
SPEAKER_0:  and I'm going to step back and talk about intelligence.

00:32:15,138 --> 00:32:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  For me, bacteria...

00:32:17,858 --> 00:32:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  that has survived like cyanobacteria.

00:32:20,962 --> 00:32:22,846
SPEAKER_0:  that has survived just like us.

00:32:23,618 --> 00:32:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  four billion years in one incarnation or another, and actually they are very similar to the one that they were 3.5 billion years ago.

00:32:30,754 --> 00:32:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  It has some intelligence about its environment.

00:32:33,922 --> 00:32:34,526
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:32:34,946 --> 00:32:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  For complexity.

00:32:36,482 --> 00:32:37,470
SPEAKER_0:  It might be...

00:32:38,786 --> 00:32:42,494
SPEAKER_0:  that we need to take the world literally, which is an assemblage.

00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  or additional capacity to

00:32:45,026 --> 00:32:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  gather, collect, store information. Maybe this is something like that, or actually use that information to do something with it.

00:32:52,258 --> 00:32:52,638
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:32:53,154 --> 00:32:53,662
SPEAKER_0:  But...

00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  I do completely agree with you when you talk about flavor of ice cream.

00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  I think this is exactly it.

00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:02,046
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  I have a basic...

00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  Education about

00:33:07,106 --> 00:33:08,670
SPEAKER_0:  What physics is doing right now?

00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,046
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm-

00:33:10,498 --> 00:33:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  Look at quantum physics.

00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,846
SPEAKER_0:  and what it says about the universe.

00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  and about the connection.

00:33:17,506 --> 00:33:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  about.

00:33:18,722 --> 00:33:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  And Adam here.

00:33:20,162 --> 00:33:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  And another hair.

00:33:21,442 --> 00:33:23,102
SPEAKER_0:  the bottom here and the bottom there.

00:33:23,714 --> 00:33:25,278
SPEAKER_0:  I am starting to put maybe...

00:33:26,082 --> 00:33:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  wrongfully, two and two together.

00:33:28,578 --> 00:33:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  But in my mind...

00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  And of course it's nothing until I can prove it.

00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,110
SPEAKER_0:  but in my mind.

00:33:34,562 --> 00:33:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  The universe is connected everywhere.

00:33:37,538 --> 00:33:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  in all different places. So this is life.

00:33:40,194 --> 00:33:41,278
SPEAKER_0:  connection is.

00:33:41,634 --> 00:33:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  Something that.

00:33:42,882 --> 00:33:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  As you said, permit.

00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,598
SPEAKER_0:  the universe and

00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  The way to find life.

00:33:47,874 --> 00:33:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  might be very different than to look for the origins of life. I think it's a good thing to go out there and look for the origins of life somewhere else.

00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  because it's the manifestation.

00:33:57,314 --> 00:34:00,318
SPEAKER_0:  of the nature of life that all of a sudden becomes.

00:34:00,994 --> 00:34:02,686
SPEAKER_0:  Apparent, evident to our eye.

00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  But...

00:34:05,122 --> 00:34:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  What I think.

00:34:07,266 --> 00:34:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  would be our greatest achievement is that if we can find

00:34:11,522 --> 00:34:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  that process.

00:34:12,962 --> 00:34:13,662
SPEAKER_0:  of life.

00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  Because at that point, in my mind, the universe all of a sudden is going to…

00:34:19,138 --> 00:34:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  illuminate itself.

00:34:20,898 --> 00:34:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  with actually.

00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:25,630
SPEAKER_0:  It's living force, what I can only call a living force.

00:34:26,082 --> 00:34:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  To me, this is what we are looking at, a universe that...

00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  becomes more and more complex with time.

00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:35,422
SPEAKER_0:  more and more able to gather information.

00:34:35,906 --> 00:34:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  And interestingly enough, why?

00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  to understand.

00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  itself.

00:34:40,802 --> 00:34:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  So Sagan was right.

00:34:42,594 --> 00:34:45,950
SPEAKER_0:  when he was telling, we are the universe trying to understand itself.

00:34:46,562 --> 00:34:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  And the more we go, the more...

00:34:48,866 --> 00:34:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  the universe become.

00:34:50,754 --> 00:34:51,358
SPEAKER_0:  Alive?

00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  maybe intelligent and maybe also conscious.

00:34:55,554 --> 00:34:56,679
SPEAKER_0:  conscious, self-aware.

00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,014
SPEAKER_1:  Exactly. Through us.

00:34:58,626 --> 00:35:01,310
SPEAKER_1:  It does make me a little bit sad as a human.

00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:07,390
SPEAKER_1:  just watching all the breakthroughs on artificial intelligence side when applied to natural sciences.

00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,214
SPEAKER_1:  Now more and more to physics.

00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:10,238
SPEAKER_1:  that.

00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:13,182
SPEAKER_1:  the creatures that will solve.

00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:18,334
SPEAKER_1:  the question of the origin of the nature of life or just the process.

00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:20,062
SPEAKER_1:  The nature of life.

00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:21,790
SPEAKER_1:  will be AI systems.

00:35:22,178 --> 00:35:23,646
SPEAKER_1:  Makes me a bit sad.

00:35:23,874 --> 00:35:24,222
SPEAKER_1:  to.

00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think so.

00:35:25,954 --> 00:35:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think so. You think humans will. At this point in time, remember who's behind AI.

00:35:31,682 --> 00:35:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

00:35:32,418 --> 00:35:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not buying in the singularity thing yet.

00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:35:37,186 --> 00:35:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  AI is not aware.

00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  AI is being built by humans?

00:35:41,986 --> 00:35:43,166
SPEAKER_0:  So, um.

00:35:43,426 --> 00:35:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  AI is a tool.

00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  an extremely smart tool.

00:35:47,234 --> 00:35:48,766
SPEAKER_0:  as long as we build it.

00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  And as long as we use it as a tool, it remains a tool.

00:35:52,354 --> 00:35:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  And I think there is a lot of brouhaha and of course, science fiction and movies.

00:35:57,826 --> 00:35:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  They don't help.

00:35:58,914 --> 00:36:03,294
SPEAKER_1:  See, I gotta push back a little bit. Yes, I agree with you for the most part, which was a boo-ha-ha.

00:36:03,682 --> 00:36:05,246
SPEAKER_1:  and sci-fi.

00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:06,814
SPEAKER_1:  But...

00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,790
SPEAKER_1:  There is, like in the work of DeepMind.

00:36:10,338 --> 00:36:12,670
SPEAKER_1:  We can look at chest, or we can look at protein folding.

00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:15,038
SPEAKER_1:  So chess is a simple one.

00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,126
SPEAKER_1:  to first look at.

00:36:17,826 --> 00:36:18,206
SPEAKER_1:  What?

00:36:18,914 --> 00:36:20,158
SPEAKER_1:  Alpha zero.

00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,782
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, which is their game playing engine.

00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:26,942
SPEAKER_1:  was able to discover an outstock fish about chess.

00:36:27,426 --> 00:36:28,126
SPEAKER_1:  HUMBLES

00:36:28,546 --> 00:36:30,046
SPEAKER_1:  the best human players.

00:36:30,402 --> 00:36:32,094
SPEAKER_1:  not just is better than them.

00:36:32,962 --> 00:36:36,382
SPEAKER_1:  It comes up with ideas that the humans don't understand.

00:36:37,122 --> 00:36:39,326
SPEAKER_1:  And so the AI now is telling you.

00:36:39,938 --> 00:36:43,102
SPEAKER_1:  Even though it's programmed by humans, the AI is saying like

00:36:43,906 --> 00:36:49,534
SPEAKER_1:  Sacrificing a pawn here is a good idea. Sacrificing a queen or a bishop here is a good idea.

00:36:49,826 --> 00:36:52,638
SPEAKER_1:  and then you start to kind of intuit as a human why.

00:36:52,866 --> 00:36:54,334
SPEAKER_1:  but you don't deeply understand.

00:36:54,882 --> 00:37:02,974
SPEAKER_1:  And you can say that AI is not conscious. It doesn't deeply understand the way humans do, but there's still a wisdom and a depth of knowledge in that.

00:37:03,202 --> 00:37:05,022
SPEAKER_1:  chess playing program that humans.

00:37:05,506 --> 00:37:08,894
SPEAKER_1:  don't have and the same with the alpha fold with protein folding.

00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:13,950
SPEAKER_1:  There's another applying it to physics to simulating nuclear reactions and so on.

00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:18,206
SPEAKER_1:  It feels like there might be a way to understand the nature of life.

00:37:18,914 --> 00:37:21,822
SPEAKER_1:  that we can kind of intuit poetically as humans.

00:37:23,426 --> 00:37:26,974
SPEAKER_1:  the true understanding will come from a system that's much more complex.

00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,734
SPEAKER_1:  computation is sophisticated.

00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  Again, I would push back on my turn because I still think that humans give themselves.

00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  Ability.

00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:39,550
SPEAKER_0:  to do that by building that tool.

00:37:39,906 --> 00:37:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:37:40,578 --> 00:37:48,158
SPEAKER_0:  The idea that we are getting into the Kardashev scale and the dark forest and all these things.

00:37:48,898 --> 00:37:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  We can see the world this way. Uh, at this point in time for me.

00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,198
SPEAKER_0:  I still see.

00:37:56,706 --> 00:37:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  A great tool.

00:37:59,458 --> 00:38:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  Now.

00:38:00,642 --> 00:38:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  whether the sci-fi scenario is going to, you know.

00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:09,406
SPEAKER_0:  I still think that we are far away from this.

00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  But if that tool is capable of giving me a new perspective.

00:38:13,186 --> 00:38:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  It's just that

00:38:15,074 --> 00:38:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

00:38:15,906 --> 00:38:17,854
SPEAKER_0:  we are starting to jump into a deeper.

00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:22,238
SPEAKER_0:  cognition of what the universe is.

00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:23,326
SPEAKER_0:  whether it's

00:38:23,874 --> 00:38:29,567
SPEAKER_0:  through our brain or through a different way of gathering information, remember, this is what we do.

00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:31,806
SPEAKER_1:  able to actually build tools.

00:38:32,482 --> 00:38:33,918
SPEAKER_1:  and then integrate them.

00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:38,206
SPEAKER_1:  enter their way of thinking. Maybe another generation has to be born.

00:38:38,754 --> 00:38:41,310
SPEAKER_1:  that is raised with those tools, but we seem to like...

00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:46,302
SPEAKER_1:  take for granted all the cool technologies you integrate into your.

00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:47,454
SPEAKER_1:  way of thinking.

00:38:47,746 --> 00:38:49,278
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of people are growing up now.

00:38:49,922 --> 00:38:51,742
SPEAKER_1:  Their mind is integrated with the internet.

00:38:52,642 --> 00:38:54,430
SPEAKER_1:  You basically.

00:38:54,658 --> 00:39:02,046
SPEAKER_1:  reconfigure the way you memorize things. You no longer have to memorize a lot of facts because you can look them up really quickly. And so like

00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:05,598
SPEAKER_1:  So you reallocate a lot of resources for.

00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:08,382
SPEAKER_1:  uh... thinking versus memory of

00:39:09,218 --> 00:39:10,718
SPEAKER_1:  just strict facts.

00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:13,045
SPEAKER_1:  That kind of stuff, and we integrate all of that.

00:39:13,045 --> 00:39:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, and you know.

00:39:14,722 --> 00:39:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  There I would completely agree with you. In fact, I wrote about this again.

00:39:19,842 --> 00:39:21,950
SPEAKER_0:  in this new book that's coming out.

00:39:22,338 --> 00:39:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  When is the book coming out? In January. It's it will be in French actually, uh, to start with. You wrote it in French? Actually, I wrote it first in English. Yes.

00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  and I translated it into French, so the English version is already pretty much ready to go if we find a publisher.

00:39:38,402 --> 00:39:39,102
SPEAKER_0:  in the US.

00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  But anyways, the point being here that I looked at this as

00:39:46,114 --> 00:39:48,126
SPEAKER_0:  our relationship with technology.

00:39:48,866 --> 00:39:50,014
SPEAKER_0:  as a complete

00:39:50,594 --> 00:39:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  change, to me this is the singularity, more than anything else.

00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,350
SPEAKER_0:  which is the coevolution.

00:39:56,802 --> 00:39:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  of human with technology, not anymore with their environment.

00:40:00,194 --> 00:40:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  while we are messing up the environment right now.

00:40:02,786 --> 00:40:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  why we don't respond to pandemic the way we should.

00:40:06,178 --> 00:40:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  because we are disconnected.

00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:11,710
SPEAKER_0:  the environment we are taking our information from and we were adapting from.

00:40:12,098 --> 00:40:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  right now exactly as you said.

00:40:13,826 --> 00:40:15,518
SPEAKER_0:  we take the information from the web.

00:40:15,938 --> 00:40:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  from the phones, etc. You have no filter.

00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  over that information.

00:40:21,282 --> 00:40:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  Before you were out in the environment, the information you get is the one the planet is sending you.

00:40:27,074 --> 00:40:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  Now this information is coming from different ways. You have no way of knowing if information is correct or not. You gotta push back on that. No, you look at this as an ecosystem and it explains a lot of our behavior.

00:40:38,818 --> 00:40:40,670
SPEAKER_1:  See, I like that you said teenagers.

00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:43,806
SPEAKER_1:  So we, the technology, I think.

00:40:44,162 --> 00:40:46,110
SPEAKER_1:  when we move past the teenager stage.

00:40:46,594 --> 00:40:49,310
SPEAKER_1:  enriches our ability to sense the earth.

00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:52,094
SPEAKER_1:  to understand what's going on with the environment.

00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,542
SPEAKER_1:  It's just that we're very, so it's not that technology disconnects us from the environment.

00:40:56,962 --> 00:41:01,837
SPEAKER_1:  It gives us more tools with which to understand what's going on with the environment.

00:41:01,837 --> 00:41:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  true for the people who are building the tools and know how to use it. Take those tools now, put them in the general public with no filter, which is happening with social media, which is happening with a lot of things.

00:41:13,826 --> 00:41:17,237
SPEAKER_0:  And you see the disaster this is creating. And it's not the disaster.

00:41:17,237 --> 00:41:21,502
SPEAKER_1:  There's challenges. You sound like a parent talking about a teenager. Yes.

00:41:21,954 --> 00:41:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  Did you know? It's the growing pains of a civilization that is becoming deeply connected.

00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:31,486
SPEAKER_1:  without we can communicate all across the world.

00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,031
SPEAKER_1:  Even through the pandemic.

00:41:33,031 --> 00:41:41,182
SPEAKER_0:  That's the good thing about technology. This is also something I wrote. It's not the tools we create that are bad. It's the way we use them.

00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  But we are learning.

00:41:43,106 --> 00:41:48,574
SPEAKER_0:  Well, and hopefully we'll do all the learning before it's too late because our response.

00:41:48,802 --> 00:41:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  to what's going on in the environment.

00:41:50,722 --> 00:41:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  Our response to pandemics is deeply connected to this disconnect we have with nature.

00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:59,038
SPEAKER_0:  Anyways, we all agree that...

00:41:59,522 --> 00:42:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  We are.

00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:01,822
SPEAKER_0:  in growing pains?

00:42:02,146 --> 00:42:03,038
SPEAKER_0:  and hopefully...

00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  we can move forward because there is a fantastic universe.

00:42:07,394 --> 00:42:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  something absolutely magical.

00:42:09,474 --> 00:42:12,798
SPEAKER_0:  around us. And I'm talking as a scientist. I mean, there is magic.

00:42:13,122 --> 00:42:15,134
SPEAKER_0:  not in the sense of trickery.

00:42:15,522 --> 00:42:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  but in sense of wonder.

00:42:17,506 --> 00:42:18,526
SPEAKER_0:  around us.

00:42:18,882 --> 00:42:21,214
SPEAKER_0:  and there are so many signs.

00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  We are getting...

00:42:23,362 --> 00:42:24,286
SPEAKER_0:  So close.

00:42:25,186 --> 00:42:25,822
SPEAKER_0:  too.

00:42:26,562 --> 00:42:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  Revolutions.

00:42:27,842 --> 00:42:32,030
SPEAKER_0:  in cosmology, in astrobiology, in astronomy.

00:42:32,546 --> 00:42:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  Which

00:42:33,474 --> 00:42:34,430
SPEAKER_0:  I think to me.

00:42:34,658 --> 00:42:39,646
SPEAKER_0:  This is where the hope lies and also an awakening of understanding that we need to.

00:42:39,906 --> 00:42:43,582
SPEAKER_0:  be in equilibrium with the planet if we want to move forward because

00:42:43,842 --> 00:42:48,446
SPEAKER_0:  Even though we have these big dreams of going on Mars and the Moon and listen, I am a

00:42:48,738 --> 00:42:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  planetary geology.

00:42:50,242 --> 00:42:51,454
SPEAKER_0:  I am all for exploration.

00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:52,798
SPEAKER_0:  Right now.

00:42:53,314 --> 00:42:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  The moon or Mars is not going to save your butt, because for the logistics, we'll still depend very much on the Earth and for a long time.

00:43:00,642 --> 00:43:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

00:43:01,602 --> 00:43:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  This

00:43:03,618 --> 00:43:04,734
SPEAKER_0:  time we are living in.

00:43:05,538 --> 00:43:06,686
SPEAKER_0:  will be remembered.

00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  as

00:43:08,098 --> 00:43:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  A.

00:43:09,666 --> 00:43:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  pivot.

00:43:10,914 --> 00:43:13,566
SPEAKER_0:  in our history for a number of reasons.

00:43:14,018 --> 00:43:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  a time where there is a growing consciousness.

00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:22,270
SPEAKER_0:  where we are creating tools that are going a little bit ahead of us, that we have some.

00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  some difficult time to catch up on with, where we have to deal with a population that's way!

00:43:28,482 --> 00:43:29,886
SPEAKER_0:  too big.

00:43:30,146 --> 00:43:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  for the planet we have.

00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  we need to really learn a sense of balance.

00:43:36,738 --> 00:43:38,590
SPEAKER_0:  and maturity as a civilization.

00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  So how is this going to unfold?

00:43:42,082 --> 00:43:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  Right now I have no clue.

00:43:44,194 --> 00:43:46,654
SPEAKER_1:  I draw a lot of optimism from the...

00:43:46,978 --> 00:43:48,766
SPEAKER_1:  similar things that happened.

00:43:49,602 --> 00:43:50,814
SPEAKER_1:  many decades ago.

00:43:51,522 --> 00:43:53,662
SPEAKER_1:  when nuclear weapons were developed.

00:43:55,394 --> 00:43:58,334
SPEAKER_1:  Boy, it was that at the time even more terrifying.

00:43:58,658 --> 00:44:02,206
SPEAKER_1:  You just now created weapons that could destroy the entirety of life on Earth.

00:44:02,594 --> 00:44:04,062
SPEAKER_1:  or not entirety, but.

00:44:04,418 --> 00:44:05,118
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of it.

00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:07,390
SPEAKER_1:  and we somehow found a balance.

00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:10,558
SPEAKER_1:  and that the threat constantly is out there.

00:44:10,882 --> 00:44:14,462
SPEAKER_1:  and that threat has been made more visceral in recent times.

00:44:15,138 --> 00:44:15,486
SPEAKER_1:  um

00:44:16,162 --> 00:44:17,886
SPEAKER_1:  because of the war in Ukraine.

00:44:18,882 --> 00:44:19,454
SPEAKER_1:  But...

00:44:19,682 --> 00:44:21,150
SPEAKER_1:  we find a balance somehow.

00:44:21,506 --> 00:44:24,286
SPEAKER_1:  So I have a thread of optimism.

00:44:24,546 --> 00:44:29,219
SPEAKER_1:  for human civilization, that we figure it out. We're clever teenagers.

00:44:29,219 --> 00:44:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  I think. We are clever teenagers. There is definitely a thread of optimism.

00:44:33,986 --> 00:44:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  But I think it's thin.

00:44:35,842 --> 00:44:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  It's thin because...

00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  Something that has changed as well.

00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:41,918
SPEAKER_0:  is the mentality.

00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  of humans.

00:44:44,514 --> 00:44:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  Although the threat...

00:44:46,914 --> 00:44:48,062
SPEAKER_0:  was terrifying.

00:44:48,674 --> 00:44:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  when nuclear weapons were created.

00:44:52,802 --> 00:44:53,310
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:44:53,794 --> 00:44:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  There was a sense...

00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  of

00:44:57,666 --> 00:45:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  limits you were willing to push in the threads.

00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:05,022
SPEAKER_0:  There was a sense of.

00:45:05,474 --> 00:45:06,270
SPEAKER_0:  Distancy.

00:45:06,978 --> 00:45:08,574
SPEAKER_0:  of moral values.

00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  It was not perfect.

00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:12,926
SPEAKER_0:  but it was at least a time.

00:45:13,346 --> 00:45:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  where people could come together.

00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  from very different perspectives and agree.

00:45:18,914 --> 00:45:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  that something was more important.

00:45:20,994 --> 00:45:22,718
SPEAKER_0:  than destroying everything.

00:45:22,946 --> 00:45:28,190
SPEAKER_1:  But that's so hilarious you say that. Yes, you're talking about a small slither of humans.

00:45:28,546 --> 00:45:33,246
SPEAKER_1:  which is the scientist in the Manhattan Project, perhaps. No, absolutely not. It's also the time.

00:45:33,794 --> 00:45:37,703
SPEAKER_1:  when over a hundred million people were tortured or murdered.

00:45:37,703 --> 00:45:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  No, no, I agree with that. Absolutely, absolutely. I'm not talking about scientists here.

00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  Actually, I'm talking about politicians.

00:45:45,762 --> 00:45:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  We've gone.

00:45:46,914 --> 00:45:48,222
SPEAKER_0:  beyond that point now.

00:45:48,898 --> 00:45:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  This is what I'm worried about.

00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  torture, et cetera. Unfortunately, well, we are apes.

00:45:55,938 --> 00:46:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  exactly what you said. So I think that there is a lot to be, not to blame grandpa for that, but because we can always get better.

00:46:04,866 --> 00:46:05,991
SPEAKER_0:  Grandpa was a wild man.

00:46:05,991 --> 00:46:06,741
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:46:06,741 --> 00:46:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  Hehehehe

00:46:08,002 --> 00:46:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  But...

00:46:08,994 --> 00:46:13,869
SPEAKER_0:  We have to improve a lot on that side before we can claim that we are a material civilization.

00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:17,406
SPEAKER_1:  When you um just because you mentioned the magic when you look out there

00:46:18,498 --> 00:46:20,414
SPEAKER_1:  Perhaps it's not a scientific question, but...

00:46:21,762 --> 00:46:24,387
SPEAKER_0:  You don't have to be scientific all the time. Yeah. Well, this.

00:46:24,387 --> 00:46:29,566
SPEAKER_1:  You said magic. So there's a magic to magic that is in part scientific and in part.

00:46:30,402 --> 00:46:34,654
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know, whatever fills us with awe as humans when we look up at the stars.

00:46:35,234 --> 00:46:36,222
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think?

00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:39,550
SPEAKER_1:  the universe is full of life or not.

00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:43,678
SPEAKER_1:  You know, when you're sitting drinking some wine, looking up at the stars and-

00:46:44,002 --> 00:46:45,662
SPEAKER_1:  and wandering as a human.

00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:46,622
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:48,638
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think we're alone?

00:46:49,154 --> 00:46:50,302
SPEAKER_1:  Or do you think?

00:46:51,234 --> 00:46:52,359
SPEAKER_1:  It's life is.

00:46:52,359 --> 00:46:57,246
SPEAKER_0:  everywhere. I am going to make such an unmagical response to that.

00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:59,710
SPEAKER_0:  My response is...

00:47:00,194 --> 00:47:02,046
SPEAKER_0:  That's the scientific response.

00:47:02,754 --> 00:47:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  that if we are alone...

00:47:05,218 --> 00:47:08,062
SPEAKER_0:  then the universe is a statistical absurdity.

00:47:09,442 --> 00:47:09,822
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:47:10,402 --> 00:47:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  And I have no doubt.

00:47:12,642 --> 00:47:15,326
SPEAKER_0:  in my mind and that is an unscientific.

00:47:15,554 --> 00:47:16,574
SPEAKER_0:  response as well.

00:47:16,898 --> 00:47:18,814
SPEAKER_0:  but I have no doubt in my mind.

00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  that the universe is teeming with life.

00:47:22,018 --> 00:47:23,006
SPEAKER_0:  What if...

00:47:24,706 --> 00:47:25,694
SPEAKER_1:  keeps dying.

00:47:26,946 --> 00:47:27,902
SPEAKER_0:  This is what life does.

00:47:28,834 --> 00:47:30,709
SPEAKER_0:  Unfortunately.

00:47:30,709 --> 00:47:34,622
SPEAKER_1:  So that extinction.

00:47:34,882 --> 00:47:38,910
SPEAKER_1:  is as a process, as a part of the process of life.

00:47:39,362 --> 00:47:41,502
SPEAKER_1:  Extinction seems to be a fundamental...

00:47:42,018 --> 00:47:43,294
SPEAKER_1:  both negative and positive.

00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:44,414
SPEAKER_1:  component.

00:47:45,122 --> 00:47:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  So what if all the...

00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:49,470
SPEAKER_1:  Complex life out there just keeps dying.

00:47:49,986 --> 00:47:51,486
SPEAKER_1:  and not making way for.

00:47:52,066 --> 00:47:54,814
SPEAKER_1:  Like we're actually a statistical anomaly.

00:47:55,394 --> 00:47:57,854
SPEAKER_1:  in us being able to survive that L.

00:47:58,274 --> 00:48:03,102
SPEAKER_1:  in the Drake equation, being able to survive long enough to form complex organisms.

00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,182
SPEAKER_1:  of the kind that mammals are.

00:48:05,634 --> 00:48:06,759
SPEAKER_1:  Things with brains.

00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  things that are able to cause us harm. L is not about that, L is about how long a civilization is capable of.

00:48:13,954 --> 00:48:18,079
SPEAKER_0:  being detectable, which means that rich technologies and being detectable.

00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:22,942
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so there's a more nuanced things to L because you can have intelligent civilizations that are not very detectable

00:48:23,298 --> 00:48:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, we had civilization.

00:48:25,474 --> 00:48:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  for thousands of years.

00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:30,462
SPEAKER_0:  We started to be detectable 150 years ago.

00:48:31,234 --> 00:48:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  So it's about technology, technology that we can actually.

00:48:36,066 --> 00:48:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  capture from space, you become visible to your neighbors.

00:48:41,058 --> 00:48:44,606
SPEAKER_0:  And this is all about the Fermi paradox, right?

00:48:44,834 --> 00:48:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  It takes time.

00:48:46,146 --> 00:48:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  Obviously, if we're taking again.

00:48:48,386 --> 00:48:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  ourselves as a model, but this is the only one we have.

00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  to get to the point where we become detectable.

00:48:56,322 --> 00:48:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  But...

00:48:57,154 --> 00:48:59,422
SPEAKER_0:  Look at the edge of the universe, even if…

00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  Life as we understand it, not...

00:49:02,658 --> 00:49:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  Not saying even as we know it, but as we can understand it.

00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  started 10 billion years ago.

00:49:08,098 --> 00:49:08,990
SPEAKER_0:  and it takes.

00:49:09,442 --> 00:49:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  4 billion years.

00:49:10,722 --> 00:49:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  to get to the point where it becomes detectable.

00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:18,110
SPEAKER_0:  That means that the first planet where those civilizations started off

00:49:18,434 --> 00:49:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  starting to be detectable when we were still cyanobacteria in ponds. So they were, you know.

00:49:23,746 --> 00:49:24,862
SPEAKER_0:  throwing messages and

00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  that were passing above our heads at that point.

00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:33,022
SPEAKER_0:  And those civilizations, when you look at them now, close to 10 billion years.

00:49:33,442 --> 00:49:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  after the start.

00:49:34,946 --> 00:49:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  So their son would be dead.

00:49:37,826 --> 00:49:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

00:49:38,914 --> 00:49:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  In the best-case scenario, they move somewhere else.

00:49:41,826 --> 00:49:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  And what that means is that civilizations are going.

00:49:45,602 --> 00:49:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  to rise.

00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  die or move?

00:49:49,154 --> 00:49:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  and transform themselves, we can see ourselves changing. We know that humans are still changing as a species.

00:49:56,386 --> 00:50:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  The human being in a thousand or even 500 years from now might not be looking a lot like we are doing right now. Who knows where we will be? We might be migrating into our planetary system. We might be migrating somewhere else.

00:50:11,682 --> 00:50:13,118
SPEAKER_1:  Well, you said migrating, but...

00:50:13,538 --> 00:50:17,662
SPEAKER_1:  It seems when you look at life, it doesn't necessarily migrate. It expands.

00:50:18,274 --> 00:50:18,846
SPEAKER_1:  So it's not.

00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:20,766
SPEAKER_1:  or

00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:24,945
SPEAKER_1:  Place A or Place B is Place A and Place B.

00:50:24,945 --> 00:50:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  It seems to expand. It could be. We are talking about the human civilization here.

00:50:31,106 --> 00:50:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  So they are different.

00:50:32,802 --> 00:50:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  factor, if you are a cyanobacteria or any type of even a mammal.

00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  that doesn't have the technology to escape.

00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  the planet we were born on.

00:50:42,882 --> 00:50:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  then it's plan A, it's right there. You know, whatever happens to your planet, you are tied to it. You cannot escape it.

00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  For humans, it's a little different. It's A and B, or whatever we can.

00:50:57,186 --> 00:50:57,694
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:50:57,922 --> 00:51:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  We have to expect that a number of the civilizations

00:51:03,106 --> 00:51:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  extraterrestrial civilization that might be technologically advanced, a number of them will have disappeared just because they run the course of their.

00:51:11,202 --> 00:51:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  evolution or because their son…

00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  run out of fuel and they didn't have a way to escape.

00:51:19,714 --> 00:51:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  or they were wiped out.

00:51:21,538 --> 00:51:22,110
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:26,334
SPEAKER_0:  any kind of event and then there will be those that survive.

00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:28,958
SPEAKER_1:  everything I've seen from life, it seems.

00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:31,902
SPEAKER_1:  obvious that there's life everywhere out there.

00:51:32,578 --> 00:51:33,278
SPEAKER_1:  In fact,

00:51:33,954 --> 00:51:37,406
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe I don't understand the jump from bacteria enough.

00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:42,654
SPEAKER_1:  but it seems obvious that there's intelligent civilizations out there.

00:51:43,842 --> 00:51:47,198
SPEAKER_1:  Now I don't know how to define intelligence, but there's.

00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  beautiful complexity. Like when you look at a

00:51:50,786 --> 00:51:53,790
SPEAKER_1:  I've looked at enough cellular automata, which is a very

00:51:54,018 --> 00:51:55,486
SPEAKER_1:  primitive mathematical

00:51:56,802 --> 00:51:58,750
SPEAKER_1:  construction that when you run.

00:51:59,106 --> 00:52:00,414
SPEAKER_1:  complexity emerges.

00:52:00,994 --> 00:52:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  I've looked at that enough to know that it just seems like there's complexity everywhere out there so F- F- F- F- F- F- F- F- F- F- F- F- F- F- F- F- F- F- F- F- F- F- F- F- F-

00:52:06,434 --> 00:52:11,006
SPEAKER_1:  That's why I'm deeply puzzled by the Fermi paradox. It makes no sense to me.

00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:12,830
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, uh...

00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:17,694
SPEAKER_1:  that have trivial answers to it. Why haven't aliens at scale not shown up?

00:52:19,874 --> 00:52:22,846
SPEAKER_1:  I think the two possible options for me.

00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:23,678
SPEAKER_1:  is

00:52:24,002 --> 00:52:27,454
SPEAKER_1:  Either we're too dumb to see it, they're already here, they've been talking to us.

00:52:27,746 --> 00:52:29,982
SPEAKER_1:  through processes we just don't understand.

00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:30,590
SPEAKER_1:  Mike.

00:52:31,394 --> 00:52:38,078
SPEAKER_1:  What we experience as life here on earth is actually there everywhere. Aliens could be consciousness.

00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:44,862
SPEAKER_1:  that when we feel love for one another, that could be aliens. When we, I don't know, or feel fear or whatever.

00:52:45,218 --> 00:52:46,343
SPEAKER_1:  That could be aliens.

00:52:46,343 --> 00:52:47,678
SPEAKER_0:  I have to agree with you.

00:52:47,906 --> 00:52:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  None of this is scientifically provable. Right now we talked a little bit already about that.

00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  But I would say that I...

00:52:56,578 --> 00:52:57,182
SPEAKER_0:  Do not.

00:52:57,634 --> 00:52:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  there too the Fermi paradox.

00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  because it's very anthropomorphic. It's an interesting exercise. Let's put it that way.

00:53:07,554 --> 00:53:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  But...

00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  It's a typical example of seeing the universe through our own.

00:53:13,026 --> 00:53:13,566
SPEAKER_0:  ice.

00:53:13,986 --> 00:53:14,686
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:53:15,042 --> 00:53:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  This is where the limitation is.

00:53:18,082 --> 00:53:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  Understanding?

00:53:19,522 --> 00:53:23,422
SPEAKER_0:  what's going on with complexity, as you said, and looking at the biophysical.

00:53:23,714 --> 00:53:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  model.

00:53:24,546 --> 00:53:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  and theories.

00:53:25,666 --> 00:53:26,814
SPEAKER_0:  for the nature of life.

00:53:27,362 --> 00:53:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  I would agree that

00:53:28,578 --> 00:53:29,310
SPEAKER_0:  Probably.

00:53:30,242 --> 00:53:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  This extraterrestrial message is all around us.

00:53:33,762 --> 00:53:35,806
SPEAKER_0:  we're not yet capable of picking it up.

00:53:37,154 --> 00:53:44,766
SPEAKER_1:  But I think unfortunately, even though that makes me sad, the way to pick it up is by studying life here on Earth, doing some of the science you're doing.

00:53:45,154 --> 00:53:48,190
SPEAKER_1:  better understand the nature of life until you realize.

00:53:49,026 --> 00:53:50,526
SPEAKER_1:  uh... holy crap

00:53:51,042 --> 00:53:55,207
SPEAKER_1:  The thing I was looking for all along has been here all along.

00:53:55,207 --> 00:53:59,070
SPEAKER_0:  Well, you know, a good example of that and it doesn't need to be.

00:53:59,362 --> 00:53:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:54:00,386 --> 00:54:02,046
SPEAKER_0:  and extraterrestrial civilization.

00:54:02,626 --> 00:54:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  look at something that I really...

00:54:05,282 --> 00:54:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  you know, whether or not it's...

00:54:06,914 --> 00:54:07,454
SPEAKER_0:  Real?

00:54:07,938 --> 00:54:14,302
SPEAKER_0:  I don't care because in terms of intellectual exercise, I think it's fantastic. Look at the Shadow Biosphere.

00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  The idea.

00:54:16,354 --> 00:54:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  ZERD

00:54:17,314 --> 00:54:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  Life

00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:19,262
SPEAKER_0:  didn't appear.

00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  Only once.

00:54:21,282 --> 00:54:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  on Earth.

00:54:22,594 --> 00:54:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  but there were many different pathways.

00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  of it.

00:54:26,434 --> 00:54:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:54:28,258 --> 00:54:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  Today, we know when we study.

00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:32,510
SPEAKER_0:  The Tree of Life.

00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  That's it.

00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:34,526
SPEAKER_0:  to us.

00:54:35,266 --> 00:54:36,670
SPEAKER_0:  from Luca to us.

00:54:37,698 --> 00:54:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  The shadow biosphere is telling us that there is...

00:54:42,306 --> 00:54:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  Or there are.

00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:44,606
SPEAKER_0:  other pathways.

00:54:45,602 --> 00:54:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  that came.

00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  at the time where life originated.

00:54:49,922 --> 00:54:51,454
SPEAKER_0:  But they are so different.

00:54:52,098 --> 00:54:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  that we cannot recognize them.

00:54:54,498 --> 00:54:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  as being the living.

00:54:56,482 --> 00:55:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  and we cannot pick them up in our tests because our tests are being

00:55:01,954 --> 00:55:02,398
SPEAKER_0:  built.

00:55:02,722 --> 00:55:04,638
SPEAKER_0:  to recognize life as we know it.

00:55:04,994 --> 00:55:05,982
SPEAKER_0:  And for me...

00:55:06,338 --> 00:55:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  Again, I don't know if this theory...

00:55:09,826 --> 00:55:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  will be verified.

00:55:11,234 --> 00:55:11,646
SPEAKER_0:  or

00:55:12,258 --> 00:55:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  it would be...

00:55:13,314 --> 00:55:14,558
SPEAKER_0:  discredited but...

00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:18,398
SPEAKER_0:  What I like about it is that it forces me to think on

00:55:18,626 --> 00:55:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  How do I look for life?

00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know.

00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:55:24,002 --> 00:55:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  that starts here on our planet.

00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  not even with little green men.

00:55:29,122 --> 00:55:32,350
SPEAKER_0:  It starts with very simple light that be...

00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:33,982
SPEAKER_0:  can be so different.

00:55:35,042 --> 00:55:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  that it might be just right in front of our nose, and we don't see it.

00:55:38,594 --> 00:55:42,398
SPEAKER_1:  So that's probably starts with the scientific humility of.

00:55:42,754 --> 00:55:43,326
SPEAKER_1:  Always.

00:55:44,354 --> 00:55:45,374
SPEAKER_1:  realizing that.

00:55:46,178 --> 00:55:50,718
SPEAKER_1:  We might be too biased in understanding of what is the phenomena we're trying to study.

00:55:50,818 --> 00:56:00,990
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I don't like the term bias because it involves some moral connotation. But I understand the bias in terms of scientific pathway, intellectual framework.

00:56:01,218 --> 00:56:01,822
SPEAKER_0:  Definitely.

00:56:01,922 --> 00:56:03,774
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think about the...

00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:06,430
SPEAKER_1:  UFO sightings.

00:56:06,722 --> 00:56:07,870
SPEAKER_1:  the widespread

00:56:08,674 --> 00:56:10,846
SPEAKER_1:  experiences that people have and seeing.

00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:12,510
SPEAKER_1:  different phenomena.

00:56:13,026 --> 00:56:14,078
SPEAKER_1:  that they...

00:56:14,306 --> 00:56:17,342
SPEAKER_1:  sort of that are mysterious that people project.

00:56:17,858 --> 00:56:24,766
SPEAKER_1:  ideas about whether it's aliens or not, but they can't explain it and there's pictures and data and the government is involved and

00:56:25,218 --> 00:56:25,918
SPEAKER_1:  Releasing

00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:29,841
SPEAKER_1:  footage and all that kind of stuff and that it seems to captivate the public.

00:56:29,841 --> 00:56:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  It always does. There are a number of things that...

00:56:35,554 --> 00:56:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  captivate people.

00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  especially children, actually, dinosaurs and aliens. Still a child. Yeah, we are all such a child at heart.

00:56:43,522 --> 00:56:45,214
SPEAKER_0:  So, about UFOs.

00:56:45,794 --> 00:56:47,390
SPEAKER_0:  I am a scientist and I'm a citizen.

00:56:47,682 --> 00:56:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  So I'm going to tell you a couple of things. Thirst, I don't mind talking about that at all, because I think as a scientist, this is extremely interesting.

00:56:56,514 --> 00:56:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  cuz the thing I don't know

00:56:58,562 --> 00:57:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  I want to learn about it. This is more knowledge.

00:57:01,442 --> 00:57:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  So we all know the statistics about UFOs.

00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  95% of them are just natural phenomenon or things that are being misinterpreted. We know that.

00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  Then you have the 2% that might be secret programs by whatever government.

00:57:17,954 --> 00:57:18,974
SPEAKER_0:  It's out there.

00:57:19,778 --> 00:57:23,262
SPEAKER_0:  Another person say is about natural phenomenon.

00:57:23,522 --> 00:57:24,094
SPEAKER_0:  that.

00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  we don't know about yet and we cannot explain. And then there is this tiny percentage.

00:57:29,378 --> 00:57:40,190
SPEAKER_0:  that don't fall into all these categories of things. I think that the report about the UAPs falls into the same kind of scheme except that now they have at least

00:57:40,578 --> 00:57:43,038
SPEAKER_0:  some patterns of speed of...

00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  other things that were in the report.

00:57:46,146 --> 00:57:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  Today we don't know if these sightings are...

00:57:51,042 --> 00:57:54,174
SPEAKER_0:  part of military program or actual.

00:57:54,754 --> 00:57:55,454
SPEAKER_0:  UFOs.

00:57:56,066 --> 00:57:56,478
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:57:56,866 --> 00:58:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  I always run into that question because of course as the director of the Carsteg and Center at the study institute, I received a number of emails about the subject. People actually...

00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  Confused about what the study institute is? We are not studying UFOs.

00:58:11,458 --> 00:58:19,038
SPEAKER_0:  We are studying, we are actually looking for messages. The way I put it, you know, usually is that we are studying.

00:58:19,266 --> 00:58:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  extraterrestrial in their natural habitat. The UFO people are trying to understand whether they invaded our aerial space. Which is two very different things.

00:58:31,426 --> 00:58:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  And unfortunately, over the years...

00:58:34,722 --> 00:58:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  I actually respect very much people who are trying.

00:58:38,626 --> 00:58:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  to go to the bottom of what UFOs are.

00:58:41,954 --> 00:58:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  following some very

00:58:44,994 --> 00:58:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  scientific ways of doing this. They are very-

00:58:47,202 --> 00:58:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  very credible agencies doing this.

00:58:49,986 --> 00:58:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  Unfortunately, there is a folklore.

00:58:52,066 --> 00:58:53,150
SPEAKER_0:  around UFOs.

00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:57,982
SPEAKER_0:  And this has been a huge disservice.

00:58:58,498 --> 00:58:59,742
SPEAKER_0:  to the scientific community.

00:59:00,034 --> 00:59:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  This is why you have been having that much pushback for a long time by the scientific community because

00:59:06,818 --> 00:59:08,574
SPEAKER_0:  No congressman in the world.

00:59:08,994 --> 00:59:15,582
SPEAKER_0:  wants to tell their taxpayer that they are supporting something that's looking for flying saucers and you know

00:59:16,258 --> 00:59:19,742
SPEAKER_0:  When you see what's happening, it's terrifying. And I am actually-

00:59:20,194 --> 00:59:22,142
SPEAKER_0:  concern, you know.

00:59:22,402 --> 00:59:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  about that relationship that people do between.

00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  folklore.

00:59:28,642 --> 00:59:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  and real search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

00:59:32,226 --> 00:59:33,630
SPEAKER_0:  In fact,

00:59:34,082 --> 00:59:35,806
SPEAKER_0:  It's been so bad that...

00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  Until today.

00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  There is no government agency that is actually...

00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  funding.

00:59:43,074 --> 00:59:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  the city search.

00:59:44,386 --> 00:59:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  It is a private funded.

00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:46,526
SPEAKER_0:  Endeavor.

00:59:47,234 --> 00:59:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  What NASA finds right now, which is a progress, is a search for techno-signature, which means that when you are looking, you can see the

00:59:53,954 --> 00:59:55,710
SPEAKER_0:  the atmosphere of the planet.

00:59:56,098 --> 00:59:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  You look for some disequilibrium that could tell you that something is there.

00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:02,014
SPEAKER_0:  but it's not going to fund.

01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  a institute.

01:00:04,738 --> 01:00:09,393
SPEAKER_0:  or whatnot that is looking for messages or other things like that.

01:00:09,393 --> 01:00:12,519
SPEAKER_1:  Does that just have to do with the taboo associated with the folklore?

01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  Yes!

01:00:13,474 --> 01:00:15,006
SPEAKER_0:  And I think there was a pushback.

01:00:15,586 --> 01:00:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  from the political.

01:00:17,154 --> 01:00:18,398
SPEAKER_0:  uh, arena.

01:00:19,426 --> 01:00:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  decades ago.

01:00:20,418 --> 01:00:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  about that at the time where all the flying saucers were coming out.

01:00:23,970 --> 01:00:25,982
SPEAKER_0:  and then the study institute.

01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  God, it's.

01:00:27,202 --> 01:00:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  started.

01:00:27,746 --> 01:00:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:00:28,642 --> 01:00:29,886
SPEAKER_0:  But now...

01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  there is more of a willingness to look at the UAP.

01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  Ah.

01:00:34,178 --> 01:00:34,814
SPEAKER_0:  you whistle.

01:00:35,234 --> 01:00:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  a phenomenon.

01:00:36,994 --> 01:00:39,774
SPEAKER_0:  from a scientific standpoint. So much so.

01:00:40,002 --> 01:00:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  that the government is actually seeking.

01:00:42,754 --> 01:00:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  Some.

01:00:43,522 --> 01:00:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  help from.

01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:45,790
SPEAKER_0:  scientific.

01:00:46,082 --> 01:00:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  institution.

01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  and their programs.

01:00:48,898 --> 01:00:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  to start.

01:00:50,242 --> 01:00:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  looking into those phenomena.

01:00:52,290 --> 01:00:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  And as a scientist...

01:00:54,082 --> 01:00:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  I am interested.

01:00:55,394 --> 01:00:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  what I'm not interested in.

01:00:57,410 --> 01:00:59,038
SPEAKER_0:  Again, Carl Sagan comes back here.

01:00:59,458 --> 01:01:00,670
SPEAKER_0:  I don't want to believe.

01:01:01,218 --> 01:01:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  I want to know.

01:01:02,658 --> 01:01:05,118
SPEAKER_0:  And so to know you have to have.

01:01:05,442 --> 01:01:09,694
SPEAKER_0:  a real experiment, you have to have observation and you have.

01:01:10,018 --> 01:01:12,446
SPEAKER_0:  things that are done the right way.

01:01:12,834 --> 01:01:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  I don't want to have somebody that starts with, what if…

01:01:16,578 --> 01:01:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  as a question and then turns this what if into the only argument and the only conclusion there is. You understand what I'm saying? Cool.

01:01:24,738 --> 01:01:26,174
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's valuable to.

01:01:26,626 --> 01:01:28,222
SPEAKER_1:  appreciate the mystery.

01:01:28,706 --> 01:01:30,581
SPEAKER_1:  and not deny the mystery. So

01:01:30,581 --> 01:01:37,054
SPEAKER_0:  Now the mystery is there, but what I don't want is people taking advantage of the public and making money out of folklore.

01:01:37,218 --> 01:01:39,198
SPEAKER_1:  Well, let me flip that. I understand.

01:01:39,426 --> 01:01:43,902
SPEAKER_1:  But so there's a folklore in like the stuff I do AI and robotics, for example.

01:01:44,354 --> 01:01:47,742
SPEAKER_1:  There's a clear fear, Terminator, and movies, and all those kind of stuff.

01:01:48,354 --> 01:01:51,422
SPEAKER_1:  You could say that I'm very concerned about this.

01:01:51,714 --> 01:01:55,646
SPEAKER_1:  miscalibrated understanding of the public of what robots.

01:01:56,066 --> 01:01:57,438
SPEAKER_1:  role are in society.

01:01:57,794 --> 01:01:58,910
SPEAKER_1:  Or you could see it as a-

01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:02,718
SPEAKER_1:  Let's use a metaphor of a wave. You can say this giant wave.

01:02:03,458 --> 01:02:08,990
SPEAKER_1:  the local folklore is a really bad idea. We need to avoid it. We need to hide. We need to build dams.

01:02:09,218 --> 01:02:12,382
SPEAKER_1:  or you can be a surfer and ride the wave as a scientist.

01:02:12,802 --> 01:02:18,302
SPEAKER_1:  To me, the fact that people are wondering about the mystery of UFOs.

01:02:18,882 --> 01:02:19,902
SPEAKER_1:  It means they're wondering.

01:02:20,258 --> 01:02:22,974
SPEAKER_0:  No, they are. The thing, I will stop.

01:02:23,202 --> 01:02:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  surfing that wave.

01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:27,038
SPEAKER_0:  when it comes back to bite and then tire.

01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:29,438
SPEAKER_0:  Scientific discipline. Science sure.

01:02:29,762 --> 01:02:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  for now the past 60 years.

01:02:32,770 --> 01:02:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  We were not able to raise money from the government, no grants.

01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:42,174
SPEAKER_0:  It's a discipline that has no postdoc, very little postdoc.

01:02:42,882 --> 01:02:43,966
SPEAKER_0:  Just because.

01:02:44,546 --> 01:02:45,598
SPEAKER_0:  There is a fear.

01:02:46,146 --> 01:02:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  of that folklore.

01:02:47,874 --> 01:02:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  on the political arena.

01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:52,990
SPEAKER_0:  People don't want to be associated with that because they confuse the two.

01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  So I stopped.

01:02:55,330 --> 01:02:55,710
SPEAKER_0:  There.

01:02:56,130 --> 01:03:02,558
SPEAKER_0:  And as the director of the Carl Sagan Center, I am just very happy to see now that there is a course correction.

01:03:03,394 --> 01:03:05,182
SPEAKER_0:  in the government seeking

01:03:05,794 --> 01:03:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  scientific.

01:03:07,266 --> 01:03:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  investigators for these kinds of issues and hopefully that we're right.

01:03:11,874 --> 01:03:12,446
SPEAKER_0:  The ship.

01:03:12,834 --> 01:03:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  there.

01:03:13,602 --> 01:03:15,038
SPEAKER_1:  I love it, I'd love to see it, but.

01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:24,350
SPEAKER_1:  I want, and I love our little disagreements. I'm doing so obviously respectfully and with love and it's, it makes it for a fun conversation. But I think.

01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:28,126
SPEAKER_1:  You know, just like with surfing a wave there, there, there's some level of.

01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:30,174
SPEAKER_1:  the more you resist it.

01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:31,454
SPEAKER_1:  the worse it is.

01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:32,382
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:34,430
SPEAKER_0:  I- We didn't resist it.

01:03:34,754 --> 01:03:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  It didn't come from us and we pay the price.

01:03:38,626 --> 01:03:39,614
SPEAKER_0:  I just think.

01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:40,478
SPEAKER_1:  that.

01:03:41,538 --> 01:03:42,590
SPEAKER_1:  The role of us.

01:03:43,074 --> 01:03:43,902
SPEAKER_1:  scientists.

01:03:44,226 --> 01:03:44,894
SPEAKER_1:  in part.

01:03:45,474 --> 01:03:48,030
SPEAKER_1:  in the 21st century when we talk about social media.

01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:52,094
SPEAKER_1:  is to direct this sense of wonder that people have.

01:03:52,706 --> 01:03:55,806
SPEAKER_1:  into a direction of the rigors of science.

01:03:56,066 --> 01:03:57,438
SPEAKER_0:  I think we do that pretty well.

01:03:57,602 --> 01:03:58,782
SPEAKER_1:  I would disagree.

01:03:59,042 --> 01:04:02,910
SPEAKER_1:  I don't think so. Society does much better, but there's other places in science.

01:04:03,234 --> 01:04:12,766
SPEAKER_0:  The search for life is a fairly easy place to draw the wonder of people. Yes. Because it's a profound question that pretty much everybody has.

01:04:13,346 --> 01:04:15,742
SPEAKER_1:  But I think I just want to highlight the fact that.

01:04:16,194 --> 01:04:19,070
SPEAKER_1:  I think a lot of scientists, my colleagues, friends.

01:04:19,874 --> 01:04:21,918
SPEAKER_1:  think that all you need to do is science.

01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:27,966
SPEAKER_1:  All you need to do is the scientific process, the peer review process, the data and so on.

01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:30,974
SPEAKER_1:  But I think communication is actually a fundamental part.

01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:31,966
SPEAKER_1:  of the process.

01:04:32,578 --> 01:04:36,190
SPEAKER_1:  Um, cause it has to do with funding, but also has to do with like work.

01:04:36,418 --> 01:04:37,598
SPEAKER_1:  We're a bunch of humans.

01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:40,734
SPEAKER_1:  trying to ask big questions, trying to figure this whole puzzle out.

01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:43,710
SPEAKER_0:  I totally agree. We do have more.

01:04:44,162 --> 01:04:49,726
SPEAKER_0:  public presentation at the Institute than peer-reviewed articles. And believe me, we have lots.

01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  of peer-reviewed articles. So our scientists are out there and they are sharing the wonder of discoveries.

01:04:55,714 --> 01:05:02,686
SPEAKER_0:  And it's so easy these days. I mean, there is not one day. I'm telling you about writing a book right now about the search for life in the universe.

01:05:03,042 --> 01:05:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's almost every single day I had to correct something.

01:05:07,138 --> 01:05:09,022
SPEAKER_0:  in the chapters I was writing.

01:05:09,282 --> 01:05:10,110
SPEAKER_1:  So said he.

01:05:10,370 --> 01:05:13,790
SPEAKER_1:  in terms of both signatures and signals is a pretty active.

01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:14,590
SPEAKER_1:  feel.

01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  So it's getting better right now. It's getting better.

01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  But remember that the SETI Institute is not only about the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. It's about the historical root of the Institute.

01:05:27,746 --> 01:05:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  But it's about 10% of what we do. In fact, we are searching for life in the universe from the origins of life to extraterrestrial intelligence.

01:05:36,354 --> 01:05:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  So 90% of everything else is exoplanet. For instance, we have a-

01:05:42,274 --> 01:05:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  good chunk of the caper theme that

01:05:44,642 --> 01:05:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  is actually with the study institute and they are working with tests right now. Some already have some time on the jam's web.

01:05:52,706 --> 01:05:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  We have astrobiologists, we have astronomers.

01:05:55,170 --> 01:05:56,222
SPEAKER_1:  and those are looking.

01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:59,390
SPEAKER_1:  for data, for signals.

01:05:59,842 --> 01:06:00,967
SPEAKER_1:  for Planets Out.

01:06:00,967 --> 01:06:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  Go to analog places to try and understand the type of life that survive in...

01:06:07,778 --> 01:06:09,406
SPEAKER_0:  planetary type environments.

01:06:09,794 --> 01:06:12,478
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, people are always surprised when I tell them, you know.

01:06:13,058 --> 01:06:14,110
SPEAKER_0:  Whatever flies.

01:06:14,754 --> 01:06:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  in the source system.

01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  As long as we'll be flying.

01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  We're involved.

01:06:20,834 --> 01:06:27,902
SPEAKER_0:  So this is not something that pops in everybody's mind when they are thinking about the Sutt Institute because we started off.

01:06:28,194 --> 01:06:31,166
SPEAKER_0:  as the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

01:06:31,618 --> 01:06:39,125
SPEAKER_0:  But the Institute has really bloomed into the search for life along the Drake equation, all the terms of the Drake equation.

01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:45,630
SPEAKER_1:  Just to clarify because by the way you're saying a bunch of terms sometimes it's good to return to the basics when you're saying

01:06:46,018 --> 01:06:47,166
SPEAKER_1:  Whatever's flown.

01:06:48,578 --> 01:06:49,342
SPEAKER_1:  SETI.

01:06:49,698 --> 01:06:50,302
SPEAKER_1:  is a part.

01:06:50,562 --> 01:06:51,710
SPEAKER_1:  of the things that have flown.

01:06:52,034 --> 01:07:00,766
SPEAKER_1:  So we, because we're using we elucid sometimes, we say we humans and sometimes we saidy. So the saidy is really broadly involved. A lot of.

01:07:01,186 --> 01:07:03,061
SPEAKER_1:  the fingertips reaching out.

01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:11,326
SPEAKER_0:  towards the stars.

01:07:11,618 --> 01:07:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  Eh.

01:07:12,418 --> 01:07:14,686
SPEAKER_0:  Cassini, New Horizon.

01:07:15,234 --> 01:07:17,406
SPEAKER_0:  also missions that will be coming.

01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  It's.

01:07:18,786 --> 01:07:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  The search for life, we do this all across the Drake equation. So, a city is part of it.

01:07:24,770 --> 01:07:27,198
SPEAKER_0:  and it's a root and it's

01:07:27,874 --> 01:07:34,558
SPEAKER_0:  expanding a little bit right now. We hope it will continue to expand. So this is a good time for the Institute.

01:07:34,882 --> 01:07:35,998
SPEAKER_0:  And you also...

01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:43,134
SPEAKER_0:  In my mind, it was the very first astrobiology institute because we have this multidisciplinary approach.

01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  where I can bring

01:07:45,154 --> 01:07:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  many of the scientists from different

01:07:47,426 --> 01:07:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  domains and disciplines to think about a question and as you know

01:07:51,522 --> 01:07:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  Discoveries happen at the Nexus.

01:07:53,954 --> 01:07:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  of disciplines and it's really a privilege when you are in an institute like that.

01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:00,734
SPEAKER_1:  You've dived.

01:08:01,186 --> 01:08:07,198
SPEAKER_1:  in volcanic lakes at high altitudes to study the creatures within. Can you tell me the technical?

01:08:07,714 --> 01:08:10,174
SPEAKER_1:  the fun, the human story of that effort.

01:08:10,434 --> 01:08:15,998
SPEAKER_0:  The image that is associated with the scientist is the person with the white coat in the lab.

01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:18,462
SPEAKER_0:  In fact,

01:08:18,914 --> 01:08:22,974
SPEAKER_0:  A number of us at the Institute are athletes doing extreme sports.

01:08:23,426 --> 01:08:25,278
SPEAKER_0:  what would be considered extreme stuff.

01:08:25,826 --> 01:08:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  and not

01:08:27,682 --> 01:08:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's fun.

01:08:28,738 --> 01:08:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  It's a little dangerous too, but it's to get data and more knowledge.

01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:36,035
SPEAKER_0:  So there are so many stories. I don't even know.

01:08:36,035 --> 01:08:38,718
SPEAKER_1:  When was the first time you did a dangerous thing with a volcano?

01:08:40,258 --> 01:08:42,078
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, so the first...

01:08:42,466 --> 01:08:43,806
SPEAKER_0:  one associated.

01:08:44,034 --> 01:08:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  to the search for life.

01:08:46,722 --> 01:08:47,998
SPEAKER_0:  understanding was in

01:08:48,450 --> 01:08:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  2002, where I started climbing those high volcanoes in the Andes that are 20,000 footers.

01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:57,365
SPEAKER_0:  The view out there is just beautiful.

01:08:57,365 --> 01:08:57,950
SPEAKER_1:  You got...

01:08:59,554 --> 01:09:05,822
SPEAKER_1:  You're so hilarious at spending almost no time on some epic things. I love this. You're so hilarious at spending almost no time on some epic things.

01:09:06,338 --> 01:09:16,318
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, how tall are these volcanoes? What are you doing with a volcano? What's required to prepare for that? What does a mission like that look like? I mean, that is true.

01:09:16,674 --> 01:09:17,694
SPEAKER_1:  that this is.

01:09:17,922 --> 01:09:25,278
SPEAKER_1:  science embodied, it's like athletics and science and you're studying the extreme conditions of life on earth, extreme beauty.

01:09:25,666 --> 01:09:31,230
SPEAKER_1:  of life on earth in those conditions. So what, what, what was, what was, what are we talking about with this volcano?

01:09:31,682 --> 01:09:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  So remember when we were talking about.

01:09:34,594 --> 01:09:44,478
SPEAKER_0:  How do I understand how I should throw life on Mars? This is how it started for me. And then I looked at the environment, in my head started going through the environment on Earth.

01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  that would be good analysis.

01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:50,526
SPEAKER_0:  and then you only have a few. And the end is in that case are

01:09:50,882 --> 01:09:52,414
SPEAKER_0:  some of the best in the world.

01:09:52,738 --> 01:09:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  just because of the aridity of the place.

01:09:56,066 --> 01:09:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  in.

01:09:57,058 --> 01:09:58,110
SPEAKER_0:  the higher you go.

01:09:59,106 --> 01:10:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  The least atmosphere you have, the more UV radiation you have.

01:10:04,162 --> 01:10:10,526
SPEAKER_0:  And the Andes are volcanic, hydrothermal, plus you have the climate change that's coming, you have evaporation.

01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  It's a picture of Mars.

01:10:13,026 --> 01:10:14,334
SPEAKER_0:  3.5 billion years ago.

01:10:14,818 --> 01:10:15,518
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

01:10:15,842 --> 01:10:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  Now you are.

01:10:17,474 --> 01:10:19,070
SPEAKER_0:  actually entering a time machine.

01:10:19,746 --> 01:10:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  Basically.

01:10:21,282 --> 01:10:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  So...

01:10:22,178 --> 01:10:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  Remember, I'm a diver.

01:10:24,866 --> 01:10:31,870
SPEAKER_0:  And the first time I got in 2002 to the places we wanted to explore.

01:10:32,642 --> 01:10:34,654
SPEAKER_0:  All sudden I was standing.

01:10:34,978 --> 01:10:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  at 14,000 feet, looking at 20,000 feet.

01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  and saying.

01:10:39,298 --> 01:10:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

01:10:40,898 --> 01:10:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I need to get up there.

01:10:42,882 --> 01:10:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  Are you scared? No!

01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  No, because we are prepared.

01:10:47,490 --> 01:11:00,702
SPEAKER_0:  And the only thing I didn't know is if I was going to be able to make it to the top, because now you're dealing with high altitude, you can deal with high altitude sickness, you can deal with a number of things, and for God's sake, these are volcanoes and they are dormant, they are not extinct.

01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:02,206
SPEAKER_0:  That can buy.

01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:04,455
SPEAKER_0:  to buy toast a couple of times.

01:11:04,455 --> 01:11:05,598
SPEAKER_1:  your preparation.

01:11:05,922 --> 01:11:07,047
SPEAKER_1:  for that kind of, I mean this.

01:11:07,047 --> 01:11:18,462
SPEAKER_0:  There is a lot of hiking and trekking at altitude around here, but not so high because we don't have anything closer to those elevations around here in the US.

01:11:18,978 --> 01:11:23,902
SPEAKER_0:  But in volcanic environment, climbing volcanoes here, we have plenty of those.

01:11:24,258 --> 01:11:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  Diving as well. I am a free diver. So this is where it's going to be hilarious.

01:11:29,058 --> 01:11:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  because...

01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  I started with a completely rational fear of pressurized vessels.

01:11:36,034 --> 01:11:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  comes from an incident in my childhood.

01:11:38,786 --> 01:11:42,910
SPEAKER_0:  And so I became a free diver to avoid having to carry oxygen.

01:11:43,202 --> 01:11:44,222
SPEAKER_0:  tags on my back.

01:11:44,482 --> 01:11:46,357
SPEAKER_1:  freediving is diving with

01:11:46,357 --> 01:11:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  without anything, just your lungs, right?

01:11:49,122 --> 01:11:50,997
SPEAKER_1:  That was that started from childhood.

01:11:50,997 --> 01:11:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, no, it was to the point where when I saw it, I was like, oh, I'm going to do it.

01:11:54,242 --> 01:11:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  I saw a pressure vessel like him.

01:11:57,090 --> 01:11:58,974
SPEAKER_0:  metten tanks or anything, I would be...

01:11:59,842 --> 01:12:01,342
SPEAKER_0:  going around and

01:12:01,954 --> 01:12:07,678
SPEAKER_0:  puts a lot of distance between me and that tank. So I was not going to carry any oxygen tank.

01:12:08,034 --> 01:12:10,846
SPEAKER_0:  And the first time I actually...

01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:14,046
SPEAKER_0:  Dive at the summit of that lake was free diving.

01:12:14,626 --> 01:12:18,001
SPEAKER_0:  People look at me like I'm nuts. Well, maybe I am a little bit.

01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:21,751
SPEAKER_1:  people that work with you as well. I mean, that kind of seems kind of nuts.

01:12:21,751 --> 01:12:24,094
SPEAKER_0:  No, uh, we knew with- It's a risk.

01:12:24,546 --> 01:12:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  Actually, it's a lot of.

01:12:25,730 --> 01:12:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  less of a risk.

01:12:26,978 --> 01:12:32,030
SPEAKER_0:  than getting with conventional air. And I can explain that.

01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  But ultimately what decided me to certify Scuba.

01:12:37,346 --> 01:12:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  and go over.

01:12:38,530 --> 01:12:39,518
SPEAKER_0:  my fear.

01:12:39,874 --> 01:12:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  was that as a scientist I needed more time at the bottom.

01:12:43,074 --> 01:12:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  of the lake to sample.

01:12:45,826 --> 01:12:46,910
SPEAKER_0:  you know, rationally.

01:12:47,202 --> 01:12:48,382
SPEAKER_0:  Take my time to think.

01:12:48,962 --> 01:12:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:12:50,402 --> 01:12:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  I can stay.

01:12:52,418 --> 01:12:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  quite long enough.

01:12:53,986 --> 01:12:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  as a freediver underwater.

01:12:56,290 --> 01:13:02,014
SPEAKER_0:  But the last thing you want to do at 20,000 feet is to come up at the surface with empty lungs.

01:13:02,306 --> 01:13:06,558
SPEAKER_0:  because there is not much you can breathe out there to replenish your oxygen.

01:13:07,074 --> 01:13:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:13:08,002 --> 01:13:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  Definitely your time and the water is cut short.

01:13:11,362 --> 01:13:20,094
SPEAKER_0:  just for safety and I realized that it was not a good trade off for me at some point. So I certified Scuba and after...

01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  three years of exploring that lake freediving.

01:13:24,418 --> 01:13:27,678
SPEAKER_0:  we finally came up with a full scuba diving expedition.

01:13:27,938 --> 01:13:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  but we were diving with rebreather, which means that we dived with...

01:13:33,922 --> 01:13:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  pure oxygen.

01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:36,478
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:13:37,122 --> 01:13:39,102
SPEAKER_0:  Rebrievers, give you a bag.

01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  with.

01:13:41,282 --> 01:13:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  Stuff that looks like...

01:13:42,850 --> 01:13:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  cat liters in it, which is basically to absorb the CO2.

01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:50,078
SPEAKER_0:  uh, that you are expelling when you're breathing.

01:13:50,530 --> 01:13:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  and they're resaking oxygen this way.

01:13:53,506 --> 01:13:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  So basically you are re-breathing.

01:13:55,778 --> 01:13:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  your own.

01:13:57,250 --> 01:13:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  respiration.

01:13:59,042 --> 01:14:02,417
SPEAKER_1:  How long can you do that? So what's interesting about that technology?

01:14:02,417 --> 01:14:06,398
SPEAKER_0:  So it is very interesting because then that...

01:14:06,658 --> 01:14:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  completely avoids.

01:14:08,418 --> 01:14:09,630
SPEAKER_0:  The potential.

01:14:10,018 --> 01:14:11,582
SPEAKER_0:  issues you may have with

01:14:11,810 --> 01:14:12,478
SPEAKER_0:  the binds.

01:14:12,706 --> 01:14:15,390
SPEAKER_0:  when you are diving, the risk of bubbles.

01:14:15,682 --> 01:14:17,118
SPEAKER_0:  trapped in your lungs.

01:14:17,538 --> 01:14:20,702
SPEAKER_0:  because of different pressures and different gases.

01:14:21,154 --> 01:14:23,998
SPEAKER_1:  So there's a complexity to the flow of oxygen.

01:14:25,026 --> 01:14:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  underwater. When you are breathing regular air, when you are scuba diving here.

01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:35,422
SPEAKER_0:  You know that you have to do some different, when you're coming back, when you're diving deep.

01:14:35,682 --> 01:14:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  and you have conventional air, then you need to stop.

01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:41,822
SPEAKER_0:  so that you can equalize.

01:14:42,306 --> 01:14:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  the gases in your lungs. If you come back

01:14:45,666 --> 01:14:46,750
SPEAKER_0:  too fast.

01:14:47,106 --> 01:14:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  then you can have air bubbles.

01:14:49,794 --> 01:14:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  Stuck.

01:14:50,722 --> 01:14:56,382
SPEAKER_0:  And then you can risk the vines, which you can risk to be paralyzed. You can risk a number of nasty issues.

01:14:56,642 --> 01:14:58,974
SPEAKER_0:  And we wanted absolutely to avoid that. So

01:14:59,202 --> 01:15:00,638
SPEAKER_0:  diving with pure oxygen.

01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  Avoid this completely.

01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  and it has another.

01:15:06,498 --> 01:15:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  benefit.

01:15:07,714 --> 01:15:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  at high altitude is that

01:15:09,954 --> 01:15:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  Well.

01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:13,758
SPEAKER_0:  The greater risk when you're at high altitude.

01:15:14,114 --> 01:15:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  is altitude sickness. What is altitude sickness is just you not having enough oxygen in your blood.

01:15:20,482 --> 01:15:20,926
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:15:21,186 --> 01:15:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  This was a good benefit, it was a good trade-off.

01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  We were lucky enough to be also trained by the military.

01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  So we came up with.

01:15:30,754 --> 01:15:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  not the civilian rebreather, which is the big thing on the back.

01:15:35,458 --> 01:15:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  that you carry on your back, we actually...

01:15:37,794 --> 01:15:39,166
SPEAKER_0:  we're given.

01:15:39,682 --> 01:15:42,279
SPEAKER_0:  Navy SEALs, commando, rebreather.

01:15:42,279 --> 01:15:43,029
SPEAKER_1:  Navy SEALs.

01:15:43,029 --> 01:15:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  This is the director of military operations. Yes, we were trained like astronauts.

01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  three months.

01:15:51,778 --> 01:16:00,574
SPEAKER_0:  I spent more time, I had a joke that if somebody wanted to reach me, they better put a phone line at the bottom of the swimming pool because this is where I was.

01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:04,286
SPEAKER_0:  So we train and we train and our manual about the safety.

01:16:04,674 --> 01:16:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  was about that thick.

01:16:06,946 --> 01:16:09,374
SPEAKER_0:  So it was a real operation.

01:16:10,178 --> 01:16:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  That was three years into it because when you are freediving in the years prior.

01:16:14,946 --> 01:16:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  There is no risk. You don't have any other gas in your lung than what you are breathing. The only risk is come short.

01:16:21,954 --> 01:16:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  of air and then you're in trouble, which happened to me one time, seriously.

01:16:26,882 --> 01:16:28,007
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:16:28,007 --> 01:16:31,757
SPEAKER_1:  that time I gotta ask you about freediving before we return to the rebreat

01:16:31,757 --> 01:16:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  Well, all these legs, I had altitude, they are cold. They are at the minimum temperature that you can have on bodies of water, clear bodies of water, which is for degree C.

01:16:42,082 --> 01:16:43,422
SPEAKER_0:  it's very very cold.

01:16:43,906 --> 01:16:46,334
SPEAKER_0:  And so you can now. Nice bath.

01:16:46,786 --> 01:16:49,726
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, so you cannot...

01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:50,558
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:16:51,586 --> 01:16:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  just dive with a wetsuit.

01:16:55,138 --> 01:17:00,030
SPEAKER_0:  So the idea was to take a dry suit.

01:17:00,386 --> 01:17:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  and I learned.

01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:02,942
SPEAKER_0:  how to freedive with it.

01:17:03,298 --> 01:17:06,673
SPEAKER_0:  dry suit, which is really the worst thing you can do.

01:17:06,673 --> 01:17:07,423
SPEAKER_1:  to what it was.

01:17:07,423 --> 01:17:17,438
SPEAKER_0:  a dry suit. So a dry suit, a wet suit is usually what you use in the ocean when it's not too cold. You can use also a dry suit, but the wet suit basically is going to keep you warm.

01:17:17,826 --> 01:17:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  because water is getting into the suit.

01:17:20,674 --> 01:17:22,270
SPEAKER_0:  and at the contact of your skin.

01:17:22,786 --> 01:17:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  is getting to body temperature.

01:17:25,218 --> 01:17:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  And so for a while you can...

01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:28,414
SPEAKER_0:  You know, dive like that.

01:17:28,674 --> 01:17:30,622
SPEAKER_0:  and in the ocean here.

01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  That's fine.

01:17:31,714 --> 01:17:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  That's fine.

01:17:33,346 --> 01:17:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  The drysuit is the opposite. It's completely closed, which means that

01:17:38,978 --> 01:17:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  You don't have any contact with the water outside.

01:17:41,922 --> 01:17:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  and you keep your warmth.

01:17:43,586 --> 01:17:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  through.

01:17:44,418 --> 01:17:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  your body temperature and even clothing that you can put into it. So these dry suits, they are used by dither, go really deep.

01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:58,622
SPEAKER_0:  in very cold water and need to stay a long time underwater. So what's the bad part?

01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  The bad part is that

01:18:02,434 --> 01:18:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  when you have those dry suit

01:18:06,434 --> 01:18:07,102
SPEAKER_0:  You.

01:18:07,682 --> 01:18:09,502
SPEAKER_0:  have a lot of air that can be trapped.

01:18:10,050 --> 01:18:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  in it.

01:18:10,882 --> 01:18:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  Usually we do what we call burping the suit. It's not a very pleasant expression, but...

01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  You get in the water and as soon as you get in the water, you can see the air pockets all over the place. Right? So you burp the suit, you open the valve and the air comes out.

01:18:25,986 --> 01:18:29,886
SPEAKER_0:  Once you have done that, then you look with your lead belt.

01:18:30,274 --> 01:18:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  and you know when you're ready to go down.

01:18:32,994 --> 01:18:34,462
SPEAKER_0:  And so what happened that day?

01:18:35,106 --> 01:18:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  is that I actually did burp the suit.

01:18:37,762 --> 01:18:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  but didn't realize I burped it.

01:18:39,746 --> 01:18:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  completely.

01:18:40,866 --> 01:18:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  And so...

01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  I went.

01:18:42,978 --> 01:18:43,518
SPEAKER_0:  down.

01:18:44,418 --> 01:18:48,926
SPEAKER_0:  And immediately I felt an air pocket going to my legs.

01:18:49,474 --> 01:18:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  So basically, air was trapped in the suit and went.

01:18:53,506 --> 01:18:54,270
SPEAKER_0:  on my legs.

01:18:54,562 --> 01:18:55,678
SPEAKER_0:  as I was diving like that.

01:18:56,322 --> 01:18:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  And so I didn't pay too much attention to that. Because you're diving down.

01:19:00,322 --> 01:19:01,086
SPEAKER_0:  I was diving down.

01:19:01,602 --> 01:19:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  and so didn't pay too much attention.

01:19:04,066 --> 01:19:09,278
SPEAKER_0:  But that, as I was busy, just an awkward position.

01:19:09,794 --> 01:19:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:19:10,658 --> 01:19:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  Then I wanted to...

01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  turn in the go up.

01:19:14,402 --> 01:19:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  Well, no can do.

01:19:15,906 --> 01:19:17,310
SPEAKER_0:  I was just like a buoy.

01:19:19,170 --> 01:19:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  And I was like that.

01:19:21,378 --> 01:19:23,102
SPEAKER_0:  The first time I say, okay.

01:19:23,362 --> 01:19:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  I tried a second time and a third time. By the fourth time, I kind of realized I was in trouble.

01:19:29,314 --> 01:19:35,838
SPEAKER_0:  And the fifth time I say, OK, now you better give it your best try, otherwise it's going to be big trouble.

01:19:36,450 --> 01:19:37,575
SPEAKER_0:  Um,

01:19:37,575 --> 01:19:41,822
SPEAKER_1:  This is free diving. I was free diving. And then you can't.

01:19:42,082 --> 01:19:44,707
SPEAKER_1:  And I cannot turn around. What were you feeling? Yummy is there a pan-

01:19:44,707 --> 01:19:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  No

01:19:45,794 --> 01:19:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  There is no panic because you can't, you cannot afford.

01:19:49,122 --> 01:19:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  be panicking. In fact, you are always thinking because there is training and this is the best part about training.

01:19:54,562 --> 01:19:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  Your training allows you that space.

01:19:57,122 --> 01:19:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  to keep you cool.

01:19:58,658 --> 01:20:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  and compose which you need to be in that kind of situation.

01:20:02,370 --> 01:20:03,262
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

01:20:03,682 --> 01:20:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  Finally, after the fifth time.

01:20:05,954 --> 01:20:08,990
SPEAKER_0:  I was able to rectify the position and get myself up.

01:20:09,730 --> 01:20:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  But when I get up...

01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  My lungs were empty. I had been in the water for quite some time.

01:20:16,418 --> 01:20:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:20:17,410 --> 01:20:17,950
SPEAKER_0:  I have co-

01:20:18,466 --> 01:20:27,646
SPEAKER_0:  I knew what was going to happen, so I decided to just be the plank, not move and don't do anything, just open my mouth and try to suck oxygen.

01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  But obviously oxygen.

01:20:29,538 --> 01:20:31,902
SPEAKER_0:  at 6,000 meters, 20,000 feet.

01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:33,470
SPEAKER_0:  There is not that much.

01:20:33,730 --> 01:20:35,454
SPEAKER_0:  It's about a little, it's a...

01:20:35,938 --> 01:20:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  48% of what you breathe at sea level.

01:20:39,426 --> 01:20:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  So, although it was...

01:20:41,634 --> 01:20:42,078
SPEAKER_0:  Noon.

01:20:42,818 --> 01:20:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  at that time.

01:20:44,322 --> 01:20:47,774
SPEAKER_0:  The sky is that pretty dark and starry.

01:20:48,674 --> 01:20:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  Such stars everywhere. Oh my god, yes.

01:20:51,394 --> 01:20:52,382
SPEAKER_0: ttationalty

01:20:52,898 --> 01:20:54,773
SPEAKER_0:  The funny thing was...

01:20:54,773 --> 01:20:57,726
SPEAKER_1:  And that's the first time you experienced that kind of uh

01:20:58,370 --> 01:21:00,894
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, can you possibly train for that? Like-

01:21:01,282 --> 01:21:02,814
SPEAKER_1:  Can you also pass out?

01:21:03,010 --> 01:21:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, you could. I mean, the fact that I was already seeing dark was a real sign that my brain was starved of oxygen.

01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  And I had one of my friends or colleagues on the shore.

01:21:17,058 --> 01:21:20,062
SPEAKER_0:  just telling me because I'd been under for a real while and say...

01:21:20,418 --> 01:21:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  Is everything okay? I remember trying to say something.

01:21:24,898 --> 01:21:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  And I was just like...

01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:32,255
SPEAKER_0:  That's I think the best lie I ever ever.

01:21:32,255 --> 01:21:34,718
SPEAKER_1:  You're lying to the friend and maybe to yourself

01:21:34,914 --> 01:21:41,150
SPEAKER_0:  No, because I knew I was going to be okay, but it took me to be still for a few minutes.

01:21:41,922 --> 01:21:47,934
SPEAKER_1:  Well, can you talk about free diving? I mean, what's the technical skill involved here? It just seems...

01:21:49,282 --> 01:21:52,862
SPEAKER_1:  It seems exceptionally difficult. Like for most people that swim, you go under water.

01:21:53,314 --> 01:21:56,286
SPEAKER_1:  It's hard. So what's the skill there?

01:21:56,482 --> 01:21:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I think...

01:21:58,274 --> 01:22:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  You probably can get good or better at freediving.

01:22:01,634 --> 01:22:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  by training. So you have different techniques. You can train in swimming pool and you can say, you know.

01:22:08,226 --> 01:22:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  Frankly, for me, I go at the bottom of the swimming pool and I sit.

01:22:12,578 --> 01:22:13,022
SPEAKER_0:  there.

01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:15,454
SPEAKER_0:  and then you have relaxation.

01:22:15,746 --> 01:22:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  techniques.

01:22:17,442 --> 01:22:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  Some people meditate, I can't. I am not a good person that can meditate, or if I do, I don't know about it.

01:22:23,842 --> 01:22:24,702
SPEAKER_0:  But, um...

01:22:25,442 --> 01:22:29,918
SPEAKER_0:  My way of doing things and taking my mind off the situation I'm in.

01:22:30,402 --> 01:22:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  is by singing my head.

01:22:33,154 --> 01:22:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  I love music or hearing music. And in fact, knowing the kind of song I'm singing, I know about the length of time.

01:22:40,066 --> 01:22:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  that I'm staying on the water as well. So this is my own way. People have different ways. What kind of music are we talking about?

01:22:47,874 --> 01:22:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  All sorts of music can be classical, can be pop music, you know, just songs.

01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:53,982
SPEAKER_0:  when you really know.

01:22:54,466 --> 01:22:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  that you are a

01:22:56,098 --> 01:22:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  Relax.

01:22:57,570 --> 01:22:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  and something I experienced actually at

01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  20,000 feet, which was the

01:23:02,146 --> 01:23:05,758
SPEAKER_0:  greatest experience of my life in those terms.

01:23:06,018 --> 01:23:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  is when you forget.

01:23:07,490 --> 01:23:08,830
SPEAKER_0:  that you have water around you.

01:23:09,314 --> 01:23:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  At that point...

01:23:10,722 --> 01:23:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  You cannot tell whether you are the water or whether it is you. There is actually no separation anymore.

01:23:17,282 --> 01:23:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  And I felt that.

01:23:18,978 --> 01:23:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  when I was training.

01:23:20,642 --> 01:23:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  In a swimming pool, I never...

01:23:22,786 --> 01:23:24,158
SPEAKER_0:  could have imagined that I would.

01:23:24,898 --> 01:23:25,278
SPEAKER_0:  feel.

01:23:25,794 --> 01:23:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  that way once on top of that volcano, and it happened.

01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  And it was absolutely amazing. It was.

01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we were talking about.

01:23:34,146 --> 01:23:35,870
SPEAKER_0:  How life consciousness.

01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  permits the universe.

01:23:38,338 --> 01:23:41,822
SPEAKER_0:  at that point in time, on that volcano, that day.

01:23:42,946 --> 01:23:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  It took me by surprise. I was not expecting it.

01:23:46,434 --> 01:23:48,702
SPEAKER_0:  Everything around me, the lake was...

01:23:49,346 --> 01:23:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  Arctic blue?

01:23:50,914 --> 01:23:53,182
SPEAKER_0:  with all the ray of the suns you can...

01:23:54,338 --> 01:23:59,486
SPEAKER_0:  You could tell them apart, every single one of them. I was surrounded by golden darts.

01:24:00,354 --> 01:24:04,830
SPEAKER_0:  And it was the most incredible experience and I don't know if it's that kind.

01:24:05,314 --> 01:24:05,886
SPEAKER_0:  of

01:24:06,114 --> 01:24:08,766
SPEAKER_0:  environment that led me to just...

01:24:09,058 --> 01:24:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  you know, going to...

01:24:10,818 --> 01:24:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  whatever state of meditation or whatnot.

01:24:14,018 --> 01:24:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  But all of a sudden...

01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  There was no separation anymore between me, the water, the volcano.

01:24:20,418 --> 01:24:22,206
SPEAKER_0:  And if I came with questions...

01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  They didn't matter anymore because for that fraction of a second, it seemed that I had all the answers of the—

01:24:28,386 --> 01:24:29,511
SPEAKER_0:  in the universe.

01:24:29,511 --> 01:24:31,422
SPEAKER_1:  the connectedness with everything.

01:24:31,746 --> 01:24:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  You can call it that way. I still don't know what it means, you know, literally.

01:24:36,578 --> 01:24:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  But it is.

01:24:37,698 --> 01:24:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  that moment where you feel that

01:24:40,226 --> 01:24:41,438
SPEAKER_0:  It doesn't matter.

01:24:41,794 --> 01:24:43,614
SPEAKER_0:  It really doesn't matter anymore.

01:24:43,970 --> 01:24:44,606
SPEAKER_0:  It was a-

01:24:45,026 --> 01:24:48,702
SPEAKER_0:  Absolutely, absolute peace, absolute understanding.

01:24:49,154 --> 01:24:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  And it was incredible. It was an absolute awareness.

01:24:54,498 --> 01:24:55,966
SPEAKER_0:  Could you describe it as beautiful?

01:24:56,962 --> 01:25:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  That wouldn't go beyond that. I think that there is clearly in my mind...

01:25:01,122 --> 01:25:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  Mine today.

01:25:02,818 --> 01:25:06,270
SPEAKER_0:  No words that can express how perfect.

01:25:06,754 --> 01:25:07,422
SPEAKER_0:  This was.

01:25:07,714 --> 01:25:10,206
SPEAKER_1:  Does that start to speak to why you love diving?

01:25:10,626 --> 01:25:13,150
SPEAKER_1:  Or is there something special about that place?

01:25:13,826 --> 01:25:15,701
SPEAKER_1:  diving at such elevations.

01:25:15,701 --> 01:25:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  volcanoes. You know, I started diving pretty much, this is the first thing I did when I was near water. In fact, there is a very fun little...

01:25:23,778 --> 01:25:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  incident with my parents, me being a

01:25:26,594 --> 01:25:28,958
SPEAKER_0:  on the shore of the lake on vacation I was.

01:25:29,922 --> 01:25:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  three years old, maybe.

01:25:31,746 --> 01:25:33,950
SPEAKER_0:  and I had these little lifesavers.

01:25:34,210 --> 01:25:37,310
SPEAKER_0:  you know, on my arms and my parents were not

01:25:37,538 --> 01:25:40,894
SPEAKER_0:  watching and in my little brain I still can remember today.

01:25:41,410 --> 01:25:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  saying.

01:25:42,178 --> 01:25:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  Well...

01:25:43,842 --> 01:25:47,422
SPEAKER_0:  Nothing bad can happen to me. I cannot drown if I go underwater.

01:25:47,906 --> 01:25:50,366
SPEAKER_0:  See, that's the logic of a three year old. Yes. Yeah.

01:25:50,690 --> 01:25:51,870
SPEAKER_1:  It kind of works. I mean, that's.

01:25:52,130 --> 01:25:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, well, you know.

01:25:53,826 --> 01:25:54,622
SPEAKER_0:  So I removed.

01:25:55,714 --> 01:25:57,374
SPEAKER_0:  the lifesavers that I had.

01:25:57,762 --> 01:26:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  And I just went in the water. And my mom said before, she could do anything.

01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:02,814
SPEAKER_0:  I was under.

01:26:03,202 --> 01:26:07,614
SPEAKER_0:  And it was like a natural thing. And for me, I felt immediately at home.

01:26:08,194 --> 01:26:10,878
SPEAKER_0:  and you know, as little as I was.

01:26:11,170 --> 01:26:13,662
SPEAKER_0:  completely and it goes beyond that.

01:26:14,146 --> 01:26:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  You know, this sense of connectiveness or oneness or whatever.

01:26:17,954 --> 01:26:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  I always felt.

01:26:20,194 --> 01:26:29,854
SPEAKER_0:  good underwater. So it doesn't matter really if it's 20,000 feet. The thing that matters at that point is that you need to get there.

01:26:30,210 --> 01:26:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  So you need to get with all the gears with your...

01:26:34,306 --> 01:26:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  hiking trekking equipment.

01:26:36,994 --> 01:26:38,782
SPEAKER_0:  high mountaineering gears.

01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  And when you get on top of that, you have to remove all that and...

01:26:42,722 --> 01:26:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  Don't shoot.

01:26:44,546 --> 01:26:54,631
SPEAKER_1:  Is there something you can speak to the challenging aspects of that process? Or is it just like this rigorous process that's well designed that you have to go through and you don't think...

01:26:54,631 --> 01:26:55,358
SPEAKER_0:  We are humans.

01:26:55,650 --> 01:26:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  This is where most of the risk.

01:26:57,794 --> 01:26:58,334
SPEAKER_0:  is.

01:26:58,914 --> 01:26:59,646
SPEAKER_0:  because.

01:27:01,026 --> 01:27:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  You can be well prepared.

01:27:02,722 --> 01:27:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  but for one reason or another.

01:27:04,674 --> 01:27:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  you get sick, you know, and you can get sick not only because of high altitude sickness, it can be a number of things.

01:27:11,970 --> 01:27:14,046
SPEAKER_0:  or you can be tired or you can...

01:27:14,306 --> 01:27:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  catch a cold.

01:27:15,426 --> 01:27:17,182
SPEAKER_0:  And then of course you have the mountain itself.

01:27:17,986 --> 01:27:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  We had a magnitude 7.8 earthquake.

01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:29,918
SPEAKER_0:  hitting one day when we are 50 meters away from the summit. So you can't obviously plan for that. No you can't and that's the acts of gods you know.

01:27:30,146 --> 01:27:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  Working with NASA, although I am the director of the SETI Institute, my grants are coming from NASA, so I'm a NASA contractor. Every time we go to those environments, we have to go through the rigorous process of training with NASA and checking all the boxes for safety. So they are training and training and training us, and I have to thank them.

01:27:50,626 --> 01:27:51,902
SPEAKER_0:  because a lot of those...

01:27:52,514 --> 01:27:57,118
SPEAKER_0:  Trainings are the things that are in your brain when these kinds of things happen.

01:27:57,346 --> 01:27:59,742
SPEAKER_0:  You know how to react, and you are not freaking out.

01:28:00,482 --> 01:28:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  But...

01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:03,518
SPEAKER_0:  in all of the things they are training us for.

01:28:03,874 --> 01:28:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  you have the green risk, the yellow risk, and the red risk.

01:28:07,426 --> 01:28:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  So the green risks are basically the don't be stupid and don't do the kind of thing you wouldn't be doing at home like it.

01:28:13,762 --> 01:28:16,670
SPEAKER_0:  jumping, you know, on rocks that are not stable. you can.

01:28:17,410 --> 01:28:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  tweak your ankle, you know.

01:28:19,586 --> 01:28:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  And then you have other risks like high altitude sickness, how you prepare for that, how you recognize that.

01:28:26,146 --> 01:28:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  These are the yellow risks and then the red risks.

01:28:28,578 --> 01:28:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  The red bricks are what they call the acts of gods, the kind of thing that

01:28:33,090 --> 01:28:33,950
SPEAKER_0:  They can happen.

01:28:34,210 --> 01:28:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  You know there is nothing you can do about it and you accept that when you do that.

01:28:38,402 --> 01:28:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:28:39,106 --> 01:28:39,678
SPEAKER_0:  Those are...

01:28:40,642 --> 01:28:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  volcanic eruptions when you're in this kind of environment.

01:28:43,714 --> 01:28:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  Earthquakes?

01:28:45,634 --> 01:28:47,509
SPEAKER_0:  and everything that an avalanche is for.

01:28:47,509 --> 01:28:49,566
SPEAKER_1:  So you're in this giant mountain.

01:28:50,050 --> 01:28:50,974
SPEAKER_1:  and it's shaking.

01:28:51,490 --> 01:28:53,470
SPEAKER_0:  No, it's not shaking. That's the interesting f-

01:28:53,794 --> 01:28:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  part of it.

01:28:54,690 --> 01:28:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:28:55,490 --> 01:28:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  There was a whole background of things that happened that day when we started off.

01:29:01,186 --> 01:29:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  We got

01:29:02,178 --> 01:29:09,278
SPEAKER_0:  to 50 meters from the summit. And I have part of my logistics team that is at the foot of the mountain.

01:29:09,698 --> 01:29:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:29:10,530 --> 01:29:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  being so close to the summit we have to go under an overhang of lava.

01:29:14,786 --> 01:29:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  So it's just like we are just under this big vault of lava.

01:29:18,658 --> 01:29:19,998
SPEAKER_0:  and it's actually beautiful.

01:29:20,258 --> 01:29:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  If you want something beautiful, it's the Altiplano seen from 20,000 feet.

01:29:25,090 --> 01:29:29,470
SPEAKER_0:  just absolutely stunning. What's the colors? What are we looking at? The colors are that of...

01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  early Earth, which means primordial Earth.

01:29:32,642 --> 01:29:33,214
SPEAKER_0:  It's...

01:29:33,474 --> 01:29:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  Aukers, yellows, oranges, browns.

01:29:36,802 --> 01:29:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  with a dark

01:29:38,594 --> 01:29:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  Blue.

01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:43,038
SPEAKER_0:  And so you're just, you know, it's a time machine.

01:29:43,266 --> 01:29:46,526
SPEAKER_0:  You're just out there and you're climbing 42 degree slopes.

01:29:47,330 --> 01:29:47,966
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:56,478
SPEAKER_0:  All of a sudden, I'm right next behind the guide, and the guide has been with us, it's family, we've been together for 10 years.

01:29:56,834 --> 01:29:58,526
SPEAKER_0:  and he's starting to do that.

01:30:00,322 --> 01:30:05,694
SPEAKER_0:  I don't discuss. When my career do that, I listen.

01:30:05,986 --> 01:30:08,350
SPEAKER_0:  I asked the team to do the same thing where maybe half a dozen.

01:30:09,026 --> 01:30:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  And then I went to talk to him and say, what's going on? He's on the radio.

01:30:12,834 --> 01:30:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  And then he gives me the radio, I'm talking to my logistic chief officer who was at the bottom and he say we're having a...

01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:20,734
SPEAKER_0:  tremendous earthquake.

01:30:21,442 --> 01:30:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  It was saying that the...

01:30:24,162 --> 01:30:26,430
SPEAKER_0:  Actually, the ground was waving. It was so bad.

01:30:27,778 --> 01:30:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  and it was freaking out.

01:30:29,634 --> 01:30:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  because he said, everything is avalanching and I'm very puzzled because we are in a very dangerous part of the volcano, nothing's happening.

01:30:37,090 --> 01:30:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  I turn around.

01:30:38,466 --> 01:30:41,406
SPEAKER_0:  And then this is when I realized there is dust absolutely everywhere.

01:30:42,466 --> 01:30:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  Everything that I saw two minutes before it's

01:30:44,866 --> 01:30:47,390
SPEAKER_0:  gone, just disappear into a wall of dust.

01:30:47,746 --> 01:30:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  But nothing's happening where we are.

01:30:49,922 --> 01:30:50,366
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:30:50,754 --> 01:30:58,398
SPEAKER_0:  Our friends were freaking out because they were seeing everything avalanche, especially the other side of the mountain we were on.

01:30:58,818 --> 01:31:03,902
SPEAKER_0:  was avalanche. So they have no visuals? They have no visual. They thought that we are caught in the avalanche.

01:31:04,130 --> 01:31:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:31:04,930 --> 01:31:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  I said no, but...

01:31:06,754 --> 01:31:11,518
SPEAKER_0:  Some, uh, uh, so at that point, They thought you were screwed. Yeah.

01:31:11,746 --> 01:31:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  And I said, okay, so if this is.

01:31:14,114 --> 01:31:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  What's happening?

01:31:15,266 --> 01:31:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  then I'm taking everybody.

01:31:18,018 --> 01:31:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  to the summit.

01:31:18,914 --> 01:31:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  because we have a very large crater that will take care of avalanches, will be safe.

01:31:23,522 --> 01:31:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  and I'm waiting for the aftershock because this is what you do.

01:31:26,114 --> 01:31:28,030
SPEAKER_0:  you know, when you have earthquakes.

01:31:28,610 --> 01:31:29,726
SPEAKER_0:  So here we go.

01:31:29,954 --> 01:31:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  taking everybody in the crater, and now you have half a dozen scientists.

01:31:35,234 --> 01:31:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  in

01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  The crater with the crater lake.

01:31:38,050 --> 01:31:38,494
SPEAKER_0:  Eh.

01:31:38,946 --> 01:31:41,406
SPEAKER_0:  and this is why we came for.

01:31:41,666 --> 01:31:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  So...

01:31:42,978 --> 01:31:46,110
SPEAKER_0:  We just had a 7.8 earthquake and what do you think they do?

01:31:46,658 --> 01:31:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  Well, of course they do the science they came to.

01:31:48,738 --> 01:31:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  to do.

01:31:49,602 --> 01:31:50,078
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:53,470
SPEAKER_0:  The only thing is that I couldn't because my radio...

01:31:53,954 --> 01:31:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  was only working when I was on the rim of the crater.

01:31:58,050 --> 01:32:02,686
SPEAKER_0:  But I had a little assistant with me, a young...

01:32:03,266 --> 01:32:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  a Bolivian teenager had been shadowing me for.

01:32:06,114 --> 01:32:08,926
SPEAKER_0:  three weeks so he knew exactly what to do and he said now you don't

01:32:09,442 --> 01:32:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  No problem, give me your bag, I'll do the sampling for you.

01:32:12,290 --> 01:32:13,758
SPEAKER_0:  So I was monitoring.

01:32:13,986 --> 01:32:15,006
SPEAKER_0:  the situation.

01:32:15,362 --> 01:32:16,606
SPEAKER_0:  And, uh......

01:32:18,754 --> 01:32:19,838
SPEAKER_0:  I wasn't at that point.

01:32:20,866 --> 01:32:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:32:22,626 --> 01:32:23,806
SPEAKER_0:  There was another moment.

01:32:24,034 --> 01:32:36,222
SPEAKER_0:  my friend downstairs, I could, you know- At the foot. At the foot, yeah. We've known each other. As I say, we're family. This team is family. We've known each other. I am the godmother's kid, so we are close.

01:32:36,898 --> 01:32:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:32:37,634 --> 01:32:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  I could feel for the first time.

01:32:40,034 --> 01:32:41,822
SPEAKER_0:  in my life that.

01:32:42,274 --> 01:32:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  He actually was scared.

01:32:43,906 --> 01:32:49,822
SPEAKER_0:  And he was calling me every 30 seconds, telling me stuff. I say, you have to stop this now.

01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:51,166
SPEAKER_0:  Just...

01:32:51,586 --> 01:32:55,134
SPEAKER_0:  me to give me information that is useful for me to make decisions.

01:32:55,842 --> 01:32:56,606
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

01:32:57,282 --> 01:32:57,758
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:32:58,082 --> 01:32:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  I say, okay, what's going on?

01:33:00,354 --> 01:33:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  It tells me.

01:33:01,442 --> 01:33:03,902
SPEAKER_0:  you know, there is still avalanche, etc.

01:33:04,226 --> 01:33:10,654
SPEAKER_0:  And then a few minutes later, he calls me and says, I think that last car is erupting. So now I have to tell you, we are on a volcano.

01:33:11,362 --> 01:33:17,342
SPEAKER_0:  The next volcano, we share a slope with it, is a little lower, but that's the most temperamental.

01:33:17,698 --> 01:33:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  volcano.

01:33:18,562 --> 01:33:19,582
SPEAKER_0:  of the entire chain.

01:33:20,194 --> 01:33:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  And this one as an.

01:33:21,922 --> 01:33:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  History of Eruption.

01:33:23,586 --> 01:33:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  And then my friend is telling me that the volcano seems to be.

01:33:27,170 --> 01:33:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  starting to erupt.

01:33:28,802 --> 01:33:31,614
SPEAKER_0:  If that volcano goes up, we have nowhere to go.

01:33:32,738 --> 01:33:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  That got my attention.

01:33:34,722 --> 01:33:37,374
SPEAKER_0:  So if you say scared, I would say that.

01:33:38,146 --> 01:33:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  I got the realization that

01:33:39,970 --> 01:33:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  That meant I went cold for like a fraction of a second.

01:33:43,394 --> 01:33:46,206
SPEAKER_0:  But that meant that just my adrenaline started to kick in.

01:33:46,914 --> 01:33:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  And it was a very, very strange experience because now you have tunnel vision, it's about survival.

01:33:52,738 --> 01:33:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  And I say, okay.

01:33:53,570 --> 01:33:56,286
SPEAKER_0:  Now you are going to tell me what I need to know, you know?

01:33:56,738 --> 01:33:57,214
SPEAKER_0:  Tell me.

01:33:57,794 --> 01:33:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  What do you see?

01:33:59,010 --> 01:34:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  I see smoke.

01:34:00,898 --> 01:34:02,526
SPEAKER_0:  What kind of smoke? University of Oklahoma 854- myself

01:34:02,882 --> 01:34:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  It's white, I say.

01:34:04,578 --> 01:34:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  No big deal, that's water vapor.

01:34:06,690 --> 01:34:07,070
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

01:34:07,682 --> 01:34:08,286
SPEAKER_0:  Where it's going?

01:34:08,674 --> 01:34:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  is going to Argentina. That was the opposite direction of where we are. I said, okay, I'm staying where I am.

01:34:14,306 --> 01:34:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  because right now there is no, you know.

01:34:16,130 --> 01:34:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  No danger.

01:34:17,570 --> 01:34:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  and there is still the issue of the aftershock.

01:34:20,706 --> 01:34:22,270
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't want to have the team.

01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:27,358
SPEAKER_0:  caught in the central gully of the volcano with a nevalanche coming at us.

01:34:28,002 --> 01:34:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  So is that there.

01:34:29,570 --> 01:34:34,238
SPEAKER_0:  And he called me after that and said, well, you know, it's still going to Argentina. Fine. Okay.

01:34:34,882 --> 01:34:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:34:35,810 --> 01:34:38,686
SPEAKER_0:  And then a little later, he calls me and says,

01:34:39,074 --> 01:34:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  Natalie, things are changing here. Say, okay, what's going on? Say, well...

01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  The cloud is a little yellow.

01:34:48,962 --> 01:34:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  And I was thinking...

01:34:50,594 --> 01:34:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  myself.

01:34:53,058 --> 01:34:55,262
SPEAKER_1:  What does it mean when it's yellow?

01:34:55,650 --> 01:34:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  All for it.

01:34:56,674 --> 01:34:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  And then when you have software...

01:34:58,914 --> 01:34:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  Mixed.

01:34:59,842 --> 01:35:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  with

01:35:00,738 --> 01:35:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  the water vapor or the water in your lungs, this turns into sulfuric acid.

01:35:06,370 --> 01:35:07,326
SPEAKER_0:  Then you're really screwed.

01:35:08,034 --> 01:35:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  NSA, okay.

01:35:09,346 --> 01:35:14,366
SPEAKER_0:  Thank you for the information. Where is the club going?

01:35:14,626 --> 01:35:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  The wing is shifting, it's coming your direction.

01:35:18,114 --> 01:35:20,638
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, that was a day like that, you know.

01:35:20,866 --> 01:35:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  I am talking to him on the radio and I'm turning around and as I turn around I see the clouds starting to pop.

01:35:27,586 --> 01:35:29,182
SPEAKER_0:  on the opposite side of the rim.

01:35:30,946 --> 01:35:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  So at that time, we had no choice anymore, because now you have to figure out what's going to kill you first.

01:35:37,794 --> 01:35:40,030
SPEAKER_0:  And so there was the risk.

01:35:40,482 --> 01:35:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  or the potential.

01:35:41,762 --> 01:35:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  of the Netherlands.

01:35:43,650 --> 01:35:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  But at least you can see the rocks.

01:35:46,434 --> 01:35:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  The gas is going to kill you before you can see it.

01:35:49,666 --> 01:35:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  So I called everybody back.

01:35:51,298 --> 01:35:52,350
SPEAKER_0:  We gather our stuff.

01:35:53,154 --> 01:35:56,702
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't give too much detail, but I say it's time to go.

01:35:57,506 --> 01:35:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  downhill.

01:35:58,434 --> 01:35:59,166
SPEAKER_0:  and fast.

01:35:59,874 --> 01:36:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  So, which we did.

01:36:01,602 --> 01:36:03,582
SPEAKER_0:  We stopped only when we were at mid camp.

01:36:04,098 --> 01:36:05,182
SPEAKER_0:  And then

01:36:05,794 --> 01:36:07,262
SPEAKER_0:  At that point, we saw the cloud.

01:36:07,554 --> 01:36:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  is completely covering the summit where we were.

01:36:10,146 --> 01:36:11,774
SPEAKER_0:  So we did well to bail out.

01:36:12,482 --> 01:36:14,366
SPEAKER_0:  But that was 500 meters.

01:36:15,074 --> 01:36:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  500 meters higher than we were, so we are safe. I was just making sure that it would not go down the slope.

01:36:20,482 --> 01:36:22,558
SPEAKER_0:  where we were, we were safe, so we stayed.

01:36:22,818 --> 01:36:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  and just rested for a little while.

01:36:26,082 --> 01:36:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  And after that, we descended.

01:36:28,386 --> 01:36:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  And it was all on adrenaline, I can tell you what, I had two of my crew with headaches. One of them was because of the altitude, we climbed really fast.

01:36:36,546 --> 01:36:41,662
SPEAKER_0:  The other one was because of the cloud. She was the closest to the cloud when it happened.

01:36:42,146 --> 01:36:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  So we descended fast. Wow, that was close.

01:36:44,930 --> 01:36:48,222
SPEAKER_0:  That was close and it's interesting how the human...

01:36:48,450 --> 01:36:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  body and mind works because I know that from the moment my friend told me that.

01:36:52,802 --> 01:36:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  The volcano seemed to be erupting.

01:36:55,074 --> 01:36:55,582
SPEAKER_0:  I was

01:36:56,002 --> 01:36:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  going on adrenaline.

01:36:57,698 --> 01:36:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  But.

01:36:59,138 --> 01:36:59,966
SPEAKER_0:  when we got...

01:37:00,226 --> 01:37:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  close to them and I saw him, we were getting close to the cars, I saw him coming towards me.

01:37:05,858 --> 01:37:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  and the slope also and all the adrenaline.

01:37:08,322 --> 01:37:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  When away.

01:37:10,114 --> 01:37:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  I was a mess.

01:37:11,362 --> 01:37:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  I had to find the first rock and sit down.

01:37:14,882 --> 01:37:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  It was gone.

01:37:15,906 --> 01:37:17,031
SPEAKER_0:  I mean. Fascinating.

01:37:17,031 --> 01:37:20,031
SPEAKER_1:  So you just basically physically and mentally collapsed one.

01:37:20,031 --> 01:37:22,238
SPEAKER_0:  Absolutely! There was nothing left!

01:37:22,466 --> 01:37:23,166
SPEAKER_0:  of me.

01:37:23,746 --> 01:37:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  I got in the car.

01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:30,046
SPEAKER_0:  And I felt in the cars we were heading back towards camp, I could have passed out.

01:37:30,402 --> 01:37:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  I really fought back and I'm not the kind of passing out really easy.

01:37:35,170 --> 01:37:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  but-

01:37:36,034 --> 01:37:37,150
SPEAKER_0:  There was nothing like-

01:37:37,602 --> 01:37:39,230
SPEAKER_0:  I had no energy, no nothing.

01:37:39,970 --> 01:37:40,446
SPEAKER_0:  It's.

01:37:40,674 --> 01:37:42,814
SPEAKER_0:  Fabulous how you react.

01:37:43,042 --> 01:37:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  and how this is embedded in your own.

01:37:45,058 --> 01:37:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  brain.

01:37:46,082 --> 01:37:46,494
SPEAKER_0:  from.

01:37:47,298 --> 01:37:47,902
SPEAKER_0:  And...

01:37:48,482 --> 01:37:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  of evolution, of reaction to.

01:37:51,394 --> 01:37:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  dangerous situation.

01:37:53,282 --> 01:37:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  basically.

01:37:55,042 --> 01:37:56,478
SPEAKER_0:  that drive to survive.

01:37:56,770 --> 01:37:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, something like that.

01:37:58,242 --> 01:38:03,934
SPEAKER_1:  You just told us one heck of a story. And as you said, such story comes along with many.

01:38:04,802 --> 01:38:07,134
SPEAKER_1:  of the diving expeditions that you do.

01:38:08,162 --> 01:38:09,374
SPEAKER_1:  on the science side.

01:38:10,434 --> 01:38:16,254
SPEAKER_1:  What is that world that simulates, that travels back in time into the Martian landscape?

01:38:16,738 --> 01:38:18,206
SPEAKER_1:  What does the science reveal?

01:38:18,914 --> 01:38:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  So the science reveals that...

01:38:22,242 --> 01:38:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  I feel resilient.

01:38:24,162 --> 01:38:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  When I started that...

01:38:25,282 --> 01:38:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  I told my husband I say this is going to be very fast. We are going in such nasty environment

01:38:30,722 --> 01:38:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  that we're not going to find anything.

01:38:32,674 --> 01:38:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  and you know, world back home.

01:38:34,434 --> 01:38:34,814
SPEAKER_0:  Ah.

01:38:35,330 --> 01:38:35,966
SPEAKER_0:  See you soon.

01:38:36,834 --> 01:38:39,459
SPEAKER_0:  So 20 years later, we are still studying those environments.

01:38:39,459 --> 01:38:41,246
SPEAKER_1:  That was your gut feeling like nothing.

01:38:41,538 --> 01:38:42,663
SPEAKER_1:  Not much can possibly survive.

01:38:42,663 --> 01:38:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  Well, the UV environment is so nasty.

01:38:46,242 --> 01:38:47,422
SPEAKER_0:  But there you find...

01:38:47,874 --> 01:38:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  the same microorganism.

01:38:50,722 --> 01:38:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  that made the very first fossils on Earth.

01:38:54,210 --> 01:38:55,550
SPEAKER_0:  3.5 billion years ago.

01:38:56,258 --> 01:39:00,830
SPEAKER_0:  and they keep surviving, they developed an adaptation.

01:39:01,154 --> 01:39:03,006
SPEAKER_0:  Swiss or Minna if you prefer.

01:39:03,586 --> 01:39:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  And so you learn about that, you learn about...

01:39:07,202 --> 01:39:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  what they are.

01:39:08,578 --> 01:39:09,598
SPEAKER_0:  How they adapt.

01:39:09,826 --> 01:39:13,662
SPEAKER_0:  through times and through environmental changes, which is really important.

01:39:14,242 --> 01:39:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  What are their signatures? We learn to recognize them, we learn what kind of instrument we need, what kind of signature, whether it's chemical or morphological or whatnot.

01:39:27,042 --> 01:39:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  So basically we learn how to explore.

01:39:29,538 --> 01:39:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  But...

01:39:30,210 --> 01:39:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  I would say that to me, and this is a realization interestingly enough that came three years into the project.

01:39:37,666 --> 01:39:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:39:38,850 --> 01:39:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  I really woke up literally one morning saying...

01:39:42,658 --> 01:39:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we've been coming here for three years now.

01:39:46,370 --> 01:39:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  Try and understand.

01:39:47,778 --> 01:39:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  how to search for life on Mars.

01:39:50,242 --> 01:39:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  But what this place is showing us is what's happening right here, right now on our own planet.

01:39:56,066 --> 01:40:02,814
SPEAKER_0:  And by exploring those extreme environments, we are also reaching to places not too many people go.

01:40:03,138 --> 01:40:05,982
SPEAKER_0:  And so we're learning more about our own biospheres.

01:40:06,434 --> 01:40:07,678
SPEAKER_0:  and...

01:40:08,194 --> 01:40:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  the diversity of our own life here on earth.

01:40:11,074 --> 01:40:14,302
SPEAKER_0:  So these are the two main things that I would say.

01:40:14,402 --> 01:40:15,294
SPEAKER_1:  What kind of life?

01:40:16,738 --> 01:40:17,726
SPEAKER_1:  survives up there.

01:40:18,498 --> 01:40:22,599
SPEAKER_0:  top of those volcanoes it's about bacteria mostly.

01:40:22,599 --> 01:40:23,582
SPEAKER_1:  Is there something?

01:40:24,130 --> 01:40:27,505
SPEAKER_1:  specific about that bacteria that's able to be so rugged.

01:40:27,505 --> 01:40:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, they have adapted to very high UV radiation, and it's not only because they are at high altitude, it's because early Earth.

01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  didn't have an ozone layer.

01:40:39,362 --> 01:40:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  So when those...

01:40:40,930 --> 01:40:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  the ancestors of those bacteria.

01:40:44,066 --> 01:40:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  originated.

01:40:45,250 --> 01:40:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  They have to survive a world where you had lots of short UV coming down at the surface.

01:40:51,394 --> 01:40:57,022
SPEAKER_0:  and also lots of hydrothermal environment, volcanoes and hot water, lots of salt.

01:40:57,346 --> 01:40:59,486
SPEAKER_0:  And you see all this toolbox.

01:41:00,290 --> 01:41:00,958
SPEAKER_0:  Steele.

01:41:02,018 --> 01:41:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  embedded in those microorganisms today, four billion years later. It's just amazing.

01:41:07,586 --> 01:41:11,198
SPEAKER_0:  And depending on the environment, they are going to switch.

01:41:11,522 --> 01:41:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  some of these defenses adaptation on or off.

01:41:16,034 --> 01:41:16,446
SPEAKER_0:  there.

01:41:16,706 --> 01:41:17,342
SPEAKER_0:  UV

01:41:17,954 --> 01:41:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  situation there is so nasty.

01:41:20,610 --> 01:41:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  that

01:41:22,562 --> 01:41:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  here.

01:41:23,458 --> 01:41:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  You have bacterias like that, I know bacteria, you find them everywhere. It's really something you find all over the place.

01:41:30,114 --> 01:41:32,062
SPEAKER_0:  If you found them here in California…

01:41:32,546 --> 01:41:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  they will turn their protection.

01:41:35,266 --> 01:41:37,630
SPEAKER_0:  against UV during the day in summer?

01:41:38,402 --> 01:41:39,646
SPEAKER_0:  and they will switch it off.

01:41:40,130 --> 01:41:41,054
SPEAKER_0:  at the end of the day.

01:41:42,210 --> 01:41:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  There in the Andes, it's so nasty that that thing stays on all the time.

01:41:47,458 --> 01:41:50,718
SPEAKER_0:  But if you take samples and bring them back here...

01:41:51,330 --> 01:41:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  and start to...

01:41:53,186 --> 01:41:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  culture then.

01:41:54,754 --> 01:41:58,526
SPEAKER_0:  like we did on top of a building, leaving them, you know.

01:41:59,042 --> 01:42:02,494
SPEAKER_0:  you will see the second generation of this organism.

01:42:02,946 --> 01:42:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  they are starting to switch on and off again.

01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:09,150
SPEAKER_0:  So they're extremely adaptable.

01:42:09,602 --> 01:42:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  extremely rugged.

01:42:11,298 --> 01:42:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  And that's why they are still here.

01:42:13,890 --> 01:42:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  Probably that's why we're here, because life finds ways.

01:42:18,370 --> 01:42:19,934
SPEAKER_1:  Is there some degree to which...

01:42:20,322 --> 01:42:21,950
SPEAKER_1:  The harshness of the conditions.

01:42:23,010 --> 01:42:23,998
SPEAKER_1:  enables

01:42:25,186 --> 01:42:27,719
SPEAKER_1:  the flourishing of life versus shut down.

01:42:27,719 --> 01:42:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  down.

01:42:28,962 --> 01:42:30,366
SPEAKER_0:  Well, it will shut down.

01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:37,310
SPEAKER_0:  those that cannot survive. Obviously, this is a statement that's kept an obvious right there, but it's also...

01:42:37,858 --> 01:42:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  the survival of the fittest.

01:42:40,482 --> 01:42:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  And this is what evolution is, all right?

01:42:43,074 --> 01:42:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  Um, so.

01:42:44,962 --> 01:42:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  They are here because they were the most adaptable.

01:42:48,418 --> 01:42:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

01:42:50,498 --> 01:42:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  Evolution is going.

01:42:52,930 --> 01:42:53,726
SPEAKER_0:  to show.

01:42:54,338 --> 01:42:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  have.

01:42:55,202 --> 01:42:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  of the fittest.

01:42:56,898 --> 01:43:01,822
SPEAKER_0:  The one that cannot resist, they might have a good time for a little while but then...

01:43:02,242 --> 01:43:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we've seen this at much…

01:43:05,378 --> 01:43:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  different scale.

01:43:06,690 --> 01:43:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  and with complex knife.

01:43:08,386 --> 01:43:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  Not so long ago, a hundred thousand years ago.

01:43:11,522 --> 01:43:12,318
SPEAKER_0:  Neanderthal.

01:43:13,570 --> 01:43:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  was side by side by homo sapiens.

01:43:16,322 --> 01:43:21,406
SPEAKER_0:  But Nandethor was completely adapted to a cold earth, to a glacial earth.

01:43:21,858 --> 01:43:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  of the end of the play-stocene.

01:43:24,578 --> 01:43:25,950
SPEAKER_0:  and when conditions change.

01:43:27,170 --> 01:43:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  He couldn't lie.

01:43:28,162 --> 01:43:34,110
SPEAKER_1:  You think, I mean, there's still some mysteries around that, right? Like exactly what were the harshness of the conditions.

01:43:34,786 --> 01:43:35,166
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:43:35,810 --> 01:43:36,254
SPEAKER_1:  I still...

01:43:36,546 --> 01:43:38,421
SPEAKER_1:  Really suspicious, what did Homo say?

01:43:38,421 --> 01:43:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  No, no, no, no. I really want to know. No, no, I'm shady stuff that happened

01:43:43,490 --> 01:43:45,182
SPEAKER_0:  shitty stuff happen, they met.

01:43:45,858 --> 01:43:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  They bred together, they fought against each other.

01:43:49,026 --> 01:43:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  What humans do. You had to expect that.

01:43:51,362 --> 01:43:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  But the thing is that...

01:43:53,410 --> 01:43:56,958
SPEAKER_0:  Nendirthal was completely adapted for a very long time.

01:43:57,570 --> 01:43:59,934
SPEAKER_0:  to live at the edge of those glaciers.

01:44:00,706 --> 01:44:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  They are where.

01:44:01,474 --> 01:44:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  Probably.

01:44:02,882 --> 01:44:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  in a weakened situation when homo sapiens came.

01:44:06,562 --> 01:44:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  and started to spread.

01:44:08,930 --> 01:44:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:44:09,826 --> 01:44:10,238
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:44:10,882 --> 01:44:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  Basically...

01:44:12,226 --> 01:44:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  This is what life does. It adapts, and if you cannot adapt anymore, then you disappear and something else takes over.

01:44:19,426 --> 01:44:22,622
SPEAKER_1:  You hold the Women's World Record for diving at altitudes.

01:44:22,914 --> 01:44:24,414
SPEAKER_1:  both scuba and freediving.

01:44:24,674 --> 01:44:26,270
SPEAKER_1:  So I have to ask what...

01:44:26,626 --> 01:44:28,670
SPEAKER_1:  Can you describe the details of those records?

01:44:29,122 --> 01:44:30,046
SPEAKER_0:  I never looked.

01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  For those, I'm not after records at all. In fact, I didn't know I had broken those records when that happened.

01:44:37,346 --> 01:44:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:44:38,530 --> 01:44:41,905
SPEAKER_0:  We did that as part of our expedition, as part of our scientific expedition.

01:44:41,905 --> 01:44:44,905
SPEAKER_1:  So it's basically sport in the name of science versus.

01:44:44,905 --> 01:44:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  No, it's science in the name of science and it's just a very physical thing that you have to do. So we train ourselves like athletes.

01:44:53,890 --> 01:44:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  But to get the job done. To get the job done.

01:44:56,194 --> 01:45:03,710
SPEAKER_1:  you're holding your breath underwater for a very long time, like with free diving, what are we talking about? do you think in terms of time?

01:45:04,098 --> 01:45:04,862
SPEAKER_1:  Is there like...

01:45:05,250 --> 01:45:06,590
SPEAKER_1:  layers where you know.

01:45:07,010 --> 01:45:10,878
SPEAKER_1:  through training, you're in a good place. I'm sure you take time off and get rusty.

01:45:11,298 --> 01:45:20,734
SPEAKER_0:  And I have not been diving in a while, so probably I need to go back to the drawing board at the bottom of the swimming pool.

01:45:21,026 --> 01:45:25,150
SPEAKER_0:  Having training from the past, I think, you know, we will pick up much more faster than.

01:45:25,570 --> 01:45:26,110
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:45:26,562 --> 01:45:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  Basically, I would never, at those altitudes, I would never go over three minutes.

01:45:31,394 --> 01:45:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  that would be suicidal.

01:45:32,962 --> 01:45:35,966
SPEAKER_1:  So the altitude is much tougher than the pool

01:45:36,098 --> 01:45:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  back at ground level.

01:45:38,018 --> 01:45:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  It is.

01:45:38,882 --> 01:45:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  but it's not- When you come up and you have to get up. That's not the going in the water. When I'm underwater I'm fine.

01:45:45,186 --> 01:45:46,878
SPEAKER_0:  And if I wanted, I could stay longer.

01:45:47,138 --> 01:45:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  But he wouldn't be very wise.

01:45:50,882 --> 01:45:51,486
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

01:45:51,874 --> 01:45:57,278
SPEAKER_1:  You've written about the history of life on Mars. Like you said, you've kind of exploring that by looking at the lakes.

01:45:57,794 --> 01:45:58,238
SPEAKER_1:  here.

01:45:58,850 --> 01:45:59,262
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:45:59,938 --> 01:46:01,694
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think there's been life?

01:46:02,242 --> 01:46:04,286
SPEAKER_1:  On Mars, do you think there is life on Mars?

01:46:04,898 --> 01:46:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  Right, so when you're looking at the environment of Mars early on...

01:46:08,930 --> 01:46:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  is fairly similar.

01:46:10,402 --> 01:46:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  to that of early Earth.

01:46:12,386 --> 01:46:17,310
SPEAKER_0:  never was exactly the same because Mars was always farther from the Sun than the Earth.

01:46:17,538 --> 01:46:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  So it was always a little cooler.

01:46:20,162 --> 01:46:21,950
SPEAKER_0:  But you have to imagine.

01:46:22,370 --> 01:46:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe the Arctic during the summer?

01:46:24,738 --> 01:46:32,862
SPEAKER_0:  That would be early March with a lot going on for it in terms of environment, very favorable to even life as we know it.

01:46:33,410 --> 01:46:33,982
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:46:34,690 --> 01:46:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  We don't know.

01:46:36,162 --> 01:46:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  How First Life

01:46:38,402 --> 01:46:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  happen on Earth.

01:46:39,778 --> 01:46:47,102
SPEAKER_0:  they are signs right now showing that it might have actually originated only 200 million years after the cross cooldown.

01:46:47,394 --> 01:46:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  Oh wow.

01:46:48,386 --> 01:46:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  This still has to be verified, but that's the closest. And these are indirect evidence, like…

01:46:54,082 --> 01:46:57,438
SPEAKER_0:  carbon left by the activity of life, not life itself.

01:46:57,858 --> 01:46:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  And there is a twist in the story.

01:46:59,810 --> 01:47:00,510
SPEAKER_0:  for Mars.

01:47:00,898 --> 01:47:06,270
SPEAKER_0:  is that it seems that Mars came together as a planet faster.

01:47:06,498 --> 01:47:08,798
SPEAKER_0:  than the Earth and had water.

01:47:09,090 --> 01:47:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  earlier.

01:47:10,146 --> 01:47:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  than the Earth.

01:47:11,490 --> 01:47:15,230
SPEAKER_0:  So, it may be that Mars was habitable.

01:47:15,650 --> 01:47:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  and my have seen.

01:47:18,018 --> 01:47:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  The beginning of life.

01:47:20,002 --> 01:47:20,542
SPEAKER_0:  earlier.

01:47:20,834 --> 01:47:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  than the Earth.

01:47:22,146 --> 01:47:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:47:22,786 --> 01:47:27,550
SPEAKER_0:  So all of this is speculation. Obviously, we haven't found any evidence.

01:47:27,842 --> 01:47:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  or solid evidence yet.

01:47:30,082 --> 01:47:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  I would say unambiguous evidence, but unambiguous.

01:47:33,378 --> 01:47:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  evidence of life.

01:47:35,138 --> 01:47:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  is going to be something interesting to prove because we don't know what life is, remember.

01:47:40,994 --> 01:47:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  So I always joke that the only way we would know that there is life on Mars is if there was a rabbit jumping in front of the rover.

01:47:47,554 --> 01:47:49,022
SPEAKER_0:  but we might be.

01:47:49,634 --> 01:47:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  You know, gathering, we have what we call a ladder of life detection.

01:47:54,114 --> 01:47:56,606
SPEAKER_0:  which is that you have a series of

01:47:57,090 --> 01:47:59,486
SPEAKER_0:  ranks that you need to go through.

01:48:00,226 --> 01:48:01,630
SPEAKER_0:  that actually

01:48:02,178 --> 01:48:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  are not proving you that you've discovered life.

01:48:05,314 --> 01:48:05,694
SPEAKER_0:  BUD-

01:48:05,922 --> 01:48:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  are making.

01:48:07,906 --> 01:48:11,582
SPEAKER_0:  the possibility that what you discovered

01:48:11,810 --> 01:48:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  was made only by the environment more and more improbable.

01:48:16,930 --> 01:48:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  So we are trying to prove the contrary, right?

01:48:20,002 --> 01:48:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  So this is what we have right now.

01:48:21,858 --> 01:48:23,966
SPEAKER_0:  And as far as I'm concerned.

01:48:24,770 --> 01:48:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  Considering all the unknowns we have, I think there was as much chance.

01:48:28,642 --> 01:48:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  that life.

01:48:29,954 --> 01:48:32,030
SPEAKER_0:  originated on Mars, that it did on Earth.

01:48:32,610 --> 01:48:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  and...

01:48:34,466 --> 01:48:35,902
SPEAKER_0:  if it was at the surface.

01:48:36,290 --> 01:48:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  then it got in trouble.

01:48:38,146 --> 01:48:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  after 500 million years because of the

01:48:40,994 --> 01:48:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  disappearance of the magnetosphere, the loss of the magnetosphere and the atmosphere.

01:48:45,282 --> 01:48:46,014
SPEAKER_0:  But as we know...

01:48:46,242 --> 01:48:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

01:48:47,074 --> 01:48:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  Life doesn't.

01:48:48,354 --> 01:48:49,022
SPEAKER_0:  only.

01:48:50,018 --> 01:48:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  Stay in one place.

01:48:51,298 --> 01:48:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  As soon as it's out there, it's going to adapt, it's going to give itself more chance.

01:48:56,994 --> 01:48:57,790
SPEAKER_0:  to survive.

01:48:58,114 --> 01:48:59,710
SPEAKER_0:  And that to me means that...

01:49:00,354 --> 01:49:01,630
SPEAKER_0:  If life appeared...

01:49:01,922 --> 01:49:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  I would say.

01:49:04,386 --> 01:49:07,326
SPEAKER_0:  It's still there, and probably on the ground where it...

01:49:07,618 --> 01:49:11,006
SPEAKER_0:  can be in an environment that's more stable. I don't know.

01:49:11,490 --> 01:49:14,494
SPEAKER_0:  how stability is good or not. It might not be so good, but...

01:49:14,722 --> 01:49:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  they might be in a different type of metabolism.

01:49:17,314 --> 01:49:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  through dormancy, waiting for different climate cycles.

01:49:21,570 --> 01:49:24,030
SPEAKER_0:  And there is the fact that Mars changes.

01:49:24,578 --> 01:49:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  Ballots.

01:49:25,346 --> 01:49:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  faster.

01:49:26,786 --> 01:49:27,838
SPEAKER_0:  than the Earth.

01:49:28,258 --> 01:49:31,358
SPEAKER_0:  and climate changes are a lot stronger in magnitude.

01:49:31,842 --> 01:49:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  So there might be a place on Mars. We know that there is a place on Mars.

01:49:35,906 --> 01:49:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  deeper in the subsurface where temperature and pressure are good for liquid water to stay there. So these would be good places for a stable habitat over time, no matter what happens at the surface.

01:49:47,778 --> 01:49:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  But...

01:49:48,962 --> 01:49:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  If

01:49:49,602 --> 01:49:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, life is also.

01:49:51,906 --> 01:49:52,446
SPEAKER_0:  hot.

01:49:53,154 --> 01:49:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  between that dip.

01:49:54,722 --> 01:49:55,070
SPEAKER_0:  zone.

01:49:55,522 --> 01:49:56,606
SPEAKER_0:  and the surface.

01:49:57,026 --> 01:50:01,022
SPEAKER_0:  there is an active layer, there is a lot of ice in the subsurface of Mars.

01:50:01,282 --> 01:50:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  And when the climate changes...

01:50:03,170 --> 01:50:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  when the obliquity goes beyond 30 degrees.

01:50:06,658 --> 01:50:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  Then at that point.

01:50:08,578 --> 01:50:09,918
SPEAKER_0:  You will have some.

01:50:10,402 --> 01:50:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  activation of that zone.

01:50:12,514 --> 01:50:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  You have thawing of the ice.

01:50:14,978 --> 01:50:19,678
SPEAKER_0:  So all this region is reactivated and maybe that's a way.

01:50:19,970 --> 01:50:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  where you have.

01:50:21,346 --> 01:50:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  pathways for life to move from.

01:50:23,650 --> 01:50:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  the deep zone.

01:50:24,962 --> 01:50:26,334
SPEAKER_0:  closer to the surface.

01:50:26,690 --> 01:50:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  This is why I'm one of those scientists who thinks that...

01:50:31,746 --> 01:50:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  Life might not be so far from the surface than we think.

01:50:35,938 --> 01:50:38,398
SPEAKER_1:  so we don't have to dig very far to find it.

01:50:38,594 --> 01:50:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  We probably won't. And the reason I'm... That would be so amazing. I am thinking of that just because of this experience as well of extreme environments.

01:50:47,810 --> 01:50:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  You have to sit and look.

01:50:50,562 --> 01:50:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  and listen basically.

01:50:52,162 --> 01:50:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  The story of my life. If I want to understand where microbes are located on Mars, I have to become the microbe, right?

01:50:58,690 --> 01:51:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  This is the thought experiment. And if I want to understand where ET is, then I have to become ET. So it's a big stretch.

01:51:05,730 --> 01:51:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  But in extreme environment.

01:51:07,938 --> 01:51:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  You said.

01:51:09,218 --> 01:51:10,686
SPEAKER_0:  in the desert for a while.

01:51:11,106 --> 01:51:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  and you just...

01:51:12,354 --> 01:51:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  You know, try to understand.

01:51:14,530 --> 01:51:15,646
SPEAKER_0:  where the wind's coming from.

01:51:15,906 --> 01:51:20,830
SPEAKER_0:  where the humidity, when it's showing up, and then you start to understand the patterns of those things.

01:51:21,154 --> 01:51:23,838
SPEAKER_1:  What are the useful signals that you need for survival?

01:51:24,418 --> 01:51:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  You need to know where water is, where the source of energy is going to be drawn from. You need to find shelters, and shelters don't mean that, for instance, you can have a water column.

01:51:34,850 --> 01:51:36,830
SPEAKER_0:  of the lake or river or whatnot.

01:51:37,250 --> 01:51:39,518
SPEAKER_0:  or the ocean. It can be also...

01:51:39,746 --> 01:51:40,894
SPEAKER_0:  Very thin.

01:51:41,602 --> 01:51:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  Layer of dust.

01:51:43,138 --> 01:51:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  or it can be a translucent rock.

01:51:47,042 --> 01:51:52,254
SPEAKER_0:  And you see what we call andeliths. These are the same cyanobacteria, but a different version of them.

01:51:52,578 --> 01:51:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  They live inside the rocks, inside those crystals.

01:51:55,618 --> 01:51:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  because they have the best of life.

01:51:57,826 --> 01:51:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  They are-

01:51:58,818 --> 01:52:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  into translucent.

01:52:00,898 --> 01:52:01,534
SPEAKER_0:  crystals.

01:52:01,890 --> 01:52:02,494
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:52:02,818 --> 01:52:04,734
SPEAKER_0:  that they receive the light from the sun.

01:52:05,026 --> 01:52:06,622
SPEAKER_0:  They can do the photosynthesis.

01:52:07,458 --> 01:52:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  But...

01:52:08,514 --> 01:52:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  There is enough of that crystal so that the nasty UV is being stopped.

01:52:14,562 --> 01:52:17,118
SPEAKER_0:  and they are in their little...

01:52:17,666 --> 01:52:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  house.

01:52:18,978 --> 01:52:20,286
SPEAKER_0:  a

01:52:20,578 --> 01:52:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  when you are looking at temperature within those rocks.

01:52:24,130 --> 01:52:25,694
SPEAKER_0:  They tend to make it toaster.

01:52:26,018 --> 01:52:29,278
SPEAKER_0:  than the outside temperature. So there is a lot of things going on.

01:52:29,602 --> 01:52:30,046
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:52:30,562 --> 01:52:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  So...

01:52:31,490 --> 01:52:38,718
SPEAKER_0:  What I'm saying for Mars is that, yeah, right now you don't have an atmosphere very much 160 times thinner than the Earth.

01:52:39,106 --> 01:52:42,174
SPEAKER_0:  6 mB is really not much, but it's there.

01:52:42,594 --> 01:52:43,038
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:52:43,778 --> 01:52:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  But you still have a lot of UV, the short UV, like the nasty one, UVA, UVB, UVC, that can really mess up your DNA.

01:52:51,874 --> 01:52:54,046
SPEAKER_0:  and destroy it beyond repair.

01:52:54,882 --> 01:52:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  But as soon as you have a little alcove...

01:52:58,210 --> 01:52:59,134
SPEAKER_0:  into a rock.

01:52:59,554 --> 01:53:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  or a cliff.

01:53:01,346 --> 01:53:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

01:53:02,690 --> 01:53:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  I'd be looking at those places, but you have to understand Mars, or any other planet for that matter.

01:53:08,386 --> 01:53:10,750
SPEAKER_0:  at the level that matters for the microbe.

01:53:12,130 --> 01:53:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  and it is.

01:53:13,506 --> 01:53:14,631
SPEAKER_0:  So then you.

01:53:14,631 --> 01:53:15,838
SPEAKER_1:  one with the micro.

01:53:16,130 --> 01:53:20,830
SPEAKER_0:  be one with the microbes, which means that we have lots of orbital data.

01:53:21,346 --> 01:53:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  which is good to understand habitability at the planet level or at the regional level.

01:53:26,690 --> 01:53:27,262
SPEAKER_0:  But...

01:53:27,554 --> 01:53:32,510
SPEAKER_0:  We have very little data right now that is very useful to understand habitability.

01:53:33,154 --> 01:53:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:53:34,114 --> 01:53:35,998
SPEAKER_0:  at the scale that matters for the microbes.

01:53:36,290 --> 01:53:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  at this point in time. So we need to do a better job with that. My idea is to have arrays.

01:53:44,322 --> 01:53:47,422
SPEAKER_0:  of environmental station that could have a lot of benefits.

01:53:47,778 --> 01:53:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  one would be to give us that vision.

01:53:50,210 --> 01:53:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  for the microbes.

01:53:51,874 --> 01:53:53,406
SPEAKER_0:  That would be good for astrobiology.

01:53:54,114 --> 01:53:57,489
SPEAKER_1:  And second, a collection of stations on Mars.

01:53:57,489 --> 01:53:58,239
SPEAKER_0:  Marcia.

01:53:58,239 --> 01:54:00,489
SPEAKER_1:  that collect, that give us a good map.

01:54:00,489 --> 01:54:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, high resolution.

01:54:02,530 --> 01:54:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  We can do that regionally and on top of that. It's good for us through biology for the search for life on Mars.

01:54:08,482 --> 01:54:15,646
SPEAKER_0:  That's good about how to learn where microbes could be that can be a problem for contamination both ways.

01:54:15,906 --> 01:54:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  So that's good for planetary protection.

01:54:18,914 --> 01:54:19,390
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:54:19,682 --> 01:54:22,814
SPEAKER_0:  since those stations would have communication.

01:54:23,202 --> 01:54:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  capabilities on them.

01:54:25,186 --> 01:54:28,926
SPEAKER_0:  that excellent for human exploration because now normally you have

01:54:29,282 --> 01:54:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  weather stations all over the place that can tell your astronauts.

01:54:33,186 --> 01:54:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  Learn the pattern when it's a good time to go out or not go out.

01:54:36,738 --> 01:54:38,782
SPEAKER_0:  and also helps them communicate.

01:54:39,042 --> 01:54:46,014
SPEAKER_0:  when they go and do sorties. So there are a number of things you can do that can tell you lots of information.

01:54:46,658 --> 01:54:49,182
SPEAKER_1:  Let's rewind the clock a little bit. You grew up in Paris.

01:54:50,114 --> 01:54:50,942
SPEAKER_1:  I was just there.

01:54:51,394 --> 01:54:54,878
SPEAKER_1:  Helen McDonald in her New York Times amazing profile piece of you.

01:54:55,650 --> 01:54:58,046
SPEAKER_1:  writes that your teenage years were troubled.

01:54:58,946 --> 01:54:59,294
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:54:59,554 --> 01:55:02,078
SPEAKER_1:  how did the challenging early years.

01:55:02,818 --> 01:55:05,374
SPEAKER_1:  Make the human being the scientist that you are today.

01:55:06,114 --> 01:55:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  Everything.

01:55:07,298 --> 01:55:09,342
SPEAKER_0:  I think that...

01:55:10,562 --> 01:55:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  This is what's taking me on top of those big mountains.

01:55:14,306 --> 01:55:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  And the irony is for me to be looking for the origin and nature of life.

01:55:20,482 --> 01:55:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  because I was so close to losing it.

01:55:22,466 --> 01:55:24,158
SPEAKER_0:  But to me that was...

01:55:24,482 --> 01:55:25,534
SPEAKER_0:  a great lesson learned.

01:55:26,466 --> 01:55:29,470
SPEAKER_0:  and that helped me see.

01:55:29,954 --> 01:55:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  through the beauty of life?

01:55:32,258 --> 01:55:34,270
SPEAKER_0:  Going on the other side of that

01:55:34,690 --> 01:55:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  it became really what made me.

01:55:38,626 --> 01:55:40,222
SPEAKER_0:  helped me go through absolutely.

01:55:40,642 --> 01:55:42,206
SPEAKER_0:  everything and anything in life.

01:55:42,978 --> 01:55:44,862
SPEAKER_0:  high mountains and tell me.

01:55:45,410 --> 01:55:48,638
SPEAKER_0:  there is something I want to know and you know.

01:55:49,154 --> 01:55:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:55:50,594 --> 01:55:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  I am going to give it my best.

01:55:53,090 --> 01:55:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  and I won't give up.

01:55:54,530 --> 01:55:55,454
SPEAKER_0:  And I won't give in.

01:55:55,938 --> 01:56:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  And this is a message that I carried all my life and I'm so very grateful.

01:56:01,698 --> 01:56:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  that I did because...

01:56:03,970 --> 01:56:06,622
SPEAKER_0:  all the things that I would have missed if I hadn't done that.

01:56:07,106 --> 01:56:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  You know, this is...

01:56:08,386 --> 01:56:10,174
SPEAKER_0:  something that I wrote in my first book and

01:56:10,466 --> 01:56:12,414
SPEAKER_0:  Part of it is the reason why I wrote it.

01:56:12,898 --> 01:56:15,230
SPEAKER_0:  just because I felt that there were messages.

01:56:15,586 --> 01:56:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  in my path.

01:56:17,730 --> 01:56:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  Oftentimes teenagers are troubled. It can be one way or another. Or if it's not a troubled teenage, you have times in your life where you doubt, where you know, you're just waving your arm and say...

01:56:29,954 --> 01:56:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  What's the purpose? What's the reason? Why carry on?

01:56:33,314 --> 01:56:33,854
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:56:34,466 --> 01:56:36,222
SPEAKER_0:  when I see all the things that I'm doing.

01:56:36,866 --> 01:56:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  the dream that I was able to fulfill.

01:56:40,450 --> 01:56:42,078
SPEAKER_0:  What a waste it would have been.

01:56:42,370 --> 01:56:42,814
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

01:56:43,362 --> 01:56:46,942
SPEAKER_1:  So there was a point in your life where you...

01:56:47,426 --> 01:56:48,926
SPEAKER_1:  thought about suicide. It's like a

01:56:49,826 --> 01:56:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  And I did more than thinking about it.

01:56:52,418 --> 01:56:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  But I was a lyrical one.

01:56:54,466 --> 01:56:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  For some reason I'm still here, I still don't know why.

01:56:57,346 --> 01:57:01,886
SPEAKER_0:  but I'm still here. And the lesson for me was that never, ever again.

01:57:02,114 --> 01:57:03,038
SPEAKER_0:  because

01:57:03,298 --> 01:57:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  You have to give tomorrow a chance. You never can think.

01:57:07,490 --> 01:57:08,702
SPEAKER_0:  about tomorrow.

01:57:09,186 --> 01:57:10,846
SPEAKER_0:  in the terms of the present.

01:57:11,202 --> 01:57:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  You never know what can happen. You know what is going to happen if you go.

01:57:15,330 --> 01:57:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  through.

01:57:16,642 --> 01:57:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  what you want to do.

01:57:17,890 --> 01:57:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  Tomorrow's never happening.

01:57:19,522 --> 01:57:24,446
SPEAKER_0:  You know, and I had, I had a, the other lessons came a few years later.

01:57:24,898 --> 01:57:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  We're actually.

01:57:26,178 --> 01:57:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  Somebody was drowning in a wind.

01:57:27,746 --> 01:57:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  after that person. I almost died that day too, not that I wanted to, but it's just because the conditions were very, very difficult.

01:57:35,650 --> 01:57:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  that person.

01:57:37,122 --> 01:57:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  died from there, although we took him out of the water.

01:57:41,090 --> 01:57:48,574
SPEAKER_0:  But I had a lot of difficulty coming out. I came out, but then I thought a lot about that guy. He was in his 30s.

01:57:49,090 --> 01:57:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:57:49,954 --> 01:57:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  It was like a sort of an echo from a few years.

01:57:53,762 --> 01:57:54,366
SPEAKER_0:  before.

01:57:54,818 --> 01:57:58,110
SPEAKER_0:  telling me that person would never have a tomorrow.

01:57:58,434 --> 01:58:03,070
SPEAKER_0:  that person would never be able to fulfill his dream or even have dreams of any kind.

01:58:03,970 --> 01:58:07,710
SPEAKER_0:  And I was here and I was going to give myself the best chance.

01:58:07,970 --> 01:58:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  fulfill all the dreams I wanted to and go after all the questions I wanted to.

01:58:12,610 --> 01:58:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  And this is what gets me going now, you know?

01:58:15,746 --> 01:58:16,254
SPEAKER_1:  So...

01:58:16,514 --> 01:58:19,358
SPEAKER_1:  The advice there is even if you don't see a Y.

01:58:20,834 --> 01:58:23,230
SPEAKER_1:  an answer to the why question, why live.

01:58:23,490 --> 01:58:24,414
SPEAKER_1:  today.

01:58:25,442 --> 01:58:26,686
SPEAKER_0:  Give tomorrow a chance.

01:58:27,106 --> 01:58:27,646
SPEAKER_0:  always.

01:58:29,186 --> 01:58:30,398
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think about your...

01:58:31,522 --> 01:58:34,046
SPEAKER_1:  death today? Do you think about your mortality?

01:58:35,778 --> 01:58:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  Thanks for watching!

01:58:36,962 --> 01:58:37,886
SPEAKER_0:  Not really.

01:58:38,242 --> 01:58:40,117
SPEAKER_1:  You've been so close with it. Yeahings

01:58:40,117 --> 01:58:41,662
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, we know that.

01:58:41,986 --> 01:58:43,710
SPEAKER_0:  part of life and you know what?

01:58:43,970 --> 01:58:47,102
SPEAKER_0:  If something happens to me while I'm doing the stuff I love...

01:58:48,066 --> 01:58:49,022
SPEAKER_0:  What a way of going!

01:58:50,210 --> 01:58:51,230
SPEAKER_0:  This will happen.

01:58:51,490 --> 01:58:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  wherever it is.

01:58:52,866 --> 01:58:53,630
SPEAKER_0:  catches me.

01:58:54,114 --> 01:58:58,718
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, I don't care, it will be what it will be. And I had the best.

01:58:59,010 --> 01:59:00,574
SPEAKER_0:  We were masters for that.

01:59:01,698 --> 01:59:02,590
SPEAKER_0:  I had my husband.

01:59:03,106 --> 01:59:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  My husband and I were 44 years apart.

01:59:05,890 --> 01:59:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  in age.

01:59:07,170 --> 01:59:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  and it was just a pure love story.

01:59:10,402 --> 01:59:11,838
SPEAKER_0:  and it never

01:59:12,130 --> 01:59:13,022
SPEAKER_0:  Look at his age.

01:59:13,602 --> 01:59:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  never thought about himself.

01:59:16,578 --> 01:59:17,758
SPEAKER_0:  or define himself.

01:59:18,178 --> 01:59:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  by his age. In fact, he reinvented the life for himself.

01:59:21,858 --> 01:59:25,214
SPEAKER_0:  At an age where everybody retires, we met when he was 66.

01:59:25,858 --> 01:59:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:59:26,882 --> 01:59:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  That was a blessing!

01:59:28,450 --> 01:59:33,214
SPEAKER_0:  And a curse, but a blessing most of it, because we took every single day as if it was the last.

01:59:33,730 --> 01:59:34,974
SPEAKER_0:  So we enjoyed life.

01:59:35,938 --> 01:59:36,926
SPEAKER_0:  And right now.

01:59:38,690 --> 01:59:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  It's not so much, you know, I have to really think of him. It just passed away.

01:59:43,970 --> 01:59:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  this August, last August.

01:59:46,370 --> 01:59:47,646
SPEAKER_0:  And for me...

01:59:48,002 --> 01:59:49,086
SPEAKER_0:  It's more like...

01:59:49,410 --> 01:59:50,750
SPEAKER_0:  I have to draw.

01:59:51,042 --> 01:59:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  from

01:59:52,130 --> 01:59:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  is example.

01:59:53,762 --> 01:59:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  on him always telling me.

01:59:57,378 --> 01:59:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  Look forward.

01:59:59,074 --> 02:00:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  Trust Life.

02:00:01,314 --> 02:00:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  Be happy.

02:00:02,850 --> 02:00:03,358
SPEAKER_0:  Live.

02:00:04,418 --> 02:00:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  You know what?

02:00:05,122 --> 02:00:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  Today, every single day.

02:00:07,042 --> 02:00:09,342
SPEAKER_0:  I have to remind several times a day.

02:00:09,634 --> 02:00:11,102
SPEAKER_0:  of this, it's not easy.

02:00:11,714 --> 02:00:13,310
SPEAKER_0:  But he had the recipe.

02:00:13,602 --> 02:00:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  He never thought about death.

02:00:15,458 --> 02:00:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  Because when you start thinking too much about death, that prevents you from living.

02:00:21,666 --> 02:00:22,238
SPEAKER_0:  Do you miss him?

02:00:23,426 --> 02:00:25,630
SPEAKER_0:  Gosh, we were so close, I think we were.

02:00:26,274 --> 02:00:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  It's more like...

02:00:28,354 --> 02:00:33,598
SPEAKER_0:  One spirit in two bodies. We were that close. So missing him doesn't even cut it.

02:00:34,370 --> 02:00:35,550
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's.

02:00:37,794 --> 02:00:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  It's the toughest mountain I ever climbed.

02:00:41,858 --> 02:00:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  What's the role of love in the human condition?

02:00:45,506 --> 02:00:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  I think, I hope.

02:00:47,746 --> 02:00:53,182
SPEAKER_0:  that this is the force that drives the universe, although, you know, we might be experiencing the other side of it.

02:00:53,666 --> 02:00:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe just to learn.

02:00:55,074 --> 02:00:56,382
SPEAKER_0:  how important love is.

02:00:56,898 --> 02:00:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  That might be it.

02:00:58,146 --> 02:00:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

02:00:59,138 --> 02:00:59,742
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:01:00,546 --> 02:01:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  For me?

02:01:02,786 --> 02:01:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  my experience with my husband where I never had to.

02:01:06,850 --> 02:01:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  Wake up every...

02:01:08,162 --> 02:01:08,926
SPEAKER_0:  single morning.

02:01:09,474 --> 02:01:11,102
SPEAKER_0:  Ever wondering if I was in love?

02:01:11,714 --> 02:01:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  I had to look.

02:01:13,090 --> 02:01:13,918
SPEAKER_0:  In his eyes.

02:01:14,882 --> 02:01:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  and Lim looking back at me.

02:01:16,546 --> 02:01:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  know it.

02:01:18,018 --> 02:01:18,462
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

02:01:18,978 --> 02:01:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  So when you get to that point where you don't question it anymore, I would hope for humanity to reach that point.

02:01:26,530 --> 02:01:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  where you can feel the same love for the person.

02:01:30,274 --> 02:01:31,870
SPEAKER_0:  that is unknown in the street.

02:01:32,418 --> 02:01:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  that you feel for the people you love. I think that at that point, we are going to be reaching.

02:01:38,274 --> 02:01:41,822
SPEAKER_0:  the maturity of that civilization we are hoping for and seeing.

02:01:42,402 --> 02:01:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  the universe through love.

02:01:44,994 --> 02:01:45,438
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

02:01:46,402 --> 02:01:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  That doesn't run spacecrafts.

02:01:48,290 --> 02:01:48,702
SPEAKER_0:  course.

02:01:49,442 --> 02:01:49,950
SPEAKER_0:  But...

02:01:50,818 --> 02:01:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  putting love into our intent of going into.

02:01:54,274 --> 02:01:59,230
SPEAKER_0:  and settling into another planet instead of, oh my God, we need to escape because we are.

02:01:59,714 --> 02:02:02,814
SPEAKER_0:  Freaking messing up with our own planet.

02:02:03,266 --> 02:02:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:02:04,130 --> 02:02:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  I think that this is the answer to so many things.

02:02:09,922 --> 02:02:11,262
SPEAKER_1:  Is there a part of you?

02:02:12,098 --> 02:02:14,142
SPEAKER_1:  that maybe just a little bit.

02:02:14,850 --> 02:02:16,638
SPEAKER_1:  wants to step foot on Mars?

02:02:16,898 --> 02:02:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  Like you personally.

02:02:18,338 --> 02:02:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  Oh yeah, of course, I'm curious. I'm a scientist and I've been working on Mars.

02:02:23,042 --> 02:02:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  I was actually privileged to be working on Gusev Crater and deciding for the landing site of the Spirit Rover, which means that I worked on that landing site for 15 years and I got to see it from the ground.

02:02:35,778 --> 02:02:37,150
SPEAKER_0:  That's the closest.

02:02:37,378 --> 02:02:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  you know, to being there and exploring. Of course, that's not phys-

02:02:41,026 --> 02:02:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  be present there.

02:02:42,818 --> 02:02:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:02:43,714 --> 02:02:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  If you were giving me the opportunity, of course I would go, but I know...

02:02:47,746 --> 02:02:48,254
SPEAKER_0:  one thing.

02:02:49,026 --> 02:02:50,078
SPEAKER_0:  I would want to come back.

02:02:52,098 --> 02:02:53,790
SPEAKER_1:  So given the option.

02:02:54,498 --> 02:02:55,998
SPEAKER_1:  of dying on Mars.

02:02:56,802 --> 02:02:58,046
SPEAKER_1:  or dying on earth.

02:02:58,818 --> 02:03:02,622
SPEAKER_1:  You'd visit Mars, but you would like to spend your last days here. Yep.

02:03:02,818 --> 02:03:04,734
SPEAKER_0:  because of a number of things.

02:03:05,698 --> 02:03:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  I think that

02:03:07,426 --> 02:03:09,310
SPEAKER_0:  First we are not ready to set on Mars.

02:03:09,794 --> 02:03:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  regardless of what being said.

02:03:12,642 --> 02:03:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  It will happen.

02:03:13,634 --> 02:03:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  It will happen and because we are explorers, humans, you know, they're explorers. So this will happen.

02:03:19,138 --> 02:03:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  And it's a good thing. Depending on how we go about this, it can be a very good thing.

02:03:24,834 --> 02:03:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  You know, with time, as much as I've been exploring, continue to explore the big questions of...

02:03:30,434 --> 02:03:33,662
SPEAKER_0:  the original nature of life or exploring of a planet.

02:03:34,466 --> 02:03:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  The love, you are talking about love.

02:03:36,706 --> 02:03:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  The love for my own planet.

02:03:39,202 --> 02:03:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  has grown deeper.

02:03:41,282 --> 02:03:43,710
SPEAKER_0:  and my concern about it has grown deeper.

02:03:44,130 --> 02:03:46,206
SPEAKER_0:  So the data that I'm collecting.

02:03:46,466 --> 02:03:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  to learn about.

02:03:47,938 --> 02:03:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  other planets. I'm also using it to understand better our home planet.

02:03:52,482 --> 02:03:55,710
SPEAKER_0:  and trying to make it a little better for the next generation.

02:03:56,258 --> 02:03:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:03:57,186 --> 02:03:57,694
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:03:58,338 --> 02:04:00,734
SPEAKER_0:  If you were talking about love, this is love that would...

02:04:01,122 --> 02:04:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  drive me back here.

02:04:03,266 --> 02:04:04,382
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, this planet.

02:04:05,122 --> 02:04:05,790
SPEAKER_1:  It's just...

02:04:06,338 --> 02:04:08,094
SPEAKER_1:  Sometimes I just pause.

02:04:08,354 --> 02:04:11,134
SPEAKER_1:  and M&R at the incredible thing we have here.

02:04:11,714 --> 02:04:12,158
SPEAKER_1:  and just.

02:04:12,578 --> 02:04:14,622
SPEAKER_1:  And I have deep gratitude for...

02:04:15,138 --> 02:04:16,670
SPEAKER_1:  all the life forms here.

02:04:17,410 --> 02:04:21,118
SPEAKER_1:  The beautiful complexity, of course there's darkness behind it.

02:04:21,378 --> 02:04:22,302
SPEAKER_1:  All the death.

02:04:22,658 --> 02:04:24,190
SPEAKER_1:  or the extinction that led.

02:04:24,866 --> 02:04:25,918
SPEAKER_1:  up to

02:04:26,306 --> 02:04:30,814
SPEAKER_1:  us two descendants of Ape sitting here today. I feel that's a responsibility.

02:04:31,458 --> 02:04:33,086
SPEAKER_1:  We're the fittest that survived.

02:04:33,442 --> 02:04:34,558
SPEAKER_0:  Exactly right!

02:04:34,978 --> 02:04:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  as the

02:04:37,474 --> 02:04:41,438
SPEAKER_0:  dominant species at least, you know, technologically, etc.

02:04:42,082 --> 02:04:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe not.

02:04:43,234 --> 02:04:48,702
SPEAKER_0:  the wisest one, but the dominant species, we have a responsibility towards the entire biosphere.

02:04:49,250 --> 02:04:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  because the

02:04:50,146 --> 02:04:51,710
SPEAKER_0:  Decisions we are making now.

02:04:52,482 --> 02:04:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  None of you affect us.

02:04:54,594 --> 02:04:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  They're affecting.

02:04:56,354 --> 02:04:57,598
SPEAKER_0:  the entire biosphere.

02:04:57,858 --> 02:04:59,998
