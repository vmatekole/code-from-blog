00:00:00,098 --> 00:00:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  Narcissism is not arrogance. Narcissism is the opposite.

00:00:03,522 --> 00:00:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  of arrogance. There is such a deep sense of inadequacy.

00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  and incompetence in the self.

00:00:10,818 --> 00:00:13,854
SPEAKER_0:  that the defensive structure around that.

00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:17,406
SPEAKER_0:  becomes dominated by rocket fueled.

00:00:17,922 --> 00:00:18,302
SPEAKER_0:  ENVY.

00:00:21,858 --> 00:00:24,254
SPEAKER_1:  The following is a conversation with Paul Conte.

00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,454
SPEAKER_1:  a psychiatrist, and a brilliant scholar of human nature.

00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:28,734
SPEAKER_1:  My friend.

00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,046
SPEAKER_1:  Andrew Huberman

00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:33,278
SPEAKER_1:  told me that Paul and I absolutely must meet and talk.

00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:38,046
SPEAKER_1:  Not just about the topic of trauma, which Paul wrote an amazing book about.

00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:39,838
SPEAKER_1:  but broadly about human nature.

00:00:40,162 --> 00:00:42,654
SPEAKER_1:  narcissism, sociopathy, psychopathy.

00:00:42,978 --> 00:00:43,710
SPEAKER_1:  Good and Evil.

00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,054
SPEAKER_1:  Hate and love.

00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:46,718
SPEAKER_1:  happiness and envy.

00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:47,966
SPEAKER_1:  As usual...

00:00:48,194 --> 00:00:49,086
SPEAKER_1:  Andrew was right.

00:00:49,346 --> 00:00:50,974
SPEAKER_1:  This was a fascinating conversation.

00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:52,670
SPEAKER_1:  as the old meme goes.

00:00:52,898 --> 00:00:55,742
SPEAKER_1:  one does not simply doubt the advice of Andrew Huberman.

00:00:56,834 --> 00:00:58,398
SPEAKER_1:  Allow me to also quickly mention.

00:00:58,882 --> 00:01:01,822
SPEAKER_1:  that I disagree with Paul a bunch in this episode.

00:01:02,274 --> 00:01:04,702
SPEAKER_1:  as I do in other episodes, even with exports.

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,614
SPEAKER_1:  in part for fun and in part because I think

00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,774
SPEAKER_1:  The tension of ideas and conversation is what creates insights and wisdom.

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,870
SPEAKER_1:  My goal is to always empathize, understand, and explore ideas of the person.

00:01:16,226 --> 00:01:17,278
SPEAKER_1:  sitting across from me.

00:01:17,826 --> 00:01:21,246
SPEAKER_1:  Disagreement is just one of the ways I think it's fun to do just that.

00:01:21,762 --> 00:01:23,422
SPEAKER_1:  As long as I do so.

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,526
SPEAKER_1:  from a place of curiosity and compassion.

00:01:27,362 --> 00:01:29,054
SPEAKER_1:  This is the Lex Freedman Podcast.

00:01:29,282 --> 00:01:31,934
SPEAKER_1:  To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:01:32,386 --> 00:01:33,726
SPEAKER_1:  And now, dear friends.

00:01:34,146 --> 00:01:34,782
SPEAKER_1:  Here's Paul.

00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:35,710
SPEAKER_1:  Conti.

00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:43,363
SPEAKER_1:  Do you see psychiatry as fundamentally a study of the human mind and not just a set of tools for treating psychological spanning?

00:01:43,363 --> 00:01:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  Absolutely. I think psychiatry is our best way.

00:01:46,914 --> 00:01:48,446
SPEAKER_0:  to understand who we are as

00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:50,750
SPEAKER_0:  It looks at our biology.

00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  How does our brain work? How does it connect the parts with one another? How does the chemistry in it work?

00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,398
SPEAKER_0:  It's the very foundational aspects of.

00:01:58,722 --> 00:02:00,510
SPEAKER_0:  who we are and then it manifests as

00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:04,958
SPEAKER_0:  psychology, what do we think, what do we feel, what are our strivings, what are our fears?

00:02:05,282 --> 00:02:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  So yeah, I think psychiatry provides.

00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  tools that we can use to help each other, but those tools come through it being a discipline of understanding.

00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:15,134
SPEAKER_1:  So with every

00:02:15,874 --> 00:02:18,494
SPEAKER_1:  patient you see with every mind you explore.

00:02:18,914 --> 00:02:21,342
SPEAKER_1:  Are you picking up a deeper understanding of the human mind?

00:02:22,786 --> 00:02:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  I think I'm trying to, I think we should learn.

00:02:25,282 --> 00:02:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  should be able to.

00:02:26,242 --> 00:02:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  take something away from.

00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:29,406
SPEAKER_0:  everything we do, you know, every...

00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,541
SPEAKER_0:  interaction to some small degree.

00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:32,254
SPEAKER_1:  conversation.

00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:34,462
SPEAKER_1:  It doesn't have to be a patient, just anywhere.

00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:36,414
SPEAKER_1:  at Starbucks, getting a coffee.

00:02:36,738 --> 00:02:38,622
SPEAKER_1:  You can learn something from that little experience.

00:02:38,786 --> 00:02:40,734
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, even if you just reinforce sort of-

00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:43,166
SPEAKER_0:  gentle kindness and gratitude and

00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,062
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  decent human interaction. There's a reinforcement of that, that even if we don't take away memories or lessons, so to speak, we can reinforce who we choose to be.

00:02:53,346 --> 00:02:58,398
SPEAKER_1:  So understanding ourselves from those interactions too, not just the general sort of philosophical human mind, but

00:02:59,298 --> 00:03:00,318
SPEAKER_1:  understanding our own.

00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,214
SPEAKER_1:  mind.

00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:03,038
SPEAKER_1:  introspect.

00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,990
SPEAKER_1:  and how our own mind works.

00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,574
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, because everything we understand about anyone or anything else...

00:03:08,962 --> 00:03:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  is coming through here, right? So

00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, or understanding others where.

00:03:13,602 --> 00:03:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  We're also understanding ourselves, it's all feeding.

00:03:17,122 --> 00:03:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  through us.

00:03:17,826 --> 00:03:20,830
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, but it's a tricky thing to step away and look at your mind.

00:03:22,274 --> 00:03:23,966
SPEAKER_1:  and understand that it's just a machine.

00:03:24,674 --> 00:03:28,574
SPEAKER_1:  and you can kind of control the way the machine processes the external environment.

00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:30,494
SPEAKER_1:  and the way that

00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:34,526
SPEAKER_1:  machine converts the things it perceives into actual emotions.

00:03:35,074 --> 00:03:37,502
SPEAKER_1:  Like how it interprets the things it perceives.

00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,606
SPEAKER_1:  You just sort of step away and analyze it in that way.

00:03:41,186 --> 00:03:42,750
SPEAKER_1:  and then you can control it. You can...

00:03:43,586 --> 00:03:47,102
SPEAKER_1:  you can oil the machine, you can control how it actually interprets the perceptions.

00:03:47,426 --> 00:03:49,182
SPEAKER_1:  in order to generate positive emotions.

00:03:49,698 --> 00:03:51,838
SPEAKER_1:  and be like a, what is it, like a mechanic.

00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:53,310
SPEAKER_1:  for the...

00:03:53,698 --> 00:03:54,878
SPEAKER_1:  for the gears in the machine.

00:03:55,682 --> 00:03:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I think to some degree, to some degree, a bit.

00:03:58,178 --> 00:04:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  The difference, I think, at least as I.

00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,582
SPEAKER_0:  Understand I think of machines as not being

00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  inscrutable.

00:04:04,898 --> 00:04:06,942
SPEAKER_0:  Right, that if there's enough.

00:04:07,394 --> 00:04:09,694
SPEAKER_0:  study there's enough acumen applied

00:04:10,018 --> 00:04:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  that

00:04:10,722 --> 00:04:14,366
SPEAKER_0:  we can understand whatever it is we're trying to figure out. Where as

00:04:14,594 --> 00:04:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  part of understanding ourselves.

00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:19,070
SPEAKER_0:  is understanding that there are things we can't understand.

00:04:19,554 --> 00:04:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that's.

00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  That's.

00:04:22,114 --> 00:04:23,806
SPEAKER_0:  Indispensably important.

00:04:24,258 --> 00:04:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  to health and happiness and also.

00:04:26,658 --> 00:04:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  to having enough humility to see.

00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  how people can be different from us, how we can be different from ourselves.

00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  at times, so knowing that we don't know.

00:04:36,802 --> 00:04:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  A lot.

00:04:37,762 --> 00:04:41,182
SPEAKER_0:  and having some idea of what that might be, I think is.

00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  an indispensable part of the process, which I think is different from machines.

00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:50,590
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, the machines, you're basically saying machines generally because they're engineered.

00:04:51,298 --> 00:04:53,406
SPEAKER_1:  from a design, they're usually going to be simpler.

00:04:53,698 --> 00:04:54,718
SPEAKER_1:  therefore understandable.

00:04:55,298 --> 00:04:58,174
SPEAKER_1:  And you're saying the complexity of the human mind is...

00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,150
SPEAKER_1:  at least from our perspective, nearly infinite.

00:05:01,986 --> 00:05:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  Is there a meta-phenomena, what sometimes gets described as sort of levels of emergence where at increasing levels of complexity?

00:05:09,314 --> 00:05:16,798
SPEAKER_0:  you have novelty evolve that you can't predict from lower levels of complexity. Like for example,

00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,262
SPEAKER_0:  atoms to molecules. It's just one.

00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,406
SPEAKER_0:  example. I think

00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:25,630
SPEAKER_0:  neurons to consciousness, consciousness to culture.

00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:29,470
SPEAKER_0:  Right? Meta phenomena that separate from the phenomenon.

00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,422
SPEAKER_0:  for the phenomena underneath of them.

00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:35,614
SPEAKER_0:  and thereby add an entire aspect of novelty.

00:05:35,906 --> 00:05:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  So I think we are.

00:05:38,114 --> 00:05:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I really think this is true that we are all infinitely fascinating because of these levels of emergence of novelty that are inscrutable because you can't predict from one level.

00:05:47,298 --> 00:05:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  to the next or understand.

00:05:49,218 --> 00:05:50,750
SPEAKER_0:  fully are what make us.

00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  And not just us, but I think sentient creatures, human beings, but sentient creatures, inestimably more.

00:05:58,562 --> 00:06:02,814
SPEAKER_0:  interesting than creatures that aren't sentient. And I don't know, I think when...

00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  When we think about machine learning and artificial intelligence, I think it's that.

00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:10,206
SPEAKER_0:  that we're trying to create levels of emergence that now.

00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  we don't fully understand.

00:06:12,642 --> 00:06:15,390
SPEAKER_0:  anymore, which I guess is both exciting and maybe scary too.

00:06:16,802 --> 00:06:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so you started the physics of atoms.

00:06:19,682 --> 00:06:21,182
SPEAKER_1:  quantum mechanics.

00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,646
SPEAKER_1:  go into chemistry, go into biology.

00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:30,526
SPEAKER_1:  from the biology, you have the functional phenomena, especially as manifested in the human brain. Then

00:06:30,914 --> 00:06:35,582
SPEAKER_1:  Multiple brains connecting together through consciousness and intelligence creates civilizations.

00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,270
SPEAKER_1:  It's pretty interesting. Where do you think the magic is?

00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:39,774
SPEAKER_1:  at which layer of the cake.

00:06:40,386 --> 00:06:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  every layer.

00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  because every time you emerge from one thing to another, I see it as an analog with the concept of the dialect.

00:06:47,778 --> 00:06:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  right, where I think it was Hegel, right, who...

00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  who realized...

00:06:51,938 --> 00:06:53,150
SPEAKER_0:  Hey, when you have like...

00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,990
SPEAKER_0:  thing A and thing B and they're complicated and they come together.

00:06:57,346 --> 00:07:03,006
SPEAKER_0:  you don't get a hybrid of A and B, right? You end up getting something that's new, that's novel.

00:07:03,426 --> 00:07:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that...

00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:08,830
SPEAKER_0:  describes to some degree that like what emergence is.

00:07:09,122 --> 00:07:10,494
SPEAKER_0:  except there's

00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:14,142
SPEAKER_0:  There's a whole new, it's a universe of novelty.

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  That comes in each layer of.

00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:20,286
SPEAKER_0:  emergence that allows infinite possibilities that weren't.

00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:24,254
SPEAKER_0:  possible before and I think that's why we're so complicated that we're our

00:07:24,706 --> 00:07:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  functional neuroscience, right, which I think is psychology, right, our ability to think about ourselves, about others, to be reflective.

00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  is sitting on top of.

00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:33,630
SPEAKER_0:  So many.

00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  layers of emergence, like the idea of standing on the shoulders of giants that we're...

00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  You know, each of us, our consciousness is standing on the shoulder of a giant.

00:07:42,658 --> 00:07:43,166
SPEAKER_0:  of

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  Many many many...

00:07:45,154 --> 00:07:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  levels of emergence, of novelty.

00:07:47,522 --> 00:07:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  so many of which we don't understand. I mean, about subatomic particles, everything that quantum physics means, when does time become important?

00:07:55,554 --> 00:07:57,118
SPEAKER_0:  right, as opposed to.

00:07:57,378 --> 00:07:59,870
SPEAKER_0:  things happening outside of time and outside of space.

00:08:00,194 --> 00:08:01,822
SPEAKER_0:  When do we slide into one?

00:08:02,146 --> 00:08:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  temporal perspective and then the complexity just I think grows and grows and grows.

00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:07,911
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, the interesting.

00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:09,310
SPEAKER_1:  where he uses novelty.

00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,214
SPEAKER_1:  If true, this really blows my mind.

00:08:13,986 --> 00:08:16,606
SPEAKER_1:  either shallow or deep sense, it is true.

00:08:17,026 --> 00:08:17,918
SPEAKER_1:  trying to figure that out.

00:08:18,306 --> 00:08:21,758
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if you know something about cellular automata, it's this very simple

00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:27,774
SPEAKER_1:  mathematical objects where you have rules that govern each individual little cell and they interact locally.

00:08:28,002 --> 00:08:31,582
SPEAKER_1:  and that you understand the very simple operation of those individual cells but

00:08:32,194 --> 00:08:36,382
SPEAKER_1:  add another layer of abstraction when you just kind of zoom out with blurry vision.

00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,822
SPEAKER_1:  this.

00:08:38,114 --> 00:08:40,158
SPEAKER_1:  matter object starts appearing that.

00:08:40,514 --> 00:08:41,662
SPEAKER_1:  function you could build.

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:46,590
SPEAKER_1:  a torrent machine where they can build arbitrary complexity of compute of

00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,574
SPEAKER_1:  of computation on top of this kind of.

00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:49,982
SPEAKER_1:  Very simple object.

00:08:50,434 --> 00:08:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  Yes. Questioning question whether.

00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,262
SPEAKER_1:  That was always there.

00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,790
SPEAKER_1:  the arms

00:08:58,882 --> 00:09:00,414
SPEAKER_1:  somehow know about love.

00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:01,150
SPEAKER_1:  Right?

00:09:01,506 --> 00:09:03,966
SPEAKER_1:  like about consciousness.

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,550
SPEAKER_1:  about war and violence and evil and hate and all that.

00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:12,414
SPEAKER_1:  that's already laid in, the possibility of that, the capacity for that's already in the atoms.

00:09:12,962 --> 00:09:14,750
SPEAKER_1:  It's already in the physics, it's already in the...

00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:20,286
SPEAKER_1:  in all the different chemistry that builds up. And it's like even the origin of life.

00:09:21,058 --> 00:09:21,982
SPEAKER_1:  Still a mystery.

00:09:22,498 --> 00:09:23,006
SPEAKER_1:  That's.

00:09:23,618 --> 00:09:24,542
SPEAKER_1:  That's known.

00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:25,886
SPEAKER_1:  That's in the physics.

00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:26,686
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

00:09:26,978 --> 00:09:29,150
SPEAKER_1:  That's known to the universe, the basic...

00:09:29,474 --> 00:09:31,454
SPEAKER_1:  background physics in the universe.

00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,918
SPEAKER_1:  Because if this is that's not the case

00:09:34,594 --> 00:09:36,606
SPEAKER_1:  It's like, where does that come from? Where's that magic?

00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,454
SPEAKER_1:  And how many layers can the cake possibly have?

00:09:40,002 --> 00:09:41,182
SPEAKER_1:  How many are we gonna keep building?

00:09:41,634 --> 00:09:45,982
SPEAKER_1:  If we're constantly through this process of abstraction.

00:09:46,626 --> 00:09:49,502
SPEAKER_1:  of adding a layer to the cake, adding novel things.

00:09:50,274 --> 00:09:51,230
SPEAKER_1:  Like where's the ceiling?

00:09:53,122 --> 00:09:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  as we expand out into the cosmos.

00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,598
SPEAKER_1:  if we successfully can do that, are we gonna keep building like-

00:09:58,274 --> 00:10:00,158
SPEAKER_1:  more miraculous complex.

00:10:00,578 --> 00:10:02,782
SPEAKER_1:  objects and then the brain is just like a

00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:04,222
SPEAKER_1:  middle layer.

00:10:04,994 --> 00:10:08,094
SPEAKER_1:  We tend to think of ourselves as truly, truly special.

00:10:08,578 --> 00:10:12,958
SPEAKER_1:  manifestations of what's possible in the universe, but maybe we're just like the basic like-

00:10:13,698 --> 00:10:15,614
SPEAKER_1:  tiny building block or something much much

00:10:16,098 --> 00:10:17,950
SPEAKER_1:  much bigger. We're in the early days of

00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,358
SPEAKER_1:  being a brick.

00:10:19,874 --> 00:10:21,214
SPEAKER_0:  and a very large building.

00:10:22,658 --> 00:10:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  I think that's entirely...

00:10:24,194 --> 00:10:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I think...

00:10:25,954 --> 00:10:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  The only-

00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:35,390
SPEAKER_0:  emergent thing, so to speak, that we build this culture, right? The aggregation of us. So you have individual human minds.

00:10:35,874 --> 00:10:36,414
SPEAKER_0:  Which...

00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  You are entirely

00:10:38,562 --> 00:10:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, even the fact that time is different for you and me, right? Maybe by picoseconds, right?

00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  We

00:10:45,634 --> 00:10:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  can engage because our.

00:10:48,418 --> 00:10:55,230
SPEAKER_0:  perceptions of time are parallel enough, they're close enough, right, that we can share a reality, right? But we're all living.

00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:57,598
SPEAKER_0:  in a different dimension of time.

00:10:57,826 --> 00:11:00,510
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, we know that, right? So we're unique.

00:11:00,802 --> 00:11:02,334
SPEAKER_0:  in that way and then.

00:11:02,658 --> 00:11:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  the unique individuals that we are, just like the cells, start to create.

00:11:07,682 --> 00:11:11,102
SPEAKER_0:  not just one thing, not just a culture, but culture on top of

00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  hour.

00:11:12,386 --> 00:11:20,190
SPEAKER_0:  individuality, right? Our uniqueness, our even dimensional uniqueness of time and experience and consciousness.

00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,686
SPEAKER_0:  So we create cultures on top of us.

00:11:23,746 --> 00:11:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  what could be beyond culture, right? and what

00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  is.

00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:36,958
SPEAKER_0:  different from us either on underlying levels like quantum physics or chemistry or biology or entirely different and unconceived I think is.

00:11:37,538 --> 00:11:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  It's an immense.

00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:44,542
SPEAKER_0:  question and I think it's one that should create humility in us, right? Look how much we don't know.

00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  and then how reckless we are.

00:11:46,626 --> 00:11:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  with ourselves, with our resources, with...

00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  with

00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:55,966
SPEAKER_0:  human life. And I think there it's important to say, think about how entropy rules.

00:11:56,802 --> 00:11:59,038
SPEAKER_0:  the universe around us. I mean, how over-

00:11:59,362 --> 00:12:01,534
SPEAKER_0:  selected are we? How many?

00:12:01,826 --> 00:12:02,398
SPEAKER_0:  Not just...

00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  hundreds or thousands of times, but how many millions of times does there have to be a selection branch point before

00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  we get into a sort of eddy pool of counter entropy, right? where you can begin to create.

00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:20,670
SPEAKER_0:  which I think is why you say, okay, do the atoms know about love, right?

00:12:20,898 --> 00:12:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  The- the- the-

00:12:21,794 --> 00:12:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  The fact that anything is being created, right, means there's this over-selection for counter entropy where there can be a building of...

00:12:29,506 --> 00:12:32,094
SPEAKER_0:  greater complexity of ultimately of

00:12:32,354 --> 00:12:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  novelty and we don't often think about.

00:12:34,562 --> 00:12:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  that of how far removed we are, maybe light years, so to speak.

00:12:39,682 --> 00:12:41,054
SPEAKER_0:  uh, from.

00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:48,542
SPEAKER_0:  any other location, temporally, physically in the universe where this could happen.

00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,462
SPEAKER_0:  We don't think about what does that.

00:12:51,362 --> 00:12:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  ME.

00:12:52,098 --> 00:12:53,502
SPEAKER_1:  Everything they just said love

00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:54,590
SPEAKER_1:  Everything.

00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,854
SPEAKER_1:  is counter entropy goes against the way.

00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:02,782
SPEAKER_1:  the basic physics of the universe. So maybe actually the atoms really don't like what we're doing.

00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,942
SPEAKER_1:  They want us to stop. They've been trying really hard to stop.

00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,702
SPEAKER_1:  and despite that we somehow

00:13:09,154 --> 00:13:11,779
SPEAKER_1:  uh... started this whole bacteria thing for for the bill

00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:12,894
SPEAKER_0:  million years and now we're here.

00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,206
SPEAKER_0:  I should think of it.

00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  Kind of the other way.

00:13:15,618 --> 00:13:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think there's any purpose to purposelessness, right? So why would anything be here if we...

00:13:22,882 --> 00:13:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  The drive weren't.

00:13:24,354 --> 00:13:24,990
SPEAKER_0:  chords.

00:13:26,914 --> 00:13:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  creativity, right? If it's a derived warrant towards those subatomic particles.

00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  not being nothingness that blips in and out of existence, right? Like we think is going on in empty space, you know, for light years upon light years, right? But is

00:13:40,258 --> 00:13:41,278
SPEAKER_0:  Is there...

00:13:41,602 --> 00:13:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  a design, either natural or intentional.

00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  for a schema, right, a scenario.

00:13:47,682 --> 00:13:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  that allows for the incredibly rare but not non-existent

00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  any pool of counter entropy where

00:13:55,362 --> 00:13:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  Good can happen, right? Good can happen, right?

00:13:57,122 --> 00:13:59,102
SPEAKER_0:  creativity can happen where ultimately

00:13:59,586 --> 00:14:01,662
SPEAKER_0:  something can grow, something novel.

00:14:02,178 --> 00:14:05,918
SPEAKER_0:  There's no novelty in the vastness of space even though there's not nothing.

00:14:06,466 --> 00:14:06,814
SPEAKER_0:  there.

00:14:07,394 --> 00:14:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  There's novelty here.

00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:18,174
SPEAKER_0:  because I think the layers of emergence start stacking very, very, very high when we're in a place of counter entropy.

00:14:18,594 --> 00:14:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  Which then.

00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  could provide.

00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  even thoughts about like good and evil, right? The idea that creating...

00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:29,726
SPEAKER_0:  that preserving is good, right? It's what we build upon. It's how we get to the eddy pool of counterenters.

00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  So then destruction is

00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,134
SPEAKER_0:  not good, what good comes of...

00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  aggression and destruction.

00:14:37,282 --> 00:14:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  Unless we're protecting, we can think of...

00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  outlying cases, but just think in general concepts, right? Stephen Ban мин wir wir «Sch cockro prevent»

00:14:44,994 --> 00:14:50,014
SPEAKER_0:  destroys, it brings us towards a state of entropy, towards a state of nothingness, whereas

00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  a goodness commonality collaboration, right?

00:14:55,234 --> 00:14:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  nurturing brings.

00:14:57,826 --> 00:15:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  novelty, it brings new existence into the universe. And I think we don't think about that. We're in the middle of something so vast and built on top of so many layers. And I think it leads us to be.

00:15:09,122 --> 00:15:09,694
SPEAKER_0:  Cavalier.

00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  You know, with, with...

00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:13,150
SPEAKER_0:  human life, including often our own.

00:15:14,082 --> 00:15:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  So you think this.

00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,470
SPEAKER_1:  There's an underlying creative force to the universe.

00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:19,198
SPEAKER_1:  that uh...

00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:21,118
SPEAKER_1:  that might even have a kind of...

00:15:22,274 --> 00:15:23,710
SPEAKER_1:  built in morality to it.

00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:24,670
SPEAKER_1:  Where?

00:15:25,506 --> 00:15:27,038
SPEAKER_1:  Creating is better than destroying.

00:15:27,906 --> 00:15:30,910
SPEAKER_1:  and then that somehow maps on to our society.

00:15:31,394 --> 00:15:33,534
SPEAKER_1:  Well, we kind of try to figure out what that actually means.

00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:35,262
SPEAKER_1:  in terms of good and evil.

00:15:35,842 --> 00:15:39,518
SPEAKER_1:  So there's that's some something is there like that. It's like panicking

00:15:39,842 --> 00:15:40,894
SPEAKER_1:  But it has to be.

00:15:41,922 --> 00:15:44,382
SPEAKER_1:  It's like so nice, it's so perfect, cause it's rare.

00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:53,310
SPEAKER_1:  It's sufficiently rare where we have our own space. Like you can close the door and say, I need to be alone right now as our human civilization to work on my thing.

00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:58,782
SPEAKER_1:  So sufficiently rare that there's not other alien civilizations. They're just like constantly knocking on our door destroying us.

00:15:59,362 --> 00:15:59,806
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

00:16:00,098 --> 00:16:01,150
SPEAKER_1:  but it still exists.

00:16:01,282 --> 00:16:01,886
SPEAKER_0:  That's weird.

00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,838
SPEAKER_0:  It's so fantastically improbable that I think we should be very.

00:16:08,226 --> 00:16:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  respectful of it. And I think you said there's a creative force that values creativity. Yes.

00:16:13,346 --> 00:16:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  Well sure, if it's a creative force, right?

00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  It's existence.

00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,742
SPEAKER_0:  its ability to exist and to create.

00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  comes from something other than entropy, right? Something other than so much dispersion that there's nothingness, right? So the creative force will value...

00:16:30,338 --> 00:16:35,422
SPEAKER_0:  sanctity of things, right? You know, keeping things together, not destroying things, right? Building...

00:16:35,714 --> 00:16:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  novelty, including novelty of knowledge, novelty of sentience. I mean, it fits.

00:16:41,122 --> 00:16:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  with the idea that we're not nothing, that that's incredibly improbable.

00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:49,342
SPEAKER_0:  and that there are these many, many layers of emergence that we're standing upon.

00:16:49,986 --> 00:16:52,798
SPEAKER_0:  And I think it tells us something that we're not.

00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  doing ourselves a service to ignore.

00:16:55,778 --> 00:16:57,790
SPEAKER_0:  It's not just a jump to saying.

00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,830
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, there's a religious answer to everything. No, it's saying.

00:17:02,114 --> 00:17:06,622
SPEAKER_0:  science isn't a god either, right? So if we think of science as a tool...

00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:11,678
SPEAKER_0:  and not as an endpoint in and of itself, what is the science telling us? like I remember

00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:14,814
SPEAKER_0:  showing up at medical school and it really is true. I mean, I knew...

00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  so little about the human body. I'd only been in hospitals to visit people. I'd taken pre-med classes, but sort of

00:17:21,346 --> 00:17:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  intensely at once after I didn't take any and I was working in business. I knew next to nothing and I had this idea that was so naive in retrospect that

00:17:30,498 --> 00:17:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  I was gonna learn so much, right? I was gonna answer these questions, because I was gonna learn what's going on in the body, what are these organs doing, what are these cells?

00:17:36,674 --> 00:17:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  And what I learned was...

00:17:39,874 --> 00:17:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  There was so much more that was amazing.

00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  mysterious and seemingly impossible, like even how a cell functions.

00:17:47,874 --> 00:17:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  Like what is going on inside of a cell, the transport mechanisms and...

00:17:51,714 --> 00:18:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  energy functions and diffusion functions, and then you can go down to smaller levels than that. But when you come back out and you say, how all those cells make a kidney?

00:18:01,026 --> 00:18:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  It's not.

00:18:02,722 --> 00:18:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  explanatory. I remember asking the OB who had delivered my first child. I was so amazed and I asked him like.

00:18:10,338 --> 00:18:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  What do you think? What do you know? You do this, right? You're seeing this life created and-

00:18:15,746 --> 00:18:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  You know, and his thought was...

00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  Nothing, I just marvel. I mean, I get to do this, but I just-

00:18:21,314 --> 00:18:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  Marvel at it and I think the more we know

00:18:24,962 --> 00:18:25,726
SPEAKER_0:  about us.

00:18:26,018 --> 00:18:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  the more we respectfully marvel.

00:18:29,058 --> 00:18:32,222
SPEAKER_1:  And we should do that. We should proactively marvel at every aspect.

00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:34,366
SPEAKER_1:  at every layer.

00:18:35,106 --> 00:18:38,270
SPEAKER_1:  that where the novelty emerges.

00:18:38,882 --> 00:18:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

00:18:39,522 --> 00:18:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  we'd be a lot less likely to say,

00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  hey, I don't like you because of something, whatever it is, you know, race, religion, culture.

00:18:46,242 --> 00:18:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  sexuality, gender identity, whatever it is, you know.

00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  I want rights that you don't have, right? Or I want what you have.

00:18:52,834 --> 00:19:02,558
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, there's so much of this and I understand it's driven by scarcity and by human insecurity and envy and all of these things that I think could drive us towards destruction.

00:19:02,786 --> 00:19:03,102
SPEAKER_0:  But-

00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,822
SPEAKER_0:  All of that recklessness comes from.

00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:13,918
SPEAKER_0:  not having this initial appreciation and respect that you're referring to and just marveling at, like, wow, okay, we're here.

00:19:14,466 --> 00:19:16,126
SPEAKER_0:  That's amazing. Let's start with that.

00:19:16,962 --> 00:19:18,238
SPEAKER_1:  But if we marvel at this...

00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,518
SPEAKER_1:  whole thing.

00:19:20,322 --> 00:19:24,638
SPEAKER_1:  the human project, the human condition, all the different kinds of human beings that are possible.

00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:27,102
SPEAKER_1:  What do you then make of that?

00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,638
SPEAKER_1:  some humans.

00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,718
SPEAKER_1:  do evil onto the world.

00:19:31,586 --> 00:19:34,174
SPEAKER_1:  First of all, are all human beings capable of evil?

00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,774
SPEAKER_1:  If we're in the process.

00:19:36,002 --> 00:19:38,526
SPEAKER_1:  Now we've got a little bit of momentum in terms of marvelling.

00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:39,998
SPEAKER_1:  the layers of the cake.

00:19:40,642 --> 00:19:43,774
SPEAKER_1:  Should we also marvel at the capacity for evil in all of us?

00:19:44,002 --> 00:19:46,302
SPEAKER_1:  Is that capacity there? I believe that it is.

00:19:46,754 --> 00:19:47,102
SPEAKER_1:  Yes.

00:19:47,426 --> 00:19:51,838
SPEAKER_1:  So what do we understand about the psychology of evil? Where does it originate in the human mind?

00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,950
SPEAKER_1:  Is it there in your biology?

00:19:54,274 --> 00:19:55,646
SPEAKER_1:  Is it there in the environment?

00:19:55,874 --> 00:19:56,638
SPEAKER_1:  Any upbringing?

00:19:56,898 --> 00:20:00,830
SPEAKER_0:  Can I clarify first? I think the capacity for evil, I do believe is in all of us.

00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,590
SPEAKER_0:  There's a difference between.

00:20:02,978 --> 00:20:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  enacting evil and

00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  and a suit of-

00:20:06,978 --> 00:20:07,614
SPEAKER_0:  preset

00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  followed developed plan of evil.

00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:13,150
SPEAKER_0:  Right, I don't believe that all of us are capable of doing.

00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:14,366
SPEAKER_0:  What?

00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  the people who perpetrate the most evil do.

00:20:17,442 --> 00:20:19,742
SPEAKER_0:  But I do believe that we're capable.

00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:20,414
SPEAKER_0:  of

00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:21,182
SPEAKER_0:  of.

00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,302
SPEAKER_0:  perpetrating evil.

00:20:22,562 --> 00:20:25,694
SPEAKER_0:  And the thought, one thought would be that...

00:20:25,922 --> 00:20:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  There are...

00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  drives in us. I mean, there certainly seem to be drives.

00:20:29,858 --> 00:20:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  in us towards.

00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:35,870
SPEAKER_0:  survival towards gratification, in some ways towards.

00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:41,598
SPEAKER_0:  and that can get very complicated because pleasure inside can be relief of distress.

00:20:41,954 --> 00:20:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  If I feel very badly about myself...

00:20:44,546 --> 00:20:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  and I can feel a little better about myself by making you feel worse about yourself, right? Which that plays out in a lot of human beings. Is that an indirect way of bringing pleasure, right? So it gets very complicated what's going on inside of us. And sometimes the perpetration of...

00:21:00,322 --> 00:21:05,118
SPEAKER_0:  Evil things can be through misunderstandings, anger, impulsivity. I mean, there are things that we can...

00:21:05,378 --> 00:21:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  that we can have.

00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:18,366
SPEAKER_0:  in us and other times there can be other things going on which are through the lens of unhealthy human psychology. So for example, the psychology of envy, which I think drives

00:21:18,818 --> 00:21:22,974
SPEAKER_0:  the lion's share of the orchestrated evil, right? There's a difference between...

00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:25,150
SPEAKER_0:  Impulsive reflexive.

00:21:26,434 --> 00:21:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  evil and

00:21:28,098 --> 00:21:31,646
SPEAKER_0:  highly orchestrated evil, which I think is driven by.

00:21:32,418 --> 00:21:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  Envy.

00:21:33,538 --> 00:21:34,663
SPEAKER_0:  highly orchestrated.

00:21:34,663 --> 00:21:35,166
SPEAKER_1:  evil.

00:21:35,554 --> 00:21:39,070
SPEAKER_1:  Are we talking about a scale of societies like totalitarianism?

00:21:39,394 --> 00:21:42,398
SPEAKER_1:  if we're thinking about somebody like Hitler.

00:21:42,754 --> 00:21:43,326
SPEAKER_1:  So.

00:21:43,746 --> 00:21:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  as at scale.

00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,254
SPEAKER_1:  orchestration of evil and be driving that so.

00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:50,302
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, that's really interesting to.

00:21:50,626 --> 00:21:54,078
SPEAKER_1:  to think about it. I'd love to hear more about it. So some of it, there might be some.

00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,798
SPEAKER_1:  psychological forces that are in tension.

00:21:57,698 --> 00:22:00,030
SPEAKER_1:  with each other. So one is.

00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:02,206
SPEAKER_1:  If you look at somebody like Hitler.

00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:05,534
SPEAKER_1:  It's difficult to know.

00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:07,518
SPEAKER_1:  what was going on in his mind.

00:22:08,002 --> 00:22:11,646
SPEAKER_1:  but it's possible to imagine if you just look at dictators thought history.

00:22:12,322 --> 00:22:14,174
SPEAKER_1:  that he thought he was doing good.

00:22:14,818 --> 00:22:16,894
SPEAKER_1:  not just for himself but for

00:22:17,506 --> 00:22:18,334
SPEAKER_1:  The people.

00:22:18,786 --> 00:22:20,062
SPEAKER_1:  he believed have value.

00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,238
SPEAKER_1:  So one way you can have.

00:22:22,594 --> 00:22:25,086
SPEAKER_1:  you can achieve what we consider as evil.

00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,438
SPEAKER_1:  is by devaluing some group of people.

00:22:29,986 --> 00:22:34,590
SPEAKER_1:  And that could be all group of people. So it could have sort of a narcissistic type of.

00:22:34,946 --> 00:22:35,934
SPEAKER_1:  idea that

00:22:36,226 --> 00:22:38,302
SPEAKER_1:  You basically don't care about other human beings.

00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,126
SPEAKER_1:  That's one. That's one.

00:22:40,898 --> 00:22:43,326
SPEAKER_1:  different, I mean maybe they can collaborate together.

00:22:43,778 --> 00:22:44,222
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:49,374
SPEAKER_1:  or even like you mentioned, you can actually enjoy doing bad to others.

00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:53,854
SPEAKER_1:  That's almost like different because if all it is is like narcissism

00:22:54,466 --> 00:22:55,934
SPEAKER_1:  You disregarded

00:22:56,482 --> 00:22:58,142
SPEAKER_1:  You don't care how others feel.

00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:01,854
SPEAKER_1:  then you can just make cold calculated military.

00:23:02,146 --> 00:23:03,678
SPEAKER_1:  almost economic decisions.

00:23:04,226 --> 00:23:06,686
SPEAKER_1:  And you don't care if a million people die here or there.

00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:10,302
SPEAKER_1:  But if you actually enjoy some aspect of that.

00:23:10,562 --> 00:23:13,790
SPEAKER_1:  Or there is like a resentment that fuels it. It's not just-

00:23:14,306 --> 00:23:17,342
SPEAKER_1:  It's like fueled by some kind of personal.

00:23:17,698 --> 00:23:21,214
SPEAKER_1:  or cultural resentment. The city gets off-field by that.

00:23:21,698 --> 00:23:26,814
SPEAKER_0:  You think so? I think it's all field, but I think the idea that, say Hitler thought he was doing good, right?

00:23:27,234 --> 00:23:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  It is like.

00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:35,262
SPEAKER_0:  is such a thin facade that it flies away like a handkerchief in a hurricane.

00:23:35,746 --> 00:23:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  Right.

00:23:38,466 --> 00:23:41,091
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, thank you. That's wow. That's beautiful. Yeah

00:23:41,091 --> 00:23:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  It's built upon.

00:23:44,482 --> 00:23:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  It says.

00:23:45,314 --> 00:23:47,582
SPEAKER_0:  I'll explain logical lies, right? Because no.

00:23:48,354 --> 00:23:53,214
SPEAKER_0:  people can build lies upon specious logic, right? So the idea that...

00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:58,046
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, I am doing good because I believe that this ethnicity of

00:23:58,594 --> 00:23:59,134
SPEAKER_0:  People is.

00:23:59,362 --> 00:24:10,558
SPEAKER_0:  good and this is bad. And now I'm going to do this and I'm going to make the world different and it's going to bring better to the world. And now I'm raising armies and I'm building concentration camps. And I think like, this is all in the service of good. I don't-

00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,894
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think anyone ever thinks that.

00:24:13,346 --> 00:24:13,694
SPEAKER_0:  Right.

00:24:14,018 --> 00:24:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  or they think that but with, because they're living.

00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:24,030
SPEAKER_0:  in the surface patina, right? Like they're not allowing the hurricane in that blows away the handkerchief and says like, this is all, this is all.

00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  This is all evil, right? I mean, how do you decide that-

00:24:27,874 --> 00:24:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  Some group of people is good and some is bad. What is it that you take upon yourself?

00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,430
SPEAKER_0:  to, to, to.

00:24:34,754 --> 00:24:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  play God or make decisions about the world. And I think what really is going on is people are not doing that.

00:24:39,586 --> 00:24:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  There's something cobbled together to say like, why this is right and this is okay, right? And this is even good, right?

00:24:46,658 --> 00:24:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  It is all.

00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  a lie, right? It's a lie that's adorning.

00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:52,382
SPEAKER_0:  The

00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  What I believe is the fact, I believe that what's going on is the gratification of envy.

00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:03,870
SPEAKER_0:  inside of the person and whether someone says, oh, I think this is good and it's okay if a million people die or

00:25:04,194 --> 00:25:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  I'm gonna enjoy that a million people die, I think is the same.

00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:09,822
SPEAKER_0:  I think the enjoyment, the gratification.

00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:14,782
SPEAKER_0:  of the orchestrated evil is there and that it all comes from.

00:25:15,362 --> 00:25:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  Vulnerability and insecurity, it all comes from deficits.

00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  in the sense of self.

00:25:21,858 --> 00:25:23,518
SPEAKER_1:  I'm gonna have to process that.

00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:30,366
SPEAKER_1:  My slow penny and PC is processing that so Envy underlies all of it.

00:25:30,882 --> 00:25:32,958
SPEAKER_1:  the psychological concept of envy.

00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,270
SPEAKER_1:  What is that?

00:25:35,106 --> 00:25:43,006
SPEAKER_1:  I keep putting myself in the mind of Hitler, I guess. That has nothing to do, it doesn't have to do with Jews or Slavic people.

00:25:43,586 --> 00:25:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  Does it have to do with specific?

00:25:45,602 --> 00:25:46,526
SPEAKER_1:  amorphous.

00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:47,998
SPEAKER_1:  Other

00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:49,886
SPEAKER_1:  in his mind.

00:25:50,402 --> 00:25:51,390
SPEAKER_1:  that he's envious of.

00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,214
SPEAKER_0:  I think it has all to do with him.

00:25:54,082 --> 00:25:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  All to do with

00:25:55,874 --> 00:26:05,918
SPEAKER_0:  There's not a love of the people with whom he allied or even a sense of the people who he persecuted were worse than him. It's all projections out of what was going on inside of him.

00:26:06,338 --> 00:26:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  which was an intense.

00:26:08,514 --> 00:26:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  sense of inadequacy.

00:26:10,178 --> 00:26:14,398
SPEAKER_0:  a rage at being someone he perceived as lesser.

00:26:15,298 --> 00:26:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  then.

00:26:16,162 --> 00:26:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  That's the difference between so we can define words in different ways even within psychology. Let's say we take the definition.

00:26:21,762 --> 00:26:33,438
SPEAKER_0:  here of sort of jealousy as being sort of benign, right? The idea that, oh, I might see something that you have that I don't, and I might think, I'd like that. Maybe I'll work harder to get it, right? Or maybe I can't get it. Maybe it's that you're younger than I am.

00:26:33,762 --> 00:26:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  They say, okay, you have that and I don't. I mean, I have other things too, I'm okay anyway.

00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  But I might

00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  want those things, but it's very benign, the jealousy. I'd like to be younger, I'd like to be richer, whatever it is that we people think, right?

00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  but it's just a thought.

00:26:48,514 --> 00:26:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  And it's a thought that can...

00:26:50,114 --> 00:26:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  result in strivings or acceptance, right?

00:26:53,218 --> 00:26:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  It's very, very different. It's completely different than Envy.

00:26:57,058 --> 00:26:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  which is destructive.

00:26:58,914 --> 00:27:00,542
SPEAKER_0:  It's the thought of I.

00:27:00,802 --> 00:27:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  see something that you have that I don't have, right? And instead of me working for it or accepting that I don't have it, what I'd like to do then is bring you down.

00:27:10,434 --> 00:27:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  take you down to where I am and then I'll feel better.

00:27:13,058 --> 00:27:17,406
SPEAKER_0:  Right, because from the perspective of envy, it is all.

00:27:18,082 --> 00:27:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  Relative.

00:27:18,818 --> 00:27:22,782
SPEAKER_1:  So his jealousy is about, as he said, completely different.

00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,854
SPEAKER_1:  but is jealousy potentially like a gateway drug to envy?

00:27:26,466 --> 00:27:28,670
SPEAKER_1:  Like, is it a slippery slough?

00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,654
SPEAKER_0:  I think no, I think that jealousy...

00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:37,982
SPEAKER_0:  is a natural just part of the human phenomenon that we go through life and we see like, oh, I'd like to have that. I think it's part of our incentives, right?

00:27:38,242 --> 00:27:39,230
SPEAKER_0:  You know, for FF

00:27:40,098 --> 00:27:40,542
SPEAKER_0:  I'm-

00:27:40,866 --> 00:27:48,741
SPEAKER_0:  farming and I have one row of crops and I look over and I see that you're working harder and you have two and I'd like to have two that can make me work harder to have two.

00:27:48,741 --> 00:27:50,878
SPEAKER_1:  is a slippery slope from one to the other to...

00:27:51,298 --> 00:28:01,438
SPEAKER_1:  At first you're like, I'd like to work harder, but then you keep failing and the weather sucks and you keep failing and the other person becomes more successful. Plus he's got a new hot wife now. There's a nice tractor.

00:28:01,826 --> 00:28:05,246
SPEAKER_1:  Does it feel this all working and then you get this idea that you know what I'm gonna

00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:06,782
SPEAKER_1:  steal all his stuff.

00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:08,286
SPEAKER_1:  I gotta murder him.

00:28:08,962 --> 00:28:11,294
SPEAKER_1:  And that, don't you think that's just like a leap?

00:28:11,906 --> 00:28:13,781
SPEAKER_1:  No, I actually think not. Of the same phenomenon?

00:28:13,781 --> 00:28:14,942
SPEAKER_0:  No, because I think.

00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:18,142
SPEAKER_0:  There are things that are in us as humans, right? So-

00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:29,726
SPEAKER_0:  So the things are just by being human, like we can, for example, feel, we can feel compassion, right? We can feel interest, right? We can feel jealousy in that benign sense. Like, it's all part of just being human.

00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,350
SPEAKER_0:  If we start going from.

00:28:32,706 --> 00:28:39,774
SPEAKER_0:  Hey, you have more crops than I have and, and you know, it seems like I actually have a better life in a lot of ways than I have. I'm gonna kill you. That's not-

00:28:40,258 --> 00:28:42,238
SPEAKER_0:  That is not a progression of something benign.

00:28:42,498 --> 00:28:42,846
SPEAKER_0:  Right.

00:28:43,074 --> 00:28:47,422
SPEAKER_1:  That is... But wait, wait a minute, but there is a human leap of the same thing, isn't it?

00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,942
SPEAKER_1:  is you're drawing a line, stuff.

00:28:51,234 --> 00:28:55,262
SPEAKER_1:  You're saying like, this is the, this human stuff is regular life is benign.

00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:59,262
SPEAKER_1:  but it feels like this benign thing is just a low magnitude thing.

00:29:00,098 --> 00:29:02,046
SPEAKER_1:  version of the thing that's not benign.

00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:06,686
SPEAKER_1:  There's probably a gray area where it stops being there. Like jealousy.

00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:15,902
SPEAKER_1:  You can have like healthy jealousy. You can have a little bit slightly unhealthy. There's a, that's I think jealous guy. This John Lennon song that I love is just beautiful. I mean, there's like.

00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:20,350
SPEAKER_1:  This jealousy inside relationships can make you feel like...

00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,142
SPEAKER_1:  you know, take your minds and all.

00:29:22,818 --> 00:29:24,094
SPEAKER_1:  kinds of silly directions.

00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:26,622
SPEAKER_1:  It's crazy, but like it feels like that.

00:29:26,946 --> 00:29:28,894
SPEAKER_1:  That's an extra neighbor to like.

00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:40,126
SPEAKER_1:  being really crazy and toxic and all that kind of stuff inside relationships. And then that feels like a next door neighbor. It's like an apartment building. That feels like a next door neighbor that eventually gets to Hitler with a.

00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,878
SPEAKER_1:  with envy and resentment of entire population of people.

00:29:43,202 --> 00:29:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  you're writing that there's a causal...

00:29:44,994 --> 00:29:48,542
SPEAKER_0:  There can be a causal chain, right? If I'm not feeling jealous.

00:29:48,898 --> 00:29:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe I won't ever feel envious, right? So as you can see, okay, so it can kind of lead to can open gates to, huh, like how much do I dislike that you have things that I don't have, right?

00:29:58,434 --> 00:30:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  So yes, in that sense, but, and I think.

00:30:01,442 --> 00:30:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  this is the part I think is so important that I think there is a disjunction.

00:30:05,634 --> 00:30:11,765
SPEAKER_0:  Right? It's, it, there's an asymptotic shift, right? From one thing to another, because it is very- Why are you speaking my language?

00:30:11,765 --> 00:30:13,265
SPEAKER_1:  mathematically. Yeah.

00:30:13,265 --> 00:30:13,854
SPEAKER_0:  leap yep.

00:30:14,082 --> 00:30:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, that's, it's a way to convey, right, something that's entirely different. Because if I start thinking.

00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  You know what?

00:30:21,506 --> 00:30:27,486
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not gonna try and make things better, right? I'd like instead to harm you. That's qualitatively different.

00:30:27,906 --> 00:30:32,190
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, it's almost like, you know what it is? It could be, I don't know what you think about this, but...

00:30:32,994 --> 00:30:33,790
SPEAKER_1:  It's a...

00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:35,774
SPEAKER_1:  In which direction?

00:30:36,482 --> 00:30:38,430
SPEAKER_1:  your motivation is pointing.

00:30:39,202 --> 00:30:41,854
SPEAKER_1:  So if in the response to the feeling of jealousy.

00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,678
SPEAKER_1:  your sort of

00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:48,606
SPEAKER_1:  The motivation says, okay, I understand this feeling. I want to do less of it.

00:30:49,538 --> 00:30:55,166
SPEAKER_1:  I think there must be a threshold to which you actually want to do more of. Like it becomes a vicious downward cycle.

00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:56,798
SPEAKER_1:  So that's what envy becomes.

00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,166
SPEAKER_1:  Like the first feeling, this idea.

00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,694
SPEAKER_1:  that I'm gonna kill the farmer.

00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:08,862
SPEAKER_1:  It turns into like more and more and more and you can't sleep and you're visualizing the farm and he becomes the devil and like you have this

00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:16,286
SPEAKER_1:  very, you know, it's basically a thing that builds into the negative direction versus returns to the stable center.

00:31:16,546 --> 00:31:21,694
SPEAKER_0:  Now a person is cultivating evil. Yeah. Right, they're saying, hey, there can be seeds of evil in all of us.

00:31:22,018 --> 00:31:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  Let me take that seed out, dust it off, plant it, nurture it, right, and then grow that seed of evil, which will affect all other.

00:31:29,634 --> 00:31:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  parts of the person's life, right? They won't behave the same towards others.

00:31:33,346 --> 00:31:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  in their life. Will they still become different?

00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  as they nurture fantasies of evil, as they begin to.

00:31:41,314 --> 00:31:45,534
SPEAKER_0:  create with inside of themselves the motivation and.

00:31:45,858 --> 00:31:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  the will to enact evil. The Hitler analogy would say, when you take someone who had a bad childhood, who was not loved, who was...

00:31:55,234 --> 00:31:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  taught and told that he was less than.

00:31:57,442 --> 00:31:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, like that.

00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  And we know that happens. I mean, that's why child abuse is so-

00:32:01,762 --> 00:32:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  evil, right? It's telling children.

00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:11,710
SPEAKER_0:  the worst possible wrong lessons, right? They're not good enough, they'll always be hurt, they can't keep themselves safe, they don't deserve safety, right?

00:32:11,938 --> 00:32:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  So then you take someone.

00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:14,270
SPEAKER_0:  Who then?

00:32:14,754 --> 00:32:26,782
SPEAKER_0:  nurtures that seed of evil, which is a choice. And this is why I can't paint well enough and no one appreciates me and I don't like how I look and I don't fit in with the people I wanna fit in with and then and on and on and on and on and on.

00:32:27,106 --> 00:32:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  And there's a hatred of self.

00:32:30,338 --> 00:32:32,254
SPEAKER_0:  through that lens of

00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  misery of just being repulsed by the self.

00:32:35,618 --> 00:32:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  But that's...

00:32:36,802 --> 00:32:38,942
SPEAKER_0:  unacceptable to the self.

00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  or it has to be someone else's fault.

00:32:41,762 --> 00:32:43,710
SPEAKER_0:  Right? It's not my fault, whose fault is it?

00:32:44,034 --> 00:32:47,390
SPEAKER_0:  Right? And then you see en masse the inaction of evil.

00:32:47,618 --> 00:32:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  towards groups of people who

00:32:50,018 --> 00:32:54,174
SPEAKER_0:  who somehow in this person's mind are responsible for his-

00:32:54,786 --> 00:32:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  misery and there's the justification of evil and then all the

00:32:58,850 --> 00:32:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  You know, whether it's...

00:33:00,066 --> 00:33:05,150
SPEAKER_0:  this will be better for the economy, this will be good, this will be that. Like that's all lies built to justify.

00:33:05,506 --> 00:33:05,886
SPEAKER_0:  the evil.

00:33:06,114 --> 00:33:07,518
SPEAKER_1:  Those are surface level narratives.

00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:09,854
SPEAKER_1:  and the envy.

00:33:10,402 --> 00:33:12,286
SPEAKER_1:  is the deep down mechanism.

00:33:12,994 --> 00:33:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  that enabled and that's the end point that's being served. What's being served is destruction.

00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  Right, which is why.

00:33:18,978 --> 00:33:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  It always brings more destruction.

00:33:20,962 --> 00:33:22,398
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, how many times do you do?

00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  wars that were started for purposes that we would look and say like those were evil purposes. Like how many times?

00:33:29,282 --> 00:33:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  There's good come of that. Even if we look at the modern world, what comes of it is...

00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  more evil is more destruction. And Hitler's outward destruction eventually came inward and you know you see pictures of what Berlin.

00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  look like after the second world.

00:33:43,586 --> 00:33:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  It wasn't just destruction perpetrated outward as awful as that.

00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:48,958
SPEAKER_0:  is it's it's

00:33:49,314 --> 00:33:49,950
SPEAKER_0:  It's catchy.

00:33:50,754 --> 00:33:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  Like people used to work during the time of the Manhattan Project, right? If you start this chain reaction, you know, will you?

00:33:57,186 --> 00:34:00,830
SPEAKER_0:  blow the whole world up, right? Will it stop within this bomb or not?

00:34:01,058 --> 00:34:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  and we see, okay, the chain reaction of evil.

00:34:04,066 --> 00:34:08,830
SPEAKER_0:  hasn't yet blown the whole world up, but look at how the catastrophe.

00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:14,942
SPEAKER_0:  You think 50 to 60 million people dead in the Second World War, which truly was a world

00:34:15,362 --> 00:34:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  War!

00:34:16,098 --> 00:34:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  what destruction was spread.

00:34:18,242 --> 00:34:19,006
SPEAKER_0:  around the globe.

00:34:19,522 --> 00:34:20,862
SPEAKER_1:  and this is something that

00:34:21,122 --> 00:34:21,886
SPEAKER_1:  can't be stopped.

00:34:22,178 --> 00:34:25,150
SPEAKER_1:  once the chain reaction starts, like if Hitler was

00:34:25,634 --> 00:34:26,430
SPEAKER_1:  Successful.

00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:27,774
SPEAKER_1:  Like it would just keep going.

00:34:27,874 --> 00:34:28,670
SPEAKER_0:  If he had been...

00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:31,262
SPEAKER_1:  in the industrial psychological

00:34:31,394 --> 00:34:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  Right, because if we think from the perspective of destruction...

00:34:34,178 --> 00:34:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  success would have needed, led to the need to conquer more, then there's factions and infighting and eventually you get the same mass.

00:34:40,482 --> 00:34:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  destruction, right? And never

00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:51,230
SPEAKER_0:  does the inaction of evil satisfy what the person is initially seeking? People want to feel better about themselves. But this is not something that everyone is able to accomplish.

00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,406
SPEAKER_0:  uh... in abridged

00:34:53,794 --> 00:34:56,030
SPEAKER_0:  uh... pediatrician who who wrote about

00:34:56,386 --> 00:35:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  children and adults from very deep perspectives. He wrote about the idea of good enough, right? And you can sort of extrapolate that to like, we all wanna feel good enough, like not just limp over the line good enough, but I wanna feel good enough that I'm a decent person in the world and like what I do matters and...

00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:19,838
SPEAKER_0:  I can have an impact on people and people can like me and care about me. There's a simplicity there that people want.

00:35:20,194 --> 00:35:25,950
SPEAKER_0:  that when people don't have and there's certain other factors, maybe they're temperamental factors or historical factors.

00:35:26,178 --> 00:35:27,070
SPEAKER_0:  can lead.

00:35:27,298 --> 00:35:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  to trying to soothe that.

00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:31,646
SPEAKER_0:  deficit, right, through

00:35:32,194 --> 00:35:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  envy. And I think it starts with that. And it often starts in childhood, not always, but it often starts in childhood when the...

00:35:41,666 --> 00:35:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  child's brain and psychology are so vulnerable. And you see salient child abuse. If you look at what was Hitler's background and what was Stalin's background, then I mean, you could look at almost anyone who's perpetrated evil, serial killers, whatever it may be.

00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  The majority, not everyone, but the majority.

00:36:01,122 --> 00:36:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  had these lessons in childhood that said, you're not good enough, you can't keep yourself safe, no one cares about you and-

00:36:07,522 --> 00:36:09,118
SPEAKER_0:  and in a subset of people.

00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  that's going to generate envy and that seed of evil then gets planted and nurtured.

00:36:16,994 --> 00:36:17,758
SPEAKER_0:  as a fighter jet.

00:36:18,882 --> 00:36:21,022
SPEAKER_0:  The sound of a fighter jet above us.

00:36:21,314 --> 00:36:22,526
SPEAKER_0:  It's been good by an orchestra.

00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:23,774
SPEAKER_1:  You forget.

00:36:24,194 --> 00:36:25,214
SPEAKER_1:  You quickly forget.

00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:29,118
SPEAKER_1:  the comfort of being in a peaceful place. That's one thing I saw in Ukraine.

00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:31,550
SPEAKER_1:  is um...

00:36:32,386 --> 00:36:35,550
SPEAKER_1:  Hey, you quickly get comfortable here. I'm going to take the whole trip back.

00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:37,982
SPEAKER_1:  I was thinking.

00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,214
SPEAKER_1:  It's so damn good to be in America.

00:36:41,634 --> 00:36:45,054
SPEAKER_1:  It's a whole, just a whole like, it's like a three day trip back.

00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,326
SPEAKER_1:  It's so good to be American.

00:36:49,634 --> 00:36:53,982
SPEAKER_0:  You might take that for granted as a population, but I do agree.

00:36:54,626 --> 00:36:56,501
SPEAKER_1:  so that destruction never alleviates.

00:36:56,501 --> 00:36:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  the envy.

00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:00,670
SPEAKER_0:  are all.

00:37:00,962 --> 00:37:02,974
SPEAKER_0:  humans capable of envy.

00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:09,150
SPEAKER_0:  I believe the answer is yes. Do we all have the possibility of evil in us?

00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:11,486
SPEAKER_0:  I think the answer to that is yes.

00:37:11,874 --> 00:37:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  but we have...

00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  We have choice. We can choose what we do.

00:37:17,122 --> 00:37:17,598
SPEAKER_0:  with that.

00:37:17,922 --> 00:37:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  Which is why just because someone is

00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  A sociopath, for example, doesn't mean that they're not responsible.

00:37:26,466 --> 00:37:29,726
SPEAKER_0:  medical legal jurisprudence.

00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  has absolutely borne that out, that legally, medically, we believe that completely.

00:37:34,082 --> 00:37:34,526
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:36,414
SPEAKER_0:  You were responsible.

00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  presuming we're healthy, we're not unhealthy in other ways, that eliminates our ability to be circumspect, but that we're responsible for what we do.

00:37:45,282 --> 00:37:46,302
SPEAKER_0:  and don't nurture.

00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  inside of us. There are plenty of things we could decide to nurture anger and hatred.

00:37:51,394 --> 00:38:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  about. I could think of slight difficulties, whether it's something someone else has done to me, or I could blame fate, or I could be mad at God, or the world. We can all make those.

00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:01,662
SPEAKER_0:  choices and where...

00:38:02,178 --> 00:38:07,070
SPEAKER_0:  responsible for them or for recognizing things in us. They're like, oh, I too have that in me.

00:38:08,322 --> 00:38:10,046
SPEAKER_0:  I don't want to nurture that, I don't want to foster.

00:38:10,434 --> 00:38:11,742
SPEAKER_0:  that or do I choose?

00:38:12,034 --> 00:38:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  nurture and foster that. And I think ultimately, you know, our subject of

00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  Hitler is as evil if if he had

00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:22,142
SPEAKER_0:  kept winning and winning. I think ultimately he would have been the only person on earth.

00:38:22,882 --> 00:38:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  And I really do believe that ultimately everyone, everything else would be.

00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:30,558
SPEAKER_0:  because it's such destruction, right? Destroy everything, right? And

00:38:30,914 --> 00:38:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  Probably when that didn't work, then there's the destruction of the self, right?

00:38:35,842 --> 00:38:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  Nothing

00:38:38,498 --> 00:38:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  soothes.

00:38:40,354 --> 00:38:43,966
SPEAKER_0:  envy that is stoked by the sort of flames of evil.

00:38:44,514 --> 00:38:49,726
SPEAKER_0:  And what you see is more and more anger and more and more frustration, which is why I really do believe someone.

00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  like that, who nurtured evil in themselves that way, ultimately would

00:38:53,922 --> 00:38:56,702
SPEAKER_0:  They'd be like him and one other person, and then he'd kill the other.

00:38:57,378 --> 00:38:59,230
SPEAKER_1:  I think that's really powerfully said.

00:39:00,258 --> 00:39:02,782
SPEAKER_1:  but even just to return to the jealousy vs envy.

00:39:03,394 --> 00:39:04,254
SPEAKER_1:  I still f-

00:39:04,546 --> 00:39:05,022
SPEAKER_1:  Think.

00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:06,910
SPEAKER_1:  that it's the same flame.

00:39:08,866 --> 00:39:12,030
SPEAKER_1:  And Envy is just the bigger version of it. So I think...

00:39:13,314 --> 00:39:14,974
SPEAKER_1:  I just did my own personal life.

00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:16,798
SPEAKER_1:  I f-

00:39:17,026 --> 00:39:20,766
SPEAKER_1:  felt jealousy towards others, like you said, like, Oh, this person.

00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,806
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know, a cooler thing.

00:39:24,034 --> 00:39:24,382
SPEAKER_1:  Trinket.

00:39:24,898 --> 00:39:29,982
SPEAKER_1:  whatever trinket I cared about. And usually it's when somebody is really close to the trinket you're building.

00:39:32,098 --> 00:39:32,798
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:39:33,058 --> 00:39:33,534
SPEAKER_1:  And I-

00:39:34,178 --> 00:39:36,574
SPEAKER_1:  Early on, like in my teens.

00:39:37,922 --> 00:39:38,974
SPEAKER_1:  I realized that...

00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,726
SPEAKER_1:  Just, just empirically speaking.

00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:45,982
SPEAKER_1:  that jealousy over a period of a week just doesn't feel good.

00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:50,526
SPEAKER_1:  and it's not productive. It doesn't help me build a better trinket.

00:39:51,618 --> 00:39:51,966
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:39:52,674 --> 00:39:54,206
SPEAKER_1:  or it does if I

00:39:54,946 --> 00:39:57,022
SPEAKER_1:  turn it into jealousy.

00:39:57,794 --> 00:39:58,878
SPEAKER_1:  towards another person.

00:39:59,330 --> 00:39:59,774
SPEAKER_1:  but

00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:02,302
SPEAKER_1:  into a love for building a better trinket.

00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:06,366
SPEAKER_1:  It's like, oh cool. Almost, you know what, like proactively speaking.

00:40:06,978 --> 00:40:13,022
SPEAKER_1:  And later in life, people like Joe Rogan actually have been really powerful in this for me, just as a fan of his.

00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:14,974
SPEAKER_1:  to celebrate other people.

00:40:15,298 --> 00:40:22,558
SPEAKER_1:  So it's almost as opposed to ignoring that other person with a cool trinket, it's like celebrating their awesomeness in my mind.

00:40:22,882 --> 00:40:24,606
SPEAKER_1:  Like just saying how awesome.

00:40:24,962 --> 00:40:28,862
SPEAKER_1:  that humans are able to do that. And actually just how awesome is that exact.

00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:34,558
SPEAKER_1:  person and being able to do that. Yeah. And that somehow made me more capable to build my own trinket better.

00:40:34,818 --> 00:40:38,046
SPEAKER_1:  And it feels good also. Like it makes me feel happy.

00:40:38,242 --> 00:40:39,550
SPEAKER_0:  And now you're not jealous anymore.

00:40:39,778 --> 00:40:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  You're not jealous anymore. Right? So that's why I think jealousy is different, right? Because you're saying there's a week of jealousy, like I don't like this, right? I don't like, but if you take that in a way that says.

00:40:48,514 --> 00:40:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  Wait a second, actually this is awesome. This is fabulous and this person did this. That person's awesome, right?

00:40:54,722 --> 00:41:00,670
SPEAKER_0:  then you're not raining on anyone's parade, right? and in not doing that even inside your own mind

00:41:01,122 --> 00:41:04,126
SPEAKER_0:  you gain a greater cognizance of your own capability.

00:41:04,418 --> 00:41:12,158
SPEAKER_0:  Right, well if he can do that or she can do that, why can't I too? Like I wanna make the better Trinket too, right? Now you're thinking creatively.

00:41:12,418 --> 00:41:13,918
SPEAKER_0:  Nowhere in there.

00:41:14,658 --> 00:41:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  Nowhere in there was the emergence of evil.

00:41:17,922 --> 00:41:20,926
SPEAKER_0:  I just disagree with that. I think there was a choice made.

00:41:21,474 --> 00:41:22,366
SPEAKER_1:  Where I- Huh?

00:41:22,818 --> 00:41:27,934
SPEAKER_1:  I looked at my, if my life was darker, more difficult, I think has nothing to do with my life.

00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:31,582
SPEAKER_1:  with the actual little flame of jealousy I felt.

00:41:32,098 --> 00:41:34,878
SPEAKER_1:  I think it has to do a lot more with the other context. And they have come out Voc avisca going surdr, Discover

00:41:35,298 --> 00:41:36,062
SPEAKER_1:  If I...

00:41:36,962 --> 00:41:38,494
SPEAKER_1:  If my life were.

00:41:38,818 --> 00:41:40,990
SPEAKER_1:  more difficult, there was more abuse.

00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:42,718
SPEAKER_1:  there was more challenges.

00:41:43,106 --> 00:41:47,326
SPEAKER_1:  I think that decision, I could have made that decision in a different direction. Yes yes yes.

00:41:47,746 --> 00:41:48,862
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know what, uh...

00:41:49,218 --> 00:41:53,310
SPEAKER_1:  You've written brilliantly about trauma. There's a bit more trauma.

00:41:53,826 --> 00:41:56,574
SPEAKER_1:  as the background noise of my decision making.

00:41:56,802 --> 00:41:58,270
SPEAKER_1:  I'll be more likely to-

00:41:58,722 --> 00:42:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  uh... not be able to uh... pull away from the gravitational field of that jealousy and would build the ml in 멋있

00:42:04,866 --> 00:42:05,310
SPEAKER_1:  So I think.

00:42:05,634 --> 00:42:07,646
SPEAKER_1:  I disagree with the

00:42:08,002 --> 00:42:11,646
SPEAKER_1:  with a brilliant person, but I feel like that flame.

00:42:12,002 --> 00:42:13,758
SPEAKER_1:  That flame has the capacity.

00:42:14,306 --> 00:42:18,366
SPEAKER_1:  to engulf the whole world. I guess the initial flame of jealousy, the little bit.

00:42:18,978 --> 00:42:20,510
SPEAKER_1:  Like especially the younger you are.

00:42:21,346 --> 00:42:23,102
SPEAKER_1:  It's almost like a habit.

00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:24,286
SPEAKER_0:  You get to...

00:42:24,514 --> 00:42:24,926
SPEAKER_0:  Build.

00:42:25,282 --> 00:42:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  in either direction, because I've early on built a habit.

00:42:28,514 --> 00:42:29,150
SPEAKER_1:  of saying.

00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,006
SPEAKER_1:  I'm going to, uh...

00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:33,022
SPEAKER_1:  Channel that jealousy.

00:42:33,474 --> 00:42:40,254
SPEAKER_1:  into productivity and into celebrating other people and that jealousy disappears. That was like a little discovery for me.

00:42:40,578 --> 00:42:44,414
SPEAKER_1:  I discovered that. I get it.

00:42:44,738 --> 00:42:47,774
SPEAKER_1:  You kind of discovered that little thing. I could have easily not discovered it.

00:42:48,002 --> 00:42:49,278
SPEAKER_1:  I could have easily discovered.

00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:51,710
SPEAKER_1:  that it kind of feels good to.

00:42:52,418 --> 00:42:52,734
SPEAKER_1:  to.

00:42:52,994 --> 00:42:53,438
SPEAKER_1:  Like.

00:42:53,794 --> 00:42:55,518
SPEAKER_1:  mess with that other person to like

00:42:55,938 --> 00:42:56,734
SPEAKER_1:  Think

00:42:57,186 --> 00:43:00,062
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, shitty thoughts. Think negative thoughts.

00:43:00,482 --> 00:43:06,846
SPEAKER_1:  do negative things to that other person. Because that could also, I just think the capacity in that initial feeling is there.

00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:09,694
SPEAKER_1:  And I think it's a decision with me, because otherwise.

00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:14,078
SPEAKER_1:  I think it dissolves responsibility.

00:43:14,818 --> 00:43:16,702
SPEAKER_1:  Like, well surely I'm not Hitler.

00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:17,918
SPEAKER_1:  Therefore...

00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:24,894
SPEAKER_1:  this jealousy is normal. No, I just feel like every jealous is the capacity to turn into maybe not Hitler, but a toxicity.

00:43:25,474 --> 00:43:30,110
SPEAKER_1:  that destroys in a small way in your own little private life, but it could destroy.

00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:31,294
SPEAKER_0:  I agree that-

00:43:32,418 --> 00:43:33,630
SPEAKER_0:  Jealousy brings us.

00:43:35,906 --> 00:43:39,646
SPEAKER_0:  can bring us dangerously close to envy. I mean, maybe, maybe, let's see if if.

00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  If I'm...

00:43:41,058 --> 00:43:44,222
SPEAKER_0:  A heuristic we could agree on, right? Let's see. Let's see.

00:43:44,674 --> 00:43:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, if we look at the...

00:43:46,306 --> 00:43:49,086
SPEAKER_0:  terrain of the mind is geography, right? So if I'm feeling...

00:43:49,698 --> 00:43:57,598
SPEAKER_0:  happy, satisfied, proud. I'm pretty far from envy land, right? But if I'm feeling jealousy now, I'm, I'm.

00:43:58,274 --> 00:44:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  I'm coming kind of closer to that border.

00:44:00,706 --> 00:44:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:04,542
SPEAKER_0:  I still, I think there's.

00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:27,998
SPEAKER_0:  It's a big thing to go over the border, right? That the border isn't a gray area, right? There's a border to go over. And I think that I agree completely, one certainly about trauma, that the more trauma there is, because then the more misunderstandings there are about self and feelings that I'm not good enough, and then that can be anger about why and who might be oppressing me and, you know, I mean, I hate myself and everyone else who seems to be better. So trauma...

00:44:28,386 --> 00:44:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  can drive us in these negative directions, but we're still crossing over some.

00:44:32,866 --> 00:44:38,270
SPEAKER_0:  Right? So if you have the trinket and I think that's awesome, I want that, I want to work harder.

00:44:38,914 --> 00:44:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  You know what I could do though is...

00:44:40,418 --> 00:44:43,646
SPEAKER_0:  I could sneak in tonight when no one's around and I could move something.

00:44:43,906 --> 00:44:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  No, no, wait, I don't wanna do that, right? But it's like I came over the border a little bit and I thought maybe...

00:44:48,578 --> 00:44:50,238
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe that's a better way, but then I came back.

00:44:50,658 --> 00:45:00,702
SPEAKER_0:  right? And we're responsible for that, right? Because it is a choice to say, I don't want to work hard. I'm already working how hard? I don't want to make my trinket better. I want to think mine's the best one.

00:45:01,122 --> 00:45:14,078
SPEAKER_0:  I could destroy yours, right? Then, you know, we're letting our mind go over that border and do we say, right, run that forward, right? Let's run that forward and put people around us who feel the same way and start doing it so we think less of ourselves and we debase ourselves.

00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:17,950
SPEAKER_0:  Do we run headlong in or do we come over that boundary?

00:45:18,306 --> 00:45:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  And that's maybe the capacity for evil in us, that we come over that boundary, all of us.

00:45:22,946 --> 00:45:27,390
SPEAKER_0:  right, at times, but do we come over it and then say, no, that's not my choice.

00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  That's not my self definition.

00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:35,710
SPEAKER_1:  I'm coming back. But I'm trying to justify, maybe there's certain other sociological forces that help us cross the border too.

00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:37,438
SPEAKER_1:  So in Nazi Germany...

00:45:37,858 --> 00:45:41,342
SPEAKER_1:  uh... we've been talking about hitler but then there's also the

00:45:41,602 --> 00:45:42,718
SPEAKER_1:  the the german people

00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:46,782
SPEAKER_1:  And so maybe when there's a bit of a mass hysteria, so all these effects.

00:45:47,458 --> 00:45:48,606
SPEAKER_1:  of like.

00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:50,974
SPEAKER_1:  combination of propaganda with

00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:55,262
SPEAKER_1:  the small jealousies and resentments of the people that don't cross the border.

00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:57,758
SPEAKER_1:  uh... together they can

00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:00,510
SPEAKER_1:  with great charismatic leaders that...

00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:08,446
SPEAKER_1:  sort of really fuel that fire that we feel when we're a part of the crowd. So maybe those individual kind of psychological barriers that you have.

00:46:08,994 --> 00:46:11,038
SPEAKER_1:  take that leap from jealousy to envy.

00:46:11,298 --> 00:46:12,158
SPEAKER_1:  those can be.

00:46:12,386 --> 00:46:15,907
SPEAKER_1:  made easier the the leap can be catalyzed to this matter and you

00:46:15,907 --> 00:46:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  percent.

00:46:16,834 --> 00:46:25,214
SPEAKER_0:  100%. I think that to me is a massive point. We're talking about layers of emergence, right? So if there's individual consciousness, then there's culture.

00:46:25,602 --> 00:46:33,918
SPEAKER_0:  And we're products of the soup we swim in, so to speak. People would say that when I was growing up. We're products of the soup we swim in. So if the soup that we're swimming in...

00:46:34,146 --> 00:46:35,422
SPEAKER_0:  is the soup of hatred.

00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  Then it's going to foster all of those things. So then you think about...

00:46:40,034 --> 00:46:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  just in a painting with a very broad brush.

00:46:42,402 --> 00:46:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  the culture created in Germany prior to the Second World War, and what was the impact of the reparations after the First World War?

00:46:49,794 --> 00:47:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  of the punishing reparations, impoverishment, and basically humiliation that people were feeling. Okay, there were a whole bunch of decisions that impacted that cultural perspective.

00:47:01,346 --> 00:47:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  right, then there must have been aspects just like I see in many ways parallels.

00:47:06,306 --> 00:47:10,046
SPEAKER_0:  in America now of what are our standards for.

00:47:10,306 --> 00:47:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  what we're communicating to others, right? How is the media deciding like what's real and what's not real, what's true, what's not true, what's hatred?

00:47:18,466 --> 00:47:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  that is only gonna do...

00:47:20,834 --> 00:47:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  evil versus what's hatred that's okay because I might sell something by by

00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  putting it out there. That was, we know that was going on.

00:47:29,154 --> 00:47:29,758
SPEAKER_0:  in

00:47:30,114 --> 00:47:45,054
SPEAKER_0:  Germany during the rise of the Nazis and I think there's a parallel to, do we value truth? Can we stand together and say, no matter how much I might disagree with you politically, we can still understand that there's right and there's wrong, right? There's truth and there's lies, right?

00:47:45,346 --> 00:47:51,230
SPEAKER_0:  So I think those are just two examples of determinants of culture. And then the culture.

00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  is a determinant of, is someone like.

00:47:54,530 --> 00:48:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  Hitler marginalizes like that's a crazy evil person. Oh my goodness, like, whoa.

00:48:00,418 --> 00:48:11,710
SPEAKER_0:  Right, or is that someone who gains a greater following, a more adherence, and then there starts to be a momentum. Because why? Because what do demagogues do? I think they have a giant lasso and they harness.

00:48:12,162 --> 00:48:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  the envy of thousands upon thousands upon thousands of people. That's right, you feel worse about yourself too. Doesn't matter what the reasons are. Maybe it's your childhood, maybe it's not. Maybe it's job failings, maybe it's professional, maybe it's personal, doesn't matter. Like you have envy too.

00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:30,654
SPEAKER_0:  let's put it together and do some destruction because that'll make us feel better

00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:32,094
SPEAKER_0:  Which is a lie.

00:48:33,314 --> 00:48:34,750
SPEAKER_1:  So we've talked about Envy.

00:48:35,106 --> 00:48:37,118
SPEAKER_1:  Where does, from the leader perspective...

00:48:37,538 --> 00:48:42,110
SPEAKER_1:  of things like narcissism or sociopathy, come into play.

00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:43,870
SPEAKER_1:  What can you make of?

00:48:45,154 --> 00:48:46,270
SPEAKER_1:  world we live in.

00:48:46,658 --> 00:48:48,894
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe the leaders that run the world.

00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:51,870
SPEAKER_1:  from the perspective, from the lens of narcissism.

00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:53,790
SPEAKER_0:  I am struck.

00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  20 years of doing.

00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:56,958
SPEAKER_0:  what I do now.

00:48:57,186 --> 00:49:04,286
SPEAKER_0:  I've been a psychiatrist for 20 years and I practice in so many different settings and I consult in different settings. I've been fortunate to have a very wide...

00:49:04,546 --> 00:49:07,710
SPEAKER_0:  purview of what's going on in people and in the world around us.

00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:09,278
SPEAKER_0:  and I am.

00:49:09,506 --> 00:49:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  struck with amazement.

00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:19,230
SPEAKER_0:  of all the things I see that are say abnormal, let's say from the mental health perspective. This could be depression, panic attacks.

00:49:19,618 --> 00:49:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  I hearing voices, addiction, but there's so many things that cover everything.

00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  that.

00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:27,742
SPEAKER_0:  Narcissism?

00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  is not.

00:49:30,018 --> 00:49:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  frequent compared to a lot of other things. So it's small in terms of narcissistic diagnosis, right? It's much less than many other things.

00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:39,102
SPEAKER_0:  But...

00:49:39,362 --> 00:49:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  it causes the lion's share. I don't just mean the most compared to anything else, but I think more than 50%, the majority of...

00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:49,246
SPEAKER_0:  Bad things.

00:49:49,794 --> 00:49:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  evil things, destructive things that I see in the world around us. I think narcissists are,

00:49:55,138 --> 00:49:56,030
SPEAKER_0:

00:49:56,386 --> 00:50:03,486
SPEAKER_0:  destructive because they are driven completely, they are lodged completely in the lane of.

00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:04,542
SPEAKER_0:  Envy.

00:50:05,986 --> 00:50:06,974
SPEAKER_1:  Can you, uh...

00:50:07,394 --> 00:50:08,222
SPEAKER_1:  try to sneak up.

00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:13,118
SPEAKER_1:  and we don't want to be lost in definitions, but can you try to sneak up to a definition?

00:50:13,506 --> 00:50:16,382
SPEAKER_1:  non-clinical definition of narcissism that we're talking about

00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:19,070
SPEAKER_0:  Narcissism is...

00:50:19,586 --> 00:50:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  I ate.

00:50:20,674 --> 00:50:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  deep.

00:50:21,858 --> 00:50:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  pervasive and unquestioned.

00:50:24,802 --> 00:50:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  sense of inadequacy.

00:50:26,946 --> 00:50:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  in

00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  The Self.

00:50:28,802 --> 00:50:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  that comes along with anger and fear and vulnerability.

00:50:33,026 --> 00:50:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  fear of destruction, fear of annihilation.

00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  that is compensated for.

00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  aggression by the mechanics of envy.

00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

00:50:45,346 --> 00:50:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  trying to make the self.

00:50:47,842 --> 00:50:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  seem better at the expense of others by

00:50:51,522 --> 00:50:52,734
SPEAKER_0:  taking from others.

00:50:53,026 --> 00:50:54,334
SPEAKER_0:  uh... by being

00:50:54,562 --> 00:50:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  completely cavalier to the thoughts and feelings.

00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:01,534
SPEAKER_0:  of others, that narcissism is not arrogance, narcissism is the opposite.

00:51:01,794 --> 00:51:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  of arrogance. There is such a deep sense of inadequacy.

00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,670
SPEAKER_0:  and incompetence in the self.

00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  that the defensive structure around that

00:51:12,386 --> 00:51:15,678
SPEAKER_0:  becomes dominated by rocket fueled.

00:51:16,194 --> 00:51:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  Envy.

00:51:18,498 --> 00:51:20,958
SPEAKER_1:  the machinery of narcissism is envy.

00:51:22,018 --> 00:51:26,814
SPEAKER_1:  What do you make of the kind of more popularly discussed kind of symptom?

00:51:27,234 --> 00:51:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  of narcissism.

00:51:28,802 --> 00:51:30,110
SPEAKER_1:  which is a seeming...

00:51:31,074 --> 00:51:33,150
SPEAKER_1:  not caring about other people.

00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:35,742
SPEAKER_1:  sort of a very...

00:51:36,098 --> 00:51:41,534
SPEAKER_1:  inward-facing focus in terms of the calculation you make when making decisions about the world.

00:51:42,306 --> 00:51:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  narcissistic people.

00:51:44,162 --> 00:51:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  definitely care about other people, right? it's the people who are schizoid?

00:51:47,842 --> 00:52:07,134
SPEAKER_0:  Right, and say that don't necessarily register other people, right? But narcissism, people care about other people, but it's entirely vis-a-vis the self, right? If I'm schizoid, I don't really notice or care much who you are, right? But if I'm narcissistic, I absolutely care, because I'm watching every last detail of you. What might you have that's better than me?

00:52:07,426 --> 00:52:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:12,926
SPEAKER_0:  It's an incredibly intense focus upon individuals.

00:52:13,218 --> 00:52:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  and demographics of people.

00:52:15,394 --> 00:52:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  but the priority, the...

00:52:17,826 --> 00:52:19,966
SPEAKER_0:  The goal is entirely about

00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:26,174
SPEAKER_0:  the self, which is why they can become easy to say, I don't care if a million people die, right? How different is that from?

00:52:26,594 --> 00:52:35,870
SPEAKER_0:  going out and destroying one person or a million people, right? It's in the same category of those people only, their existence is only meaningful in how it.

00:52:36,226 --> 00:52:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  relates to me.

00:52:38,818 --> 00:52:39,486
SPEAKER_1:  But it's still...

00:52:40,258 --> 00:52:46,494
SPEAKER_1:  Meaningful it just seems like a very difficult leap to take that I don't care that a million people die

00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:48,222
SPEAKER_1:  that.

00:52:49,986 --> 00:52:52,414
SPEAKER_1:  seems to be even with envy.

00:52:53,058 --> 00:52:54,334
SPEAKER_1:  That seems to be a big...

00:52:55,554 --> 00:52:57,886
SPEAKER_1:  like feeling and thought to have.

00:52:58,306 --> 00:52:59,934
SPEAKER_1:  if you at all care about them.

00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:01,895
SPEAKER_1:  are other people.

00:53:01,895 --> 00:53:02,526
SPEAKER_0:  I guess.

00:53:04,066 --> 00:53:04,958
SPEAKER_1:  tools for it.

00:53:05,506 --> 00:53:08,414
SPEAKER_1:  alleviation of your sense of inadequacy.

00:53:08,738 --> 00:53:14,078
SPEAKER_0:  Right, I mean, I don't even care about in that like being caring at all. I mean, caring about in that noticing.

00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  that the person exists.

00:53:16,642 --> 00:53:21,214
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, someone who wants money and notices that there's a hundred dollar bill out.

00:53:21,506 --> 00:53:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  cares about that. They don't care about the hundred dollar bill and that doesn't mean anything to them. It's of thoughts and feelings.

00:53:27,202 --> 00:53:29,854
SPEAKER_0:  but it's gonna attract attention, they care about it because.

00:53:30,242 --> 00:53:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  It's something that they want.

00:53:32,002 --> 00:53:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  The same way people will care about others, but only from the perspective of, do you have things that I want?

00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  Or can I feel better about myself by taking something from you by making...

00:53:41,858 --> 00:53:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  things worse for you.

00:53:43,074 --> 00:53:46,142
SPEAKER_1:  People often talk about narcissism as like the opposite of empathy.

00:53:48,322 --> 00:53:52,190
SPEAKER_1:  but sort of empathy again, depends how you define it, but.

00:53:52,418 --> 00:53:53,246
SPEAKER_1:  is uh...

00:53:54,338 --> 00:53:56,478
SPEAKER_1:  is a careful consideration.

00:53:57,346 --> 00:54:01,662
SPEAKER_1:  of the mental space of another person, of how the other person sees the world.

00:54:02,402 --> 00:54:03,742
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

00:54:04,098 --> 00:54:08,702
SPEAKER_1:  You're kind of saying that narcissism, narcissistic people would also be very good at that.

00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:10,878
SPEAKER_1:  in order to understand.

00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:16,286
SPEAKER_1:  how maybe the other person can be manipulated or something to alleviate your sense of inadequacy.

00:54:16,706 --> 00:54:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  Right, so there's a difference between the mechanics.

00:54:19,074 --> 00:54:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  of empathy. So let's say, and we can define things different ways. Let's say empathic attunement.

00:54:23,746 --> 00:54:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  is the ability to be attuned and to think, okay.

00:54:26,338 --> 00:54:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  What's going on in you? What might you be thinking? What might you be feeling?

00:54:29,954 --> 00:54:32,062
SPEAKER_0:  Some people have a lot of empathic attunement.

00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  But that's, we can look at that as mechanistic, right? It doesn't equate to care.

00:54:38,658 --> 00:54:40,318
SPEAKER_0:  Right, an empathic attunement.

00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  can come along with empathy or not.

00:54:43,554 --> 00:54:50,110
SPEAKER_0:  So yes, people who are narcissistic, they can mentalize well. So you mentalize meaning the ability to.

00:54:50,434 --> 00:54:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  to.

00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  understand or to consider thoughts, feelings, motivations in other people, right?

00:54:57,986 --> 00:55:04,126
SPEAKER_0:  People who are narcissistic can have empathic attunement or mentalization depending upon how we want to describe those things.

00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  But that has nothing to do...

00:55:06,786 --> 00:55:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  with

00:55:07,906 --> 00:55:10,526
SPEAKER_0:  care with actual empathy or kindness or

00:55:11,042 --> 00:55:11,454
SPEAKER_0:  or

00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:16,862
SPEAKER_1:  So in that sense, empathy, usually popularly used means...

00:55:17,346 --> 00:55:20,542
SPEAKER_1:  that you care, like your happiness is aligned. This is a

00:55:21,282 --> 00:55:27,390
SPEAKER_1:  I need to read this book. I've read so little science fiction. That's been one of my goals for this year, to catch up on some science fiction.

00:55:27,618 --> 00:55:32,222
SPEAKER_1:  So Robert Highland from Stranger in a Strange Land has this quote about love.

00:55:32,674 --> 00:55:38,142
SPEAKER_1:  which is love is that condition where another person's happiness is essential to your own.

00:55:38,498 --> 00:55:40,542
SPEAKER_1:  So that's a good definition, I guess, of empathy where...

00:55:40,834 --> 00:55:45,694
SPEAKER_1:  Yes. You're very sensitive. So mechanistically very sensitive to the state of another person's mind.

00:55:46,466 --> 00:55:47,934
SPEAKER_1:  and your goal.

00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:50,110
SPEAKER_1:  is to maximize their happiness.

00:55:50,402 --> 00:55:52,094
SPEAKER_1:  It's like essential to your own happiness.

00:55:52,578 --> 00:55:54,750
SPEAKER_1:  so that the happiness is that our line

00:55:55,074 --> 00:55:57,758
SPEAKER_1:  And when that's elevated to its highest form, you can call that.

00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:00,190
SPEAKER_1:  love romantic love friendship and so on

00:56:00,578 --> 00:56:06,398
SPEAKER_0:  Okay. There's one more thing about the narcissist is some people can be sort of benign narcissists where

00:56:06,978 --> 00:56:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  They want...

00:56:08,194 --> 00:56:11,422
SPEAKER_0:  great things for themselves, right? but if they have enough

00:56:11,842 --> 00:56:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  great things, they can sort of tolerate others being happy too.

00:56:15,298 --> 00:56:25,630
SPEAKER_0:  And these are people who sometimes are actually quite highly liked, right? Because they have to have the most money, the most power, the most of anything, anything more than anyone else could challenge.

00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:36,734
SPEAKER_0:  But as long as I have that, it's okay that you have some too, right? And then that can make you happy and can make you like me, right? So benign narcissists can be well-liked from that perspective.

00:56:38,242 --> 00:56:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  it's still all about them and that can change if for example there's a scarcity of resources now right

00:56:44,738 --> 00:56:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  But they're generally, they're not people who are being overtly destructive, although that...

00:56:49,186 --> 00:56:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  They're over the border into the...

00:56:51,426 --> 00:56:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  you know, into the envy territory, right? Malignant narcissists are very different where they then want to have everything. So even if I have...

00:56:59,714 --> 00:57:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  thousand times more than you do I still envy you what you have because I want to have I don't think I can feel good enough about myself unless I have everything

00:57:07,554 --> 00:57:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  And once I have everything, I won't feel good enough about myself either and then I'll have to have more, right? Take differences Influence Contact Bana

00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  That's

00:57:12,482 --> 00:57:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  malignant narcissism which we think of as

00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:18,302
SPEAKER_0:  Sociopathy, right? We can define these words in different ways, but...

00:57:18,594 --> 00:57:24,030
SPEAKER_0:  They're very, very negative concepts. That's profound sociopathy, malignant narcissism.

00:57:24,418 --> 00:57:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  you know, envy writ large.

00:57:26,466 --> 00:57:27,591
SPEAKER_0:  sociopathies.

00:57:27,591 --> 00:57:29,118
SPEAKER_1:  as malignant narcissism.

00:57:29,346 --> 00:57:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  That's a convenient way to think about it.

00:57:31,874 --> 00:57:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, no, because we can do sort of sociopathic things that, but not be sociopathic, like, well, you know, tell a white lie. It's, it's like sort of sociopathy on steroids, right, is then.

00:57:42,754 --> 00:57:45,379
SPEAKER_0:  You know, envy writ large is malignant narcissism.

00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:50,878
SPEAKER_1:  But just like you're saying, there's empathic attunement, as you said. So there's the mechanistic.

00:57:51,586 --> 00:57:57,822
SPEAKER_1:  aspect of empathy and sociopathy. And then there's the big label you get attached if you're just doing that thing regularly.

00:57:58,082 --> 00:57:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  I guess.

00:57:59,394 --> 00:58:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  living your life through that lens. Take care.

00:58:02,466 --> 00:58:04,990
SPEAKER_1:  And is there a nice spectrum that's like.

00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:09,694
SPEAKER_1:  narcissism, sociopathy and psychopathy? Is it all the same kind of

00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:12,094
SPEAKER_1:  Nice stroll through the woods.

00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:19,326
SPEAKER_0:  So off the cliff or? Not really because the words don't have clear definitions like psychopathy and sociopathy. There's no, there's no.

00:58:19,906 --> 00:58:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  There's no real definition of...

00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:29,310
SPEAKER_0:  psychopath or psychopathy, or does that mean someone's sociopathic but psychotic? Like there's really not a- we end up using those words colloquially.

00:58:29,538 --> 00:58:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  Right, which is why.

00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:34,974
SPEAKER_0:  you know, concepts that we can define, like you like envy, empathic attunement.

00:58:35,298 --> 00:58:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  narcissism, even though there might be nuances and definitions, like we can define them in ways that though're

00:58:41,538 --> 00:58:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  were widely accepted, including within.

00:58:43,682 --> 00:58:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  psychology and psychiatry.

00:58:45,442 --> 00:58:50,494
SPEAKER_1:  So it's nice to just think about this broad umbrella of narcissism and the levels to which it's benign or For those of you who don't know this yet, and like, subscribe to my channel, denied

00:58:51,042 --> 00:58:51,774
SPEAKER_1:  malignant.

00:58:52,002 --> 00:58:54,718
SPEAKER_1:  and then also separating into the different mechanisms.

00:58:55,522 --> 00:59:00,062
SPEAKER_1:  like interaction by interaction, sometimes can be narcissistic but broadly speaking.

00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:03,006
SPEAKER_1:  Do you do everything through the lens of malignant narcissism?

00:59:03,266 --> 00:59:04,190
SPEAKER_1:  That makes you a

00:59:05,346 --> 00:59:06,718
SPEAKER_1:  sociopath or

00:59:07,426 --> 00:59:08,766
SPEAKER_0:  a malignant narcissist.

00:59:09,218 --> 00:59:11,902
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, and the thing I would add to that is the thought about culture.

00:59:12,226 --> 00:59:15,934
SPEAKER_0:  It's like how does the cultures were in whether it's a culture of a household?

00:59:16,258 --> 00:59:19,262
SPEAKER_0:  Right? The culture of a community, the culture of a nation or the world.

00:59:19,554 --> 00:59:21,950
SPEAKER_0:  How does that impact?

00:59:22,274 --> 00:59:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  what unfolds in that person and then how does what unfolds in that person

00:59:26,242 --> 00:59:27,166
SPEAKER_0:  impact that culture.

00:59:27,394 --> 00:59:30,366
SPEAKER_1:  Well, that's the question is what unfolds in that person?

00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:34,430
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, how does culture affect it, but how does your own?

00:59:34,722 --> 00:59:36,094
SPEAKER_1:  psychological development.

00:59:36,834 --> 00:59:37,534
SPEAKER_1:  on Foldit.

00:59:37,826 --> 00:59:40,542
SPEAKER_1:  because narcissism in leaders is the most.

00:59:40,834 --> 00:59:41,694
SPEAKER_1:  impactful thing.

00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:42,494
SPEAKER_1:  Right.

00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:49,406
SPEAKER_1:  Who are the most impactful individuals? What is the most impact of individual psychology we have? Usually leaders of countries

00:59:49,922 --> 00:59:51,902
SPEAKER_1:  or leaders of major organizations and so on.

00:59:52,578 --> 00:59:55,454
SPEAKER_1:  And one of the things you mentioned was benign narcissism.

00:59:56,002 --> 00:59:57,118
SPEAKER_1:  That seems to be...

00:59:57,538 --> 00:59:59,070
SPEAKER_1:  aligned with success, right?

00:59:59,522 --> 01:00:00,958
SPEAKER_1:  If you care about your own success...

01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:05,022
SPEAKER_1:  that's going to be, you're more likely to be.

01:00:05,346 --> 01:00:07,198
SPEAKER_1:  have narcissistic tendencies, I suppose.

01:00:07,874 --> 01:00:08,254
SPEAKER_1:  U 15

01:00:08,994 --> 01:00:11,390
SPEAKER_1:  And so my question is when you.

01:00:12,194 --> 01:00:15,774
SPEAKER_1:  Follow that threat of narcissism to become the leader of a country.

01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:19,006
SPEAKER_1:  Now you have a lot of...

01:00:19,234 --> 01:00:23,614
SPEAKER_1:  new interesting psychological complexities to deal with like power.

01:00:24,034 --> 01:00:25,918
SPEAKER_1:  That old cliche that power corrupts.

01:00:27,106 --> 01:00:27,710
SPEAKER_1:  Does that?

01:00:28,482 --> 01:00:29,598
SPEAKER_1:  Is it possible?

01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:34,398
SPEAKER_1:  for power to corrupt the human mind, to where it pushes you farther and farther.

01:00:35,138 --> 01:00:37,598
SPEAKER_1:  into malignant narcissism.

01:00:38,242 --> 01:00:39,774
SPEAKER_1:  into this destructive envy.

01:00:40,354 --> 01:00:41,918
SPEAKER_1:  What are your thoughts on power?

01:00:42,178 --> 01:00:43,998
SPEAKER_1:  like the effect of power in the human mind.

01:00:45,314 --> 01:00:45,630
SPEAKER_0:  Thank you.

01:00:45,858 --> 01:00:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  Power is...

01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:00:49,026 --> 01:00:51,806
SPEAKER_0:  It's also an accentuator, right? It's an intensifier.

01:00:52,034 --> 01:00:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  Right, so.

01:00:53,506 --> 01:00:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  So I think it is.

01:00:55,362 --> 01:01:00,606
SPEAKER_0:  that there are people who can be sort of in a gray area where there are malignant narcissistic

01:01:00,898 --> 01:01:03,742
SPEAKER_0:  tendencies and behaviors.

01:01:04,066 --> 01:01:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  But there are also ways in which that person can think outside of themselves and think in a broader way and think kindly about others.

01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:11,582
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  and they're trying to navigate.

01:01:14,914 --> 01:01:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  whether they're aware or not that they're trying to navigate between one and the other. And then the allure of power is, well, just look, just exercise that power and you'll feel better, right? It'll show you, right, that you're good enough. Look at the power you have and whatever may be going on in the person's mind.

01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  that then power, yes, can.

01:01:31,426 --> 01:01:31,870
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

01:01:32,322 --> 01:01:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  I think that's why we have to have checks and balances, right? Because we don't-

01:01:36,002 --> 01:01:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we...

01:01:36,962 --> 01:01:43,582
SPEAKER_0:  We are all inscrutable to ourselves, let alone to others. So we must have checks and balances and we should always have them on ourselves.

01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:48,510
SPEAKER_0:  as well as on others. We should want that for the health of ourselves and the world around us.

01:01:48,962 --> 01:01:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  uh... so i think all of that is

01:01:51,426 --> 01:01:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  true but there are also people who don't necessarily.

01:01:54,818 --> 01:01:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  become corrupted by...

01:01:57,186 --> 01:02:09,982
SPEAKER_0:  There can be an understanding and a grounding that they're a steward of power, a shepherd. There are ways people describe utilizing power and utilizing it in a benign way.

01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  that then.

01:02:11,554 --> 01:02:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  fosters the healthy aspects.

01:02:14,018 --> 01:02:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  of self, right? So like gratitude and humility, right? If I mean, if we could.

01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  add a healthy dose of gratitude and humility to everyone or to our society, there would be a sea change. But how do you feel gratitude? How do you feel humility? Good night<|te|>, my dear.

01:02:28,098 --> 01:02:29,470
SPEAKER_0:  Those things are incompatible.

01:02:29,858 --> 01:02:30,334
SPEAKER_0:  with.

01:02:30,754 --> 01:02:34,398
SPEAKER_0:  narcissism envy, right, with really the bad pole of things that were.

01:02:34,722 --> 01:02:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  talking about and part of the reason I

01:02:36,546 --> 01:02:40,446
SPEAKER_0:  I'm so focused in my work and in really what runs through all of my.

01:02:40,706 --> 01:02:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  about life is the impact of trauma, right? Because trauma-

01:02:44,578 --> 01:02:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  creates these false lessons and it walls us off from truth, then it starts to point towards

01:02:50,818 --> 01:02:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  the unhealthy ways of

01:02:53,954 --> 01:02:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  of trying to feel better.

01:02:56,002 --> 01:02:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  about ourselves, but we have the health in us.

01:02:59,938 --> 01:03:08,798
SPEAKER_0:  And two, we have those seeds of health too that can grow into being a steward of power and sharing power, being considerate and kind. We see a lot of that in the world too.

01:03:09,154 --> 01:03:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  Right, it's not all just.

01:03:10,626 --> 01:03:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  the evil we you know we see plenty people who

01:03:12,994 --> 01:03:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  do good and who are generous of spirit. We have both in us, and it is, I think, your time at our culture and the seeds that we sow and the climate that we set, including putting governors in boundaries. How do we rein in or say that the more aggressive, the more envious or destructive is unacceptable?

01:03:31,778 --> 01:03:33,470
SPEAKER_0:  Right? How do we foster?

01:03:33,762 --> 01:03:41,150
SPEAKER_0:  the part that's kind and considerate and reflective and slow to judge of like, hey, let's learn a little bit more. Like how do we foster that and.

01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  I think a lot of that comes back to...

01:03:43,106 --> 01:03:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  to early childhood education. I mean, I think we don't do nearly enough to protect.

01:03:47,234 --> 01:03:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  and as a corollary to that, we don't do nearly enough to educate.

01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:53,726
SPEAKER_0:  children. I want to write a book.

01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  The second book I write is going to be everything I needed to know about life.

01:03:58,274 --> 01:04:02,366
SPEAKER_0:  I learned as a second year post-graduate psychiatry resident.

01:04:02,594 --> 01:04:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  Why? Why then did I learn so much about?

01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  unconscious motivation, about the impact of trauma, about how we can be envious and how we can act out, even about how our emotions trump logic in us. Why, why—

01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  Why don't we teach these things?

01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  when we're young enough to understand, like, why is that other kid bullying me?

01:04:23,394 --> 01:04:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  Right? Or why just because I'm a little bit bigger, do I want to go bump that other kid on the head?

01:04:29,378 --> 01:04:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  But what's going on?

01:04:31,106 --> 01:04:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  that we don't.

01:04:32,098 --> 01:04:36,734
SPEAKER_0:  We don't do those things, we're just tripping ahead of ourselves and we don't stop and think.

01:04:37,442 --> 01:04:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  How are we using our resources? How are we using our resources?

01:04:39,970 --> 01:04:45,854
SPEAKER_0:  How are we shepherding forward the next generation, which by the way is a generation that's going to determine our fates too as we get older?

01:04:46,914 --> 01:04:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  We don't.

01:04:47,618 --> 01:04:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  you know, do that. I often think of like in the Olympics, you know, you see like the great sprinters, right? And they've got to come out of the blocks perfectly, right? So if they come out of the blocks a little bit too fast, they're going to fall over, right? They're going to just fall forward and

01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:07,358
SPEAKER_0:  And I often see that in my head about us as humans and as a culture that we're rushing so far forward we don't stop and say wait let's-

01:05:07,746 --> 01:05:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  Let's keep the basics.

01:05:09,154 --> 01:05:12,414
SPEAKER_0:  Here are the basic techniques of how are we navigating forward.

01:05:12,866 --> 01:05:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  in life or do we just throw all those away? Because I can get some benefit by-

01:05:17,794 --> 01:05:20,670
SPEAKER_0:  saying that you're bad even though what's being leveled against you is wrong.

01:05:21,346 --> 01:05:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  Right? Like what? Why? Why? Do I take that? Or do I say, no, there's something more important here.

01:05:26,562 --> 01:05:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  that we want to shepherd forward in ourselves as a culture. And I think...

01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  preventing childhood trauma.

01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  and changing the ways that we educate children and adults could again make a sea change.

01:05:36,994 --> 01:05:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  and maybe set us on a course towards.

01:05:39,298 --> 01:05:42,174
SPEAKER_0:  even towards a greater likelihood of survival as a species.

01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:43,102
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so.

01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:47,710
SPEAKER_1:  talking to like people in elementary school.

01:05:48,418 --> 01:05:49,726
SPEAKER_1:  about human nature.

01:05:50,594 --> 01:05:52,670
SPEAKER_1:  and teaching them was so.

01:05:53,186 --> 01:05:55,646
SPEAKER_1:  uh... how people can be resentful and envious and

01:05:56,194 --> 01:05:58,302
SPEAKER_1:  how to deal with your emotions.

01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:04,254
SPEAKER_1:  How to yeah, so these basic interaction things about human relationships about friendships

01:06:04,674 --> 01:06:05,438
SPEAKER_1:  Bob the trail.

01:06:06,050 --> 01:06:08,158
SPEAKER_1:  about love, about all those things.

01:06:08,514 --> 01:06:09,758
SPEAKER_1:  Like it just...

01:06:10,114 --> 01:06:12,126
SPEAKER_1:  It's actually strange that we don't.

01:06:12,898 --> 01:06:16,446
SPEAKER_1:  kind of hope the parents talk about that kind of stuff. Right.

01:06:16,674 --> 01:06:18,782
SPEAKER_1:  But then the parents often...

01:06:19,682 --> 01:06:22,526
SPEAKER_1:  uh you know need therapy themselves

01:06:22,658 --> 01:06:24,030
SPEAKER_0:  The parents didn't learn it.

01:06:24,418 --> 01:06:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I'm not joking that I was mad.

01:06:27,778 --> 01:06:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  You know, second year after medical school, like how is it? I think of even things in my own life and-

01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:33,182
SPEAKER_0:  You know how I...

01:06:33,602 --> 01:06:39,166
SPEAKER_0:  You know, how much shame I felt after my brother's suicide. I was already an adult, right? As a young adult, but-

01:06:39,426 --> 01:06:40,478
SPEAKER_0:  I felt so much...

01:06:40,834 --> 01:06:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  Shame, I didn't, like I had no understanding that.

01:06:43,778 --> 01:06:46,878
SPEAKER_0:  that, oh, it's a reflex to Trump.

01:06:47,394 --> 01:06:50,558
SPEAKER_0:  right, to feel guilt and shame. And that of course I was feeling.

01:06:50,978 --> 01:06:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  that it didn't mean it was true because I felt it.

01:06:54,338 --> 01:07:04,894
SPEAKER_0:  But I mapped the fact that I felt ashamed to the fact that I should have felt guilty and ashamed and it like led to some very negative things in my life that I had to sort of pull myself back from and recover from.

01:07:05,858 --> 01:07:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't know that. I didn't know the automaticity of the reflex and how pervasive it can be and how it can put blinders on us. And I mean, it's just one example.

01:07:15,426 --> 01:07:18,366
SPEAKER_0:  But it's an example of something big that happens to people.

01:07:18,658 --> 01:07:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  that we don't learn about. And I find myself sometimes.

01:07:21,794 --> 01:07:27,998
SPEAKER_0:  having conversations with a person. So I still do a lot of clinical care of having conversations with a person after a tragedy.

01:07:28,354 --> 01:07:31,006
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm saying, I can't believe it. Again, I'm saying.

01:07:31,426 --> 01:07:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  the things that this person didn't learn.

01:07:33,346 --> 01:07:39,710
SPEAKER_0:  in elementary school because like none of us did, right? And then look at the misery and the suffering. And then I think this is one person among how many.

01:07:40,066 --> 01:07:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  millions among us who

01:07:41,954 --> 01:07:43,806
SPEAKER_0:  who try and go about their way.

01:07:44,066 --> 01:07:48,542
SPEAKER_0:  without knowing things that are easily knowable because they don't even know that they're knowable because we don't know

01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  teach them.

01:07:50,594 --> 01:07:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  So how to deal with trauma.

01:07:52,674 --> 01:07:54,366
SPEAKER_1:  The trauma happens, first of all.

01:07:55,138 --> 01:07:56,126
SPEAKER_1:  uh... that

01:07:56,386 --> 01:07:57,950
SPEAKER_1:  suffering can happen.

01:07:58,402 --> 01:08:00,830
SPEAKER_1:  and small trauma and big trauma.

01:08:01,474 --> 01:08:02,430
SPEAKER_1:  all that can happen.

01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:04,414
SPEAKER_1:  and there's natural ways to deal with it.

01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:07,710
SPEAKER_1:  So in the case of traumas, you write about.

01:08:08,546 --> 01:08:08,958
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:12,542
SPEAKER_1:  You can also just talk about some more of the details of that.

01:08:12,834 --> 01:08:16,030
SPEAKER_1:  is it's good to uh... bring to the surface to talk about it too

01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:18,366
SPEAKER_1:  not be ashamed to hide it inside.

01:08:18,658 --> 01:08:22,078
SPEAKER_1:  to be some kind of secret that it's actually.

01:08:23,458 --> 01:08:32,478
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, there's a lot of positive things to say here, at least from my perspective. One is it's discussing trauma and dealing with trauma together with other human beings by talking about it.

01:08:32,802 --> 01:08:34,974
SPEAKER_1:  is a path to deep friendship and intimacy.

01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:35,966
SPEAKER_1:  with those people.

01:08:36,706 --> 01:08:38,430
SPEAKER_1:  There's a dark.

01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:39,358
SPEAKER_1:  aspect.

01:08:39,586 --> 01:08:40,830
SPEAKER_1:  to trauma, to war.

01:08:41,474 --> 01:08:42,078
SPEAKER_1:  that...

01:08:43,042 --> 01:08:44,926
SPEAKER_1:  communicating it or sharing it?

01:08:45,922 --> 01:08:46,558
SPEAKER_1:  bonds you.

01:08:46,850 --> 01:08:47,198
SPEAKER_1:  Yes.

01:08:47,426 --> 01:08:53,790
SPEAKER_1:  So like the other side of trauma is like love, is you need that hardship, not you don't need it.

01:08:54,050 --> 01:09:00,030
SPEAKER_1:  But hardship and trauma can often be a catalyst for a deep human connection. If you bring it to the surface, it's supposed to kind of...

01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:05,662
SPEAKER_1:  on the inside. If we can just linger on it because you've been through a few

01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:08,702
SPEAKER_1:  very traumatic events in your life.

01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:11,614
SPEAKER_1:  when you were 25 years old, as you mentioned.

01:09:12,002 --> 01:09:13,406
SPEAKER_1:  Your brother committed suicide.

01:09:15,298 --> 01:09:17,278
SPEAKER_1:  What did that event teach you about life?

01:09:18,914 --> 01:09:19,390
SPEAKER_1:  Death.

01:09:20,194 --> 01:09:21,598
SPEAKER_1:  and about the human mind.

01:09:23,394 --> 01:09:25,598
SPEAKER_0:  What certainly brought me face to face with.

01:09:26,082 --> 01:09:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  the truths of.

01:09:27,394 --> 01:09:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  Life and death.

01:09:28,802 --> 01:09:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  because I had not had.

01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  A major trauma before then?

01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  So there wasn't a major trauma sort of in my developmental years.

01:09:37,026 --> 01:09:38,814
SPEAKER_0:  that what can carry forward.

01:09:39,106 --> 01:09:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  is a sort of omnipotence defense, right? I mean, the thought is that when we're toddlers, we all have like an omnipotence defense, which is like, I can just try and get up and run and move. And if I run into something, I'll get up and do it again, right? That we kind of have to.

01:09:52,514 --> 01:10:03,486
SPEAKER_0:  and it's partly the protection of the parent, et cetera, but we think we can get out there in the world and do things and we just do. And if we don't have major traumas, we can sort of carry through the, oh, like bad things aren't gonna happen to me.

01:10:03,714 --> 01:10:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  I know that they're there and I know they happen to people, but they don't happen to hear me.

01:10:08,194 --> 01:10:08,542
SPEAKER_0:  Right.

01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:10:09,858 --> 01:10:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  sometimes what will happen is being confronted with such a tragedy.

01:10:13,698 --> 01:10:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  wipes that away very, very quickly. And then the person feels extremely exposed. Like, oh, I thought.

01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  that I was gonna be okay and now I know that I'm not, and then, and that can start to lead to, and what does that mean? Now, is this all coming for me?

01:10:29,506 --> 01:10:36,478
SPEAKER_0:  now? Did I get so lucky for 25 years, nothing bad happened? Nothing but bad things are going to be happening. Am I cursed?

01:10:36,802 --> 01:10:39,678
SPEAKER_0:  is my family cursed, right? And I think that

01:10:39,906 --> 01:10:42,814
SPEAKER_0:  leads to say what the learning about the human mind.

01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  In retrospect, I think I understood at the time to some degree.

01:10:47,842 --> 01:10:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  but not like I do now, I can put words to it now, right? like HOW!?

01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:53,790
SPEAKER_0:  incredibly important.

01:10:54,082 --> 01:10:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  powerful.

01:10:55,010 --> 01:10:58,014
SPEAKER_0:  powerfully important negative emotion is.

01:10:58,338 --> 01:11:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  Right? That how a sense of guilt and shame and vulnerability.

01:11:02,946 --> 01:11:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  can just pervade.

01:11:05,602 --> 01:11:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  our entire life.

01:11:07,298 --> 01:11:10,430
SPEAKER_0:  So all of a sudden we're swimming in a very different soup.

01:11:10,754 --> 01:11:13,662
SPEAKER_0:  and it's a frightening soup and it's a toxic soup.

01:11:14,146 --> 01:11:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm most struck.

01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  by that and that

01:11:17,986 --> 01:11:20,702
SPEAKER_0:  goes along with the idea that we're not taught that.

01:11:21,346 --> 01:11:23,006
SPEAKER_0:  Emotion always beats logic.

01:11:23,426 --> 01:11:30,046
SPEAKER_0:  You know, like I think the idea of Descartes, the idea that we're rational creatures, you know, that kind of comes down to us through Western thought.

01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:30,942
SPEAKER_0:  is like

01:11:31,426 --> 01:11:34,238
SPEAKER_0:  not true. Like we're rational creatures.

01:11:34,722 --> 01:11:36,414
SPEAKER_0:  Only if there is an emotion.

01:11:37,378 --> 01:11:44,542
SPEAKER_0:  grabbing for our attention, right? Like, you know, we're attending to one another, we're being very logical, right? What we're doing now, if we heard a frightening noise...

01:11:44,898 --> 01:11:55,710
SPEAKER_0:  right outside the door, we'd be entirely different. The emotion would trump everything. It's like, stop paying attention to this. Now safety is at stake and we'd think differently, feel differently, behave differently, right?

01:11:56,130 --> 01:11:59,294
SPEAKER_0:  This is what happens to us, not just in situations where...

01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  Something drags us from one emotional state to another, but it can be very, very pervasive. So my sense of anger...

01:12:06,946 --> 01:12:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  Frustration.

01:12:08,194 --> 01:12:22,206
SPEAKER_0:  inadequacy and then soothing in unhealthy ways, soothing by drinking too much and then kind of hating myself in the first place and hating the world around me and then starting to think, well, who cares what happens? You know, there's some very dark thoughts.

01:12:22,626 --> 01:12:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  And choices.

01:12:24,098 --> 01:12:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  that came from...

01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  a changed perspective of self in the world.

01:12:29,442 --> 01:12:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  So what do you do in that?

01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:32,734
SPEAKER_1:  Um, because of trauma.

01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:35,134
SPEAKER_1:  Again, small or large.

01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:37,662
SPEAKER_1:  You find yourself.

01:12:38,530 --> 01:12:42,174
SPEAKER_1:  swimming or drowning in a soup of negative emotion.

01:12:43,266 --> 01:12:43,742
SPEAKER_1:  What do you do?

01:12:45,506 --> 01:12:49,982
SPEAKER_1:  What do you do with that emotion? I mean, we don't have to even talk about trauma, I think.

01:12:50,338 --> 01:12:51,678
SPEAKER_1:  The interesting thing is...

01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:54,558
SPEAKER_1:  You know, um.

01:12:55,138 --> 01:12:57,950
SPEAKER_1:  Any one of us throughout the day can find ourselves.

01:12:58,690 --> 01:13:01,758
SPEAKER_1:  taking a bit of a dip in the pool of negative emotion.

01:13:02,498 --> 01:13:03,166
SPEAKER_0:  What do we do with that?

01:13:03,810 --> 01:13:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  The first thing is to separate.

01:13:05,698 --> 01:13:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  how we feel.

01:13:07,042 --> 01:13:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  from what's true.

01:13:08,866 --> 01:13:10,494
SPEAKER_0:  is we don't do a good job of that.

01:13:10,722 --> 01:13:12,574
SPEAKER_0:  as humans if I feel

01:13:13,410 --> 01:13:16,798
SPEAKER_0:  bad about myself, it's very easy then I conclude like, I'm bad.

01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  If I feel ashamed of myself, I conclude I'm a terrible person who's shameful.

01:13:21,826 --> 01:13:33,918
SPEAKER_0:  Right? This is the, you know, there's an old psychodynamic concept of what they used to call an observing ego. It still gets called that. It's not ego in the sense of arrogance, right? It's the ability to step outside and to see ourselves.

01:13:34,306 --> 01:13:34,654
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

01:13:34,882 --> 01:13:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  So that's what lets us keep the difference between our feelings.

01:13:39,234 --> 01:13:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  and what we know to be true. We could be very angry at someone. So I think that person's terrible. I think the person's stupid.

01:13:44,642 --> 01:13:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  I think that right now because like something negative is passed between us.

01:13:47,938 --> 01:13:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  this inside of me, it's just because of how I feel. Like when I can separate that, how do I actually think about that person, right? And-

01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we get.

01:13:56,130 --> 01:13:57,598
SPEAKER_0:

01:13:58,050 --> 01:14:00,702
SPEAKER_0:  so frequently by how we feel.

01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:04,254
SPEAKER_0:  because how we think, therefore what we believe.

01:14:04,546 --> 01:14:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  right, just kind of comes on its heels as if the feeling is dragging it along

01:14:08,770 --> 01:14:12,606
SPEAKER_0:  And I've been struck by that. That's one of the things that has struck me so.

01:14:13,442 --> 01:14:20,958
SPEAKER_0:  the most, right, among the very most in 20 years of working as a psychiatrist is how we are led by our our

01:14:21,218 --> 01:14:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  feelings or emotions as if they are truth and then they create truth.

01:14:25,378 --> 01:14:25,982
SPEAKER_0:  Because...

01:14:26,594 --> 01:14:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  we embrace what they're telling us as true.

01:14:29,986 --> 01:14:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  And that is, I think, incredibly, I think it's how people learn prejudice. I think it's how people learn self-hatred. I think it's how we learn so many destructive behaviors. And then the blinders on us come in more and more and more.

01:14:43,618 --> 01:14:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  and more. So separate, you know, we're driven by what we feel unless we understand.

01:14:47,874 --> 01:14:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  that what we feel is different from what we.

01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  know to be true or what we can decide on one way or another.

01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:54,398
SPEAKER_1:  And that requires.

01:14:55,266 --> 01:14:59,198
SPEAKER_1:  Realizing and catching the emotions themselves, realizing that it's an emotion.

01:14:59,810 --> 01:15:02,590
SPEAKER_1:  A feeling comes into your mind overtakes you, a feeling of...

01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:03,646
SPEAKER_1:  Anger.

01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:07,262
SPEAKER_1:  Dislike, hatred, all of that just comes in.

01:15:07,714 --> 01:15:09,182
SPEAKER_1:  I think why did that person just

01:15:10,466 --> 01:15:13,310
SPEAKER_1:  me off in traffic or something like that, that feeling.

01:15:13,602 --> 01:15:14,750
SPEAKER_1:  to where you just kinda...

01:15:15,042 --> 01:15:16,446
SPEAKER_1:  Take it as a feeling and.

01:15:17,122 --> 01:15:22,142
SPEAKER_1:  Realize it's a feeling that doesn't represent some deep reality about the world that's fundamental or you

01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:23,742
SPEAKER_1:  They just kinda watch it?

01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:24,318
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:15:25,922 --> 01:15:26,686
SPEAKER_1:  Let it pass.

01:15:27,618 --> 01:15:29,182
SPEAKER_1:  which is the natural way of things.

01:15:29,602 --> 01:15:31,614
SPEAKER_0:  We'll decide if it means anything.

01:15:31,842 --> 01:15:34,462
SPEAKER_0:  You know, if I'm mad, right, someone cut me off and...

01:15:34,946 --> 01:15:40,446
SPEAKER_0:  I feel hatred and I want to destroy them, right? To stop and think, look, I've got that in me. I can...

01:15:40,738 --> 01:15:44,222
SPEAKER_0:  You know, are the stressors running too high in my life? Like, is it really good? Should I be-

01:15:44,578 --> 01:15:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  Should I be on this road 10 minutes behind schedule? Like, what am I really doing? We can learn.

01:15:50,626 --> 01:15:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  But yes, it's an observation skill, right? And it's an observation skill that we can.

01:15:55,266 --> 01:16:05,214
SPEAKER_0:  develop. I often think of it as something called the tapestry theory, which I think initially was a theodicy of explaining. I believe this is true. I'm not sure of this.

01:16:05,474 --> 01:16:08,958
SPEAKER_0:  The idea was that, oh, we don't see God's plan.

01:16:09,186 --> 01:16:19,326
SPEAKER_0:  because we're up too close to it, right? Like as if there was a beautiful tapestry on the wall and we're standing right up it, we're only gonna see one part of it, we need to stand back from it. And-

01:16:19,554 --> 01:16:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  And I remember learning that religion studies class being really fascinated.

01:16:23,458 --> 01:16:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  with that at the time and I think that.

01:16:26,594 --> 01:16:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  There are a lot of things we do that.

01:16:28,418 --> 01:16:29,726
SPEAKER_0:  Right, and in...

01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:32,030
SPEAKER_0:  training ourselves to have an observing ego.

01:16:32,258 --> 01:16:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  What we're saying is...

01:16:33,666 --> 01:16:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  Hey, like just the busyness of life or my own impulses or the pool of emotions are trying to pull me up right close to whatever tapestry there is there. And I want to sort of resist that. I mean, I'm better off if I really stay further behind it and then I make a choice if I want to come.

01:16:49,826 --> 01:17:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  If there's some really positive emotion, or it's friendship, or it's love, or it's nurturing, you know what, let me come right up to this, right? But I wanna choose when I'm doing that. I don't want...

01:17:01,026 --> 01:17:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  some drive I didn't decide to like take me by the back of the head and

01:17:04,994 --> 01:17:06,942
SPEAKER_0:  put me up against that tapestry.

01:17:07,330 --> 01:17:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:17:08,002 --> 01:17:09,502
SPEAKER_1:  The interesting exercise.

01:17:10,786 --> 01:17:15,550
SPEAKER_1:  For me and I think for a lot of people in modern civilization is the the internet with social media

01:17:16,354 --> 01:17:16,958
SPEAKER_1:  that.

01:17:17,186 --> 01:17:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  it.

01:17:17,858 --> 01:17:21,150
SPEAKER_1:  It's almost like going to the gym or something like that. At least that's the way I see it.

01:17:21,602 --> 01:17:23,038
SPEAKER_1:  Because there's a bunch of forces.

01:17:24,226 --> 01:17:24,638
SPEAKER_1:  Un-

01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:26,238
SPEAKER_1:  social media that

01:17:26,466 --> 01:17:28,030
SPEAKER_1:  are trying to make you feel things.

01:17:28,898 --> 01:17:32,798
SPEAKER_1:  Most of it is kind of in the negative space of feelings.

01:17:33,506 --> 01:17:34,238
SPEAKER_1:  U a

01:17:34,562 --> 01:17:36,286
SPEAKER_1:  There is actually a strong gravity.

01:17:36,514 --> 01:17:38,494
SPEAKER_1:  to negative feelings for some reason.

01:17:39,042 --> 01:17:39,646
SPEAKER_1:  and so

01:17:39,874 --> 01:17:40,222
SPEAKER_1:  The

01:17:40,738 --> 01:17:44,670
SPEAKER_1:  uh... and the brain notices them more and i don't know what that pool is but it's there

01:17:45,026 --> 01:17:47,774
SPEAKER_1:  and you get to observe it on social media. Like if you actually just.

01:17:48,002 --> 01:17:49,278
SPEAKER_1:  Scroll through social media.

01:17:50,722 --> 01:17:54,206
SPEAKER_1:  You feel the gravitational pull of negative emotions.

01:17:54,626 --> 01:17:57,374
SPEAKER_1:  And I just see as a kind of exercise of like.

01:17:58,402 --> 01:18:01,246
SPEAKER_1:  You feel the pull just like when you go to the gym, there's a resistance.

01:18:01,602 --> 01:18:08,670
SPEAKER_1:  and I practice like a stepping way to look at the tapestry. Right? And there's different mechanisms I think all of us have to learn.

01:18:08,930 --> 01:18:09,694
SPEAKER_1:  for me.

01:18:10,434 --> 01:18:14,558
SPEAKER_1:  There's a kind of, you mentioned gratitude and humility.

01:18:15,714 --> 01:18:16,318
SPEAKER_1:  So...

01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:18,334
SPEAKER_1:  Like if somebody

01:18:18,722 --> 01:18:21,694
SPEAKER_1:  If it's me personally, I've recently gotten attacked.

01:18:21,922 --> 01:18:22,782
SPEAKER_1:  places here and there.

01:18:23,266 --> 01:18:27,070
SPEAKER_1:  uh... uh... you know if if they're saying that they're much smarter than me

01:18:27,362 --> 01:18:29,886
SPEAKER_1:  I practice kind of humility, like you mentioned.

01:18:30,114 --> 01:18:32,126
SPEAKER_1:  And I kind of imagine that they are smarter than me.

01:18:32,578 --> 01:18:34,622
SPEAKER_1:  Those things like help me to kind of like

01:18:34,882 --> 01:18:35,774
SPEAKER_1:  pull away like.

01:18:36,066 --> 01:18:39,454
SPEAKER_1:  and then maybe they have a lesson to teach me. Like I don't take their sort of-

01:18:39,938 --> 01:18:41,886
SPEAKER_1:  Negative comments to heart?

01:18:42,114 --> 01:18:51,806
SPEAKER_1:  But I imagine the human being and like that they might have a lesson to teach me. And in general, when it's more amorphous kind of negative feeling, I think the other thing is the gratitude.

01:18:52,194 --> 01:18:52,766
SPEAKER_1:  Just like.

01:18:53,314 --> 01:18:55,550
SPEAKER_1:  uh... different versions almost meme-

01:18:55,970 --> 01:18:58,558
SPEAKER_1:  meme-ifiable versions of like, oh, this is pretty cool.

01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:02,110
SPEAKER_1:  Like we got a thing going here. There's a human civilization like.

01:19:02,722 --> 01:19:04,766
SPEAKER_1:  bickering and having a little fun like lunch.

01:19:05,730 --> 01:19:06,366
SPEAKER_1:  food fight.

01:19:06,946 --> 01:19:09,662
SPEAKER_1:  And it's kind of cool. Like we get to interact in this way.

01:19:09,922 --> 01:19:11,134
SPEAKER_1:  And...

01:19:11,778 --> 01:19:21,406
SPEAKER_1:  There's a bit of humor. There's, it's like Thanksgiving dinner. Like if you, like Thanksgiving dinner, if you're arguing about politics, it can feel like really intense. Like, I can't believe you said this, but if you zoom out, it's like.

01:19:21,826 --> 01:19:22,366
SPEAKER_1:  Family

01:19:22,626 --> 01:19:23,262
SPEAKER_1:  This is like...

01:19:23,490 --> 01:19:26,910
SPEAKER_1:  This is amazing. So that kind of feeling really helps.

01:19:27,266 --> 01:19:31,038
SPEAKER_1:  And, but it's like, it really is like going to the gym. It's like building up a muscle.

01:19:31,874 --> 01:19:33,118
SPEAKER_1:  To be able to, um.

01:19:34,786 --> 01:19:36,286
SPEAKER_1:  Pull away from those emotions, I-

01:19:37,570 --> 01:19:40,702
SPEAKER_1:  I don't think I get to practice that kind of emotion in regular day to day life.

01:19:41,122 --> 01:19:43,134
SPEAKER_1:  like you can't it's hard to get those reps.

01:19:43,490 --> 01:19:48,286
SPEAKER_1:  On social media you can really get the reps in. It's kind of cool. Like that's the way I see social media.

01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:51,102
SPEAKER_1:  is a chance to sort of practice that stoicism.

01:19:51,682 --> 01:19:57,470
SPEAKER_1:  of gratitude, of humility, of loving other people in the face of this negative emotion, all that.

01:19:58,114 --> 01:19:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  Yes and.

01:19:59,682 --> 01:20:05,758
SPEAKER_0:  There's a certain kind of psychotherapy that talks a lot about this idea that everything is as it should be.

01:20:05,986 --> 01:20:07,134
SPEAKER_0:  Right, which doesn't mean.

01:20:07,746 --> 01:20:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  from some moral or justice point. It's just that often if you look at things,

01:20:13,346 --> 01:20:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  one thing leads to another to another to another in a way that's actually very, very predictable.

01:20:19,042 --> 01:20:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  even though we might be surprised about it.

01:20:21,026 --> 01:20:23,806
SPEAKER_0:  Right? So an example, so I would.

01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:24,862
SPEAKER_0:  Say that.

01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:29,118
SPEAKER_0:  Gratitude often does come along with a healthy price.

01:20:29,602 --> 01:20:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  Right? So you could say in the example you gave,

01:20:33,218 --> 01:20:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  Here I'm being assailed on social media.

01:20:36,386 --> 01:20:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  So you can say, well.

01:20:37,730 --> 01:20:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  there was a time I sat out, I set forth to impact people, right? To be able to reach people and to impact them.

01:20:45,634 --> 01:20:50,110
SPEAKER_0:  Right? And look, I feel a sense of both gratitude and pride that I've done that.

01:20:50,338 --> 01:20:52,478
SPEAKER_0:  right? Because you did it because of your

01:20:52,738 --> 01:20:57,214
SPEAKER_0:  Your effort, right? Your work, your intelligence, your thoughts, like you're responsible for it, right?

01:20:57,442 --> 01:20:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  but also...

01:20:59,010 --> 01:21:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  you feel gratitude because any one of us who's here and has any opportunity has reason to feel immense gratitude, right? So then you can say, okay.

01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  What's actually going on here is something success.

01:21:09,346 --> 01:21:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  I set out to do something.

01:21:11,298 --> 01:21:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  and I'm doing it.

01:21:12,962 --> 01:21:13,374
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

01:21:14,562 --> 01:21:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:21:15,138 --> 01:21:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  What it brings with it absolutely includes being a sale.

01:21:19,138 --> 01:21:23,326
SPEAKER_0:  There's no surprise there, right? That because of, you know, people who have...

01:21:23,874 --> 01:21:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  Anything good serve as lightning rods for envy.

01:21:27,074 --> 01:21:29,502
SPEAKER_0:  So then, yes, there will be people who...

01:21:29,826 --> 01:21:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  want to make up lies or whatever they want to do because you become a lightning rod for envy by having succeeded at the thing you set out to do about which you can feel a healthy pride and gratitude. And then I think that kind of puts it in its place.

01:21:43,490 --> 01:21:45,534
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, you're still gonna make decisions about it, but.

01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  It makes sense then, like you have a mechanism of understanding it.

01:21:49,922 --> 01:21:50,558
SPEAKER_0:  that...

01:21:51,042 --> 01:21:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  not only makes sense to you, but reflects the truth of...

01:21:54,594 --> 01:21:58,526
SPEAKER_0:  what you actually have done and achieved and what's going on in the world around you.

01:21:58,850 --> 01:21:59,198
SPEAKER_1:  Well...

01:21:59,714 --> 01:22:02,910
SPEAKER_1:  I wonder if we're all kind of a little bit unique in this because for me

01:22:03,426 --> 01:22:04,062
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:22:04,482 --> 01:22:05,758
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe it's useful to connect.

01:22:06,114 --> 01:22:07,806
SPEAKER_1:  talk through my own experience of it.

01:22:08,226 --> 01:22:09,118
SPEAKER_1:  is, um,

01:22:09,698 --> 01:22:13,886
SPEAKER_1:  For me, I try to avoid, especially in those situations, to feel pride.

01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:15,966
SPEAKER_1:  Because...

01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:18,270
SPEAKER_1:  I'm just looking empirically.

01:22:19,522 --> 01:22:22,430
SPEAKER_1:  I feel way happier if I focus on humility.

01:22:23,106 --> 01:22:24,830
SPEAKER_1:  If I ever think...

01:22:25,090 --> 01:22:25,694
SPEAKER_1:  of like

01:22:25,922 --> 01:22:37,534
SPEAKER_1:  Oh yeah, you know, when you do something meaningful or you become more popular, you're going to experience these kinds of, I feel the attacks more and it's like me versus the world. That's the feeling that you start getting.

01:22:37,762 --> 01:22:39,518
SPEAKER_1:  And that does not create a pleasant feeling.

01:22:39,970 --> 01:22:41,982
SPEAKER_1:  So to me the pleasant feeling is like...

01:22:42,370 --> 01:22:43,582
SPEAKER_1:  uh... stepping away

01:22:43,842 --> 01:22:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  like kind of laughing at it all.

01:22:45,506 --> 01:22:49,630
SPEAKER_1:  Like with a smile and not like in a negative, like laughing at people, but just like.

01:22:49,986 --> 01:22:51,006
SPEAKER_1:  laughing at the...

01:22:51,330 --> 01:22:55,070
SPEAKER_1:  The theater of it, the circus of it, like this whole absurd existence we've got going on.

01:22:55,426 --> 01:22:57,438
SPEAKER_1:  And then just having a humility in like.

01:22:57,666 --> 01:23:01,598
SPEAKER_1:  Everybody has a lesson to teach me. It just makes me feel good. The pride thing.

01:23:02,082 --> 01:23:03,582
SPEAKER_1:  I do like feeling.

01:23:04,578 --> 01:23:07,390
SPEAKER_1:  when in a positive pool of emotion.

01:23:07,810 --> 01:23:08,958
SPEAKER_1:  So if I'm building a trinket...

01:23:09,922 --> 01:23:10,846
SPEAKER_1:  and I finish it.

01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:15,998
SPEAKER_1:  I'm like really happy with myself. Like I finished this thing. And I usually like to do that alone.

01:23:16,866 --> 01:23:19,614
SPEAKER_1:  Like I don't need an audience for Pride. I like to sit there.

01:23:19,874 --> 01:23:22,334
SPEAKER_1:  and just like, ooh, this is cool. I did that, you know?

01:23:22,690 --> 01:23:25,694
SPEAKER_1:  But I just I find that in social interactions.

01:23:26,690 --> 01:23:27,262
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:23:27,362 --> 01:23:28,487
SPEAKER_0:  Pride is just a danger.

01:23:28,487 --> 01:23:33,918
SPEAKER_1:  it's a dangerous drug for me because it like it's such a small

01:23:36,514 --> 01:23:46,942
SPEAKER_1:  It's a small step away from then losing all the humility and then you start getting very defensive and that's not going to, it just starts you on a spiral of negative emotion.

01:23:47,202 --> 01:23:49,150
SPEAKER_1:  But I also, I mean with

01:23:49,442 --> 01:23:53,598
SPEAKER_1:  with everybody you've mentioned this, you will probably sneak up to it in different directions.

01:23:54,242 --> 01:23:54,718
SPEAKER_1:  um...

01:23:55,106 --> 01:23:56,542
SPEAKER_1:  I do think there's different.

01:23:56,802 --> 01:23:57,982
SPEAKER_1:  brains that we all have.

01:23:58,978 --> 01:24:01,438
SPEAKER_1:  My brain is exceptionally self-critical.

01:24:03,042 --> 01:24:04,286
SPEAKER_1:  Non stop ışıkları.

01:24:04,642 --> 01:24:05,982
SPEAKER_1:  It's like an engine that's always there.

01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:08,094
SPEAKER_1:  And, uh...

01:24:09,410 --> 01:24:10,494
SPEAKER_1:  But at the same time...

01:24:10,946 --> 01:24:15,582
SPEAKER_1:  I'm able to zoom out and have gratitude. And it's as if there's like two brains.

01:24:16,098 --> 01:24:16,734
SPEAKER_1:  And they're like.

01:24:17,026 --> 01:24:18,462
SPEAKER_1:  cohabitating happily.

01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:25,118
SPEAKER_1:  And I can, uh, the better I get at this, the more I can use the one that's self-critical when I'm trying to be productive.

01:24:25,442 --> 01:24:29,470
SPEAKER_1:  Because naturally I'm super lazy. So I'm trying not to be less lazy. I'll be self-critical.

01:24:30,338 --> 01:24:31,422
SPEAKER_1:  And then, uh...

01:24:32,226 --> 01:24:36,926
SPEAKER_1:  When I'm not being lazy, when there's a special moment I want to enjoy that moment, I'll turn on this.

01:24:37,346 --> 01:24:38,302
SPEAKER_1:  The gratitude engine.

01:24:38,658 --> 01:24:40,542
SPEAKER_1:  I feel like generic advice that people would give.

01:24:40,770 --> 01:24:42,558
SPEAKER_1:  If your brain is self critical, that's not a good thing.

01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:44,734
SPEAKER_1:  Like you should probably get rid of that.

01:24:45,410 --> 01:24:46,238
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know about that.

01:24:46,786 --> 01:24:47,838
SPEAKER_1:  this is the warning

01:24:48,098 --> 01:24:50,334
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, like I kind of like it.

01:24:50,946 --> 01:24:54,078
SPEAKER_1:  I kind of like this grumpy old man that's in there.

01:24:54,594 --> 01:24:55,198
SPEAKER_1:  The Psych.

01:24:56,866 --> 01:24:58,558
SPEAKER_1:  That thing you did, that really sucked.

01:25:00,322 --> 01:25:06,526
SPEAKER_1:  I was like, and I kinda, you know, there's a movie, Grumpy Old Men. Okay, I like that grumpy voice, the grumpy cat is in there.

01:25:07,042 --> 01:25:09,502
SPEAKER_1:  And it's nice, but yeah, I can have a bad.

01:25:09,794 --> 01:25:10,302
SPEAKER_1:  Thanks and...

01:25:10,658 --> 01:25:12,542
SPEAKER_1:  relationships and on maybe

01:25:13,058 --> 01:25:18,238
SPEAKER_1:  My well-being maybe is to get older and all that kind of stuff. So yeah, you have to monitor all this kind of stuff, but

01:25:18,466 --> 01:25:21,470
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know, I don't know which one is like, because you've kind of.

01:25:21,698 --> 01:25:27,006
SPEAKER_1:  Highlighted it's good to have gratitude and humility. It's also good to have a little bit of pride. I wonder what that like

01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:30,270
SPEAKER_1:  set of ingredients for healthy what like

01:25:30,530 --> 01:25:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  healthy life looks like for each of us.

01:25:32,866 --> 01:25:35,166
SPEAKER_1:  whether we have to customize and figure out.

01:25:35,426 --> 01:25:36,158
SPEAKER_1:  what that is.

01:25:37,538 --> 01:25:39,998
SPEAKER_1:  Some of the cake is already baked is the problem.

01:25:40,258 --> 01:25:41,534
SPEAKER_1:  and because of the trauma.

01:25:41,762 --> 01:25:42,430
SPEAKER_1:  Like if I was like...

01:25:42,786 --> 01:25:45,982
SPEAKER_1:  eight years old maybe I could be a little more flexible. But at this point...

01:25:46,530 --> 01:25:49,214
SPEAKER_1:  Like you got the thing you got and it's hard to like.

01:25:49,826 --> 01:25:55,486
SPEAKER_0:  You can do a lot with it. You could. It may not be easy, but there's a lot of plasticity and a lot of pliability.

01:25:56,322 --> 01:25:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  across all ages.

01:25:58,562 --> 01:26:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  And people are different and they may be.

01:26:00,578 --> 01:26:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  idiosyncrasies of why one person is in a different place. As a general rule, I think the answer is absolutely yes.

01:26:06,818 --> 01:26:08,894
SPEAKER_0:  evolved and I've worked with people who've

01:26:09,474 --> 01:26:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  really change themselves and broaden their conception and understanding. you know they're in their 80s or

01:26:14,370 --> 01:26:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  I think we can do it at any stage of life.

01:26:17,186 --> 01:26:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  I would make a case for...

01:26:20,226 --> 01:26:29,630
SPEAKER_0:  for intrasychic, so not between people necessarily, right? But inside of oneself for the feeling of pride. And maybe if we call it self-esteem, right? Let's say we call it self-esteem.

01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  Right? Or we could call it healthy pride. We could put either...

01:26:32,834 --> 01:26:35,902
SPEAKER_0:  word to it, but if you think about what we're trying to avoid...

01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:38,494
SPEAKER_0:  is a sense of inadequacy.

01:26:38,722 --> 01:26:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  then it is good to sort of own what's ours.

01:26:42,050 --> 01:26:44,606
SPEAKER_0:  we can put ourselves a little bit out of balance.

01:26:44,994 --> 01:26:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:26:45,826 --> 01:26:50,110
SPEAKER_0:  either in terms of building up resentments or in terms of decreasing self-confidence.

01:26:50,434 --> 01:26:52,382
SPEAKER_0:  If we're not owning everything...

01:26:52,962 --> 01:26:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  That's ours, right? So a thought-

01:26:55,618 --> 01:26:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  thought I would have about...

01:26:57,890 --> 01:27:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  let's say about some pride or some self-esteem, right?

01:27:01,346 --> 01:27:07,742
SPEAKER_0:  It can work against vulnerability, right? Which we know can also in some situations push us towards jumping.

01:27:08,066 --> 01:27:11,838
SPEAKER_0:  boundary into envy and all of that. So, so, so let's think about vulnerability.

01:27:12,258 --> 01:27:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  If

01:27:12,962 --> 01:27:16,446
SPEAKER_0:  You conceive, okay, people are assailing me.

01:27:16,706 --> 01:27:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  and you just go to a place of gratitude.

01:27:20,130 --> 01:27:22,398
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it can send a message.

01:27:22,946 --> 01:27:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  that

01:27:24,098 --> 01:27:33,758
SPEAKER_0:  okay, I'm just lucky and I hope I continue to get lucky as opposed to like, that's not true, right? Like there's ability inside of me and discernment inside of me that tells me...

01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  I can have a greater sense of confidence that I'll navigate what comes my way.

01:27:38,242 --> 01:27:38,590
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

01:27:38,850 --> 01:27:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  So, because the pride or the self-esteem part.

01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:45,438
SPEAKER_0:  is owning what we've contributed to the goodness we've created.

01:27:45,922 --> 01:27:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  right, which does in a sense helps us feel better about ourselves. And it also helps us feel armed against say the slings and arrows of.

01:27:54,434 --> 01:27:57,809
SPEAKER_0:  you know, whatever outrageous fortune may come next. I don't know.

01:27:57,809 --> 01:28:05,278
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know, I don't know. Again, disagreeing with an expert here. Yes, I think that's generally good advice, but I think you mentioned vulnerability.

01:28:07,266 --> 01:28:09,470
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's like I've just been.

01:28:09,762 --> 01:28:12,414
SPEAKER_1:  doing a lot of research on rocket engines and fuel.

01:28:12,642 --> 01:28:14,014
SPEAKER_1:  Speaking of fuel...

01:28:14,434 --> 01:28:15,326
SPEAKER_1:  I just think...

01:28:15,906 --> 01:28:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  I get a lot from being vulnerable.

01:28:18,146 --> 01:28:19,902
SPEAKER_1:  because vulnerable leads to intimacy.

01:28:20,194 --> 01:28:21,822
SPEAKER_1:  in friendships and relationships.

01:28:22,082 --> 01:28:26,110
SPEAKER_1:  I get a lot from being intimately close with human beings, just on a friendship, on a...

01:28:26,370 --> 01:28:28,766
SPEAKER_1:  on like an ideal level.

01:28:29,186 --> 01:28:30,462
SPEAKER_1:  in conversations and so on.

01:28:31,042 --> 01:28:31,710
SPEAKER_1:  And so...

01:28:32,034 --> 01:28:33,182
SPEAKER_1:  I would rather...

01:28:33,410 --> 01:28:34,686
SPEAKER_1:  Error on the side.

01:28:35,170 --> 01:28:38,366
SPEAKER_1:  of vulnerability. To me, pride is destructive.

01:28:38,626 --> 01:28:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  I think I already...

01:28:43,170 --> 01:28:44,807
SPEAKER_0:  I already have a pretty good-

01:28:44,807 --> 01:28:45,918
SPEAKER_1:  engine that says like...

01:28:47,906 --> 01:28:48,734
SPEAKER_1:  Life is awesome.

01:28:49,282 --> 01:28:50,718
SPEAKER_1:  I don't need help for that.

01:28:51,010 --> 01:28:52,382
SPEAKER_1:  That's fine. That one is working.

01:28:53,474 --> 01:28:57,822
SPEAKER_1:  It's the it's I just feel like the way to face the world

01:28:58,626 --> 01:29:01,950
SPEAKER_1:  that's full of uncertainty, that could be full of cruelty is with...

01:29:02,562 --> 01:29:05,630
SPEAKER_1:  humility and gratitude. I don't know, this pride thing...

01:29:06,562 --> 01:29:07,326
SPEAKER_1:  feels like.

01:29:07,938 --> 01:29:10,942
SPEAKER_1:  I know that for a lot of people it's really important to

01:29:11,394 --> 01:29:11,966
SPEAKER_1:  Really v-

01:29:12,450 --> 01:29:13,214
SPEAKER_1:  Umm...

01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:18,334
SPEAKER_1:  really work on pride to make sure they don't crumble under the pressure of like

01:29:18,786 --> 01:29:21,854
SPEAKER_1:  that they don't give into this insecurity that destroys them.

01:29:22,210 --> 01:29:26,494
SPEAKER_1:  But I just, for me, empirically speaking, I seem to be happier.

01:29:27,106 --> 01:29:28,670
SPEAKER_1:  facing the world with humility.

01:29:29,090 --> 01:29:31,742
SPEAKER_1:  and just being grateful. The pride I'm really worried about.

01:29:32,322 --> 01:29:34,183
SPEAKER_1:  Like, it just feels more.

01:29:34,183 --> 01:29:35,262
SPEAKER_0:  destructive than anything.

01:29:36,002 --> 01:29:37,630
SPEAKER_0:  See what I think as you're telling me that.

01:29:38,082 --> 01:29:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  I don't want to be presumptuous, but I make some thoughts or some conclusions that tell me, hey, you're in a pretty healthy place, right? And the reason I say that is because...

01:29:46,562 --> 01:29:50,814
SPEAKER_0:  I agree completely about vulnerability. I mean, think about humility and gratitude.

01:29:51,074 --> 01:30:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  make us vulnerable, right? If like, wow, I'm grateful, thank you. I'm grateful for you. You know, we could get shot down or something, you know, something bad could happen, something could make us feel bad. So yes, we need vulnerability. If we try and eliminate vulnerability, we're living miles into the envy.

01:30:06,690 --> 01:30:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  you know, land, right?

01:30:08,194 --> 01:30:08,574
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:30:08,834 --> 01:30:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  you're describing a healthy vulnerability, but then my brain says that's because on the other side of this the seesaw so to speak

01:30:16,386 --> 01:30:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  has to be a healthy sense of self.

01:30:18,946 --> 01:30:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  whether we call it self-esteem or healthy pride. And then I'll cite what I think is the evidence for that is you describe the negative voice.

01:30:26,946 --> 01:30:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  Right? As like the grumpy cat.

01:30:28,578 --> 01:30:28,926
SPEAKER_0:  I'm f-

01:30:30,914 --> 01:30:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  that's a good negative voice to have, right? Because it's telling you like, hey, that wasn't your best. Like, come on, do better or, right? Like, you can do better. There's a negative voice in some ways.

01:30:41,090 --> 01:30:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  but it believes in you, right? It's where that voice could be, it could be a negative voice that says.

01:30:48,066 --> 01:30:51,262
SPEAKER_0:  You didn't do that well because you suck. You don't deserve anything.

01:30:52,162 --> 01:30:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

01:30:52,898 --> 01:31:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  Why should you even be alive? That's the negative voice that can gain so much force if there isn't a balance of healthy self-esteem. So I think because you're well-balanced...

01:31:03,554 --> 01:31:08,254
SPEAKER_0:  you know, you have what you need and then having more of it seems like, oh, that's not so good.

01:31:08,514 --> 01:31:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  But they're people whose negative voice isn't the...

01:31:11,042 --> 01:31:11,614
SPEAKER_0:  Grumpy.

01:31:12,226 --> 01:31:16,670
SPEAKER_0:  had, it's hateful, right? And then that's a person who needs to...

01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  to bring that into greater balance.

01:31:20,130 --> 01:31:21,374
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I think my, uh...

01:31:21,762 --> 01:31:24,798
SPEAKER_1:  My negative voice is like a grumpy cat that's like a.

01:31:25,474 --> 01:31:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  French existentialist, maybe a little bit of an nihilist.

01:31:28,770 --> 01:31:29,662
SPEAKER_1:  was just kinda...

01:31:29,826 --> 01:31:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  Sartre's cat.

01:31:32,226 --> 01:31:37,854
SPEAKER_1:  such as gas it doesn't get hateful it's not like a hitler cat so it's a little more it's a little more me there but like every single day

01:31:38,434 --> 01:31:41,214
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I guess there is kind of like this line that we've...

01:31:41,506 --> 01:31:44,894
SPEAKER_1:  across a couple of times between the benign and the malignant.

01:31:46,018 --> 01:31:48,222
SPEAKER_1:  uh... but of course if the monitor that line edges

01:31:49,218 --> 01:31:50,430
SPEAKER_1:  I think you have to be careful.

01:31:50,722 --> 01:31:51,166
SPEAKER_1:  Wow.

01:31:51,842 --> 01:31:53,950
SPEAKER_1:  when you face really difficult situations of.

01:31:55,522 --> 01:32:01,054
SPEAKER_1:  as you go on through life more and more difficulties you face a lot of loss and suffering especially later in life

01:32:02,178 --> 01:32:03,998
SPEAKER_1:  You have to be careful with that voice.

01:32:04,642 --> 01:32:09,470
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, that, that grumpy cat can get awfully confident. And then if you don't have any source of it.

01:32:10,050 --> 01:32:12,675
SPEAKER_1:  uh... positive emotions in your life you can become too

01:32:12,675 --> 01:32:13,630
SPEAKER_0:  heavy of a burden.

01:32:14,946 --> 01:32:16,574
SPEAKER_0:  which I think this leads us to a-

01:32:16,802 --> 01:32:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's a really important.

01:32:19,042 --> 01:32:22,814
SPEAKER_0:  right, that there are some people, like a significant subset of people.

01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  Who get?

01:32:24,066 --> 01:32:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  happier.

01:32:25,058 --> 01:32:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  as they get older, they have more contentment, a stronger sense of self. You might think...

01:32:29,378 --> 01:32:32,254
SPEAKER_0:  How could that ever happen, right? Like we're getting closer to death.

01:32:32,546 --> 01:32:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  We're accumulating insults, right? Like everything hurts a little bit more and we have less energy and we accumulate losses and traumas. Why would anyone-

01:32:40,226 --> 01:32:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  be healthier across time, be happier across time.

01:32:43,650 --> 01:32:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  And what we see is it's linked to the things that we're talking about, right? It's linked to say, let's say vulnerability versus pride. There's a good balance there, right? There's a lot of humility. There's a lot of self-esteem. The person is spending a lot of time standing back from the tapestry and looking.

01:32:59,202 --> 01:33:02,526
SPEAKER_0:  at it, right? And what can come into people?

01:33:02,754 --> 01:33:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  isn't sort of a sense of equanimity. Like I sort of.

01:33:05,666 --> 01:33:13,854
SPEAKER_0:  understand, you know, I'm being the best person I can be. I'm, you know, and that's not always even great. And there are things that I don't feel great about even while I'm trying to do that, but...

01:33:14,178 --> 01:33:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  But look, I'm being...

01:33:16,226 --> 01:33:23,550
SPEAKER_0:  I'm choosing to be, right? And that doesn't have to be in some big way. I'm not saying that means any one specific thing. That can mean the person who's...

01:33:23,778 --> 01:33:27,806
SPEAKER_0:  taking care of their cat and tending their garden. Like that's enough. We have to have

01:33:28,130 --> 01:33:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  you know, love, the ability to put good things out in the world, right, and to put our...

01:33:32,514 --> 01:33:43,038
SPEAKER_0:  our ability to work and be, to make things different out into the world and make things better. And if we're doing that, we get happier across time because we come to a sense of peace.

01:33:43,586 --> 01:33:48,350
SPEAKER_0:  with ourselves. I'm not supposed to be everything. I'm not supposed to do everything. I'm not supposed to fix everything.

01:33:48,674 --> 01:33:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  Right, I'm also not supposed to suffer all the time for the things I haven't.

01:33:51,906 --> 01:33:52,990
SPEAKER_0:  gotten right, you know what?

01:33:53,506 --> 01:33:56,702
SPEAKER_0:  I guess I'm kind of, and it leads back to Winnicott, right?

01:33:56,930 --> 01:33:59,006
SPEAKER_0:  the British physician of I am.

01:33:59,298 --> 01:34:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I'm good enough.

01:34:00,930 --> 01:34:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  And that seems to help people feel happy.

01:34:05,026 --> 01:34:14,366
SPEAKER_0:  you know, contentment and be generative and productive into later life. It's like that's what we all should be wanting. But it's even it's kind of an afterthought though. Some people are like that as opposed to...

01:34:14,594 --> 01:34:17,438
SPEAKER_0:  Wait a second, right? What's going on with them?

01:34:17,826 --> 01:34:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  and let's do all of.

01:34:21,122 --> 01:34:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  Albert Camus.

01:34:22,306 --> 01:34:24,030
SPEAKER_1:  writes in Mythicissivus, quote,

01:34:24,610 --> 01:34:28,222
SPEAKER_1:  There's only one real serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide.

01:34:29,282 --> 01:34:34,430
SPEAKER_1:  Deciding whether or not life is worth living is to answer the fundamental question in philosophy

01:34:35,586 --> 01:34:37,406
SPEAKER_1:  All other questions follow from that.

01:34:38,370 --> 01:34:40,158
SPEAKER_1:  So basically, to be or not to be.

01:34:41,794 --> 01:34:43,070
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think there's a...

01:34:43,714 --> 01:34:45,438
SPEAKER_1:  uh, truth to that statement.

01:34:46,082 --> 01:34:47,678
SPEAKER_1:  This question of why live?

01:34:48,162 --> 01:34:48,702
SPEAKER_1:  Ron?

01:34:49,314 --> 01:34:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  Mm-hmm.

01:34:51,106 --> 01:34:55,326
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think there's truth to that statement being a really, really important question for us to answer?

01:34:55,426 --> 01:34:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

01:34:56,482 --> 01:34:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

01:34:57,090 --> 01:34:57,790
SPEAKER_0:  I will see you next time.

01:34:58,786 --> 01:34:59,902
SPEAKER_0:  I think the answer is yes.

01:35:00,738 --> 01:35:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  And I think Kemu answered it.

01:35:02,722 --> 01:35:03,358
SPEAKER_0:  Yes too.

01:35:03,714 --> 01:35:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  I love his writing and

01:35:06,914 --> 01:35:07,454
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:35:08,226 --> 01:35:09,502
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I think there was a...

01:35:10,466 --> 01:35:11,774
SPEAKER_0:  a streak of nihilism.

01:35:12,034 --> 01:35:14,110
SPEAKER_0:  that I think grew in his writing.

01:35:14,626 --> 01:35:20,734
SPEAKER_0:  over the years and the thought is that K. Mu died by suicide. I think we're not sure of that because it was a car accident.

01:35:20,994 --> 01:35:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  But I've always read that as the primary scholarly opinion.

01:35:25,378 --> 01:35:27,390
SPEAKER_0:  And I think it's interesting that after his death...

01:35:27,970 --> 01:35:35,998
SPEAKER_0:  A book called The First Man was published, which I don't know if he had intended to publish it. I don't know the specifics about it, but it's about him as a child.

01:35:36,322 --> 01:35:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  And it's interesting, the first man, he was the first.

01:35:39,874 --> 01:35:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  man in his existence, right? The most

01:35:42,178 --> 01:35:52,638
SPEAKER_0:  the one that felt and experienced everything. And there's sadness and distress and all in that book, but there's a beauty of life and living and experience. And all three of us, in the first chapter came together

01:35:52,866 --> 01:35:54,174
SPEAKER_0:  And I think to compare.

01:35:54,466 --> 01:35:55,678
SPEAKER_0:  that beauty, like that's.

01:35:55,970 --> 01:36:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  life, even if something's difficult and scary and sad, like there's something beautiful around the corner and here's a kind person and a new discovery. You know, more what was in him as a child.

01:36:05,218 --> 01:36:06,558
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that we can get.

01:36:07,042 --> 01:36:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  jaded as you and I were just talking about a few minutes ago. We can accentuate the negative and foster the negative.

01:36:12,354 --> 01:36:15,582
SPEAKER_0:  and come to a place where we're looking for.

01:36:15,938 --> 01:36:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  some in-depth philosophical answer, some thick book that's going to explain all that to us.

01:36:22,050 --> 01:36:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  instead of the simplicity that we've been.

01:36:24,930 --> 01:36:27,646
SPEAKER_0:  talking about. I think humility, gratitude.

01:36:27,874 --> 01:36:28,958
SPEAKER_0:  helps us have.

01:36:29,378 --> 01:36:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  Just simple.

01:36:31,298 --> 01:36:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  positive experiences, feelings of contentment, feelings of connection with another person, learning, discovery. And I think the answer to Keimu's question is yes, and I think

01:36:40,034 --> 01:36:41,918
SPEAKER_0:  It lies in his writing about when.

01:36:42,434 --> 01:36:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  He was a child, which I think he saw as less important.

01:36:45,922 --> 01:36:49,246
SPEAKER_0:  then his later writings in the intellectual heaviness went.

01:36:49,474 --> 01:36:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  I think maybe...

01:36:51,042 --> 01:36:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  He had lost his way a little bit from the things he understood when he was younger.

01:36:54,850 --> 01:36:57,086
SPEAKER_1:  So another way to talk about it.

01:36:57,538 --> 01:36:59,134
SPEAKER_1:  I'd love to hear what you think is.

01:36:59,682 --> 01:37:00,702
SPEAKER_1:  about...

01:37:00,994 --> 01:37:02,270
SPEAKER_1:  these broad categories.

01:37:03,266 --> 01:37:04,766
SPEAKER_1:  Let me be started with Kierkegaard.

01:37:05,314 --> 01:37:08,030
SPEAKER_1:  of existentialism, absurdism, and nihilism.

01:37:08,706 --> 01:37:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  And I think Camus considered himself an absurdist, not actually an existentialist.

01:37:13,762 --> 01:37:16,574
SPEAKER_1:  is kind of a middle ground where I think existentialist.

01:37:19,298 --> 01:37:24,670
SPEAKER_1:  I don't want to characterize it in the wrong way. And there's a lot of different definitions, but I think existential is ultimately.

01:37:25,922 --> 01:37:28,318
SPEAKER_1:  Do think that there is meaning.

01:37:29,218 --> 01:37:29,950
SPEAKER_1:  instead of

01:37:30,786 --> 01:37:33,566
SPEAKER_1:  Pursuing the passion of life, like pursuing the most, like.

01:37:34,050 --> 01:37:37,269
SPEAKER_1:  in living life. That's where you discover the meaning of it.

01:37:37,269 --> 01:37:38,019
SPEAKER_0:  that individual.

01:37:38,019 --> 01:37:38,558
SPEAKER_1:  level.

01:37:39,458 --> 01:37:39,806
SPEAKER_1:  of.

01:37:40,194 --> 01:37:41,470
SPEAKER_1:  Fully embracing life.

01:37:42,882 --> 01:37:43,454
SPEAKER_1:  And I think...

01:37:43,906 --> 01:37:44,926
SPEAKER_1:  Sort of nihilism.

01:37:45,730 --> 01:37:49,566
SPEAKER_1:  is again, it's kind of like a spectrum, where nihilism basically says...

01:37:50,754 --> 01:37:51,902
SPEAKER_1:  There's no meaning.

01:37:53,154 --> 01:37:54,494
SPEAKER_1:  and it doesn't matter.

01:37:55,266 --> 01:37:56,382
SPEAKER_1:  Nothing matters.

01:37:57,506 --> 01:38:00,286
SPEAKER_1:  I don't even know, but somehow that lands you in a place.

01:38:00,866 --> 01:38:02,558
SPEAKER_1:  that's totally uninspired.

01:38:02,914 --> 01:38:03,294
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe.

01:38:03,522 --> 01:38:05,118
SPEAKER_1:  An atlas would disagree with that.

01:38:05,506 --> 01:38:07,998
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe there's a way to live a creative life.

01:38:08,258 --> 01:38:09,982
SPEAKER_1:  in an nihilistic mindset.

01:38:10,242 --> 01:38:13,694
SPEAKER_1:  I think absurdism is somewhere in the middle.

01:38:14,626 --> 01:38:15,230
SPEAKER_1:  where...

01:38:16,706 --> 01:38:18,558
SPEAKER_1:  Pursuing meaning at all.

01:38:19,874 --> 01:38:21,342
SPEAKER_1:  is not a good idea.

01:38:22,402 --> 01:38:25,374
SPEAKER_1:  So kind of I think existentialists say you should be looking for meaning.

01:38:25,602 --> 01:38:29,726
SPEAKER_1:  and it's to be discovered in your own actions, in your own life, in the moment.

01:38:30,178 --> 01:38:31,006
SPEAKER_1:  And uh...

01:38:31,362 --> 01:38:33,982
SPEAKER_1:  absurdism says life is absurd nothing makes sense

01:38:34,498 --> 01:38:35,486
SPEAKER_1:  Don't look for the meaning.

01:38:35,714 --> 01:38:36,958
SPEAKER_1:  Just live. Just be.

01:38:37,282 --> 01:38:41,054
SPEAKER_1:  I think that's kind of the later Camus kind of.

01:38:41,794 --> 01:38:42,270
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:38:42,690 --> 01:38:44,670
SPEAKER_1:  philosophy. I don't know if you can sort of comment on

01:38:44,930 --> 01:38:48,478
SPEAKER_1:  these kind of nuanced ideas here if there is no

01:38:49,442 --> 01:38:50,398
SPEAKER_1:  religious.

01:38:50,946 --> 01:38:51,518
SPEAKER_1:  guide.

01:38:51,970 --> 01:38:52,638
SPEAKER_1:  your life.

01:38:54,242 --> 01:38:56,414
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think about this kind of search for meaning?

01:38:56,898 --> 01:39:01,182
SPEAKER_1:  Do you see that there's some wisdom in the existentialist perspective of discovering it?

01:39:01,666 --> 01:39:04,414
SPEAKER_1:  in your own life and this passion and this kind of.

01:39:05,026 --> 01:39:07,651
SPEAKER_1:  day to day existence in the moments of your life that bring

01:39:07,651 --> 01:39:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  you joy, that kind of thing. Bringing different sort of perspectives and trying to tease apart, like, well, wait, what are the differences in those perspectives, right? And I think what it points out is that

01:39:17,122 --> 01:39:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, we tend to conflate things as human beings, right, and to take two different things and try and make them into one. But we also, I think on the other end of the spectrum, get very overly reductionist. And I think that when we get to overly reductionist...

01:39:30,402 --> 01:39:34,270
SPEAKER_0:  we lose the ability to learn from anything or to generate meaning, right? I mean, the thing about...

01:39:34,626 --> 01:39:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  Sartre, who is the thought of existentialism is so consistent with him, right, who on the one hand,

01:39:40,610 --> 01:39:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  wrote about, in very clear terms, like this is what it is and this is what it isn't, and here's how you're gonna make your meaning in a very academically proscribed way.

01:39:48,866 --> 01:39:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  But he also wrote short stories like

01:39:51,554 --> 01:39:57,342
SPEAKER_0:  the wall, right, where something totally absurd happens, right, as part of the story, right? So I think...

01:39:57,794 --> 01:40:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  What ends up happening is people either reduce themselves or get associated with something.

01:40:02,242 --> 01:40:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  that by being overly reductionist takes us away from meaning.

01:40:05,474 --> 01:40:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  The idea that, look, we don't know.

01:40:08,706 --> 01:40:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  if there is an overarching religious meaning or, you know, what we call a religious meaning or purpose. We don't know that.

01:40:16,066 --> 01:40:16,510
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

01:40:16,930 --> 01:40:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  So, okay, if we take that as a given, that people who say that they know are having faith, like how Spinoza described faith, right? Faith is that you don't know.

01:40:25,026 --> 01:40:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  But you believe anyway.

01:40:26,914 --> 01:40:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  It's not because you have faith now you know something, right? Because I think that's

01:40:32,002 --> 01:40:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  a slippery slope to the persecution of others, right?

01:40:35,266 --> 01:40:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  So if we say, okay, we don't know.

01:40:38,530 --> 01:40:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  then

01:40:39,810 --> 01:40:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  we're left either deciding, okay, well then to hell with everything. There's that movie, A Strange Brew, right? With Bob and Doug McKenzie where the brakes don't work on the car and one of them says, oh, why bother steering? Right? So if we don't know that there's meaning, like why bother steering? Let's just give up the ghost, right?

01:40:55,970 --> 01:41:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  And I don't think that's even what the nihilists said. I mean, I think Bakunin said, we should get rid of everything.

01:41:01,730 --> 01:41:05,918
SPEAKER_0:  that we've ever created except Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and start over from there.

01:41:06,210 --> 01:41:09,502
SPEAKER_0:  But so even people who are very nihilistic are associated with that.

01:41:09,762 --> 01:41:13,822
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of them were just not liking what we had built, right? So if we accept that...

01:41:14,114 --> 01:41:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of what we have built as humans inside of us and outside of us is really counterproductive and doesn't help us. And that absurd things happen.

01:41:22,274 --> 01:41:29,278
SPEAKER_0:  in the world, right? And that often the way social structures and systems build up, you build themselves up is absurd. I think our health care system.

01:41:29,602 --> 01:41:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  operates in a way that's absurd.

01:41:31,682 --> 01:41:36,254
SPEAKER_0:  So if we accept that there are absurdities that we don't know if there's truth

01:41:36,610 --> 01:41:39,550
SPEAKER_0:  then what are we left with? but like well let's try and make meaning

01:41:40,066 --> 01:41:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  Right? Or take it, you got set.

01:41:42,146 --> 01:41:51,614
SPEAKER_0:  I said, I am myself and my circumstances. She's like, look, we can't control everything. We live in circumstances around us.

01:41:51,970 --> 01:41:53,790
SPEAKER_0:  But within those circumstances...

01:41:54,082 --> 01:41:56,958
SPEAKER_0:  we can make decisions and define.

01:41:57,410 --> 01:42:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  ourselves. And I think the brilliance of that and I think tying it all together, right, in a way that's not trying to be

01:42:04,066 --> 01:42:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  And since it ties it all together by not trying...

01:42:06,754 --> 01:42:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  to answer everything concisely, that yes, we can make meaning. Like we see that if someone trips in front of me.

01:42:12,578 --> 01:42:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  I could walk around them or I could help them up. I mean, no one can tell me that it doesn't matter.

01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  what I do. I absolutely reject the idea that, oh, I could step over them or on them.

01:42:22,242 --> 01:42:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  or I could help them up and it doesn't matter. Oh yeah, try being the person on the ground.

01:42:26,786 --> 01:42:27,710
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

01:42:28,034 --> 01:42:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  we create meaning.

01:42:29,794 --> 01:42:35,646
SPEAKER_0:  But we live in our circumstances and there are absurdities both within us and outside of us in our social.

01:42:36,034 --> 01:42:38,014
SPEAKER_0:  And there are a lot of things that

01:42:38,306 --> 01:42:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  pretend to have meaning that don't. There's the shades of nihilism but ultimately there's something going on here.

01:42:44,354 --> 01:42:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  that's doing the best we can in the context of just not knowing.

01:42:48,578 --> 01:42:50,974
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I tend to see, I don't know if it's genetic, I think.

01:42:51,490 --> 01:42:53,502
SPEAKER_1:  I tend to think just observing the internet.

01:42:53,890 --> 01:42:55,006
SPEAKER_1:  the number of memes there are.

01:42:56,866 --> 01:43:01,118
SPEAKER_1:  I think many other people are like me. I tend to see the humor in the absurdity.

01:43:01,954 --> 01:43:08,734
SPEAKER_1:  I tend to enjoy it from that kind of angle. I see the Kafkaesque nature of society, different aspects of society and just kind of.

01:43:09,506 --> 01:43:11,102
SPEAKER_1:  Notice the magic with a smile.

01:43:11,554 --> 01:43:11,966
SPEAKER_1:  Mm-hmm.

01:43:12,642 --> 01:43:15,166
SPEAKER_1:  And just laugh at the circus of it all

01:43:15,650 --> 01:43:18,366
SPEAKER_1:  Because it is magical that the circus all comes together.

01:43:18,882 --> 01:43:23,757
SPEAKER_1:  It's like a little bit out of sync and then just a guy playing trombone, but like overall it's pretty

01:43:23,757 --> 01:43:24,158
SPEAKER_0:  Good.

01:43:24,418 --> 01:43:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  Pretty good.

01:43:25,378 --> 01:43:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  And we can look at that and just kind of marvel and go, huh.

01:43:28,226 --> 01:43:29,438
SPEAKER_0:  Right, which I think...

01:43:29,698 --> 01:43:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  Is it a relation to at least a lot of what we?

01:43:32,514 --> 01:43:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  in the Western world think of as Eastern, right? It's like as non-attachment, right? Because then if there's something absurd...

01:43:38,594 --> 01:43:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  And it's like, not good for me.

01:43:40,610 --> 01:43:50,110
SPEAKER_0:  you know, then I accept that too, instead of getting angry about it and railing about it or seeing some cosmic meaning in it, right? I think there's also a healthy non-attachment in what you're saying too.

01:43:50,626 --> 01:43:54,014
SPEAKER_1:  So there's, I mean, you mentioned Eastern thought, there's...

01:43:54,434 --> 01:43:56,670
SPEAKER_1:  Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, but also Buddha.

01:43:57,186 --> 01:43:59,742
SPEAKER_1:  have kind of spoke of life as suffering.

01:44:00,258 --> 01:44:01,630
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think that's true to that?

01:44:01,986 --> 01:44:02,750
SPEAKER_1:  that suffering is a-

01:44:03,650 --> 01:44:05,118
SPEAKER_0:  is a fundamental part of life.

01:44:06,082 --> 01:44:08,254
SPEAKER_0:  I think it is a fundamental part of life.

01:44:08,642 --> 01:44:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think that means that life is suffering.

01:44:11,586 --> 01:44:13,758
SPEAKER_0:  Right, if we say, well, life is suffering, then.

01:44:14,146 --> 01:44:22,878
SPEAKER_0:  What am I doing that I'm trying to erase from my mind like the birth of my children, right? Things that were filled with joy, right? Like life is not entirely suffering.

01:44:23,554 --> 01:44:25,246
SPEAKER_0:  But life brings a lot of suffering.

01:44:26,050 --> 01:44:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  And for some people it brings such disproportionate

01:44:29,186 --> 01:44:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  suffering and the people don't survive the suffering. I think when people are conscientious and empathic, they don't survive the suffering.

01:44:35,522 --> 01:44:39,934
SPEAKER_0:  that really bothers us, right? The suffering in our own lives and the fact that others at times could...

01:44:40,226 --> 01:44:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  could seem to be so overwhelmed by suffering that they don't even get a chance.

01:44:44,354 --> 01:44:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  to see good. I think that there's.

01:44:46,562 --> 01:44:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  I do think there's truth to that and there's sadness and distress to that.

01:44:50,338 --> 01:44:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  But to say therefore life is suffering, I think is completely untrue.

01:44:55,426 --> 01:45:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it ignores the fact that someone even made a trombone, right? Let alone that there's a little bit out of sync and someone's playing the trombone. Like, that's cool. There's a there's a there's a

01:45:03,682 --> 01:45:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  you know, there's elements of the absurd that are neat and interesting and if we start accepting that we can't understand or control everything.

01:45:12,098 --> 01:45:14,302
SPEAKER_0:  then we can accept and I think really.

01:45:14,690 --> 01:45:16,350
SPEAKER_0:  love and foster the beauty.

01:45:16,994 --> 01:45:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  in Ireland.

01:45:18,498 --> 01:45:19,623
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I think...

01:45:19,623 --> 01:45:20,894
SPEAKER_1:  The word suffering.

01:45:21,602 --> 01:45:23,486
SPEAKER_1:  is doing a little bit too much work.

01:45:24,066 --> 01:45:26,942
SPEAKER_1:  because I think it's probably referring to the philosophical concept of

01:45:27,426 --> 01:45:28,318
SPEAKER_1:  that uh...

01:45:29,122 --> 01:45:31,230
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it is absurd, the absurdity.

01:45:31,842 --> 01:45:33,726
SPEAKER_1:  That stuff just happens randomly.

01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:37,438
SPEAKER_1:  Evil people succeed, good people fail.

01:45:37,922 --> 01:45:40,990
SPEAKER_1:  There's a seeming random injustice on occasion.

01:45:41,986 --> 01:45:43,870
SPEAKER_1:  and on occasion there's justice.

01:45:44,098 --> 01:45:44,446
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:45:45,698 --> 01:45:48,574
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, all of it that feels like...

01:45:49,474 --> 01:45:50,366
SPEAKER_1:  and maybe because it.

01:45:50,914 --> 01:45:52,670
SPEAKER_1:  Often there's a lot of loss.

01:45:53,122 --> 01:45:53,886
SPEAKER_1:  And then there's...

01:45:54,306 --> 01:45:55,294
SPEAKER_1:  as a kind of.

01:45:56,450 --> 01:46:03,614
SPEAKER_1:  matching complimentary aspect to any good feeling that all comes crashing down. like every hello

01:46:05,026 --> 01:46:06,151
SPEAKER_1:  from a physics perspective.

01:46:06,151 --> 01:46:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  ends in a goodbye.

01:46:09,218 --> 01:46:09,950
SPEAKER_1:  Like, uh...

01:46:13,218 --> 01:46:15,102
SPEAKER_1:  That's a really sad thing.

01:46:15,490 --> 01:46:16,414
SPEAKER_1:  of uh...

01:46:16,962 --> 01:46:19,710
SPEAKER_1:  you know, all the amazing people I get to meet in my life.

01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:22,590
SPEAKER_1:  All the amazing experiences eventually they have to end.

01:46:23,522 --> 01:46:25,374
SPEAKER_1:  And that's part of what makes them amazing.

01:46:26,178 --> 01:46:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  Why is that sad?

01:46:27,810 --> 01:46:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  is because we're taught to think.

01:46:29,922 --> 01:46:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  And I'd say, look, at some point you and I are gonna say goodbye today. I hope we're richer for it. And then we take that goodness off with us. I wanna celebrate that because it's all part of the goodness. I think we're taught to think, oh, that's so bad and it equates to death and misery.

01:46:44,898 --> 01:46:47,102
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's often not that way.

01:46:47,458 --> 01:46:50,942
SPEAKER_1:  I think there is a sadness to it, but I also don't think that sadness isn't

01:46:51,522 --> 01:46:53,118
SPEAKER_1:  a negative thing.

01:46:53,442 --> 01:46:59,422
SPEAKER_1:  It's a different way to celebrate a beautiful thing. So there's a melancholic nature to it, something passing of themselves and day after day.

01:46:59,842 --> 01:47:00,702
SPEAKER_1:  If it leaving.

01:47:01,154 --> 01:47:07,614
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's that old Louis CK thing that I go back to over and over from his show, Louis, where.

01:47:08,834 --> 01:47:12,222
SPEAKER_1:  He was all heartbroken that he just broke up

01:47:12,962 --> 01:47:14,046
SPEAKER_1:  You know, with the...

01:47:14,466 --> 01:47:15,550
SPEAKER_1:  with somebody he loved.

01:47:16,482 --> 01:47:18,462
SPEAKER_1:  And he told about that to an old man.

01:47:18,978 --> 01:47:20,222
SPEAKER_1:  And the old man said,

01:47:20,482 --> 01:47:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  You're a fool.

01:47:21,730 --> 01:47:22,855
SPEAKER_0:  That's the best part.

01:47:22,855 --> 01:47:23,806
SPEAKER_1:  I missed that part.

01:47:24,258 --> 01:47:25,278
SPEAKER_1:  or you sort of...

01:47:25,826 --> 01:47:28,734
SPEAKER_1:  are lingering in that loss, feeling the pain of that loss.

01:47:28,994 --> 01:47:36,798
SPEAKER_1:  because that lasts the longest, it's the most intense, it's the most reliable, and it's a kind of celebration of the love you had.

01:47:37,058 --> 01:47:38,398
SPEAKER_1:  Like losing the love.

01:47:38,946 --> 01:47:39,678
SPEAKER_1:  is still.

01:47:40,066 --> 01:47:41,598
SPEAKER_1:  a celebration of the love.

01:47:42,370 --> 01:47:43,710
SPEAKER_1:  with I think

01:47:44,034 --> 01:47:47,774
SPEAKER_1:  You don't want to over romanticize that, but there's some aspect of truth to that.

01:47:48,290 --> 01:47:50,238
SPEAKER_1:  Like that melancholic feeling.

01:47:50,690 --> 01:47:51,678
SPEAKER_1:  of remembering.

01:47:51,906 --> 01:47:53,886
SPEAKER_1:  a beautiful time that's no longer there.

01:47:54,690 --> 01:47:59,870
SPEAKER_1:  is a kind of celebration of it and is a kind of joyful experience even though

01:48:01,922 --> 01:48:04,446
SPEAKER_1:  It's very easy to experience it.

01:48:04,706 --> 01:48:06,046
SPEAKER_1:  as a negative emotion.

01:48:06,274 --> 01:48:09,886
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's just like you said, I mean, it's up to our mind to determine how.

01:48:10,114 --> 01:48:15,230
SPEAKER_1:  that emotions really felt. But it's a tricky one, because it's like heartbreak to experience that as a positive thing.

01:48:15,426 --> 01:48:17,246
SPEAKER_0:  people can reminisce at funerals, right?

01:48:17,538 --> 01:48:20,606
SPEAKER_0:  and laugh because people can be very very very sad and perceive.

01:48:21,026 --> 01:48:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  that this person has died and perceived the sadness of it.

01:48:25,058 --> 01:48:26,334
SPEAKER_0:  but in perceiving.

01:48:26,626 --> 01:48:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  that and really living in it, then you can have people who want to remember that person by telling a funny story. Why? Because each of those people carries that with them.

01:48:35,362 --> 01:48:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  So I think.

01:48:36,482 --> 01:48:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  What you're saying is consistent with.

01:48:38,658 --> 01:48:43,614
SPEAKER_0:  healthy function as human beings because we're gonna encounter sadness and loss. Like what do we do with that?

01:48:44,130 --> 01:48:50,814
SPEAKER_0:  Right? And do we do things that ultimately create some redemption or even reparation inside of us? And like reparations are big.

01:48:51,266 --> 01:48:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  Word and psychology, right? It's how we repair damage and loss. So if we lose someone and we're sad.

01:48:56,354 --> 01:48:58,558
SPEAKER_0:  Can we, by telling funny stories.

01:48:58,818 --> 01:49:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  about that person remind ourselves that, hey, they're still inside of us. Whether they're out there looking at me, I don't know, but I can call that person of mine inside of us and then.

01:49:06,370 --> 01:49:09,278
SPEAKER_0:  we have something that's good and beautiful that comes with that too.

01:49:11,010 --> 01:49:11,902
SPEAKER_0:  in the...

01:49:12,034 --> 01:49:13,310
SPEAKER_1:  Introduction to your book.

01:49:13,634 --> 01:49:14,238
SPEAKER_1:  on Trauma?

01:49:15,106 --> 01:49:17,950
SPEAKER_1:  Lady Gaga wrote it, she wrote the intro.

01:49:19,202 --> 01:49:21,182
SPEAKER_1:  She said this about you, quote,

01:49:21,506 --> 01:49:25,438
SPEAKER_1:  I can now say with certainty that this man saved my life.

01:49:26,274 --> 01:49:28,702
SPEAKER_1:  He made life worth living.

01:49:29,154 --> 01:49:31,550
SPEAKER_1:  This goes to our discussion about.

01:49:32,194 --> 01:49:34,782
SPEAKER_1:  the mythicistivist Kamu question.

01:49:35,394 --> 01:49:36,254
SPEAKER_1:  about why I live.

01:49:37,634 --> 01:49:38,078
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:49:38,370 --> 01:49:42,558
SPEAKER_1:  I think, at least to me, she's one of the most brilliant and unique artists ever.

01:49:43,234 --> 01:49:43,646
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:49:44,450 --> 01:49:47,075
SPEAKER_1:  It's a difficult question, but a question of creativity.

01:49:47,075 --> 01:49:47,825
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, what?

01:49:47,825 --> 01:49:49,438
SPEAKER_1:  role does trauma play?

01:49:50,594 --> 01:49:51,518
SPEAKER_1:  in, uh...

01:49:52,642 --> 01:49:55,934
SPEAKER_1:  in somebody like that, in this artist that has created some...

01:49:56,226 --> 01:49:57,406
SPEAKER_1:  incredible things.

01:49:57,858 --> 01:49:59,070
SPEAKER_1:  wood positive.

01:49:59,554 --> 01:50:00,766
SPEAKER_1:  constructive.

01:50:03,522 --> 01:50:06,654
SPEAKER_1:  A role does trauma serve and what limiting role?

01:50:07,010 --> 01:50:07,678
SPEAKER_1:  does it serve?

01:50:08,162 --> 01:50:10,302
SPEAKER_1:  and preventing that person from flourishing more.

01:50:11,074 --> 01:50:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  The trauma can certainly

01:50:12,642 --> 01:50:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  drive us to...

01:50:14,466 --> 01:50:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  creativity.

01:50:15,522 --> 01:50:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  The two even to push against or to protest against what the trauma.

01:50:20,066 --> 01:50:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  tells us, you know, trauma tells us lessons like nothing matters.

01:50:23,842 --> 01:50:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  you don't matter and nothing will ever be good and nothing is beautiful and we can.

01:50:29,122 --> 01:50:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  push against trauma. They know there is life in me. There's something, there's goodness for me to spread in the world, to express and spread.

01:50:35,522 --> 01:50:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  So I think trauma fuels.

01:50:37,570 --> 01:50:46,014
SPEAKER_0:  creativity in many, many, many ways, trauma also shuts down creativity, right? People who are, for one example, trauma.

01:50:46,306 --> 01:50:54,462
SPEAKER_0:  that escalates to the point where now the person is soothing it with alcohol. It's one example. And now the impact of the alcohol shuts down any creativity.

01:50:54,722 --> 01:50:58,398
SPEAKER_0:  So can people be creative and outward thinking without trauma?

01:50:58,626 --> 01:51:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  I think sometimes, if I remember correctly, people will use Emmanuel Kant as an example of someone who I think hadn't traveled much and didn't have trauma and like look at what he knew. So, okay, there are going to be exceptions, right? A lot of our creativity...

01:51:10,146 --> 01:51:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  is in some ways fueled by our suffering, although it's complicated because it comes from generative places in us, right? So those places are there, they're not created by suffering, but maybe suffering.

01:51:21,602 --> 01:51:23,550
SPEAKER_0:  makes an incentive or a passion.

01:51:24,066 --> 01:51:25,950
SPEAKER_0:  inside of us and a person.

01:51:26,690 --> 01:51:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  Stephanie, who you referred to is just such an incredible.

01:51:30,850 --> 01:51:32,254
SPEAKER_0:  astounding creative.

01:51:32,642 --> 01:51:36,254
SPEAKER_0:  And sure, some of that comes from trauma, some of it comes from...

01:51:36,674 --> 01:51:39,550
SPEAKER_0:  you know, trauma fueling the generative creative places.

01:51:40,002 --> 01:51:44,222
SPEAKER_0:  in her, but what I helped her to do, she's very generous with her words, but...

01:51:44,610 --> 01:51:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  What I helped her to do was to see

01:51:47,426 --> 01:51:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  all that she is and all that the creativity in her is and all that there is to create through.

01:51:54,946 --> 01:51:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  love and caring and

01:51:57,314 --> 01:51:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  compassion.

01:51:58,882 --> 01:52:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  and to again see that. I mean, a lot of time that's what I'm doing clinically. I think it's what's good psychiatrists or mental health professionals do is we help people see the beauty that is there.

01:52:09,346 --> 01:52:17,310
SPEAKER_0:  Right? Because oftentimes we're way too close up to that tapestry. And what brings us close is often the sad thing. So we're up close and all we see is a tapestry.

01:52:17,602 --> 01:52:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  is the negative. It's easy then to get classically nihilistic, but by helping someone take a step

01:52:23,298 --> 01:52:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  back and to see who they are and what's in them.

01:52:26,658 --> 01:52:29,726
SPEAKER_0:  That's how people get better and it's how people reengage in.

01:52:30,210 --> 01:52:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  in life.

01:52:31,298 --> 01:52:32,254
SPEAKER_1:  It's such a...

01:52:32,514 --> 01:52:34,526
SPEAKER_1:  difficult thing because if you were to.

01:52:36,002 --> 01:52:37,374
SPEAKER_1:  for studying human beings.

01:52:38,146 --> 01:52:40,478
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like the optimal trajectory.

01:52:41,698 --> 01:52:43,358
SPEAKER_1:  is having some trauma.

01:52:43,650 --> 01:52:44,862
SPEAKER_1:  that doesn't destroy you.

01:52:46,626 --> 01:52:47,102
SPEAKER_1:  that.

01:52:47,682 --> 01:52:51,166
SPEAKER_1:  forces you early in life to really struggle with the

01:52:51,394 --> 01:52:53,182
SPEAKER_1:  intricacies of the human condition.

01:52:54,082 --> 01:52:59,230
SPEAKER_1:  And then later in life, as you form and like you build an expertise around and mastery.

01:53:00,002 --> 01:53:04,510
SPEAKER_1:  start to do exactly what you said, which is step back and look at the tapestry.

01:53:05,250 --> 01:53:08,181
SPEAKER_0:  If you don't have the...

01:53:08,181 --> 01:53:13,374
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like just empirically speaking, there's of course just a huge amount of data and all kinds of-

01:53:13,698 --> 01:53:14,526
SPEAKER_1:  anecdotal.

01:53:14,978 --> 01:53:19,838
SPEAKER_1:  evidence but it and I'm going to be careful here because maybe I'm romanticizing

01:53:20,834 --> 01:53:21,758
SPEAKER_1:  hardship.

01:53:22,658 --> 01:53:24,862
SPEAKER_1:  but it does seem that hardship in childhood.

01:53:25,954 --> 01:53:28,094
SPEAKER_1:  If it doesn't break you can be constructive.

01:53:28,514 --> 01:53:29,630
SPEAKER_1:  It's like you said.

01:53:30,178 --> 01:53:33,022
SPEAKER_1:  Having that trauma one of the ways to fight it.

01:53:33,346 --> 01:53:36,126
SPEAKER_1:  is to say I am worth something. I am.

01:53:36,386 --> 01:53:37,310
SPEAKER_1:  And this is

01:53:37,538 --> 01:53:38,462
SPEAKER_1:  you know, uh.

01:53:38,786 --> 01:53:42,782
SPEAKER_1:  David Goggins talks about this.

01:53:43,778 --> 01:53:50,687
SPEAKER_1:  I am somebody, I can be somebody special and I'm gonna prove it to you, I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna do this big thing, this is this engine.

01:53:50,687 --> 01:53:51,437
SPEAKER_0:  that drives you.

01:53:51,437 --> 01:53:51,838
SPEAKER_1:  forward.

01:53:52,290 --> 01:53:53,822
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, comment on that because like.

01:53:54,050 --> 01:53:55,934
SPEAKER_1:  from a like a parent's perspective.

01:53:56,450 --> 01:53:56,926
SPEAKER_1:  You want-

01:53:57,986 --> 01:53:59,742
SPEAKER_1:  A child to have an easy.

01:54:00,194 --> 01:54:00,574
SPEAKER_1:  life.

01:54:01,506 --> 01:54:03,998
SPEAKER_1:  Right, you want them to.

01:54:04,290 --> 01:54:06,590
SPEAKER_1:  not have hardship, certainly not have trauma.

01:54:07,714 --> 01:54:10,302
SPEAKER_1:  But that's such a difficult dance because, um...

01:54:10,754 --> 01:54:11,710
SPEAKER_1:  in some ways.

01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:13,214
SPEAKER_1:  a little bit of hardship

01:54:14,434 --> 01:54:14,878
SPEAKER_1:  and it

01:54:15,138 --> 01:54:18,270
SPEAKER_1:  gradually increasing amount of hardship that doesn't break you.

01:54:18,658 --> 01:54:21,630
SPEAKER_1:  can really develop you into a really interesting, complicated

01:54:22,178 --> 01:54:22,814
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:54:23,138 --> 01:54:26,110
SPEAKER_1:  person and it helps you flourish as a creative being.

01:54:26,690 --> 01:54:27,390
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know what to-

01:54:27,618 --> 01:54:30,243
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if there's a question there. I just keep saying right-

01:54:30,243 --> 01:54:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  of things. No, it makes, look, I think it makes good, it makes good sense to me. I think what you're trying to get at, like, dude, we need trauma.

01:54:37,666 --> 01:54:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  And how are we defining it, right? Because we say trauma, hardship, difficulties.

01:54:42,882 --> 01:54:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, we could set aside, we could set apart, say, and differentiate things.

01:54:47,682 --> 01:54:48,702
SPEAKER_0:  that are difficult?

01:54:49,026 --> 01:54:50,238
SPEAKER_0:  but that are overcomeable.

01:54:50,658 --> 01:54:59,614
SPEAKER_0:  versus things that we could use the word trauma this way, if we chose to, that are just entirely negative, like someone saying.

01:54:59,938 --> 01:55:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  Oh.

01:55:01,506 --> 01:55:09,310
SPEAKER_0:  you can't do that and you'll never succeed because what? And then they tell you something about yourself, okay? Because you're from here or you're this race, religion, whatever it is, right? We think well,

01:55:09,826 --> 01:55:13,566
SPEAKER_0:  You know, that could make someone say, hey, I'm going to show you, I'm going to overcome, right?

01:55:13,826 --> 01:55:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  but then they're overcoming something bad.

01:55:16,642 --> 01:55:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  Right? Like it's just like, there's nothing good or helpful about that, right? If someone's saying that, so the person has to overcome it.

01:55:22,178 --> 01:55:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  That's different than something.

01:55:24,130 --> 01:55:26,878
SPEAKER_0:  that is placed in front of a person where...

01:55:27,362 --> 01:55:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  where

01:55:28,482 --> 01:55:31,166
SPEAKER_0:  the whole conception of it is something positive.

01:55:31,522 --> 01:55:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  that you can make through effort, right? So, you know, I remember...

01:55:36,290 --> 01:55:39,902
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, I think I was 15 years old. There was some rule, like you could then go...

01:55:40,322 --> 01:55:57,598
SPEAKER_0:  I think it was picking raspberries or blueberries, right? And I think, and my parents wanted me to see, like, hey, go see how that works with you. Now you got 50 cents at the end of it, right? And then you think about that when, you know, you wanna buy baseball cards or you, you know, you think about it and you work hard. And I could remember, like, it was hard and I was sweating and I was tired and...

01:55:58,050 --> 01:56:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  but I learned from it. I mean, it's the reason I remember it today. So —

01:56:01,442 --> 01:56:06,014
SPEAKER_0:  So yes, parents might want their kids to have a good life, but not this is certainly an easy life.

01:56:06,338 --> 01:56:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  you know, and I think.

01:56:07,522 --> 01:56:08,286
SPEAKER_0:  That was done.

01:56:09,090 --> 01:56:15,134
SPEAKER_0:  They took me to do that so I'd have a greater sense of responsibility in a sense of like hard work is meaningful and it's important and

01:56:15,522 --> 01:56:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that that kind of thing is good, but if we separate that from something that's just...

01:56:21,154 --> 01:56:25,278
SPEAKER_0:  denigrating, prejudicial. I think those things aren't good, but they're unavoidable.

01:56:25,762 --> 01:56:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  So it's not necessarily that, oh, is some trauma good?

01:56:28,418 --> 01:56:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  I would look at it more that some trauma is unavoidable. I mean, it's hard to-

01:56:32,194 --> 01:56:37,566
SPEAKER_0:  How do you go through life and not have any losses or anything negative or anything sad?

01:56:38,050 --> 01:56:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  And then people are people. There may be people who have not a lot of that. And then there's a sort of complacency and they don't do it as much as they could or feel as good as they could. You know, then there's other people who have a highly attuned emotional, so there's people with very highly attuned emotional compasses.

01:56:52,450 --> 01:56:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  for which a little bit of trauma becomes so intrusive.

01:56:56,546 --> 01:57:06,014
SPEAKER_0:  It's so much of it is person driven, but I do want to distinguish between things that are just purely bad that we might overcome or find some fire in our belly about or whatever the case may be.

01:57:06,306 --> 01:57:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  and things that may be boundaries or barriers either directly, purposely placed or not.

01:57:11,842 --> 01:57:17,342
SPEAKER_0:  that in a sense invite us or inform us of the possibility of striving and overcoming.

01:57:18,658 --> 01:57:19,783
SPEAKER_0:  Finally in tune to mo-

01:57:19,783 --> 01:57:22,238
SPEAKER_1:  compasses it's so true that there is

01:57:22,946 --> 01:57:24,350
SPEAKER_1:  That's a component of it too.

01:57:24,930 --> 01:57:25,406
SPEAKER_1:  It's.

01:57:25,794 --> 01:57:27,166
SPEAKER_1:  This is almost genetic.

01:57:27,906 --> 01:57:32,158
SPEAKER_1:  how sensitive you are to particular trauma, so little things can have a huge impact.

01:57:32,674 --> 01:57:33,886
SPEAKER_1:  or gigantic things.

01:57:34,114 --> 01:57:35,774
SPEAKER_1:  uh... serious abuse in

01:57:36,354 --> 01:57:37,950
SPEAKER_1:  in childhood can be.

01:57:38,498 --> 01:57:39,623
SPEAKER_1:  by some people overcome.

01:57:39,623 --> 01:57:40,190
SPEAKER_0:  easily.

01:57:40,930 --> 01:57:44,574
SPEAKER_0:  It's not just what's the trauma, it's what's the trauma that makes certain problems.

01:57:44,802 --> 01:57:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  You have to match the trauma to the person. And a big part of what you're matching to is that

01:57:49,634 --> 01:57:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  genetically based characteristic of how finely attuned is that.

01:57:53,922 --> 01:57:55,550
SPEAKER_0:  and path the cartoon men to that compass.

01:57:55,746 --> 01:57:58,622
SPEAKER_1:  So when you think about, it was just returned to childhood.

01:57:58,914 --> 01:58:00,606
SPEAKER_1:  when you think about trauma in childhood.

01:58:04,290 --> 01:58:07,326
SPEAKER_1:  What can we say about the impact?

01:58:07,970 --> 01:58:08,542
SPEAKER_1:  of

01:58:09,122 --> 01:58:10,142
SPEAKER_1:  child abuse.

01:58:10,882 --> 01:58:12,350
SPEAKER_0:  on the development of a human being.

01:58:13,282 --> 01:58:13,982
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

01:58:15,746 --> 01:58:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  The impact of it is so...

01:58:19,170 --> 01:58:20,510
SPEAKER_0:  disproportionately.

01:58:21,858 --> 01:58:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  bad and hurtful.

01:58:24,962 --> 01:58:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  compared to things that happen when we're not children. And I wanna be very careful about how I'm saying that because people can...

01:58:32,482 --> 01:58:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  through their strength and resilience and...

01:58:35,266 --> 01:58:39,422
SPEAKER_0:  human interconnectedness can overcome that. I don't mean to say.

01:58:39,714 --> 01:58:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  that

01:58:40,994 --> 01:58:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  anyone who's experienced those things is...

01:58:43,650 --> 01:58:45,246
SPEAKER_0:  can't make it through it or over it.

01:58:46,018 --> 01:58:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  That part is not true.

01:58:48,162 --> 01:58:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  But it is true that the impact is so disproportionate to anything else that can happen because the brain is... I

01:58:55,010 --> 01:59:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  So, both, if we say psychology is like applied neurobiology, and we look at both of those as a guess

01:59:03,106 --> 01:59:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  as

01:59:04,834 --> 01:59:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  different ends, right, even though there's a lot of gray in the middle.

01:59:07,810 --> 01:59:14,782
SPEAKER_0:  you know, the neurobiology is changed. So just one example of a much greater salience.

01:59:15,138 --> 01:59:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  of vigilance mechanisms, of...

01:59:18,242 --> 01:59:22,686
SPEAKER_0:  of mechanisms of self-protection, mechanisms that can make a person…

01:59:23,074 --> 01:59:27,454
SPEAKER_0:  feel more fear and more insecurity and hide themselves away from the world.

01:59:27,746 --> 01:59:33,758
SPEAKER_0:  and not trust the world. And I mean, not trust the world even enough that, oh, I'd like to have a better job and-

01:59:34,146 --> 01:59:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  There's another one that's here that I could take but...

01:59:37,346 --> 01:59:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe it could be worse, you know, they think of being afraid of that, right? Like there are all sorts of ways in which...

01:59:42,274 --> 01:59:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  in which the changes to those pathways impact someone. And that's just one of...

01:59:47,714 --> 01:59:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  We could bring trauma experts together that could talk about that for days. What is the impact upon the brain biology?

01:59:54,082 --> 02:00:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  So that then gets changed inside the person. And from the perspective of those changes, the psychology on top of it changes. Like, what do I think about myself? Do I think that I'm worthwhile?

02:00:04,994 --> 02:00:07,262
SPEAKER_0:  you know, even in my mid-20s after...

02:00:07,586 --> 02:00:08,350
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I-I-I-

02:00:08,674 --> 02:00:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  without formative traumas and a pretty strong sense of self and some achievements.

02:00:13,090 --> 02:00:22,974
SPEAKER_0:  There was a big trauma then with the death of my brother and I start questioning, am I cursed? Am I worth anything? I mean, I was 20 something years old and doing reasonably well.

02:00:23,234 --> 02:00:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  at the time. What how does this impact.

02:00:27,042 --> 02:00:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  child of 6'7".

02:00:29,410 --> 02:00:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  10, 12 years.

02:00:31,042 --> 02:00:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  old, right? We're sending such powerful messages that then change conception of self.

02:00:37,474 --> 02:00:43,966
SPEAKER_0:  And that negatively changed conception sits upon the negatively changed neurobiology. And I think if we really thought...

02:00:44,418 --> 02:00:49,150
SPEAKER_0:  Hey, let's do the best we can just for humans in general, for the human race, for species in general is

02:00:49,442 --> 02:00:56,126
SPEAKER_0:  We would handle children and caring for children so much differently in terms of protection mechanisms.

02:00:56,386 --> 02:00:58,878
SPEAKER_0:  intervention mechanisms. How many times do you see where...

02:00:59,106 --> 02:01:03,870
SPEAKER_0:  where now there's been some tragedy and the child gets a little bit of support and

02:01:04,098 --> 02:01:07,454
SPEAKER_0:  You know, they had some therapy that was provided by some...

02:01:07,778 --> 02:01:15,998
SPEAKER_0:  insurance carrier, you know, that they get once a week for 16 weeks or whatever. I mean, we should be wrapping our societal resources.

02:01:16,578 --> 02:01:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  around.

02:01:17,570 --> 02:01:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  but we don't use our resources.

02:01:20,034 --> 02:01:22,398
SPEAKER_0:  Well, you know, I was just reading, it's a little bit of an aside, but.

02:01:22,722 --> 02:01:25,726
SPEAKER_0:  about $300 and something billion a year.

02:01:26,050 --> 02:01:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  in cost to the US economy.

02:01:28,450 --> 02:01:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  just from schizophrenia.

02:01:30,434 --> 02:01:31,006
SPEAKER_0:  Can you think?

02:01:32,130 --> 02:01:44,798
SPEAKER_0:  And it costs a fraction. What do we actually put into caring for people who have schizophrenia? So first there's a moral imperative, but let's say we put that aside and we only care about the economy, right? Because there are.

02:01:45,058 --> 02:01:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  Mechanisms of thinking that look at it that way. How could we not amend that right, but we are so reckless

02:01:51,522 --> 02:01:56,030
SPEAKER_0:  with our resources and we're tripping ahead of ourselves that we don't think, oh my goodness.

02:01:56,354 --> 02:01:59,326
SPEAKER_0:  There is no better place on God's earth for prevention.

02:01:59,586 --> 02:02:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  then.

02:02:00,482 --> 02:02:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  Here, prevention in terms of human suffering, and also where do people like that go? I mean, more often, people like that go to place of increased suffering, inability to take care of themselves or...

02:02:11,170 --> 02:02:15,454
SPEAKER_0:  to be in supportive relationships. Okay, we know there's a higher prevalence of that.

02:02:15,682 --> 02:02:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  but we're also creating the pool of people through which.

02:02:19,586 --> 02:02:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  the envy, the narcissism, the sociopathy, the destruction.

02:02:24,130 --> 02:02:28,894
SPEAKER_0:  arises. So again, if we care about people, we would be so focused on that.

02:02:29,442 --> 02:02:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  If we don't care about other people and just ourselves or just economic costs, we would still be so focused, but-

02:02:35,618 --> 02:02:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we're not and we tend to just kind of call it good because

02:02:39,522 --> 02:02:42,110
SPEAKER_0:  We don't see anything disastrous happening at the moment.

02:02:42,498 --> 02:02:47,358
SPEAKER_0:  And I think there's a societal negligence there to the shame really of all of us.

02:02:47,746 --> 02:02:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:02:48,866 --> 02:02:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  when child abuse and the impact neurobiologically and psychologically is potentially the greatest cause of suffering directly and indirectly on the face of the planet.

02:03:01,730 --> 02:03:02,974
SPEAKER_0:  How much is trauma?

02:03:04,034 --> 02:03:08,158
SPEAKER_1:  of that kind and later in life affect your ability to love another human being.

02:03:08,962 --> 02:03:10,558
SPEAKER_1:  say inside a relationship.

02:03:10,850 --> 02:03:11,326
SPEAKER_1:  Connect.

02:03:11,554 --> 02:03:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  with another human being.

02:03:13,378 --> 02:03:21,406
SPEAKER_0:  it can impact it a lot. And again, I wanna say, can people overcome and be as loving to a partner or a child or anyone else? YES!

02:03:21,826 --> 02:03:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  But we're talking across society, right? How are we setting the odds, right? We're setting the odds towards a higher sense of vigilance.

02:03:29,122 --> 02:03:30,462
SPEAKER_0:  a decreased sense of.

02:03:30,818 --> 02:03:46,878
SPEAKER_0:  self-confidence, an increased sense of vulnerability, right? A decreased comfort interacting with others, right? What we're doing is we're pushing towards isolation and misery and depression and resentment. I mean, those factors push towards that. You know, we know that the research is so strong that...

02:03:47,170 --> 02:03:50,558
SPEAKER_0:  at adverse childhood experiences, these things that happen.

02:03:50,818 --> 02:03:53,310
SPEAKER_0:  The more, the worse, the more prolonged.

02:03:53,602 --> 02:03:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  the more that person is up against.

02:03:56,034 --> 02:03:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  as they try and navigate.

02:03:58,018 --> 02:03:58,398
SPEAKER_0:  life.

02:03:59,458 --> 02:04:01,726
SPEAKER_1:  and uh... i suppose one of the

02:04:01,954 --> 02:04:05,694
SPEAKER_1:  elements of intimacy like what we're talking about is vulnerability.

02:04:06,466 --> 02:04:07,710
SPEAKER_1:  and maybe there's a...

02:04:08,674 --> 02:04:09,630
SPEAKER_1:  Is there fear?

02:04:10,082 --> 02:04:11,102
SPEAKER_1:  of being vulnerable.

02:04:11,938 --> 02:04:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  of being hurt again.

02:04:14,338 --> 02:04:16,213
SPEAKER_1:  Is that ultimately the barrier?

02:04:16,213 --> 02:04:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  to intimacy.

02:04:17,346 --> 02:04:20,606
SPEAKER_0:  If you're taught a lesson that says the world is not safe.

02:04:21,474 --> 02:04:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  and you're not good enough for someone to keep safe.

02:04:24,290 --> 02:04:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  and you're not strong enough to keep yourself safe.

02:04:27,330 --> 02:04:29,278
SPEAKER_0:  That's a final common pathway of.

02:04:29,570 --> 02:04:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  of the vast majority of child abuse is telling those lessons

02:04:33,890 --> 02:04:34,430
SPEAKER_0:  See you then.

02:04:34,690 --> 02:04:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  How

02:04:35,586 --> 02:04:36,670
SPEAKER_0:  How can that not?

02:04:37,538 --> 02:04:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  change the lay of the land against openness, against the ability to rationally consider trust and mutuality and to protect oneself, but also take chances and do the things that we have to do to create the greatest happiness.

02:04:52,194 --> 02:04:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  in our lives. We set the odds so much.

02:04:55,394 --> 02:04:56,519
SPEAKER_0:  against them.

02:04:56,519 --> 02:04:58,942
SPEAKER_1:  pathway which I think is really...

02:04:59,778 --> 02:05:00,830
SPEAKER_1:  interesting because of

02:05:01,506 --> 02:05:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  I've seen it in people is this kind of ability to detach yourself.

02:05:06,658 --> 02:05:08,702
SPEAKER_1:  from feeling any emotions.

02:05:09,858 --> 02:05:11,006
SPEAKER_1:  to like protect yourself.

02:05:11,650 --> 02:05:12,798
SPEAKER_1:  It's almost like you're not.

02:05:13,218 --> 02:05:13,918
SPEAKER_0:  quite there.

02:05:14,274 --> 02:05:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  There's a word for it, it's isolation of affect. This is a defense mechanism.

02:05:17,826 --> 02:05:18,951
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. Isolation of F.

02:05:18,951 --> 02:05:19,454
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

02:05:19,746 --> 02:05:22,014
SPEAKER_1:  Is that a common way another?

02:05:22,658 --> 02:05:24,030
SPEAKER_1:  Common way to deal with trauma.

02:05:24,994 --> 02:05:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  Well...

02:05:26,018 --> 02:05:27,550
SPEAKER_0:  Isolation of affect can cut-

02:05:27,842 --> 02:05:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  both ways so f-

02:05:29,474 --> 02:05:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  If there's been a major trauma, let's say someone has seen something terrible.

02:05:33,058 --> 02:05:35,262
SPEAKER_0:  and they're isolated from their affidavits.

02:05:35,874 --> 02:05:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  And at one time it was thought, well, maybe that's good, right? They're not hysterical, they're not distraught, but we see that is not good.

02:05:42,210 --> 02:05:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  Right, because what needs to be beheld.

02:05:45,954 --> 02:05:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  process to get our arms around in some way, shape or form has just been separated off.

02:05:50,658 --> 02:05:51,262
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

02:05:51,522 --> 02:05:52,798
SPEAKER_0:  So we know that is not good.

02:05:53,122 --> 02:05:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  Right.

02:05:53,826 --> 02:05:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  But...

02:05:54,498 --> 02:05:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  Isolation of affid can also serve us very well.

02:05:57,730 --> 02:05:59,006
SPEAKER_0:  When I think back to being.

02:05:59,298 --> 02:06:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  an intern, a medical intern in the hospital, and you might have to go and-

02:06:05,506 --> 02:06:07,422
SPEAKER_0:  pronounce someone dead with

02:06:07,842 --> 02:06:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  you know, with.

02:06:09,122 --> 02:06:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  hysterical family members.

02:06:11,170 --> 02:06:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  And then 10 minutes later.

02:06:13,826 --> 02:06:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  five minutes later, might be two minutes later, really, you know, you have to go to

02:06:18,434 --> 02:06:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  another room and you've got to maybe do some procedure that involves having your focus on a certain thing and making sure your hand movements are the right way or talking to a person in a way that is

02:06:29,954 --> 02:06:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  that's very different than where you just came from, that's very hopeful.

02:06:33,602 --> 02:06:41,598
SPEAKER_0:  So then you have to isolate the affect of what's going on around you. And it happens not just in, it's just one example, but we have to do it in life.

02:06:41,954 --> 02:06:43,166
SPEAKER_0:  so that we can.

02:06:43,586 --> 02:06:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  put affect aside to process later or not feel the full weight of affect.

02:06:48,226 --> 02:06:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  where we know the meaning, like I know the meaning of the tragedy of the person I just pronounced dead

02:06:53,026 --> 02:07:03,390
SPEAKER_0:  but I wanna separate that from myself because I'm also aware that it's not my tragedy so that I can then, okay, put that affect aside and go do the next thing that I have to do. So that I think can cut both ways.

02:07:04,738 --> 02:07:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  Right, but then you have to like...

02:07:06,626 --> 02:07:07,486
SPEAKER_1:  Reattach it.

02:07:08,386 --> 02:07:12,510
SPEAKER_1:  Understand that is good to be close with emotion even painful emotion

02:07:13,378 --> 02:07:13,694
SPEAKER_1:  Right.

02:07:14,146 --> 02:07:15,998
SPEAKER_1:  Like, because that's the human experience.

02:07:16,450 --> 02:07:18,526
SPEAKER_1:  Right. I feel like.

02:07:18,786 --> 02:07:21,630
SPEAKER_1:  If you build up a skill that you can detach yourself from

02:07:21,890 --> 02:07:22,526
SPEAKER_1:  Emotion.

02:07:23,970 --> 02:07:26,014
SPEAKER_1:  I think that could become its own kind of... Yeah.

02:07:26,338 --> 02:07:32,510
SPEAKER_0:  It becomes too easy to do it, right? And to reinforce, that's when people are suffering too much.

02:07:33,346 --> 02:07:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  over too long a period of time.

02:07:35,810 --> 02:07:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  then we're creatures of habit.

02:07:38,082 --> 02:07:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  Right? And even though our brains are, you're talking about our brains are sitting on the shoulders of the giant of the maybe thousand levels of emergence that come underneath of them.

02:07:47,714 --> 02:07:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  Our brains are also.

02:07:49,186 --> 02:07:53,950
SPEAKER_0:  also work in very simple habit-based ways. Like if you and I chose a word right now.

02:07:54,242 --> 02:07:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  and set it 500 times.

02:07:56,258 --> 02:07:59,550
SPEAKER_0:  We would know, it's just a silly experiment, but we'd both be saying it.

02:08:00,642 --> 02:08:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  Right? Because our brains are also creatures of habit. So if you over and over and over have to isolate yourself,

02:08:07,618 --> 02:08:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  from affect and you develop those mechanisms, well you develop those mechanisms and

02:08:12,162 --> 02:08:16,574
SPEAKER_0:  they don't go away any easier than if we said the word 500 times and decided to forget.

02:08:17,218 --> 02:08:18,974
SPEAKER_0:  We won't forget no matter what we decided.

02:08:20,546 --> 02:08:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  So...

02:08:21,602 --> 02:08:22,846
SPEAKER_1:  How do we find our way back?

02:08:24,130 --> 02:08:25,182
SPEAKER_1:  How do we overcome?

02:08:26,882 --> 02:08:28,766
SPEAKER_1:  What are the different pathways?

02:08:28,898 --> 02:08:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  The very first thing is to acknowledge.

02:08:32,258 --> 02:08:39,230
SPEAKER_0:  ourselves and often to others, which might be one other person. It might be in words, spoken, it might be written.

02:08:39,714 --> 02:08:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  what the trauma has been.

02:08:42,210 --> 02:08:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  Because the lessons of trauma...

02:08:44,834 --> 02:08:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  the evil lessons of trauma.

02:08:47,298 --> 02:08:51,454
SPEAKER_0:  And I'll use the example of my own life, the lesson that told me that

02:08:51,714 --> 02:08:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  I was shameful.

02:08:54,018 --> 02:08:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  uh, cursed.

02:08:55,362 --> 02:08:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  and hopeless.

02:08:56,642 --> 02:08:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

02:08:57,730 --> 02:08:59,774
SPEAKER_0:  It's a very evil lesson.

02:09:00,738 --> 02:09:07,262
SPEAKER_0:  but my brain will say it over and did say it over and over and over to me. And if that just sits inside.

02:09:07,490 --> 02:09:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  That's how trauma festers, that's how trauma hijacks our thoughts, our emotions.

02:09:12,354 --> 02:09:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  So being able to say.

02:09:14,562 --> 02:09:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  to ourselves and to another, like this is what's happened.

02:09:17,986 --> 02:09:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  Right? Okay. This is what's happened. We're built to

02:09:21,442 --> 02:09:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  massage words and to create meaning through words, right? Like we don't massage pictures, right, images. We talk and massage meaning with words.

02:09:29,122 --> 02:09:33,662
SPEAKER_0:  So when I finally went to see a therapist and I could say...

02:09:34,018 --> 02:09:34,558
SPEAKER_0:  No.

02:09:36,002 --> 02:09:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  My brother.

02:09:37,090 --> 02:09:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  whatever words I would have said, like he killed himself. and I can't

02:09:42,690 --> 02:09:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  accepted or I can't imagine it and like I let it happen. Like, so I had to say those things, right? So then I could begin to bring some sense of truth to it, you know, and I think it was a long time ago, but the therapist probably said something like, okay, probably season you let it happen. It's your fault, right? Cause you got to get at those things.

02:10:00,034 --> 02:10:02,558
SPEAKER_0:  so that one can begin to bring.

02:10:03,010 --> 02:10:06,622
SPEAKER_0:  into focus what does a trauma mean and what does it not mean?

02:10:06,978 --> 02:10:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, a classic example is the, what would you say to someone else example? You know, it will say, well, I.

02:10:12,450 --> 02:10:13,662
SPEAKER_0:  Now how many times have I...

02:10:14,114 --> 02:10:20,862
SPEAKER_0:  It's just, I cry if I stop and think about it enough. It's just stop and talk to someone who is sexually assaulted through no fault of their own.

02:10:21,346 --> 02:10:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  who comes in and tells the story they've been telling themselves about how it's their fault. They should have walked home a different way, they should have dressed differently, they should have left earlier. Summary

02:10:28,418 --> 02:10:31,102
SPEAKER_0:  I wrote about it in the book over and over and over.

02:10:31,458 --> 02:10:32,894
SPEAKER_0:  They have a person.

02:10:33,154 --> 02:10:33,854
SPEAKER_0:  Who?

02:10:34,114 --> 02:10:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  Let's say you take a person who's intelligent, engaged in the world, who's capable of understanding lots and lots and lots of things, but doesn't understand that.

02:10:41,698 --> 02:10:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  If it were someone else, that person would understand in a moment, it's not that person's fault. So what you want to do is overcome the fact that the negative emotions, the hijacked emotion systems of trauma are telling that person a lie and they're telling them so strongly and so strongly.

02:10:58,850 --> 02:11:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  Awfully so meanly.

02:11:00,610 --> 02:11:04,094
SPEAKER_0:  that the person just takes it inside and starts to see it as.

02:11:05,122 --> 02:11:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  So you begin to hold that up to the light of day. And again, one example could be, okay, so someone, the person who's coming in next has actually been through something similar, right? And can you stay and just...

02:11:15,906 --> 02:11:25,630
SPEAKER_0:  tell her how it's her fault, right? And like, oh my God, no, oh, because I could never, like then they see, right? I mean, again, this is not always how you do it, you can get a person to see like.

02:11:26,050 --> 02:11:27,710
SPEAKER_0:  Well that would be the most horrible-

02:11:28,482 --> 02:11:32,254
SPEAKER_0:  How could you do that? Right? Maybe they're doing it to themselves.

02:11:32,482 --> 02:11:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  So you begin.

02:11:34,370 --> 02:11:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  you begin to put words in a structure and say, okay, let's look at what's going on inside of you. You don't have to be scared of anything you're thinking and feeling. In fact, the fear is in not.

02:11:43,138 --> 02:11:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  exposing it to the light of day. That's where it gets the best of us.

02:11:46,658 --> 02:11:50,366
SPEAKER_0:  And now, everything is different. And whether that involves...

02:11:50,722 --> 02:11:58,526
SPEAKER_0:  use of medications for intrusive thoughts and depression, or there's no medicines needed, but it's all reframing, like whatever it may be that comes next.

02:11:58,850 --> 02:12:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  The whole world has changed.

02:12:00,802 --> 02:12:02,334
SPEAKER_0:  when the person has...

02:12:02,978 --> 02:12:12,894
SPEAKER_0:  acknowledged what's happened, exposed it to themselves and to trusted others around them and begun to look at it in some way other than...

02:12:13,122 --> 02:12:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  the stuff in an evil box place that the trauma initially puts us through our.

02:12:18,690 --> 02:12:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  The reflexes it creates in us.

02:12:20,514 --> 02:12:23,326
SPEAKER_1:  It's interesting that there's power to just saying it out loud.

02:12:25,282 --> 02:12:27,646
SPEAKER_1:  First, saying your perception of it aloud.

02:12:28,546 --> 02:12:30,430
SPEAKER_1:  other than in that case, that might be your fault.

02:12:31,106 --> 02:12:31,806
SPEAKER_1:  And then...

02:12:32,418 --> 02:12:34,622
SPEAKER_1:  working out loud, working through.

02:12:35,714 --> 02:12:36,286
SPEAKER_1:  that

02:12:36,546 --> 02:12:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  It may not be.

02:12:38,402 --> 02:12:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  Any experienced therapist will tell you this that.

02:12:41,218 --> 02:12:42,686
SPEAKER_0:  Every now and then it will happen.

02:12:43,042 --> 02:12:46,110
SPEAKER_0:  that someone will come and they'll say something.

02:12:46,626 --> 02:12:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  Usually it's very early on in the process, they'll say something they've never said before and they immediately...

02:12:52,482 --> 02:12:56,286
SPEAKER_0:  are in an entirely different place than they may have been for decades.

02:12:56,898 --> 02:12:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  And I can remember a person saying...

02:12:58,946 --> 02:13:00,990
SPEAKER_0:  that the coach had raped him.

02:13:01,826 --> 02:13:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  and just saying it. This was Aknie Sane.

02:13:03,458 --> 02:13:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  decades before.

02:13:04,770 --> 02:13:06,494
SPEAKER_0:  Everything was different.

02:13:06,882 --> 02:13:13,662
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not saying everything is perfect, but his life was in a different, but as soon as he said it, he could see how dare, like he thought that person did that.

02:13:13,954 --> 02:13:14,782
SPEAKER_0:  to this child.

02:13:15,170 --> 02:13:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  The child was me.

02:13:16,482 --> 02:13:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  He never thought it until he said it out loud because his mind was going over and over with why it was his fault, what he did to deserve it, how he kept going back, so it must be his fault. It was in it, as soon as he put words to it, he saw the truth of it.

02:13:29,602 --> 02:13:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:13:30,690 --> 02:13:33,918
SPEAKER_0:  You lose a bifurcation in the path of life then. And any therapist has-

02:13:34,178 --> 02:13:39,934
SPEAKER_0:  you know, stories like that, which just shows the immense power that it can even be that just uttering the words.

02:13:40,322 --> 02:13:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  makes just a cascade of change all at once.

02:13:44,162 --> 02:13:46,206
SPEAKER_1:  Just saying those words to another human being.

02:13:47,586 --> 02:13:50,494
SPEAKER_1:  It makes you wonder what that compulsive

02:13:51,170 --> 02:13:53,022
SPEAKER_1:  loop that happens in our heads.

02:13:54,562 --> 02:13:55,934
SPEAKER_1:  until it's...

02:13:56,226 --> 02:13:57,342
SPEAKER_1:  brought to the surface.

02:13:57,602 --> 02:13:58,462
SPEAKER_1:  That's so interesting.

02:13:58,850 --> 02:14:05,822
SPEAKER_0:  entirely non-productive the loops. And sometimes even if we put, what would I say to another? Let me write it down. It can get rid of those loops in our.

02:14:06,306 --> 02:14:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  in our brains. Any even thought of outward expression is the enemy of those.

02:14:11,234 --> 02:14:13,694
SPEAKER_0:  internal persecutory negative thought loops.

02:14:14,306 --> 02:14:15,806
SPEAKER_0:  How do you find a good therapist?

02:14:17,698 --> 02:14:19,326
SPEAKER_1:  I tend to think of...

02:14:19,970 --> 02:14:21,726
SPEAKER_1:  Listen, I'm a fan of podcasts.

02:14:22,338 --> 02:14:25,406
SPEAKER_1:  I'm a fan of conversations. It feels like a real, you know.

02:14:25,954 --> 02:14:27,550
SPEAKER_1:  It's like finding a good friend.

02:14:27,842 --> 02:14:30,558
SPEAKER_1:  or something. It feels like a difficult journey.

02:14:31,170 --> 02:14:34,398
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe I'm wrong in that, but it just feels like such a...

02:14:35,906 --> 02:14:39,806
SPEAKER_1:  It feels like a partnership, a journey together versus like some very

02:14:40,642 --> 02:14:42,430
SPEAKER_1:  simple clinical

02:14:42,594 --> 02:14:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  procedure.

02:14:44,354 --> 02:14:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  The first thing I would say is.

02:14:45,954 --> 02:14:55,678
SPEAKER_0:  to change the entire paradigm. Like most people, like, okay, I need a therapist. So people feel often like they're in a weakened position because they need, you know, quote unquote, a therapist.

02:14:56,002 --> 02:14:58,046
SPEAKER_0:  then therapists are rationed.

02:14:58,338 --> 02:15:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  Right? How many insurance panels have

02:15:01,698 --> 02:15:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  lists a mile long of qualified therapists.

02:15:04,738 --> 02:15:07,422
SPEAKER_0:  who could be on that insurance panel.

02:15:07,650 --> 02:15:15,806
SPEAKER_0:  but there's a certification process. Like these things make no sense, right? The state's already certified the person, right? But there's so many barriers to entry that now we're rationing.

02:15:16,194 --> 02:15:25,246
SPEAKER_0:  this resource, which we should all stop and pause for a second and think like we're okay with that as a society. And by the way, everything else is like that too, when we're trying to get help for our health.

02:15:25,538 --> 02:15:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  So let's step back from that for a second.

02:15:27,874 --> 02:15:32,350
SPEAKER_0:  Now it's a resource that's not in great supply, and then a person begins to think.

02:15:33,090 --> 02:15:37,662
SPEAKER_0:  you know, essentially I'll take what I can get. Like I just gotta get somebody I don't know enough to know anyway, right?

02:15:37,890 --> 02:15:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  And those are very disempowering.

02:15:39,842 --> 02:15:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  thoughts as opposed to saying, look, I'm going to be an empowered consumer and

02:15:44,354 --> 02:15:46,334
SPEAKER_0:  I need to choose someone.

02:15:46,690 --> 02:15:59,166
SPEAKER_0:  who gets over just some basic hurdles of what I think are reasonable human interaction, right? So like, is a person making eye contact? Do they seem interested, right? Like, these are basic points about any human interaction, including a therapist, right?

02:15:59,394 --> 02:16:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  then you can say, okay, is there a word of mouth? Anyone else has something good? Nothing better than a word of mouth recommendation from someone you trust, right?

02:16:05,954 --> 02:16:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  Or anybody can have a good website, but you say, let me look at the website. What is it saying if there is one, right?

02:16:11,138 --> 02:16:12,798
SPEAKER_0:  Does it?

02:16:13,122 --> 02:16:15,294
SPEAKER_0:  resonate with me or not, right?

02:16:15,522 --> 02:16:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  But after all of that, then you go to see the person.

02:16:19,010 --> 02:16:20,702
SPEAKER_0:  with the idea that you're interviewing them.

02:16:21,378 --> 02:16:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  Right? The idea that, yeah, I hope this person can help me. And if so, great, I'm with the program, but I'm thinking about it. Do I want this person? Do I feel heard? Do I feel cared for?

02:16:31,490 --> 02:16:34,974
SPEAKER_0:  Which doesn't mean is it easy, right? What it might mean is it hard and...

02:16:35,202 --> 02:16:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  I leave and I feel like...

02:16:37,378 --> 02:16:41,406
SPEAKER_0:  Emotional for a couple of days, but but I see that I'm facing new things

02:16:41,666 --> 02:16:43,390
SPEAKER_0:  Now this process of assessment...

02:16:43,778 --> 02:16:46,494
SPEAKER_0:  so that one isn't settling for something.

02:16:46,818 --> 02:16:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  that is formulaic, over-packaged, and I'm not trying to be overly critical of therapists. I mean, there are people everywhere who do their jobs well and people who don't do their jobs well.

02:16:55,234 --> 02:16:58,398
SPEAKER_0:  but most therapists are working in systems.

02:16:58,658 --> 02:17:00,414
SPEAKER_0:  that push against doing.

02:17:00,770 --> 02:17:07,358
SPEAKER_0:  the job well, right, because they're rationing care and there's a lot of number of sessions and there's enough time before a person can return.

02:17:07,650 --> 02:17:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  So often it's an uphill battle because we're trying to be helped.

02:17:10,978 --> 02:17:14,078
SPEAKER_0:  within systems we've created and tolerate.

02:17:14,338 --> 02:17:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  that are pushing.

02:17:16,098 --> 02:17:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  against helping us.

02:17:19,234 --> 02:17:20,359
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, but you know that

02:17:20,359 --> 02:17:21,406
SPEAKER_1:  process.

02:17:22,114 --> 02:17:25,246
SPEAKER_1:  It's tricky. I mean, if you're in a rough place mentally.

02:17:26,690 --> 02:17:27,998
SPEAKER_1:  just like with

02:17:28,226 --> 02:17:30,238
SPEAKER_1:  with any kind of interview, it's hard not to.

02:17:31,586 --> 02:17:33,982
SPEAKER_1:  that a failed interaction failed interview.

02:17:34,882 --> 02:17:37,054
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, there's, there's something wrong with you.

02:17:37,474 --> 02:17:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  Sure.

02:17:38,818 --> 02:17:41,854
SPEAKER_1:  There is an authority to a therapist, I think, where you think like...

02:17:42,402 --> 02:17:43,774
SPEAKER_1:  They've got it all figured out.

02:17:44,706 --> 02:17:47,102
SPEAKER_1:  and I'm a mess and therefore

02:17:47,682 --> 02:17:49,022
SPEAKER_1:  If there's something off...

02:17:49,410 --> 02:17:50,302
SPEAKER_1:  It's all my fault.

02:17:51,394 --> 02:17:54,686
SPEAKER_1:  Alright, so it's very tricky and it's easy to then give up and then...

02:17:55,042 --> 02:17:58,782
SPEAKER_1:  It's like the step to try to get a therapist, the first step.

02:17:59,554 --> 02:18:03,710
SPEAKER_1:  To get help, if I get therapists, like any kind of help, that's a big leap to take.

02:18:04,098 --> 02:18:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  Especially when you're in a rough place. I agree completely. We should not make people.

02:18:09,154 --> 02:18:11,166
SPEAKER_0:  swim against such a strong current.

02:18:11,586 --> 02:18:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  to get their needs met.

02:18:12,898 --> 02:18:15,582
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, we see this in such obvious places where...

02:18:15,810 --> 02:18:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  You have an elderly homebound person.

02:18:18,370 --> 02:18:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  who can't get their medicine.

02:18:20,162 --> 02:18:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  because, oh, there's been some change and they didn't put the new number into the form or Lord knows what, I mean, it's, it's

02:18:26,050 --> 02:18:30,558
SPEAKER_0:  incredible how we force people to swim against strong currents.

02:18:30,882 --> 02:18:34,462
SPEAKER_0:  to get things that are just basic at times for their survival.

02:18:34,978 --> 02:18:35,390
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:18:35,842 --> 02:18:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  And with that in mind, I don't have a lot of respect for where healthcare is at or where mental health is at.

02:18:41,378 --> 02:18:45,726
SPEAKER_0:  is at. The field that I work in has accepted all sorts of

02:18:46,242 --> 02:18:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:18:46,882 --> 02:18:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  aspects of how things go, someone else controlling.

02:18:50,466 --> 02:18:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  how long the interaction can go on, how the interaction is bounded, what can be said and done, what medicines can be prescribed.

02:18:58,146 --> 02:19:02,334
SPEAKER_0:  There's so many external controls in the systems we work in.

02:19:02,594 --> 02:19:03,038
SPEAKER_0:  that

02:19:03,266 --> 02:19:07,070
SPEAKER_0:  We, and I say me included, like all of us in the field.

02:19:07,970 --> 02:19:11,838
SPEAKER_0:  have let it get to a place where it's obscenely difficult.

02:19:12,322 --> 02:19:12,894
SPEAKER_0:  to get help.

02:19:13,282 --> 02:19:14,718
SPEAKER_0:  obscenely difficult.

02:19:15,010 --> 02:19:15,678
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:19:15,970 --> 02:19:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  We should

02:19:17,122 --> 02:19:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  Say that's not okay.

02:19:18,914 --> 02:19:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  I think psychiatrists and

02:19:21,186 --> 02:19:25,982
SPEAKER_0:  therapists and masters level social workers, psychologists and you name it, I think.

02:19:26,274 --> 02:19:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  we should all say, this is not okay. And then we as a society should be saying, this is not okay. Otherwise what you're saying, which is I think...

02:19:34,402 --> 02:19:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  true will only become worse as there's more and more barriers.

02:19:38,658 --> 02:19:41,726
SPEAKER_0:  to getting the help a person needs and each time a person isn't helped

02:19:42,242 --> 02:19:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  it sets the odds against them getting more help.

02:19:44,610 --> 02:19:46,302
SPEAKER_0:  I should say, Hugh, that you're...

02:19:46,594 --> 02:19:53,598
SPEAKER_0:  When I started working, there were times I would send people to an emergency room, right, if there was some emergency, you know, emergency in their mental health and they were at risk.

02:19:54,178 --> 02:19:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  And there were times I'd send somebody to an emergency room where if you stopped and looked,

02:19:58,210 --> 02:19:59,966
SPEAKER_0:  It would have been malpractice not to do that.

02:20:00,674 --> 02:20:01,086
SPEAKER_0:  All right.

02:20:01,378 --> 02:20:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  Now!

02:20:02,722 --> 02:20:04,638
SPEAKER_0:  It's not just me who...

02:20:04,866 --> 02:20:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  Who?

02:20:05,634 --> 02:20:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  has an incredibly high threshold.

02:20:08,482 --> 02:20:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  for sending someone to an emergency room because you just send someone who's in a lot of distress and oftentimes they're sitting on a gurney in a hallway or they're locked in a small white room and all they had was depression. They're scared when they go in and 36 hours later, oh, they're feeling a little better. Wikes are desperate to get out of there and someone sends them home. I mean…

02:20:26,946 --> 02:20:31,294
SPEAKER_0:  So our systems have shifted so much that we tolerate.

02:20:31,682 --> 02:20:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  Now, on mass.

02:20:33,218 --> 02:20:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  what is egregious to the individual.

02:20:37,314 --> 02:20:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  So you are.

02:20:38,594 --> 02:20:40,350
SPEAKER_1:  psychiatrist in terms of

02:20:40,802 --> 02:20:42,238
SPEAKER_1:  uh, doing therapy.

02:20:42,786 --> 02:20:43,614
SPEAKER_1:  Psychotherapy.

02:20:44,866 --> 02:20:46,686
SPEAKER_1:  What does a successful interaction look like?

02:20:47,298 --> 02:20:49,726
SPEAKER_1:  Perhaps a fun question, perhaps not.

02:20:50,274 --> 02:20:54,558
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think of the psychiatrist Sean and good will hunting played by Robin Williams?

02:20:55,426 --> 02:21:00,446
SPEAKER_1:  So what is the full range of interesting interactions? Can there be an intimacy, a friendship, a kind of...

02:21:01,026 --> 02:21:02,366
SPEAKER_1:  um, varied

02:21:02,658 --> 02:21:04,862
SPEAKER_1:  interaction that kind of blends the lines of

02:21:05,346 --> 02:21:08,478
SPEAKER_1:  you know, 30 minutes session once a week or whatever.

02:21:08,962 --> 02:21:11,326
SPEAKER_1:  versus like a really kind of...

02:21:12,450 --> 02:21:17,438
SPEAKER_1:  deliberate long-term project that cares about the well-being of a person.

02:21:17,730 --> 02:21:19,454
SPEAKER_1:  across the months and years.

02:21:20,258 --> 02:21:23,486
SPEAKER_1:  What can you say about a successful?

02:21:24,130 --> 02:21:25,214
SPEAKER_1:  interaction between.

02:21:25,378 --> 02:21:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  therapist and patient.

02:21:26,914 --> 02:21:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  I think we're much better served by the latter.

02:21:30,018 --> 02:21:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  And again, it doesn't have to be over.

02:21:31,842 --> 02:21:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  years, we may be pressing this person might need that over weeks, they might need it over months, they might need it over years.

02:21:38,434 --> 02:21:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  If I'm understanding correctly, you're describing something that is...

02:21:41,986 --> 02:21:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  like a real human engagement.

02:21:44,354 --> 02:21:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  And I work in a field that...

02:21:46,722 --> 02:21:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  for...

02:21:47,554 --> 02:21:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  years and years and years.

02:21:49,154 --> 02:21:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  the patient didn't get to see. The therapist was sitting in a place, he was sitting behind the person, right?

02:21:54,978 --> 02:21:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:21:55,618 --> 02:22:00,830
SPEAKER_0:  That's not of course the only tradition and there are aspects of that tradition that can be very humanized.

02:22:01,058 --> 02:22:02,718
SPEAKER_0:  But the idea that...

02:22:03,042 --> 02:22:08,990
SPEAKER_0:  we're supposed to not be human. I mean, this medicine is shot through with this, right? That the doctor's supposed to be God and it protects the doctor.

02:22:09,218 --> 02:22:12,382
SPEAKER_0:  And that makes its way into therapy and the idea of.

02:22:12,674 --> 02:22:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  the superiority, the therapist knows more.

02:22:15,970 --> 02:22:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  I mean in some ways

02:22:17,666 --> 02:22:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, but the idea is to know more about mechanical things.

02:22:22,146 --> 02:22:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  right to know more about like.

02:22:23,810 --> 02:22:27,806
SPEAKER_0:  and knowledge not as a human being, right? If we approach

02:22:28,130 --> 02:22:30,462
SPEAKER_0:  therapy as a collaborative human endeavor.

02:22:30,754 --> 02:22:32,798
SPEAKER_0:  Right? We're gonna do it together.

02:22:33,122 --> 02:22:43,582
SPEAKER_0:  Of course I'm gonna learn from you too, right? I mean, we're two human beings and we're talking about things that are deep and personal and intimate. And I'm not gonna participate in a way that makes it like about me.

02:22:44,066 --> 02:22:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  as much as it's about you, but we're two humans and what's gone on in me may have relevance and sharing it may have relevance. And at times,

02:22:51,682 --> 02:22:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  you doing something back for me may have relevance. I'll give you an example of a person who would not...

02:22:57,218 --> 02:23:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  let me help him. It was a young man. So when I was in training, who was very

02:23:01,730 --> 02:23:05,534
SPEAKER_0:  very sick and needed to change certain choices and habits.

02:23:05,794 --> 02:23:07,070
SPEAKER_0:  or he was not going to survive.

02:23:07,554 --> 02:23:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  and I had no...

02:23:09,122 --> 02:23:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  ability to help him whatsoever.

02:23:11,650 --> 02:23:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  And I went and I saw a supervisor who is existentially trained. Where here it's different from existentialism in the classic sense, but it's about really human connection, right?

02:23:20,418 --> 02:23:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  And the guy was always wanting to teach me.

02:23:22,850 --> 02:23:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  something, right? Because I can get by in Spanish, but he was fluent in Spanish. And he wanted to, he'd, oh, you traveled here and he'd say, you know, a word to see if I knew. And I was always directing back to what I was supposed to do, right? And the supervisor, I've never forget, he said,

02:23:36,578 --> 02:23:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  Let him teach you Spanish. Come on, so we had a couple sessions where if you look from the outside, you say, what is going on there? Like,

02:23:43,586 --> 02:23:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  Right, like they were Spanish lessons. Heh, I do National Longing

02:23:45,858 --> 02:23:49,822
SPEAKER_0:  me, right? And then at some point he brought in his mother and...

02:23:50,050 --> 02:23:53,310
SPEAKER_0:  We hadn't brought her in yet and he was in part showing off.

02:23:53,794 --> 02:23:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  that he taught me something, right? And I said a couple things and he felt.

02:23:57,346 --> 02:24:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  more powerful, like he was younger than me and he felt sick and disempowered

02:24:01,378 --> 02:24:05,886
SPEAKER_0:  but he didn't feel that way once he taught me something and we showed it off to his mother, right? you

02:24:06,178 --> 02:24:09,822
SPEAKER_0:  and his behavior started to change, he started taking better care of himself.

02:24:10,114 --> 02:24:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  He could see a little more what I was saying. He was like, you're a wonderful person. Look, you love your mother and your aunt and they love you. And he could start seeing that about himself.

02:24:18,402 --> 02:24:20,638
SPEAKER_0:  But that came from humanness and if-

02:24:20,930 --> 02:24:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that's the way we help people.

02:24:23,746 --> 02:24:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  I don't understand why we don't do everything that way. It's like, we're two humans.

02:24:27,682 --> 02:24:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  But if you're doing something for me, then there's something you have an expertise in, I don't, that's why you're doing it for me. The reverse could be true, but it doesn't mean we're not just two humans doing something together.

02:24:37,730 --> 02:24:43,070
SPEAKER_1:  And the healthcare system and the legal system should not get in the way of that. I mean, there's liability and all these kinds of things.

02:24:43,490 --> 02:24:44,350
SPEAKER_1:  that uh...

02:24:45,634 --> 02:24:46,782
SPEAKER_1:  can get in the way.

02:24:47,138 --> 02:24:48,222
SPEAKER_1:  of the humanness.

02:24:49,314 --> 02:24:54,974
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, some of that is justified. You have to be careful. You have to make sure there's irresponsible, but.

02:24:55,714 --> 02:24:57,758
SPEAKER_1:  A little too much can destroy the humanness.

02:24:57,890 --> 02:25:04,318
SPEAKER_0:  I'll use it where I don't usually say something is insane. Like it's not consistent with sanity. And the presence of.

02:25:04,898 --> 02:25:08,990
SPEAKER_0:  of the legal system. Look I'm all for of course physicians have to be held.

02:25:09,346 --> 02:25:13,982
SPEAKER_0:  We have to be responsible and everybody makes mistakes and we have to be accountable for their mistakes.

02:25:14,466 --> 02:25:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  I understand all of that.

02:25:17,346 --> 02:25:19,998
SPEAKER_0:  But what we see now, it's so...

02:25:20,834 --> 02:25:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  absurd that, oh, like everyone is frightened.

02:25:24,002 --> 02:25:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  Everyone is frightened and then just looking to like, how do I slot into the box, check the boxes of what I'm supposed to do and not get in trouble?

02:25:32,642 --> 02:25:33,470
SPEAKER_0:  You know, people get...

02:25:33,698 --> 02:25:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  sued because

02:25:34,914 --> 02:25:41,246
SPEAKER_0:  someone was at that hospital and that doctor touched their care. It happens in the VA system. It happens in other systems too.

02:25:41,634 --> 02:25:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  So you might have touched their care and no one's even saying you did anything wrong, but they say the next person did. Oh, someone settled on your behalf and now you have a malpractice.

02:25:49,378 --> 02:25:53,502
SPEAKER_0:  and maybe you can't get a license somewhere else. Like, doctors are terrified?

02:25:53,890 --> 02:25:55,294
SPEAKER_0:  and they're terrified for good.

02:25:56,034 --> 02:25:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  They're terrified for good reason, because the same society that is

02:25:59,362 --> 02:26:08,574
SPEAKER_0:  given doctors in many ways too much power over time and treated doctors maybe too much like gods, now is I think enacting some of society's anger and envy.

02:26:08,962 --> 02:26:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  Out on the...

02:26:10,018 --> 02:26:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  physicians, even the idea that like.

02:26:12,578 --> 02:26:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  person would know what medicine like I saw a couple of TV commercials give me this

02:26:16,322 --> 02:26:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  Like it's interesting, right?

02:26:18,626 --> 02:26:19,038
SPEAKER_0:  because

02:26:19,330 --> 02:26:19,838
SPEAKER_0:  Even if.

02:26:20,354 --> 02:26:23,934
SPEAKER_0:  Let's say I take myself out of it. It doesn't feel good, obviously, but it's like, wow.

02:26:24,546 --> 02:26:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  Like I went to school for like eight years for this and you didn't even wanna hear my opinion, right? You're not taking good care of yourself, right? It doesn't mean you should think my opinion is gospel because I said it.

02:26:33,730 --> 02:26:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  But, but-

02:26:34,562 --> 02:26:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  People then don't have an understanding of like, what is expertise? What do people learn?

02:26:39,202 --> 02:26:45,182
SPEAKER_0:  how can people help us understand and make better decisions? it kind of goes out with the wash and then

02:26:45,538 --> 02:26:50,462
SPEAKER_0:  the position of the expert, I mean a lot has been written about this, right, gets diminished over time.

02:26:50,978 --> 02:26:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  very much to our own.

02:26:52,834 --> 02:26:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  and then often with aggression in the medical world.

02:26:56,130 --> 02:26:56,478
SPEAKER_0:  coming.

02:26:56,738 --> 02:26:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  Back towards.

02:26:57,986 --> 02:26:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  the alleged expert.

02:26:59,874 --> 02:27:00,999
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, expertise is a-

02:27:00,999 --> 02:27:03,550
SPEAKER_1:  tricky one. Such a tricky thing.

02:27:03,938 --> 02:27:04,862
SPEAKER_1:  Because, uh...

02:27:08,962 --> 02:27:14,398
SPEAKER_1:  coupled with expertise, the attention is this arrogance that can come with expertise.

02:27:14,882 --> 02:27:15,710
SPEAKER_1:  The arrogance can

02:27:16,066 --> 02:27:16,638
SPEAKER_1:  Make the ac-

02:27:16,866 --> 02:27:19,390
SPEAKER_1:  the expert feel like they're more of an expert.

02:27:20,034 --> 02:27:26,686
SPEAKER_1:  Um, and then it's a vicious cycle and then the arrogance in the current, in the 21st century, especially with the internet, the arrogance can.

02:27:27,298 --> 02:27:33,694
SPEAKER_1:  uh, completely forced the public to distrust the expert because it all this is the gare arrogance vs the expertise

02:27:33,922 --> 02:27:34,910
SPEAKER_1:  So, um...

02:27:35,266 --> 02:27:36,510
SPEAKER_1:  Ultimately you have to have...

02:27:36,930 --> 02:27:37,438
SPEAKER_1:  I think.

02:27:39,042 --> 02:27:42,782
SPEAKER_1:  the greatest experts and masters I know are the ones that have.

02:27:43,266 --> 02:27:46,641
SPEAKER_0:  complete humility. Right, humility and gratitude. Benefit of humanity is taking advantage of what is right and what is wrong.

02:27:46,641 --> 02:27:50,174
SPEAKER_1:  back. Which is usually a really good sign that somebody...

02:27:51,074 --> 02:27:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  as at the top of their field.

02:27:53,250 --> 02:27:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  And they'll acknowledge that they don't know everything.

02:27:56,098 --> 02:28:00,958
SPEAKER_1:  Which is hilarious, right? So like the best experts I know are the ones.

02:28:01,506 --> 02:28:02,270
SPEAKER_1:  that will.

02:28:02,850 --> 02:28:03,742
SPEAKER_1:  say that they...

02:28:04,290 --> 02:28:04,926
SPEAKER_1:  don't know.

02:28:05,602 --> 02:28:07,390
SPEAKER_1:  that would not call themselves next.

02:28:08,866 --> 02:28:10,334
SPEAKER_1:  It's very confusing.

02:28:11,042 --> 02:28:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  Or know that they know a lot, but don't know the answer to this. You see that a lot in medicine. That person knows they're an expert surgeon, but they also acknowledge they don't know if this is the right time to operate. That's how you get to the best answer instead of someone who is an expert and always knows the answer.

02:28:25,378 --> 02:28:26,503
SPEAKER_0:  uh... if actually

02:28:26,503 --> 02:28:29,694
SPEAKER_1:  rewind to the beginning of our conversation we talked about

02:28:30,626 --> 02:28:32,926
SPEAKER_1:  You mentioned something I wanted to return to.

02:28:33,154 --> 02:28:34,174
SPEAKER_1:  So there's a...

02:28:34,626 --> 02:28:35,838
SPEAKER_1:  There's layers that are...

02:28:36,098 --> 02:28:37,502
SPEAKER_1:  There's an emergent

02:28:37,794 --> 02:28:41,054
SPEAKER_1:  novelty and you mentioned that we as human beings and we.

02:28:41,666 --> 02:28:43,518
SPEAKER_1:  introspect and omind.

02:28:43,970 --> 02:28:45,950
SPEAKER_1:  We really can't know most of it.

02:28:46,434 --> 02:28:46,878
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:28:47,138 --> 02:28:47,934
SPEAKER_1:  Which of course...

02:28:48,514 --> 02:28:52,158
SPEAKER_1:  makes me think of this the unconscious mind subconscious mind

02:28:52,482 --> 02:28:56,414
SPEAKER_1:  and Carl Jung, how much is hiding there in the shadows? You've, uh...

02:28:56,770 --> 02:29:00,350
SPEAKER_1:  investigated a lot of trauma. How much is there in our mind?

02:29:00,866 --> 02:29:02,814
SPEAKER_1:  that's not directly accessible to us.

02:29:03,490 --> 02:29:05,854
SPEAKER_1:  Like what can you say, maybe philosophically?

02:29:06,466 --> 02:29:08,190
SPEAKER_1:  about how much is there.

02:29:09,122 --> 02:29:09,822
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhh...

02:29:10,338 --> 02:29:11,463
SPEAKER_1:  lurking in the

02:29:11,463 --> 02:29:12,510
SPEAKER_0:  in the shadow.

02:29:13,410 --> 02:29:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  I think there's a tremendous amount.

02:29:16,322 --> 02:29:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  but I wouldn't.

02:29:17,730 --> 02:29:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  I don't immediately go to.

02:29:20,546 --> 02:29:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  an ominous perspective, right? Because if it's lurking there, right, it can come get us, right? And to some extent, that's true, right? Because the seeds of evil are there if we want to plant and nurture them. You think good things can't lurk?

02:29:32,130 --> 02:29:34,755
SPEAKER_0:  I guess I realize. I was being poetic. So we are just gonna do a GOOD.

02:29:34,755 --> 02:29:41,662
SPEAKER_1:  But you're right, you're absolutely right. And the young in shadow is supposed to not just be dark things, it's supposed to be everything. It's supposed to be a lot of positive things as well, yeah.

02:29:42,690 --> 02:29:44,190
SPEAKER_0:  which I think brings us to.

02:29:44,514 --> 02:29:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  self-knowledge to truth, where I think the opposite of envy.

02:29:49,282 --> 02:29:52,670
SPEAKER_0:  narcissism, sociopathy, I do think is all rooted in.

02:29:53,154 --> 02:29:56,958
SPEAKER_0:  It's both the truth of the good things about us or the ways we're not.

02:29:57,538 --> 02:30:01,822
SPEAKER_0:  we're not blame worthy for the things we're blaming ourselves for etc.

02:30:02,242 --> 02:30:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  but the self-knowledge and the truth and...

02:30:05,762 --> 02:30:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  getting away from the reflex of anger, frustration, envy, shame.

02:30:10,370 --> 02:30:21,214
SPEAKER_0:  What I think happens then is all of that underneath the surface. If we look at like the consciousness is the top of the iceberg, you know, outside the top. So outside the water. So is what's underneath like.

02:30:21,602 --> 02:30:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  shifting and it can pull the top under right or is it supporting the top?

02:30:26,050 --> 02:30:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  and in it.

02:30:27,170 --> 02:30:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  really I believe is honesty, truth, self-knowledge, humility, gratitude, all this simple stuff, good mental health.

02:30:34,690 --> 02:30:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  is always consistent with simplicity. You know, humility, gratitude are easy things.

02:30:39,266 --> 02:30:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  to say, like, we know what that is, right? We understand what that is. Soothing envy by having immense power and subjugating others is getting very, very complicated, right, what that is and how that plays out.

02:30:51,586 --> 02:30:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  So if we are in touch with ourselves, if we're honest with ourselves, if we own what's ours...

02:30:57,218 --> 02:31:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  We don't try and own what's not ours, right? What happens then is something isn't waiting inside of us to sort of jump us with some new...

02:31:04,930 --> 02:31:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  a fact of self or challenge of self, right?

02:31:08,354 --> 02:31:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  Then I think what happens are...

02:31:10,306 --> 02:31:15,294
SPEAKER_0:  phenomena like intrinsic learning, like the way that so much happens inside of us automatically.

02:31:15,522 --> 02:31:18,462
SPEAKER_0:  how people who have high levels of expertise.

02:31:18,818 --> 02:31:20,062
SPEAKER_0:  know the answer.

02:31:20,386 --> 02:31:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  complex questions.

02:31:22,274 --> 02:31:23,166
SPEAKER_0:  more rapidly.

02:31:23,522 --> 02:31:32,798
SPEAKER_0:  It doesn't take them longer to think through it, but they have more knowledge to think through. The more happens rapidly and unconsciously, so they know the more complex answer, the

02:31:33,314 --> 02:31:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  more quickly and readily. We can build that in ourselves, not just in terms of factual knowledge, but in terms of how we respond to things.

02:31:43,042 --> 02:31:48,766
SPEAKER_0:  If I make a mistake, do I respond with reflexive shame? If I see someone has something I'd like, how do I respond?

02:31:49,154 --> 02:31:51,518
SPEAKER_0:  We're more in accord with ourselves.

02:31:51,778 --> 02:31:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  And then the automaticity in us is.

02:31:55,170 --> 02:31:56,295
SPEAKER_0:  is serving us better.

02:31:56,295 --> 02:32:01,342
SPEAKER_1:  So that's in the positive. Do you think, do you draw some wisdom from the early pioneers?

02:32:01,922 --> 02:32:05,566
SPEAKER_1:  of psychotherapy like Freud and Jung.

02:32:05,826 --> 02:32:07,422
SPEAKER_1:  Yes. There's some repressed.

02:32:09,186 --> 02:32:11,838
SPEAKER_1:  There's some stuff to work through.

02:32:12,482 --> 02:32:14,357
SPEAKER_1:  that is in the income.

02:32:14,357 --> 02:32:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  conscious mind.

02:32:15,746 --> 02:32:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, I think there's

02:32:17,378 --> 02:32:19,262
SPEAKER_0:  Always, like 100%.

02:32:19,938 --> 02:32:22,654
SPEAKER_0:  of the time. You have a living human, you have things to work through.

02:32:23,010 --> 02:32:24,030
SPEAKER_0:  in the unconscious mind.

02:32:24,418 --> 02:32:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  There's too much that goes on around us that we might find.

02:32:28,162 --> 02:32:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  unacceptable and suppress.

02:32:29,986 --> 02:32:30,782
SPEAKER_0:  There can be.

02:32:31,522 --> 02:32:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  smaller but important examples, right? Someone who...

02:32:35,202 --> 02:32:35,710
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:32:36,866 --> 02:32:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  feels that they're not a good enough parent and

02:32:39,682 --> 02:32:42,302
SPEAKER_0:  They, I don't know, they dropped the child's.

02:32:42,530 --> 02:32:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  plate.

02:32:43,394 --> 02:32:44,286
SPEAKER_0:  Right and.

02:32:44,930 --> 02:32:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:32:46,658 --> 02:32:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  and there's a feeling about that of badness.

02:32:49,634 --> 02:32:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  in them that the person that can't tolerate and pushes away, right? maybe they become a little bit less confident, a little bit less assertive.

02:32:57,186 --> 02:33:03,454
SPEAKER_0:  Those small examples are important because they may be low valence, but there can be many, many, many, many, many, many of them.

02:33:03,778 --> 02:33:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  Then you can look at the opposite end of the spectrum where someone, for example, feels that they're repressing their sexuality.

02:33:11,170 --> 02:33:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  unconsciously, something that is...

02:33:14,082 --> 02:33:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  so important, say, to how a person feels about themselves, to whether they can seek fulfillment, to how they feel about themselves, to how they feel about themselves, to how they feel

02:33:19,106 --> 02:33:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  feel about their ability to interact and engage with others in ways that are loving and generative over time.

02:33:24,802 --> 02:33:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  So from smaller things?

02:33:27,170 --> 02:33:30,654
SPEAKER_0:  that accumulate often at rapid pace to really big things.

02:33:30,882 --> 02:33:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  We are pushing things into the unconscious because they're not.

02:33:34,530 --> 02:33:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  acceptable and we need to explore like why is that not acceptable? Maybe there's not an acceptable urge because it's really not acceptable to me, right? Like a violent urge.

02:33:42,690 --> 02:33:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe there's an unacceptable urge.

02:33:44,738 --> 02:33:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  Because...

02:33:45,698 --> 02:33:52,382
SPEAKER_0:  I'm actually listening to the lies society is telling me about what's okay and what's not okay. So in exploring those things,

02:33:52,674 --> 02:34:00,958
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, we become happier and healthier. And that could mean if we're already happy and healthy, it gets better. We get more insulated against the negative.

02:34:01,186 --> 02:34:04,798
SPEAKER_0:  Or it can mean the person who's really nurturing some of those seeds of

02:34:05,154 --> 02:34:08,190
SPEAKER_0:  of evil and envy does that less or steps away.

02:34:08,482 --> 02:34:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  So whether it's good or it's bad, it's in there inside of us.

02:34:12,386 --> 02:34:14,046
SPEAKER_0:  and we benefit from.

02:34:14,594 --> 02:34:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  understanding that idea of the observing ego, right? Like we said, the part that can stop and say, hey, this is what's.

02:34:19,970 --> 02:34:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  This is where I see what's going on in me.

02:34:22,210 --> 02:34:23,335
SPEAKER_0:  What have you learned?

02:34:23,335 --> 02:34:26,750
SPEAKER_1:  about exploring the human mind, about the art of conversation.

02:34:27,458 --> 02:34:29,246
SPEAKER_1:  is ultimately therapy's conversation.

02:34:30,530 --> 02:34:32,702
SPEAKER_1:  Is there something you can put into words?

02:34:33,730 --> 02:34:35,605
SPEAKER_1:  Like what makes it a

02:34:35,605 --> 02:34:36,030
SPEAKER_0:  Good.

02:34:36,674 --> 02:34:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  I think language is among the most amazing gifts we have.

02:34:41,634 --> 02:34:43,614
SPEAKER_0:  And it's also one of the most like.

02:34:43,938 --> 02:34:46,334
SPEAKER_0:  clunky routes to misunderstanding.

02:34:46,818 --> 02:34:54,270
SPEAKER_0:  I think of like, there's a concept of facticity, things that are like, I guess, unnecessary evils. And from the religious perspective, I think is where the word started.

02:34:54,530 --> 02:34:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  but of language being like a facticity.

02:34:56,802 --> 02:34:57,726
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

02:34:58,114 --> 02:35:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  We need to communicate with one another. We want to communicate. So we develop words and we have these amazing brains that can have language and that's all well and good.

02:35:05,634 --> 02:35:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  but our fantasy would be more like Mr. Spock.

02:35:08,322 --> 02:35:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  Right, you know, the Vulcan mind meld was like, I communicate with you because we put our hands on one another and we know, you know, by doing this, what,

02:35:15,746 --> 02:35:18,814
SPEAKER_0:  what we're thinking and what we're feeling and we won't have misunderstandings.

02:35:19,586 --> 02:35:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  So because I think we can approximate that, we can come kind of close with language, right?

02:35:25,346 --> 02:35:27,454
SPEAKER_0:  or we can be so far away.

02:35:27,810 --> 02:35:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  it that we can say the same word and of opposite meanings and have it generate immediate animosity.

02:35:33,378 --> 02:35:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  Hi.

02:35:34,018 --> 02:35:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  that we need to be very.

02:35:35,874 --> 02:35:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  Very careful.

02:35:37,378 --> 02:35:42,846
SPEAKER_0:  with language, with communication, with conversations. And I've come to understand that much, much more.

02:35:43,266 --> 02:35:46,334
SPEAKER_0:  as I've gotten older, both in terms of how hurtful.

02:35:46,690 --> 02:35:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:35:47,810 --> 02:35:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  you know, reckless.

02:35:49,314 --> 02:36:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  speeches, which is why I'm horrified by so much of what we see in our political discourse, right? The slurs, the negativity that's attached to something, to some word, you know, how one can utter something and it can go into another person just into the ear, but then goes through so many parts of the meaning of the brain that that person feels a pervasive sense of.

02:36:08,002 --> 02:36:10,206
SPEAKER_0:  shame or beleagueredness, right?

02:36:10,466 --> 02:36:14,110
SPEAKER_0:  So yes, reckless language absolutely hurts.

02:36:14,690 --> 02:36:18,110
SPEAKER_0:  people and we see that all the time in ways that I think are just atrocious.

02:36:18,562 --> 02:36:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  And also how bad miscommunication.

02:36:22,114 --> 02:36:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I really learned that through a lot of different ways, but in the work as a therapist of like really wanting to make sure...

02:36:28,514 --> 02:36:41,278
SPEAKER_0:  that I'm really understanding you and you're really understanding me. And a lot of work goes into that communication. I think people, we can get into a rhythm of it and then it happens more easily. But I think it's a life and death difference.

02:36:41,538 --> 02:36:45,630
SPEAKER_0:  at times, lots of times, right, in the world around us between.

02:36:45,858 --> 02:36:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  clear and accurate communication. So I said a word because I think you know what I mean or something like that.

02:36:51,010 --> 02:36:53,214
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, so to that, I mean, there's the the

02:36:53,506 --> 02:36:55,262
SPEAKER_1:  Camus quote that I like

02:36:55,714 --> 02:37:00,126
SPEAKER_1:  as much unhappiness has come into the world because of things left unsaid.

02:37:02,210 --> 02:37:04,862
SPEAKER_1:  So that has to do with clear communication.

02:37:06,562 --> 02:37:07,774
SPEAKER_1:  But there's also, um...

02:37:08,898 --> 02:37:09,694
SPEAKER_1:  a dance.

02:37:10,978 --> 02:37:11,518
SPEAKER_1:  to up.

02:37:11,842 --> 02:37:13,086
SPEAKER_1:  a conversation, a...

02:37:13,634 --> 02:37:17,118
SPEAKER_1:  poetry to it, there is ambiguity to language.

02:37:17,730 --> 02:37:23,038
SPEAKER_1:  And if you have a kind of awareness of that ambiguity and you play with it, that's where wit and humor come in.

02:37:23,522 --> 02:37:23,902
SPEAKER_1:  That's.

02:37:24,258 --> 02:37:27,262
SPEAKER_1:  allows you to sneak up to difficult topics.

02:37:27,650 --> 02:37:29,950
SPEAKER_1:  without trampling on them.

02:37:30,434 --> 02:37:33,406
SPEAKER_1:  i don't know uh... there there's an art to his wealth

02:37:33,762 --> 02:37:35,486
SPEAKER_1:  There's an art to the silence.

02:37:35,842 --> 02:37:36,862
SPEAKER_1:  You know, the...

02:37:37,538 --> 02:37:43,230
SPEAKER_1:  just allowing both human beings, one of the most intimate things you can share with the human being is silence.

02:37:44,258 --> 02:37:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  That's communicates. It's a different communication.

02:37:47,298 --> 02:37:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  at times more powerful.

02:37:48,802 --> 02:37:50,622
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, giving a person space.

02:37:51,362 --> 02:37:52,254
SPEAKER_1:

02:37:52,546 --> 02:37:55,646
SPEAKER_1:  accumulate, to integrate, to make sense of their thoughts.

02:37:55,970 --> 02:37:57,118
SPEAKER_1:  Enough to say a word?

02:37:57,474 --> 02:38:00,638
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe a memory spark so they can think about that memory.

02:38:00,930 --> 02:38:02,814
SPEAKER_1:  and process that memory.

02:38:03,266 --> 02:38:07,070
SPEAKER_0:  So it's not just words, sorry to do this, but it's not just words, right? It's now time for communication as.

02:38:07,298 --> 02:38:08,990
SPEAKER_0:  It's body language, it's...

02:38:09,346 --> 02:38:14,942
SPEAKER_0:  you know, it's expressions of empathy, it's movements, it's pauses, right? The communication processes

02:38:15,490 --> 02:38:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  very very complicated.

02:38:17,186 --> 02:38:18,302
SPEAKER_0:  and deep.

02:38:18,658 --> 02:38:22,302
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, and some of that is building trust, but also challenging a person.

02:38:22,978 --> 02:38:26,366
SPEAKER_1:  I wonder about that whole process with strangers, for example.

02:38:28,002 --> 02:38:31,486
SPEAKER_1:  of how you do that successfully. Like you and I just met today.

02:38:31,714 --> 02:38:32,030
SPEAKER_1:  Mm-hmm.

02:38:32,642 --> 02:38:33,438
SPEAKER_1:  But I think.

02:38:35,010 --> 02:38:39,294
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of our interaction is very free. We can get to know each other in any way we want.

02:38:39,778 --> 02:38:42,046
SPEAKER_1:  There's a few conversations I have coming up.

02:38:42,882 --> 02:38:47,038
SPEAKER_1:  In general, where there's a lot of other pressures and constraints on those conversations, there's a lot of pressure on those conversations.

02:38:47,426 --> 02:38:49,310
SPEAKER_1:  There's a danger to it, there's risks.

02:38:49,794 --> 02:38:55,422
SPEAKER_1:  there's a political forces involved like what what what it would be from not from my perspective but probably from my

02:38:55,714 --> 02:38:56,414
SPEAKER_1:  as well as the

02:38:56,994 --> 02:39:00,158
SPEAKER_1:  How do you say this thing? What are the words that are going to offend? Watch the show on YouTube for the members of the club h pela focuses on outra a

02:39:00,514 --> 02:39:04,670
SPEAKER_1:  And you're learning that about a stranger at the same time, you know, and you don't.

02:39:05,698 --> 02:39:08,323
SPEAKER_1:  It's a, it's a, it's an interesting dance.

02:39:08,323 --> 02:39:09,150
SPEAKER_0:  because you have to.

02:39:09,570 --> 02:39:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  Wok

02:39:10,850 --> 02:39:12,725
SPEAKER_0:  carefully but deliberately.

02:39:12,725 --> 02:39:13,694
SPEAKER_1:  carefully because

02:39:14,274 --> 02:39:17,950
SPEAKER_1:  I've learned this about myself, about others.

02:39:18,370 --> 02:39:19,774
SPEAKER_1:  There's certain words.

02:39:20,130 --> 02:39:21,374
SPEAKER_1:  that can trigger a person.

02:39:22,466 --> 02:39:23,230
SPEAKER_1:  that they can.

02:39:23,522 --> 02:39:24,350
SPEAKER_1:  Make a person feel.

02:39:24,770 --> 02:39:25,278
SPEAKER_1:  poorly.

02:39:26,914 --> 02:39:27,902
SPEAKER_1:  about themselves.

02:39:29,634 --> 02:39:32,798
SPEAKER_1:  So you can push, you can challenge a person about something.

02:39:33,314 --> 02:39:36,318
SPEAKER_1:  and they're totally okay with it but if you use a certain word to do it

02:39:36,834 --> 02:39:42,558
SPEAKER_1:  It's going to, it's, it may be maps that some childhood thing that their father mother used to say or something like this.

02:39:43,042 --> 02:39:44,126
SPEAKER_1:  and uh...

02:39:44,642 --> 02:39:46,910
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, part of the art of conversation is actually...

02:39:48,034 --> 02:39:51,550
SPEAKER_1:  being a little bit free in using those words, being extremely sensitive.

02:39:51,970 --> 02:39:54,595
SPEAKER_1:  in detecting when a person reacts to a particular.

02:39:54,595 --> 02:39:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  Word.

02:39:55,554 --> 02:39:57,214
SPEAKER_1:  and like storing that away.

02:39:57,538 --> 02:39:58,270
SPEAKER_1:  It's like, okay.

02:39:58,658 --> 02:40:00,734
SPEAKER_1:  Then we might want to return to that later.

02:40:02,050 --> 02:40:06,206
SPEAKER_1:  There might be an interesting, that could be a tip of an iceberg that's actually representing something beautiful.

02:40:06,594 --> 02:40:07,998
SPEAKER_1:  or you might wanna just.

02:40:08,290 --> 02:40:12,190
SPEAKER_1:  It's a nothing word they just want to avoid because it's a distraction.

02:40:12,674 --> 02:40:20,382
SPEAKER_1:  And so all of that kind of has to be integrated into the dance of language. This is really interesting, especially when the stakes are really high. When you get one conversation.

02:40:21,442 --> 02:40:21,854
SPEAKER_1:  We have.

02:40:22,114 --> 02:40:24,926
SPEAKER_1:  When you sit down, you have one conversation and it makes.

02:40:25,922 --> 02:40:28,990
SPEAKER_1:  the difference between like, say you had one conversation with a patient.

02:40:29,218 --> 02:40:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  This is the only conversation you get.

02:40:30,978 --> 02:40:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  to help. Sometimes it is the case. Yeah.

02:40:33,250 --> 02:40:33,726
SPEAKER_1:  and like

02:40:34,018 --> 02:40:35,422
SPEAKER_1:  This is pretty high stakes.

02:40:35,650 --> 02:40:36,030
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

02:40:36,386 --> 02:40:37,278
SPEAKER_1:  Oh man.

02:40:38,914 --> 02:40:41,182
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's tough. I guess you get over, um...

02:40:41,666 --> 02:40:42,110
SPEAKER_1:  And like.

02:40:42,626 --> 02:40:43,902
SPEAKER_1:  Over time, I guess.

02:40:44,162 --> 02:40:46,206
SPEAKER_1:  You get used to the...

02:40:46,466 --> 02:40:47,742
SPEAKER_1:  the high stakes nature of it.

02:40:48,322 --> 02:40:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  when you develop an ability.

02:40:49,794 --> 02:41:04,958
SPEAKER_0:  and all that unconscious processing. Right, right. All that part of the iceberg that's underneath the surface is doing all of that, right? Is reading behavioral cues, verbal cues, and recognizing the primacy of emotion over logic, right? If we're all logic,

02:41:05,378 --> 02:41:09,118
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, we're going to talk about this thing. I'll say things you say things back, even if it's-

02:41:09,378 --> 02:41:12,862
SPEAKER_0:  politically contentious say. So where is it going to talk logically? You know, that's not.

02:41:13,218 --> 02:41:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  the case, right? There could be...

02:41:14,850 --> 02:41:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  a word that raises a certain emotion and you know you don't want to tread there because the emotion will color the person's ability to engage. So you're aware of all of this. And then I think.

02:41:25,698 --> 02:41:40,030
SPEAKER_0:  from the perspective of all of that. It's like standing on the shoulders of your own internal giant, right? That understands language and emotions and body language and attunement and history and it's triggering and all of that.

02:41:40,258 --> 02:41:44,318
SPEAKER_0:  And then on top of that, as you're standing up on those shoulders, you're trying to be effective.

02:41:44,866 --> 02:41:45,214
SPEAKER_0:  Right.

02:41:45,506 --> 02:41:46,910
SPEAKER_0:  And then I think that's where...

02:41:47,298 --> 02:41:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  You know, effectiveness can be unilateral.

02:41:49,762 --> 02:41:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  or it can be together. I mean, I think some of what emerged

02:41:53,730 --> 02:41:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  from Viktor Frankl's writing after the Second World War was.

02:41:56,898 --> 02:41:57,406
SPEAKER_0:  how.

02:41:57,826 --> 02:42:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  much shared humanness means to us, how much of that.

02:42:01,698 --> 02:42:09,342
SPEAKER_0:  can be an incentive for survival beyond all others, right? So the idea of are we doing something before communicating unilaterally?

02:42:09,570 --> 02:42:10,750
SPEAKER_0:  Like I want...

02:42:11,298 --> 02:42:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  information from you or I want you to do a certain thing when we're done talking, right?

02:42:16,290 --> 02:42:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  right, done communicating. That's a very unilateral type of effectiveness, which can make sense. Sometimes I want information out of a patient because I want to know what to do next, right? So it doesn't have to always be negative.

02:42:26,946 --> 02:42:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  but it can also be a tool of manipulation.

02:42:29,090 --> 02:42:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  Right? If someone would say coming from envy or narcissism, I want to communicate with you in a way that makes you do what I want you to do.

02:42:35,362 --> 02:42:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

02:42:36,098 --> 02:42:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  Different from that is...

02:42:37,762 --> 02:42:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  where it's a shared communication, where there's like an umbrella, so to speak, over us, and we're doing something that can only happen together because we're us, we're each person, right? And we come together to do something that's a shared effectiveness. Like I think we're doing...

02:42:53,154 --> 02:43:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  now of like elucidating and pursuing thoughts and getting ideas out. And I think the best situations are shared effectiveness situations because you call upon the resourcefulness and the internal resources of both.

02:43:06,018 --> 02:43:08,734
SPEAKER_1:  But you, especially with strangers.

02:43:09,314 --> 02:43:11,870
SPEAKER_1:  especially when it's not labeled the therapy session.

02:43:12,578 --> 02:43:13,182
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:43:13,442 --> 02:43:16,126
SPEAKER_1:  you kind of actually stumble into that.

02:43:17,026 --> 02:43:17,918
SPEAKER_1:  cooperative state.

02:43:18,498 --> 02:43:19,422
SPEAKER_1:  Like, uh.

02:43:20,834 --> 02:43:21,534
SPEAKER_1:  You have to...

02:43:21,858 --> 02:43:23,006
SPEAKER_1:  organically.

02:43:24,834 --> 02:43:25,790
SPEAKER_1:  develop a trust.

02:43:26,562 --> 02:43:27,038
SPEAKER_1:  together.

02:43:28,162 --> 02:43:29,630
SPEAKER_1:  and almost lose yourself.

02:43:30,114 --> 02:43:35,230
SPEAKER_1:  Ultimately, I think you put it really nice. I think successful conversations, even when it's with.

02:43:35,906 --> 02:43:40,414
SPEAKER_1:  uh... like you know if it's like with world leaders or logicians

02:43:40,642 --> 02:43:42,462
SPEAKER_1:  people that operate in the space of reason.

02:43:42,754 --> 02:43:45,822
SPEAKER_1:  the most successful conversation will ultimately be.

02:43:46,274 --> 02:43:49,214
SPEAKER_1:  in the layer and in the landscape of emotion.

02:43:49,986 --> 02:44:00,062
SPEAKER_1:  Like that's where the interesting stuff will happen. That's where you'll discover anything. And that's where you get to actually meet to start getting an understanding of each other or what you actually mean even by the...

02:44:00,802 --> 02:44:04,062
SPEAKER_1:  statements that are supposed to be kind of rationally based.

02:44:04,642 --> 02:44:08,862
SPEAKER_1:  It's like you lose yourself. You lose yourself in the way you do when you're-

02:44:09,282 --> 02:44:10,974
SPEAKER_1:  when you're children and you just...

02:44:11,298 --> 02:44:16,286
SPEAKER_1:  Not shooting the shit about whatever topic and you just forget yourself. Forget what you're supposed to say. Sex.

02:44:17,122 --> 02:44:17,918
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, well you kinda-

02:44:18,914 --> 02:44:21,502
SPEAKER_1:  plug into the unconscious mind a little bit.

02:44:21,922 --> 02:44:23,134
SPEAKER_1:  and you get to speak.

02:44:23,714 --> 02:44:24,926
SPEAKER_1:  maybe indirectly but

02:44:25,410 --> 02:44:27,326
SPEAKER_1:  to the things that really drive you.

02:44:28,002 --> 02:44:30,334
SPEAKER_1:  to the thing that really, to the things.

02:44:30,594 --> 02:44:32,350
SPEAKER_1:  to the emotions I suppose that...

02:44:33,090 --> 02:44:34,782
SPEAKER_1:  underlie your worldview.

02:44:35,170 --> 02:44:36,062
SPEAKER_1:  I feel like that.

02:44:36,482 --> 02:44:42,846
SPEAKER_1:  That's where productive conversations can happen, whether it's a patient or just a stranger you're talking to.

02:44:43,362 --> 02:44:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  at a bar about geopolitics.

02:44:45,602 --> 02:44:50,014
SPEAKER_1:  uh... the rest of it to franco what would he make of his work man search for meaning

02:44:50,466 --> 02:44:51,166
SPEAKER_1:  What are like the-

02:44:51,426 --> 02:44:53,278
SPEAKER_1:  the lessons you draw from his work.

02:44:53,538 --> 02:44:55,710
SPEAKER_1:  of him as a psychologist, but also.

02:44:56,002 --> 02:45:01,918
SPEAKER_1:  from that very powerful work that reflects on his experience in a Nazi concentration camp.

02:45:03,042 --> 02:45:03,710
SPEAKER_0:  I think that...

02:45:04,738 --> 02:45:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  It was.

02:45:06,242 --> 02:45:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  almost a

02:45:07,394 --> 02:45:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  profound

02:45:08,802 --> 02:45:09,918
SPEAKER_0:  reinvention of

02:45:10,402 --> 02:45:11,006
SPEAKER_0:  Human-ness?

02:45:11,650 --> 02:45:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  Right, after something so...

02:45:14,530 --> 02:45:14,942
SPEAKER_0:  Awful.

02:45:15,266 --> 02:45:17,118
SPEAKER_0:  so bleak and so despairing.

02:45:17,762 --> 02:45:18,526
SPEAKER_0:  to.

02:45:19,458 --> 02:45:20,606
SPEAKER_0:  Speak anew.

02:45:21,122 --> 02:45:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  about

02:45:23,010 --> 02:45:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  shared humanness, human connection, meaning, compassion.

02:45:28,450 --> 02:45:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  that.

02:45:29,538 --> 02:45:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  I think it was in in.

02:45:31,138 --> 02:45:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  intellectual direction that was adorned with all of the emotions.

02:45:36,866 --> 02:45:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  that we need to adorn the logic with.

02:45:39,618 --> 02:45:41,150
SPEAKER_0:  in order to make real change.

02:45:41,602 --> 02:45:44,222
SPEAKER_0:  in the world. bank.

02:45:44,674 --> 02:45:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  fueled.

02:45:46,178 --> 02:45:47,934
SPEAKER_0:  you know, so many branches have come.

02:45:48,578 --> 02:45:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  from his work, the existential psychotherapy and its place in helping human activities today. I'm

02:45:57,154 --> 02:46:00,318
SPEAKER_0:  a trend away from the idea that

02:46:00,578 --> 02:46:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  that we're all quite isolated and that what's going on between us is all very transactional. I'm putting something out and you take it in. You put something out, I take it in. They're like, no, there's a difference. There's a shared humanness.

02:46:12,162 --> 02:46:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  that creates a meaning.

02:46:13,858 --> 02:46:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  beyond the transaction. Kind of like you were just saying, the logical stuff isn't really that interesting because-

02:46:19,458 --> 02:46:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  you know, the logic is there's an answer to whatever logic is. We can do math, right?

02:46:23,778 --> 02:46:26,686
SPEAKER_0:  It's where does the surprises come in?

02:46:27,042 --> 02:46:28,734
SPEAKER_0:  Right? In terms of

02:46:29,186 --> 02:46:38,846
SPEAKER_0:  of wonderful behavior or destructive behavior, right? They're coming from people's emotions. So that's what we want to understand. And that occurs in the context of a person.

02:46:39,138 --> 02:46:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  and other humans, even if it's the conception of someone and other humans as enemy, or it's the conception of two people.

02:46:48,130 --> 02:46:55,198
SPEAKER_0:  sitting together the idea that there's a shared humanist and it's not all transactional and that he could take that out of

02:46:55,650 --> 02:46:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  you know, the pinnacle of human tragedy.

02:46:59,810 --> 02:47:02,590
SPEAKER_0:  and utilize it in a way that informs us.

02:47:03,490 --> 02:47:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  being a better as a species going forward, I think is really monumental.

02:47:08,066 --> 02:47:08,990
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think, uh...

02:47:09,378 --> 02:47:11,774
SPEAKER_1:  is the role of emotion in the human mind.

02:47:12,802 --> 02:47:14,622
SPEAKER_1:  in the human condition.

02:47:15,010 --> 02:47:16,734
SPEAKER_1:  Because you've, we've talked.

02:47:17,058 --> 02:47:18,334
SPEAKER_1:  several times.

02:47:18,754 --> 02:47:19,550
SPEAKER_1:  different ways.

02:47:20,194 --> 02:47:21,598
SPEAKER_1:  that emotion matters.

02:47:21,826 --> 02:47:23,614
SPEAKER_1:  and it's a big part of who we are.

02:47:25,378 --> 02:47:25,982
SPEAKER_1:  But...

02:47:26,946 --> 02:47:27,966
SPEAKER_1:  Why is it there?

02:47:28,290 --> 02:47:29,182
SPEAKER_1:  Why is it useful?

02:47:29,570 --> 02:47:30,430
SPEAKER_1:  What's good about it?

02:47:30,850 --> 02:47:31,582
SPEAKER_1:  I... I... I...

02:47:32,226 --> 02:47:34,878
SPEAKER_1:  We've almost said it's almost like a negative thing.

02:47:35,426 --> 02:47:36,670
SPEAKER_1:  that we just have to live with.

02:47:37,378 --> 02:47:39,253
SPEAKER_1:  but why is it also maybe a beautiful

02:47:39,253 --> 02:47:39,934
SPEAKER_0:  thing. Yeah.

02:47:40,322 --> 02:47:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I think you said, what's the role of emotion? Emotion is the king.

02:47:43,330 --> 02:47:48,254
SPEAKER_0:  if we want to use that analogy. It's the CEO if you want to use that analogy, right? Emotion rules.

02:47:48,578 --> 02:47:49,214
SPEAKER_0:  Rules all.

02:47:49,922 --> 02:47:58,686
SPEAKER_0:  We're taught that we're logical creatures, but we have innumerable pieces of data, even over the course of just a day, let alone a human experience to tell us that is not.

02:47:59,010 --> 02:48:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  Is it ever logical to run into a burning building?

02:48:04,098 --> 02:48:09,342
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, logic's never gonna tell one to do that. Okay, so many love is in the building. Person's already sprinted halfway to the building.

02:48:09,922 --> 02:48:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

02:48:10,594 --> 02:48:11,422
SPEAKER_0:  Emotion

02:48:12,098 --> 02:48:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  rules us and so on.

02:48:13,858 --> 02:48:14,718
SPEAKER_0:  to the thought.

02:48:15,426 --> 02:48:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  A thought is...

02:48:16,770 --> 02:48:18,174
SPEAKER_0:  Some of that is evolutionary.

02:48:18,562 --> 02:48:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

02:48:19,810 --> 02:48:33,918
SPEAKER_0:  strong negative emotion stays with us very, very profoundly. So example I'll give is if we're hunter-gatherers and like I find a new berry and it tastes good and it seems nutritious, and then and it is right everywhere, everything's fine. It'd be good to remember them.

02:48:34,242 --> 02:48:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  But if I find a new berry and it tastes good and it seems nutritious and we both eat it and almost die of sickness?

02:48:41,186 --> 02:48:42,110
SPEAKER_0:  We better remember.

02:48:42,818 --> 02:48:45,918
SPEAKER_0:  Right? So, the primacy of emotion...

02:48:46,370 --> 02:49:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  is in us for reasons that are about survival, that the emotion of it's my child in that building or my loved one is why I don't give a damn about logic and run into the building, right? The emotion of I thought that was good and I got really sick and I better never forget.

02:49:01,442 --> 02:49:02,686
SPEAKER_0:  It is also about survival.

02:49:02,946 --> 02:49:07,102
SPEAKER_0:  And the same applies to humans. If we're from different tribes back then and-

02:49:07,426 --> 02:49:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  In my tribe, when you put your hand out, it's a greeting.

02:49:10,402 --> 02:49:15,326
SPEAKER_0:  In your tribe, if someone puts their hand out, it means, hey, I'm going to attack you and take your stuff.

02:49:15,842 --> 02:49:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  Right then.

02:49:16,770 --> 02:49:21,438
SPEAKER_0:  I put my hand out and you slug me, right? Then I was like, I better remember.

02:49:21,826 --> 02:49:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  that right but you see how that can lead into.

02:49:25,090 --> 02:49:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  you know, are the constructs around that. I say, oh, people in your tribe are violent, right? Do we start then to make stories around that?

02:49:33,090 --> 02:49:38,718
SPEAKER_0:  But the primacy of emotion, whether it's berries or it's humans who might threaten us or it's humans we love,

02:49:39,010 --> 02:49:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's hard to even look at that anthropological, psychological literature and to look at what's out there.

02:49:46,050 --> 02:49:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  And I think the face validity, that's part of survival.

02:49:49,666 --> 02:49:51,541
SPEAKER_0:  It's part of survival. It's so cool.

02:49:51,541 --> 02:50:00,798
SPEAKER_1:  that you get also things like love, which are not often rational or grounded in logic and so on. If you look from a transactional perspective.

02:50:01,858 --> 02:50:03,678
SPEAKER_1:  a lot of times falling in love or...

02:50:04,834 --> 02:50:07,102
SPEAKER_1:  whether it's with friends or...

02:50:07,586 --> 02:50:09,022
SPEAKER_1:  friendship or romantic love.

02:50:09,506 --> 02:50:11,582
SPEAKER_1:  It doesn't really make sense. I don't- I'm still don't-

02:50:11,970 --> 02:50:14,334
SPEAKER_1:  I'm still not sure what the hell it is.

02:50:14,914 --> 02:50:15,870
SPEAKER_1:  because like,

02:50:16,194 --> 02:50:19,934
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, it's the thing that is one of the things.

02:50:20,194 --> 02:50:22,430
SPEAKER_1:  or love for your kids when they're born.

02:50:22,754 --> 02:50:25,854
SPEAKER_1:  Like that love, the parental love.

02:50:26,530 --> 02:50:27,070
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

02:50:27,906 --> 02:50:28,670
SPEAKER_0:  What is that?

02:50:29,378 --> 02:50:34,718
SPEAKER_1:  That's so cool that we get to have the, like, if you're looking for the, in the menu of items.

02:50:34,946 --> 02:50:36,821
SPEAKER_1:  They give life meaning. That seems like a pretty.

02:50:36,821 --> 02:50:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  Pretty good one.

02:50:37,730 --> 02:50:38,782
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, so my-

02:50:39,010 --> 02:50:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  Response.

02:50:40,418 --> 02:50:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  you said that gives life meaning, my response initially was gonna be, it's the meaning of life.

02:50:45,346 --> 02:50:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  Right? Because saying, okay, emotion is about survival. That's one part, right? That's a very important part, right? If we don't survive.

02:50:53,250 --> 02:50:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  then we're not there to have emotions, right? So yes, it's about survival.

02:50:57,826 --> 02:50:59,646
SPEAKER_0:  As important as that is, that's the small part.

02:50:59,970 --> 02:51:01,502
SPEAKER_0:  I think it is about

02:51:01,954 --> 02:51:04,798
SPEAKER_0:  the meaning of life because it's about the beyond self.

02:51:05,026 --> 02:51:10,238
SPEAKER_0:  And I think it relates back to what we were talking about at the very beginning and the sort of levels of

02:51:10,594 --> 02:51:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  emergence, right? And when we feel love, we feel happiness because that person

02:51:16,002 --> 02:51:24,094
SPEAKER_0:  feels happiness, right? There's something that's so generative, so creative about that. Like we wanna bring order to things and we, you know, happiness

02:51:24,386 --> 02:51:30,622
SPEAKER_0:  is consistent with simplicity, right? If we're healthy, there's nothing negative to say about our health, right? If we have health problems, there's a lot to say, right?

02:51:30,882 --> 02:51:31,294
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:51:31,522 --> 02:51:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  It's emotion that pushes us towards the goodness that I think makes all.

02:51:37,090 --> 02:51:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  the meaning for us. I mean, it's interesting. I actually was wondering what your thoughts about this as a scientist, right? Because we accept it by and large that we have free will, right? The only way of free will, but then we get upset that there's not justice.

02:51:49,442 --> 02:52:00,510
SPEAKER_0:  Right? So, but how is it like if we have free will, I could act in an unjust way and then you're surprised or, you know, Viceroy's like, why, right? We have these thoughts because I think because we're

02:52:00,834 --> 02:52:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  we're rooted, we want logic to rule. Like there's a way in which I can understand logic, I can manage it, I can manipulate it.

02:52:06,722 --> 02:52:08,702
SPEAKER_0:  We sort of want it to be that way.

02:52:08,962 --> 02:52:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  So then we glorify.

02:52:11,810 --> 02:52:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  logic, and then we misapply it, like ideas like, oh, I know we have free will, but I'm now shaking my fist at the heavens because there's no justice, right?

02:52:21,218 --> 02:52:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  And I think maybe what we're looking for is

02:52:23,970 --> 02:52:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  we should go back and look at the givens. Like why is there, there's only goodness if there's justice? I mean that doesn't-

02:52:28,834 --> 02:52:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  I think the goodness...

02:52:30,882 --> 02:52:38,014
SPEAKER_0:  Why does the goodness have to be tied to that? Maybe it goes back to the counter entropy and the fact that when there is something, there is not nothing.

02:52:38,370 --> 02:52:41,662
SPEAKER_0:  Right? And where there is something, there can be awareness, there can be...

02:52:42,018 --> 02:52:45,214
SPEAKER_0:  goodness, there can be compassion, right? Is it that...

02:52:46,466 --> 02:52:50,142
SPEAKER_0:  that what's really going on is not about justice. Yes, we have free will.

02:52:50,818 --> 02:52:51,646
SPEAKER_0:  It's that.

02:52:52,098 --> 02:52:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  Goodness creating.

02:52:54,146 --> 02:52:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  shoring up, making better.

02:52:56,482 --> 02:52:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  That is...

02:52:59,522 --> 02:53:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  the meaning that is the good, right? And that the evil is the destruction as evidenced by the fact that it's overdetermined probably a million times that we're in this eddy current of counter entropy and we could destroy that quite readily.

02:53:13,346 --> 02:53:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  Right? And then we're nothingness like.

02:53:16,098 --> 02:53:18,302
SPEAKER_0:  like everything else that we know of that's not.

02:53:18,690 --> 02:53:22,078
SPEAKER_0:  us that doesn't have the ability to do something that's creative.

02:53:22,306 --> 02:53:22,718
SPEAKER_0:  or

02:53:23,298 --> 02:53:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  constructive. I mean, I think...

02:53:25,122 --> 02:53:25,822
SPEAKER_0:  that that's...

02:53:26,626 --> 02:53:29,278
SPEAKER_0:  The answer, and I think that our science really tells us.

02:53:29,858 --> 02:53:33,438
SPEAKER_0:  that that's the answer. And I think it beckons us with ideas like.

02:53:33,730 --> 02:53:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  We know that things happen outside of space and time.

02:53:36,674 --> 02:53:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, they're physics experiments, right? We know this from the science of it.

02:53:40,738 --> 02:53:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  yet we don't stop and look and say, wait, is that?

02:53:43,874 --> 02:53:48,030
SPEAKER_0:  the magic and the idea Einstein said, God doesn't play dice with the universe. In whatever happens, you may start a laisser pace sustainable revolution.

02:53:48,578 --> 02:53:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, maybe.

02:53:50,274 --> 02:53:56,254
SPEAKER_0:  God doesn't play dice with the universe. That quantum indeterminacy and all of that is not just a flip of the coin, so to speak.

02:53:56,642 --> 02:53:58,238
SPEAKER_0:  But maybe it's in that.

02:53:58,626 --> 02:54:02,334
SPEAKER_0:  indeterminacy that we're given the opportunity to.

02:54:02,818 --> 02:54:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  assert ourselves, right, to make something one way.

02:54:05,634 --> 02:54:11,102
SPEAKER_0:  or another. Maybe it's not God playing dice with the universe, but it's God loading the dice in our favor.

02:54:11,458 --> 02:54:13,150
SPEAKER_0:  if we'll only listen to

02:54:13,698 --> 02:54:15,806
SPEAKER_0:  The truth, the truth that being destructive...

02:54:16,034 --> 02:54:20,190
SPEAKER_0:  doesn't help or soothe anything, even in the person who thinks it will for themselves.

02:54:20,514 --> 02:54:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  creativity and generativeness and

02:54:22,626 --> 02:54:24,286
SPEAKER_0:  kindness and compassion like this is

02:54:24,610 --> 02:54:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  Doesn't that seem sort of analogous to the eddy current of counter entropy that has us here in the first place?

02:54:29,954 --> 02:54:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that's where I pin meaning and that meaning then.

02:54:33,922 --> 02:54:37,982
SPEAKER_0:  going back to the initial question, right, is generated in us through

02:54:38,370 --> 02:54:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  Emotion through what we feel that leads us to feel something that is mysterious. I don't know why I feel it

02:54:43,682 --> 02:54:47,838
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, in some sense, emotion is kind of the fuel of that creative imperative.

02:54:48,194 --> 02:54:48,638
SPEAKER_1:  We have.

02:54:48,994 --> 02:54:49,790
SPEAKER_1:  But if you step back...

02:54:50,082 --> 02:54:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  and look at the tapestry a little bit.

02:54:52,898 --> 02:54:58,238
SPEAKER_1:  It does seem that the creation and destruction are the yin and yang of life.

02:54:58,754 --> 02:55:00,798
SPEAKER_1:  that it all works only if...

02:55:01,922 --> 02:55:04,606
SPEAKER_1:  the main engine is towards creativity.

02:55:05,154 --> 02:55:07,390
SPEAKER_1:  but destruction also...

02:55:08,098 --> 02:55:09,694
SPEAKER_1:  makes way for new things.

02:55:10,530 --> 02:55:11,390
SPEAKER_1:  So that's the.

02:55:12,322 --> 02:55:14,974
SPEAKER_1:  this kind of struggle. It seems like life is-

02:55:15,426 --> 02:55:20,574
SPEAKER_1:  between the different forces that make up the individual human, they make up society, all these tensions.

02:55:20,962 --> 02:55:22,302
SPEAKER_1:  are necessary.

02:55:22,882 --> 02:55:25,310
SPEAKER_1:  for growth, for development, this kind of...

02:55:25,762 --> 02:55:27,806
SPEAKER_1:  inner conflict and outer conflict.

02:55:28,322 --> 02:55:29,598
SPEAKER_1:  are necessary for growth.

02:55:30,018 --> 02:55:31,166
SPEAKER_1:  It's not just the...

02:55:32,194 --> 02:55:36,286
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, in some sense, it's from the logic aspect, you kind of want everything to be perfect and-

02:55:36,802 --> 02:55:37,662
SPEAKER_1:  and just.

02:55:37,922 --> 02:55:42,782
SPEAKER_1:  for nobody to suffer for everything to be perfect. But just like we talked about with trauma, it just seems like...

02:55:43,138 --> 02:55:44,894
SPEAKER_1:  It's such a big giant mess.

02:55:45,506 --> 02:55:48,830
SPEAKER_1:  What is it Bukowski said? Find what you love and let it kill you.

02:55:49,346 --> 02:55:51,998
SPEAKER_1:  There's some aspect of...

02:55:52,258 --> 02:55:55,646
SPEAKER_1:  the negative aspect of passion and pursuit and obsession.

02:55:55,874 --> 02:55:58,686
SPEAKER_1:  The... the... the... the turmoil.

02:55:59,234 --> 02:56:00,286
SPEAKER_1:  of the pursuit.

02:56:00,994 --> 02:56:02,206
SPEAKER_1:  Avada...

02:56:02,658 --> 02:56:07,134
SPEAKER_1:  happiness, of the creative pursuits and all of that. I mean that's part of life as well.

02:56:07,906 --> 02:56:10,974
SPEAKER_1:  That's, and I don't know what to do with that.

02:56:11,778 --> 02:56:13,278
SPEAKER_1:  from an individual perspective.

02:56:13,794 --> 02:56:17,886
SPEAKER_1:  in terms of figuring out how do you live a good life, how do you live a healthy life?

02:56:18,370 --> 02:56:19,198
SPEAKER_1:  C'est un sim.

02:56:19,970 --> 02:56:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  That bit of hardship.

02:56:21,314 --> 02:56:22,590
SPEAKER_1:  or sometimes a lot of hardship.

02:56:23,650 --> 02:56:25,310
SPEAKER_1:  can make a pretty interesting life.

02:56:25,954 --> 02:56:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  I think it brings us back to the discussion that we're having.

02:56:29,474 --> 02:56:33,758
SPEAKER_0:  before about what does it mean, like the challenges of trauma, right, and of overcoming.

02:56:34,114 --> 02:56:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  And I think here we gotta be careful with the language, right? Because

02:56:37,506 --> 02:56:38,782
SPEAKER_0:  I would then say...

02:56:39,234 --> 02:56:41,246
SPEAKER_0:  Let's take destruction, right?

02:56:41,698 --> 02:56:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  separated into two things, right? One is

02:56:44,706 --> 02:56:48,254
SPEAKER_0:  You say destruction is like the breaking down, the tearing down of something.

02:56:48,642 --> 02:56:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  Right, versus...

02:56:50,818 --> 02:56:55,454
SPEAKER_0:  a process that has malice in it. So just like when we were talking about-

02:56:55,714 --> 02:56:58,014
SPEAKER_0:  a trauma and, and, um,

02:56:58,434 --> 02:57:04,702
SPEAKER_0:  No, it's setbacks, things to overcome. We might say, okay, if you say, hey, you have it harder than the next person and you have more to overcome.

02:57:05,026 --> 02:57:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  or someone put a barrier in front of you for you to overcome.

02:57:08,674 --> 02:57:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  that there can be a lot of growth in that, including the times when you don't know, gosh, can I do this, right? Can I get over it?

02:57:14,434 --> 02:57:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  Right? If you're saying like that's, that could be, that's challenge.

02:57:17,922 --> 02:57:31,294
SPEAKER_0:  and something to overcome that's very positive. But we're saying, but there's no benefit of throwing a racial slur in there, right? We're saying, because that's all bad. Like that's not, even the princess, I'm angry about that and I'm gonna overcome that. It's like, that didn't need to be, that didn't make anything better.

02:57:31,810 --> 02:57:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  If the person sees that and says, I'm going to, I'm going to overcome that. It makes things less worse.

02:57:36,866 --> 02:57:38,942
SPEAKER_0:  Right? But there's no...

02:57:39,202 --> 02:57:46,526
SPEAKER_0:  There's no good to something that's created as destructive. We may look at forest fires, like look, controlled burns. You say there's a forest burning down.

02:57:46,882 --> 02:57:51,454
SPEAKER_0:  But that's, okay, there's some, there's some we could say destruction there. There's a tearing down there.

02:57:51,778 --> 02:58:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  but it's in the service of the next fire not running through the community, the town that's on the other side of it. That's very different than a forest fire, as they started by arson.

02:58:00,866 --> 02:58:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  So you might say they're both a tearing down, they're a tearing down of the forest.

02:58:04,834 --> 02:58:07,454
SPEAKER_0:  But one is in the service of goodness, even though...

02:58:07,810 --> 02:58:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  It's hurting the animals and the plants is not all good, right? But it's in the service of something as opposed to something else that's wantonly destructive. I think there's no good.

02:58:16,706 --> 02:58:18,750
SPEAKER_0:  To the racial slur, there's no good to the arson.

02:58:19,138 --> 02:58:25,726
SPEAKER_0:  That's destruction in a way that's incorporating, I think, the malice of envy, something that's really—

02:58:26,146 --> 02:58:27,742
SPEAKER_0:  purely if there's a yin and yang.

02:58:28,066 --> 02:58:31,198
SPEAKER_0:  That's the destruct, that's the destruct, that's the badness end.

02:58:31,330 --> 02:58:32,478
SPEAKER_1:  So racial slurs.

02:58:32,834 --> 02:58:34,302
SPEAKER_1:  is a surface wave.

02:58:34,786 --> 02:58:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  of a deeper thing.

02:58:36,258 --> 02:58:36,830
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

02:58:37,218 --> 02:58:45,790
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, the reason I bring that up is like, all right, well, you have these discussions of censorship. What good does allowing racial slurs?

02:58:46,306 --> 02:58:47,838
SPEAKER_1:  in public communication.

02:58:48,194 --> 02:58:49,086
SPEAKER_1:  do, right?

02:58:49,346 --> 02:58:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  And it's like.

02:58:50,338 --> 02:58:53,822
SPEAKER_1:  our communication would surely be better if we don't say bad things to each other.

02:58:54,178 --> 02:58:54,942
SPEAKER_1:  It's like...

02:58:56,258 --> 02:58:57,982
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like the truth is...

02:58:58,498 --> 02:59:06,398
SPEAKER_1:  Our communication will be better if the amount of bad things is a small fraction of communication. It seems to be more true.

02:59:06,786 --> 02:59:15,326
SPEAKER_1:  Because another aspect of human nature with power, the moment you start censoring and removing bad words that everyone agrees are bad words.

02:59:16,034 --> 02:59:20,286
SPEAKER_1:  Then the people at the top, they're doing the censoring, start getting greedy.

02:59:20,674 --> 02:59:26,110
SPEAKER_1:  It starts, it starts expanding and this is the giant mess of human civilization where we can't.

02:59:26,338 --> 02:59:28,963
SPEAKER_1:  The nice piles you created are kind of...

02:59:28,963 --> 02:59:29,630
SPEAKER_0:  overlapping

02:59:30,658 --> 02:59:39,646
SPEAKER_0:  That's the gray area. That's the problem with it. No, I agree completely. There's a control of language. There are slippery slopes there. I think there's a very big problem.

02:59:40,834 --> 02:59:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  So I agree.

02:59:41,890 --> 02:59:42,526
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

02:59:42,818 --> 02:59:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  again, split parsing out the language, I'm not saying, hey, we shouldn't have racial slurs as if like, let's stop saying the words. I mean, the idea is.

02:59:51,074 --> 02:59:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  the premise behind it, right? Like, you know, the prejudices, we could eliminate the prejudice behind it.

02:59:56,834 --> 02:59:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I was struck-

02:59:58,178 --> 03:00:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  I do almost nothing about medicine. I get to medical school and start with anatomy.

03:00:03,394 --> 03:00:03,742
SPEAKER_0:  Right.

03:00:04,066 --> 03:00:05,534
SPEAKER_0:  And it's remarkable as

03:00:06,050 --> 03:00:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  You know, to see...

03:00:07,618 --> 03:00:11,774
SPEAKER_0:  where as the bodies are being dissected, that like we're all humans. here it is!

03:00:12,450 --> 03:00:16,798
SPEAKER_0:  It doesn't matter any of these things on the outside. And that's true.

03:00:17,058 --> 03:00:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  not just like in our bodies, but in our minds, and the part of the person that's not there, right? Because now we're trying to learn from the body.

03:00:24,674 --> 03:00:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it shows how.

03:00:26,754 --> 03:00:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  Ridiculous it is if you think that we're 99.9% all alike genetically. By the way, it's only like take another 10th off and we're all orangutans. Somehow!

03:00:37,922 --> 03:00:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  We have to see these differences between us, right? And where does that come from? And I think...

03:00:43,586 --> 03:00:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  that I believe that all comes from envy in that classical sense that if I don't feel good enough

03:00:49,378 --> 03:00:51,006
SPEAKER_0:  I'm gonna want someone to feel better.

03:00:51,458 --> 03:00:53,950
SPEAKER_0:  about and so there can be visual things.

03:00:54,178 --> 03:00:56,542
SPEAKER_0:  that that person looks different, right?

03:00:56,770 --> 03:00:58,046
SPEAKER_0:  Or you think about the...

03:00:58,626 --> 03:01:06,494
SPEAKER_0:  I spent some time in Great Britain and when there's a lot of conflict between Northern Ireland and Ireland right and you thought wow there's not

03:01:06,946 --> 03:01:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  There's not even a look difference, right? It's the same general religious umbrella, same ethnicity, right? But now there's some religious difference. And I thought...

03:01:15,426 --> 03:01:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  It's not me trying to be denigrating.

03:01:17,250 --> 03:01:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  you know, around the Irish complex, like that's human of, oh, there's no actual difference between us. If I don't feel good about myself.

03:01:23,906 --> 03:01:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  I'm gonna find one.

03:01:25,378 --> 03:01:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  Right? It's that.

03:01:27,938 --> 03:01:38,494
SPEAKER_0:  that I believe could go away. It's driven by maybe the trauma of just being alive in the world and things can happen to us, but we certainly promote in the human created trauma.

03:01:38,722 --> 03:01:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  people feeling not good enough, finding differences, there's a place for the envy to attach.

03:01:43,458 --> 03:01:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  and we're off to the races of.

03:01:45,698 --> 03:01:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  You know, wars. We're talking about the Second World War and we think, well, what have we learned?

03:01:49,890 --> 03:01:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  It would take us a day to map out all the wars since then, right? Not alone, for goodness sake, because everything that's sailing right now.

03:01:57,314 --> 03:01:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  So we're not pretty, we're not good at learning.

03:01:59,906 --> 03:02:00,382
SPEAKER_0:  from

03:02:00,706 --> 03:02:03,102
SPEAKER_0:  what seemed to be some very salient lessons.

03:02:05,282 --> 03:02:10,910
SPEAKER_1:  I should mention one thing is that I also know that you're interested in Russian culture a little bit.

03:02:12,066 --> 03:02:12,702
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

03:02:13,666 --> 03:02:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  Churchill said, I cannot forecast to you the action of Russia.

03:02:17,538 --> 03:02:20,990
SPEAKER_1:  It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.

03:02:21,442 --> 03:02:24,958
SPEAKER_1:  What to you are some interesting differences between

03:02:25,442 --> 03:02:26,462
SPEAKER_1:  So this.

03:02:26,722 --> 03:02:28,126
SPEAKER_1:  Eastern part of the world of

03:02:28,418 --> 03:02:31,742
SPEAKER_1:  Russia, Ukraine, the Slavic countries, the former Soviet Union.

03:02:32,066 --> 03:02:34,558
SPEAKER_1:  All of that versus sort of the US culture.

03:02:35,074 --> 03:02:38,014
SPEAKER_1:  what stands out to you from the literature, from the music.

03:02:38,498 --> 03:02:39,454
SPEAKER_1:  from the science.

03:02:39,586 --> 03:02:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  All that kind of stuff.

03:02:40,994 --> 03:02:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  I think there's so much.

03:02:43,394 --> 03:02:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  Intensity.

03:02:44,834 --> 03:02:46,174
SPEAKER_0:  the intensity.

03:02:46,626 --> 03:02:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:02:47,266 --> 03:02:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  And I guess I would say fearlessness of.

03:02:50,306 --> 03:02:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  Expression.

03:02:51,618 --> 03:02:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  that I see.

03:02:53,250 --> 03:02:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  in

03:02:54,210 --> 03:03:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  a Slavic culture, maybe it's across cultures, because there's a different way that expression occurs. We say like, oh, it's different in the French than the Spanish, or it's different than in parts of Africa. And I think when you take that part of the world for whatever reason, and maybe it's just totally random, or maybe it's

03:03:11,938 --> 03:03:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  It's aspects of geography and experience and migration, but there's such an intensity. And I remember listening to Tchaikovsky.

03:03:20,162 --> 03:03:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  you know, very early on, maybe not for the very first time, but early on in my life, reading Dostoevsky and feeling like...

03:03:26,946 --> 03:03:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, Dostoevsky's willingness, his ability and his willingness.

03:03:32,354 --> 03:03:33,630
SPEAKER_0:  to express.

03:03:33,890 --> 03:03:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:03:34,498 --> 03:03:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  Create!

03:03:35,554 --> 03:03:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  such powerful aberrant states of human experience. Tchaikovsky in his music, the depths of

03:03:42,690 --> 03:03:43,838
SPEAKER_0:  suffering that it

03:03:44,098 --> 03:03:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  expresses has always stood out to me.

03:03:47,458 --> 03:03:47,934
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:03:48,866 --> 03:03:55,198
SPEAKER_0:  as a way that like with the, if that's like the brightest light, so to speak, communicating information that that's a place.

03:03:55,682 --> 03:04:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  look and it's also a place that resonated with me so strongly because I think for some people who are

03:04:02,466 --> 03:04:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  informative years and having very difficult

03:04:04,962 --> 03:04:08,286
SPEAKER_0:  of like a depth of feeling of like fear and.

03:04:08,610 --> 03:04:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  How's the world going to be? Am I going to be annihilated? What do I even want? What do I feel inside of me?

03:04:13,794 --> 03:04:17,406
SPEAKER_0:  to encounter that being expressed so intensely.

03:04:17,666 --> 03:04:19,582
SPEAKER_0:  I found to be very, very

03:04:20,162 --> 03:04:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  Moving.

03:04:20,834 --> 03:04:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  So I don't know if that's a good answer or not, but I think there's an intensity of expression and a fearlessness You know Dostoevsky wrote about

03:04:27,714 --> 03:04:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  terrible things, you know, what happens in the person. Is there a person who is

03:04:32,770 --> 03:04:36,414
SPEAKER_0:  brilliant intellectually and very persuasive.

03:04:36,642 --> 03:04:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  and very capable of being effective.

03:04:39,298 --> 03:04:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  who also just chooses to be a child rapist.

03:04:42,370 --> 03:04:47,774
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, he wrote about that. He wrote about the truth of this is what we can be.

03:04:48,258 --> 03:04:56,030
SPEAKER_0:  as humans and I think there's so many lessons, including the truth. People will tend to think, oh, evil's not very bright or not very intelligent.

03:04:56,290 --> 03:05:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  That's a way to let evil propagate, right? Evil can be effective and attractive and-

03:05:02,594 --> 03:05:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  um... very compelling but evil nonetheless and i i just think is it

03:05:06,754 --> 03:05:07,902
SPEAKER_0:  fearless willingness.

03:05:08,290 --> 03:05:12,350
SPEAKER_0:  to look at that and to describe it, that I see primarily I've studied in.

03:05:12,578 --> 03:05:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  Russian culture.

03:05:14,178 --> 03:05:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, the fearless exploration of this whole...

03:05:17,346 --> 03:05:18,430
SPEAKER_1:  A human drama.

03:05:18,850 --> 03:05:22,814
SPEAKER_1:  Definitely just the Yefsky and others since in the 20th century and the 19th century have done.

03:05:23,266 --> 03:05:26,782
SPEAKER_1:  Incredible job with that some of that just like you said is the language the culture

03:05:27,298 --> 03:05:29,854
SPEAKER_1:  I think that intense romanticism is there.

03:05:30,434 --> 03:05:32,574
SPEAKER_1:  that is almost an overdramatic

03:05:33,730 --> 03:05:34,078
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

03:05:34,306 --> 03:05:35,134
SPEAKER_1:  exploration.

03:05:35,394 --> 03:05:36,958
SPEAKER_1:  of human nature.

03:05:38,082 --> 03:05:43,006
SPEAKER_1:  it can err on the side or falter when it goes into.

03:05:43,394 --> 03:05:44,830
SPEAKER_1:  kind of cynical view of life.

03:05:45,410 --> 03:05:47,038
SPEAKER_1:  You know, life is suffering.

03:05:47,426 --> 03:05:52,094
SPEAKER_1:  I think that also has to do with the way you deal with the trauma of the World Wars.

03:05:52,354 --> 03:05:56,542
SPEAKER_1:  and so on. This is something the different nations throughout Europe had to deal with that in different ways.

03:05:56,962 --> 03:05:59,998
SPEAKER_1:  Some of them have channeled into envy and resentment, some of them...

03:06:00,290 --> 03:06:01,854
SPEAKER_1:  channeled into a kind of...

03:06:02,178 --> 03:06:04,190
SPEAKER_1:  Nihilism or cynicism?

03:06:04,802 --> 03:06:05,118
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

03:06:05,378 --> 03:06:05,982
SPEAKER_1:  and

03:06:07,234 --> 03:06:10,846
SPEAKER_1:  Ultimately, the intensity of feeling is there, which is sort of interesting.

03:06:11,330 --> 03:06:11,678
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:06:12,130 --> 03:06:14,814
SPEAKER_1:  to see and interesting how that manifests itself in the kind of

03:06:15,330 --> 03:06:15,678
SPEAKER_1:  I'll-

03:06:16,066 --> 03:06:18,014
SPEAKER_1:  in the kind of governments it builds up.

03:06:18,402 --> 03:06:20,094
SPEAKER_1:  You know, there's more.

03:06:20,866 --> 03:06:21,310
SPEAKER_1:

03:06:21,634 --> 03:06:23,774
SPEAKER_1:  authoritarianism in that part of the world.

03:06:24,514 --> 03:06:26,494
SPEAKER_1:  versus the Western world that's more

03:06:26,786 --> 03:06:28,894
SPEAKER_1:  Focus on the individual versus the collective.

03:06:29,186 --> 03:06:35,326
SPEAKER_1:  And when more focused on the individual, you have a propensity to value individual rights with democracy and so on.

03:06:35,682 --> 03:06:36,798
SPEAKER_1:  It's interesting to watch.

03:06:37,058 --> 03:06:39,646
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, to reconstruct how that all came to be.

03:06:40,066 --> 03:06:41,182
SPEAKER_1:  Is it, uh...

03:06:41,538 --> 03:06:44,030
SPEAKER_1:  Is it in the blood? Is it in the mind?

03:06:44,514 --> 03:06:54,622
SPEAKER_1:  Is it in some kind of thing that more ethereal, a collective set of ideas that we pass from generation to generation between each other, sort of the collective of it?

03:06:54,882 --> 03:06:57,022
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's fascinating to see.

03:06:57,282 --> 03:06:58,462
SPEAKER_1:  Um, but now...

03:06:58,754 --> 03:07:01,502
SPEAKER_1:  reinvigorated because there's conflict in that part of the world.

03:07:02,850 --> 03:07:03,486
SPEAKER_1:  Evosel

03:07:03,810 --> 03:07:05,630
SPEAKER_1:  uh... thought about the cold war

03:07:06,050 --> 03:07:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  What lessons about...

03:07:07,522 --> 03:07:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  the

03:07:08,450 --> 03:07:10,622
SPEAKER_1:  human mind about psychiatry, psychology.

03:07:11,874 --> 03:07:14,142
SPEAKER_1:  and about looking at the Cold War.

03:07:15,522 --> 03:07:17,726
SPEAKER_1:  can we take forward in the 21st century?

03:07:18,210 --> 03:07:18,878
SPEAKER_1:  so that we can.

03:07:19,170 --> 03:07:19,870
SPEAKER_1:  Avoid.

03:07:20,546 --> 03:07:21,406
SPEAKER_0:  World War III.

03:07:22,210 --> 03:07:22,814
SPEAKER_1:  a major.

03:07:23,618 --> 03:07:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  Colder.

03:07:24,546 --> 03:07:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  Hot War.

03:07:25,762 --> 03:07:26,974
SPEAKER_0:  in the 21st century.

03:07:27,810 --> 03:07:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  I think unspoken animosities are very...

03:07:30,946 --> 03:07:32,126
SPEAKER_0:  very, very dangerous.

03:07:32,418 --> 03:07:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, right, it was a.

03:07:33,954 --> 03:07:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  Cold War, there was...

03:07:35,362 --> 03:07:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  There was...

03:07:36,674 --> 03:07:39,678
SPEAKER_0:  fighting through proxies, right? the superpowers were fighting.

03:07:40,098 --> 03:07:43,166
SPEAKER_0:  uh... surrogate wars to proxies which of course

03:07:43,490 --> 03:07:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  in and of itself causes immense suffering.

03:07:46,146 --> 03:07:50,078
SPEAKER_0:  but it becomes the opposite of an exchange of.

03:07:50,658 --> 03:07:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  ideas or an exchange of.

03:07:52,578 --> 03:07:54,846
SPEAKER_0:  thought, you know, maybe even the Chris Jeff, right?

03:07:55,074 --> 03:07:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  not believing that the kitchen...

03:07:56,866 --> 03:08:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  look like it did at the World's Fair, right? And some of the misconceptions here of what things were like in Russia, right? It was an utter...

03:08:05,986 --> 03:08:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  It was a thought that those other people are not actually people, right? There's an enemy society of evil.

03:08:12,418 --> 03:08:14,366
SPEAKER_0:  which then paints with a broad brush.

03:08:14,658 --> 03:08:19,838
SPEAKER_0:  in a way that makes it easy, too easy for the cold war, or to go from being cold.

03:08:20,066 --> 03:08:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  right to have it boiling over into utter.

03:08:22,978 --> 03:08:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  destruction. You know, I wrote, it was-

03:08:25,890 --> 03:08:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  It's really a true story that when I...

03:08:29,026 --> 03:08:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  was in, it was still the Soviet Union, but it was right around the time of the Soviet Union coming to an end.

03:08:34,850 --> 03:08:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  and had gone on a trip for students from England, and we got to go places that people hadn't gone.

03:08:42,466 --> 03:08:48,414
SPEAKER_0:  you know, if foreigners had gone in many, many years, it was just kind of the right timing to experience that.

03:08:48,770 --> 03:08:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  And it really is true that someone said on short notice to these

03:08:53,858 --> 03:08:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  kids that...

03:08:54,850 --> 03:09:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  that like these group of Americans were coming and I have a picture somewhere of the kid in a gas mask.

03:09:00,610 --> 03:09:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  Like they went into their desks and put on gas masks and they thought...

03:09:04,418 --> 03:09:04,830
SPEAKER_0:  Right.

03:09:05,570 --> 03:09:07,134
SPEAKER_0:  That's what, I mean that's what.

03:09:08,450 --> 03:09:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  They're taught to think about us and we're taught to think about them.

03:09:12,738 --> 03:09:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  Now we're back in an us them, right? When we're all trying to survive and we're all such-

03:09:20,290 --> 03:09:22,686
SPEAKER_0:  Human life is so...

03:09:22,946 --> 03:09:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:09:23,810 --> 03:09:43,582
SPEAKER_0:  delicate, right? Let alone human happiness. We make these divisions and we create this aggression and latent aggression. During the Cold War, we developed the ability to destroy the earth, right? Then just sat looking at one another with further growing misunderstanding and the opportunity for the proxy fights.

03:09:43,906 --> 03:09:47,742
SPEAKER_0:  Cuban Missile Crisis, which I know wasn't a war, but it's an aspect of that, right? We just...

03:09:48,098 --> 03:09:49,726
SPEAKER_0:  We have ourselves wildly.

03:09:50,274 --> 03:09:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  at risk of destruction.

03:09:52,994 --> 03:09:57,982
SPEAKER_0:  without any mutual understanding. And again, I would argue that that is the opposite of.

03:09:58,306 --> 03:10:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  the counter entropy, right? Like we are setting everything up for less, lack of communication, lack of understanding. How do those feelings of love and

03:10:05,602 --> 03:10:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  and shared humaneness happen.

03:10:07,554 --> 03:10:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  They don't, right? If you separate.

03:10:09,986 --> 03:10:13,374
SPEAKER_0:  and then we push ourselves more and more and more.

03:10:13,634 --> 03:10:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  towards reinstating the state of entropy that's present in the rest of the universe.

03:10:19,138 --> 03:10:20,263
SPEAKER_0:  What advice would you give to you?

03:10:20,263 --> 03:10:20,926
SPEAKER_1:  young people.

03:10:22,754 --> 03:10:23,198
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:10:23,458 --> 03:10:25,534
SPEAKER_1:  that are fighting entropy with all their might.

03:10:26,850 --> 03:10:27,838
SPEAKER_1:  So, uh...

03:10:28,610 --> 03:10:32,286
SPEAKER_1:  young people and people that are wondering how to find their way in life.

03:10:32,674 --> 03:10:34,590
SPEAKER_1:  What advice would you give?

03:10:34,914 --> 03:10:36,798
SPEAKER_1:  how to have a career, how to have a life.

03:10:37,218 --> 03:10:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  they can be proud of.

03:10:39,362 --> 03:10:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  I think...

03:10:40,802 --> 03:10:41,822
SPEAKER_0:  Starting off

03:10:42,242 --> 03:10:43,614
SPEAKER_0:  with the first principles.

03:10:43,906 --> 03:10:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  What are my values?

03:10:45,890 --> 03:10:47,934
SPEAKER_0:  How do I want to live life because

03:10:48,386 --> 03:11:00,702
SPEAKER_0:  I'm in my early 50s and when I was a kid, we waited for the newspaper came in the afternoon and then we'd see something, okay, what's going on in the world? We'd learn something. We're the West Coast baseball scorers, right?

03:11:00,930 --> 03:11:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  and learn about, oh, here's what happened in different parts of the world.

03:11:04,258 --> 03:11:09,886
SPEAKER_0:  And by and large, I and everyone else there, adult or child, we're like living in

03:11:10,178 --> 03:11:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  a reality that was largely, our conception was largely what was around us.

03:11:14,370 --> 03:11:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  Right? Now, in many ways, it is.

03:11:17,378 --> 03:11:22,398
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not saying it's entirely negative, of course, that we have more information, we can sort of think globally, so to speak, right?

03:11:23,234 --> 03:11:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  The other side of that is so much of the world's problems are on us all the time.

03:11:29,058 --> 03:11:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  Right? Like here's this awful thing that happened. How many awful things happen each day and they're right in front of us and there's such an immediacy to it all?

03:11:37,762 --> 03:11:39,422
SPEAKER_0:  that I think it can be like.

03:11:39,682 --> 03:11:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  paralyze us with terror, right? And for someone who's young and trying to make their way, it's like, how do you figure your way out in this world that your word isn't even gonna exist, right? And then you see how profligate.

03:11:51,330 --> 03:11:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  the generations before you.

03:11:53,570 --> 03:11:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  are in so many ways.

03:11:55,970 --> 03:11:59,902
SPEAKER_0:  and there can become, I think, a push towards extremes, either nihilism,

03:12:00,290 --> 03:12:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  or I'm gonna change everything.

03:12:02,722 --> 03:12:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  Right? And it's like, how about, let's start from, how do I want to behave in my own?

03:12:07,810 --> 03:12:10,494
SPEAKER_0:  community, right? Which starts with, how do I want to behave in my household?

03:12:10,946 --> 03:12:14,238
SPEAKER_0:  What kind of neighbor do I want to be? I mean, it might seem like things like that are.

03:12:14,882 --> 03:12:19,646
SPEAKER_0:  still you're small in comparison to the big things, but I don't think they are. I think that's how not small.

03:12:20,034 --> 03:12:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  That's how we start building foundations that let us tackle.

03:12:24,002 --> 03:12:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  the big things. I do find myself saying when I'm working with, sometimes doing therapy with,

03:12:28,834 --> 03:12:30,622
SPEAKER_0:  younger people of helping them.

03:12:31,074 --> 03:12:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  to bring back their...

03:12:33,346 --> 03:12:35,646
SPEAKER_0:  thoughts, their strivings, their decisions.

03:12:35,938 --> 03:12:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  more to themselves and living.

03:12:38,530 --> 03:12:42,846
SPEAKER_0:  with and around themselves more instead of in something that becomes very

03:12:43,586 --> 03:12:45,790
SPEAKER_0:  theoretical and therefore very

03:12:46,690 --> 03:12:47,998
SPEAKER_0:  threatening and unnerving.

03:12:48,610 --> 03:12:51,966
SPEAKER_1:  So focusing on the people around them, taking one small step at a time.

03:12:52,418 --> 03:12:53,918
SPEAKER_1:  to form deeper connections.

03:12:54,274 --> 03:12:55,102
SPEAKER_1:  to build something.

03:12:55,426 --> 03:12:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  locally.

03:12:56,802 --> 03:12:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  How do I want to be today if I go into the grocery store and

03:13:00,354 --> 03:13:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  person in front of me drops something, you know, I can, I can scowl because I'm in a rush, right, and I could be like that, right?

03:13:06,498 --> 03:13:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  I can be like that. I've done that way many, many times in my life, right?

03:13:09,794 --> 03:13:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  It's never done anyone a damn bit of good, including me. Or I can realize, like, the 10 seconds aren't gonna matter. Can I help pick that thing up? Or just smile? These are the seemingly small things that I think make the tenor of our lives.

03:13:22,562 --> 03:13:26,686
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I moved, I think I mentioned to you offline, uh, one of the-

03:13:26,978 --> 03:13:28,862
SPEAKER_1:  really the main reason I moved to.

03:13:29,282 --> 03:13:30,206
SPEAKER_1:  Austin, Texas.

03:13:31,074 --> 03:13:33,534
SPEAKER_1:  I just remember deciding it when I went to Walmart.

03:13:34,242 --> 03:13:35,358
SPEAKER_1:  And a lady said...

03:13:36,578 --> 03:13:36,926
SPEAKER_1:  Bye.

03:13:37,346 --> 03:13:39,134
SPEAKER_1:  You look handsome in that tie.

03:13:39,618 --> 03:13:40,990
SPEAKER_1:  or in that suit and tie or whatever.

03:13:42,018 --> 03:13:48,734
SPEAKER_1:  Like I don't think anyone's ever said older lady. She was very sweet. There's kindness in her eyes. She said that I don't think anyone ever said anything like that.

03:13:49,154 --> 03:13:50,814
SPEAKER_1:  to me in my entire life.

03:13:51,266 --> 03:13:51,902
SPEAKER_1:  And it was just.

03:13:53,506 --> 03:13:58,014
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know, it was like, wow, there's kindness in this world. I know it sounds ridiculous, but like-

03:13:58,242 --> 03:14:01,470
SPEAKER_1:  does not sound ridiculous. It's like those you could be that for somebody.

03:14:02,242 --> 03:14:04,126
SPEAKER_1:  Go walk around in Walmart.

03:14:04,386 --> 03:14:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  Right, think that you remember that, and it's pivotal, you're citing it as, hey, that was a big part of me moving here. So think about the branch point in your life.

03:14:13,474 --> 03:14:15,294
SPEAKER_0:  that comes from the simple kindness.

03:14:15,618 --> 03:14:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  right, of a person who had goodness to give.

03:14:18,242 --> 03:14:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  right and wasn't scared.

03:14:20,162 --> 03:14:25,278
SPEAKER_0:  that you're going to be upset by it or whatever, right? Take the risk. Right, right. You probably didn't have the...

03:14:25,762 --> 03:14:32,062
SPEAKER_0:  the thought that you could be a sailing, right? Probably she looks at you, she's got goodness to give, it's simple to give it, it's that.

03:14:32,738 --> 03:14:42,509
SPEAKER_0:  Simple and it's beautiful and it's worth more to you than like how many studies would be on, where's it right to live or this and that. None of that matters, what mattered was just that freedom to be kind and.

03:14:42,509 --> 03:14:51,230
SPEAKER_1:  And that's emotion, that's not logic at all. That's purely just human emotion and a little bit of humanness, that little bit of connection.

03:14:51,970 --> 03:14:52,830
SPEAKER_1:  And then, uh...

03:14:53,250 --> 03:14:54,718
SPEAKER_1:  That's what makes life great.

03:14:54,850 --> 03:15:00,702
SPEAKER_0:  that you moved here that way instead of one could say, well,

03:15:01,410 --> 03:15:08,926
SPEAKER_0:  I can't believe you did that instead of looking at all the data and hiring consultants of what's the best place to live. But that would be wrong, right? You made a good decision.

03:15:09,282 --> 03:15:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  Right, like that was good data, it was impactful data, even in your thoughts about how you're happy living here.

03:15:15,298 --> 03:15:18,302
SPEAKER_0:  Right, it's not that, oh, you discount, you shortchange yourself.

03:15:18,594 --> 03:15:26,174
SPEAKER_0:  by not relying on all the logic, right? You felt something about the place and you felt it as symbolized in a person and that made the choice for you.

03:15:26,690 --> 03:15:28,030
SPEAKER_0:  It's a balance of course.

03:15:28,130 --> 03:15:31,294
SPEAKER_1:  but you also have to know yourself a little bit sometimes.

03:15:31,618 --> 03:15:34,142
SPEAKER_1:  You can find stability and comfort in kind of.

03:15:34,498 --> 03:15:36,126
SPEAKER_1:  reasoning things out a little bit.

03:15:36,610 --> 03:15:39,710
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe as people close to me have...

03:15:40,098 --> 03:15:42,526
SPEAKER_1:  Sometimes criticized in that I'm a little bit

03:15:42,850 --> 03:15:43,806
SPEAKER_1:  too romantic.

03:15:44,162 --> 03:15:45,854
SPEAKER_1:  where I'll just follow the feeling.

03:15:46,594 --> 03:15:47,774
SPEAKER_1:  and you know life.

03:15:48,322 --> 03:15:49,726
SPEAKER_1:  you know, there's physics.

03:15:50,338 --> 03:15:51,934
SPEAKER_1:  There's a reality to this world.

03:15:52,226 --> 03:15:54,366
SPEAKER_1:  And sometimes...

03:15:54,978 --> 03:15:55,902
SPEAKER_1:  reality.

03:15:56,450 --> 03:15:58,526
SPEAKER_1:  doesn't allow you to flourish.

03:15:58,818 --> 03:16:01,630
SPEAKER_1:  if you just follow your feelings, but there's a dance there.

03:16:01,922 --> 03:16:05,918
SPEAKER_1:  And happiness is ultimately found in that landscape of.

03:16:06,370 --> 03:16:07,870
SPEAKER_1:  feeling and emotion versus.

03:16:08,450 --> 03:16:08,990
SPEAKER_1:  facts.

03:16:09,570 --> 03:16:10,270
SPEAKER_1:  and reason.

03:16:10,594 --> 03:16:11,006
