00:00:00,034 --> 00:00:03,390
SPEAKER_0:  And the nozzle, so as you're saying, there's a bunch of different designs.

00:00:03,618 --> 00:00:04,318
SPEAKER_0:  options.

00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  but it's a critical part of this, how you do that conversion.

00:00:08,322 --> 00:00:10,430
SPEAKER_1:  Which is basically like how much

00:00:10,658 --> 00:00:11,422
SPEAKER_1:  Can you convert?

00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:13,918
SPEAKER_1:  is really like the ultimate game. How much-

00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:15,230
SPEAKER_1:  Pressure and heat.

00:00:15,586 --> 00:00:17,118
SPEAKER_1:  can we convert into thrust?

00:00:17,506 --> 00:00:19,742
SPEAKER_1:  Like that's really at the end of the day, that's what a rocket engine is.

00:00:22,146 --> 00:00:23,271
SPEAKER_1:  The following is a comment.

00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:24,478
SPEAKER_0:  Conversation with Tim Dodd.

00:00:24,962 --> 00:00:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  Host of the Everyday Astronaut YouTube channel.

00:00:28,226 --> 00:00:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  where he educates and inspires.

00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:31,166
SPEAKER_0:  All of us.

00:00:31,522 --> 00:00:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  with detailed but accessible explanations.

00:00:34,082 --> 00:00:35,134
SPEAKER_0:  of rocket engines.

00:00:35,906 --> 00:00:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  All things space travel.

00:00:38,274 --> 00:00:40,030
SPEAKER_0:  This is the Lex Freedman Podcast.

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:00:43,618 --> 00:00:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  And now...

00:00:44,418 --> 00:00:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  Dear friends,

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,206
SPEAKER_0:  Here's Tim.

00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  done.

00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  Can you give a brief history of SpaceX rockets? So we got Falcon 1, Falcon 9.

00:00:54,114 --> 00:00:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  There's different versions of those, Falcon Heavy.

00:00:56,482 --> 00:00:59,070
SPEAKER_0:  Starship and also the the dragon capsules and so on

00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:05,822
SPEAKER_1:  Well, yeah, Falcon 1 is where it all started. The original intent and the original idea of SpaceX was Elon wanted to try to

00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:07,806
SPEAKER_1:  Get something to Mars.

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,422
SPEAKER_1:  You know, he saw that NASA didn't have a current Mars plan.

00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,614
SPEAKER_1:  and he wanted to go to Mars, so he decided how do I best do this?

00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,662
SPEAKER_1:  He literally wanted it.

00:01:18,242 --> 00:01:18,782
SPEAKER_1:  at first.

00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,830
SPEAKER_1:  purchase a rocket from Russia.

00:01:21,474 --> 00:01:22,014
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:23,934
SPEAKER_1:  Then on the after.

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,382
SPEAKER_1:  A foiled attempt at doing that, he decided he was going to try to develop his own rocket.

00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:36,830
SPEAKER_1:  And the Falcon 1 is what came out of that process. And he developed a pretty incredible team. I don't know how exactly he stumbled upon the team that he stumbled upon that quickly.

00:01:37,218 --> 00:01:38,878
SPEAKER_1:  But the people that he assembled were amazing.

00:01:39,362 --> 00:01:41,054
SPEAKER_1:  and they built the Falcon 1.

00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:46,494
SPEAKER_1:  which was a single Merlin engine followed by an upper stage engine called the Kestrel engine.

00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:47,454
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,318
SPEAKER_1:  pretty small compared to the things they're working on today, but that Merlin engine continued to evolve.

00:01:52,930 --> 00:02:00,638
SPEAKER_1:  into being the power plant for the Falcon 9. They went from a small lift launch vehicle up into the medium class launch vehicle so they could provide services for NASA.

00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:01,662
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:07,294
SPEAKER_1:  That's one of the big things they first kind of hung their hat up was they got the opportunity to fly cargo to the International Space Station.

00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,174
SPEAKER_1:  under originally is called the COTS program.

00:02:10,402 --> 00:02:12,958
SPEAKER_1:  the commercial orbital transportation services.

00:02:13,538 --> 00:02:16,510
SPEAKER_1:  for NASA which evolved into the commercial resupply contracts.

00:02:16,994 --> 00:02:20,830
SPEAKER_1:  And that's when SpaceX developed both their Dragon capsule, which is a

00:02:21,346 --> 00:02:25,214
SPEAKER_1:  uncrewed at first spacecraft that can dock to the ISS.

00:02:25,794 --> 00:02:29,054
SPEAKER_1:  and the Falcon 9 rocket that can take it to the International Space Station.

00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,878
SPEAKER_0:  and then Dragon rides on.

00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  It's the thing up top that rides on the big.

00:02:35,074 --> 00:02:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  booster thing that shhhhhh

00:02:36,674 --> 00:02:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  that launches it.

00:02:38,114 --> 00:02:40,894
SPEAKER_1:  the inter orbit. Exactly. Yep. The Falcon 9's the-

00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:41,438
SPEAKER_1:  dead.

00:02:41,858 --> 00:02:45,150
SPEAKER_1:  Semi truck, the dragon capsules, the payload.

00:02:45,442 --> 00:02:48,766
SPEAKER_1:  You know, it's the thing being dropped off basically at assassination. In this case.

00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,974
SPEAKER_1:  The destination is the International Space Station.

00:02:51,682 --> 00:02:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,278
SPEAKER_1:  and uh...

00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,366
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so they.

00:02:54,946 --> 00:02:56,638
SPEAKER_1:  develop those relatively quickly.

00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,798
SPEAKER_1:  and became a commercial success before you know it there.

00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:07,614
SPEAKER_1:  Now the number one launch provider in the world launching more mass to orbit than anybody else launching more frequently than

00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,078
SPEAKER_1:  um, countries.

00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:11,166
SPEAKER_1:  entire

00:03:11,394 --> 00:03:16,478
SPEAKER_1:  country of China who's going crazy right now with launches. Granted, China beat them by two launches this last in 2022, but

00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,862
SPEAKER_1:  Prior year SpaceX beat the entire country of China.

00:03:21,122 --> 00:03:22,247
SPEAKER_1:  It's nuts.

00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  And just like you said, SpaceX still beats China even this year.

00:03:26,786 --> 00:03:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  In terms of the amount of payload that was done. So all ends up.

00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,286
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, the mass, the orbit, right.

00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,854
SPEAKER_0:  that China.

00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:36,926
SPEAKER_0:  had like 60 something a couple more.

00:03:37,538 --> 00:03:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  launches but there was just like small cubes that type of

00:03:41,794 --> 00:03:43,326
SPEAKER_1:  launches exactly some of them are

00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:47,326
SPEAKER_1:  literally like 100 kilograms or something, you know, like not large payloads.

00:03:47,426 --> 00:03:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  And so SpaceX customers are.

00:03:50,178 --> 00:03:51,358
SPEAKER_0:  different.

00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  So whoever wants to...

00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,718
SPEAKER_0:  send payloads up into space.

00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:58,174
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, but right now their biggest customer is actually themselves.

00:03:58,562 --> 00:03:59,134
SPEAKER_1:  with Starling.

00:03:59,618 --> 00:04:04,030
SPEAKER_1:  One of the biggest reasons they've launched so much massed orbits is because Starlink has designed

00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:08,350
SPEAKER_1:  around the payload fairing and the payload capabilities of the Falcon 9 rocket.

00:04:09,026 --> 00:04:13,694
SPEAKER_1:  So, you know, because they're vertically integrated, because they build their own satellites, because they're building their own rocket.

00:04:13,986 --> 00:04:18,558
SPEAKER_1:  they can literally design a system that's, you know, another manufacturer might've made a more square.

00:04:18,946 --> 00:04:23,070
SPEAKER_1:  satellite that was heavier or something, but SpaceX looked at it from a blank slate and said,

00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,414
SPEAKER_1:  Here's our constraints.

00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:30,590
SPEAKER_1:  our payload mass constraints or volume constraints. And they made a funky looking satellite at things like the size of a, you know, like a table folded up.

00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:35,006
SPEAKER_1:  which isn't anything I've really ever seen before, but it's purpose built.

00:04:35,426 --> 00:04:35,838
SPEAKER_1:  to fit.

00:04:36,098 --> 00:04:38,430
SPEAKER_1:  as efficiently as possible inside their fairing.

00:04:38,818 --> 00:04:40,766
SPEAKER_1:  and inside the capabilities of that rocket. So therefore,

00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:42,654
SPEAKER_1:  because they're launching those.

00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:47,422
SPEAKER_1:  like an insane amount, you know, a dozen, you know, 40, 50 times a year or whatever.

00:04:47,778 --> 00:04:49,278
SPEAKER_1:  Um, there, uh,

00:04:49,602 --> 00:04:51,486
SPEAKER_1:  They're just putting up insane amounts of mass.

00:04:51,906 --> 00:04:53,031
SPEAKER_1:  Like we've never seen before.

00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:59,774
SPEAKER_0:  What about the different versions of Falcon 9? Are there some interesting memories to you of the different developments in Falcon 9?

00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,238
SPEAKER_1:  The very first Falcon 9's had a square.

00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,406
SPEAKER_1:  Array of engines. I had like a three by three by three grid

00:05:05,826 --> 00:05:07,934
SPEAKER_1:  of their Merlin 1 engines, the 1Ds.

00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,622
SPEAKER_1:  And I think it only lasted.

00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:13,054
SPEAKER_1:  I don't remember if it was two or four flights.

00:05:13,506 --> 00:05:19,102
SPEAKER_1:  before they went into this octo-wog configuration where there's eight, like a ring of eight engines with a center engine in the middle.

00:05:19,618 --> 00:05:24,958
SPEAKER_1:  I'm still in the same diameter that the rocket was the fuselage is more or less the same 3.7 meter wide diameter

00:05:25,314 --> 00:05:29,182
SPEAKER_1:  but the actual thrust structure changed. One of the big efficiency gains was

00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:32,126
SPEAKER_1:  you no longer have a corner engine and then like a.

00:05:32,738 --> 00:05:35,742
SPEAKER_1:  edge engine and then another corner engine. You can just make eight.

00:05:36,098 --> 00:05:36,894
SPEAKER_1:  of the same.

00:05:37,122 --> 00:05:37,758
SPEAKER_1:  you know, kind of.

00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:40,094
SPEAKER_1:  Part of the OctaWeb it's called.

00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,726
SPEAKER_1:  You know, the same shape.

00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,726
SPEAKER_1:  And then your interchangeability and your manufacturability becomes a lot simpler.

00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:53,598
SPEAKER_1:  So that was kind of one of the bigger upgrades at first and they kept stretching it. Every time they like touch this thing, it got longer and taller and taller technically.

00:05:53,922 --> 00:05:56,510
SPEAKER_1:  And then the next big feature that you saw.

00:05:57,026 --> 00:05:57,950
SPEAKER_1:  and 20.

00:05:58,562 --> 00:06:00,734
SPEAKER_1:  would have been they added landing legs.

00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,366
SPEAKER_1:  to a Falcon 9 rocket, which is...

00:06:02,722 --> 00:06:05,598
SPEAKER_1:  I was at, that was the first launch I ever went to, was actually to see.

00:06:06,018 --> 00:06:09,118
SPEAKER_1:  It was CRS3, so Commercial Resupply Mission 3, and it was probably there.

00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,846
SPEAKER_1:  God, I don't remember what that was like.

00:06:11,426 --> 00:06:14,526
SPEAKER_1:  their 14th or 15th launch or something like pretty early on.

00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:18,590
SPEAKER_1:  Um, and people were literally laughing at the idea of them putting landing.

00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:25,278
SPEAKER_1:  They just thought it was stupid. They're like, why are they wasting? Why is this billionaire Elon Musk guy wasting his time trying to

00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,925
SPEAKER_1:  land a rocket, it's not gonna work.

00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  You said the Mars plan was there in the beginning.

00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  What about the reusability of rockets?

00:06:33,858 --> 00:06:34,814
SPEAKER_0:  Was that there in the beginning?

00:06:35,426 --> 00:06:38,398
SPEAKER_1:  I think reusability definitely, you know, it's a

00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,414
SPEAKER_1:  necessary part of.

00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,366
SPEAKER_1:  making any kind of interplanetary.

00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:43,582
SPEAKER_1:  Mission.

00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:46,366
SPEAKER_1:  in order to actually do that, just...

00:06:46,914 --> 00:06:48,789
SPEAKER_1:  financially you have to start reusing these things.

00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:51,454
SPEAKER_0:  of the development of the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9.

00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  How?

00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  Early on did the.

00:06:56,194 --> 00:06:57,022
SPEAKER_0:  Golov

00:06:57,346 --> 00:06:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  reusing the rocket, having the rocket actually land.

00:07:00,194 --> 00:07:02,014
SPEAKER_0:  How early did that gold creep in?

00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:10,942
SPEAKER_1:  I can't speak for Elon and SpaceX, but it was pretty, you know, immediately they wanted to try to recover. I think the very first two Falcon 9 rockets in.

00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  Falcon 1, I think they even wanted to try to recover.

00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,382
SPEAKER_1:  using parachutes to recover the first stage.

00:07:16,834 --> 00:07:20,094
SPEAKER_1:  Um, and now fast forward, you know.

00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:23,838
SPEAKER_1:  almost 20 years later and Rocket Lab is actually doing a concept like that.

00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:26,110
SPEAKER_1:  where they're pulling a parachute.

00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:32,126
SPEAKER_1:  After the first stage is re-entering and they actually are trying to recover it with a helicopter. He's going to try to snatch it out of the air.

00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:34,718
SPEAKER_1:  They've actually done it. They've actually done it successfully once.

00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:36,917
SPEAKER_0:  How does the helicopter grab the rocket?

00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:41,374
SPEAKER_1:  With this giant like drag line and a hook. Oh, and then literally just like.

00:07:41,698 --> 00:07:43,166
SPEAKER_1:  grab snags onto the parachute.

00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:48,926
SPEAKER_1:  Wow. And it's pretty amazing. But this is a small rocket. Their rocket's only about a metric ton.

00:07:49,186 --> 00:07:50,398
SPEAKER_1:  that the booster is empty.

00:07:50,722 --> 00:07:53,310
SPEAKER_0:  So the rocket releases parachutes.

00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:54,366
SPEAKER_0:  Alexa, like

00:07:54,594 --> 00:07:55,358
SPEAKER_0:  really high up.

00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:59,134
SPEAKER_0:  I'd love to see this. Yeah. That's an interesting idea. Interesting, interesting idea.

00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:01,342
SPEAKER_0:  ideas and possibilities like SpaceX.

00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:03,070
SPEAKER_0:  basically just innovated.

00:08:04,322 --> 00:08:06,494
SPEAKER_0:  a lot of different weird ideas.

00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:10,046
SPEAKER_0:  just in the pursuit of making things more efficient, reusable.

00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:10,878
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:08:11,234 --> 00:08:13,918
SPEAKER_0:  So basically thinking from first principles how to solve this problem.

00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,886
SPEAKER_0:  And so what you find is like, you'll get all these kinds of crazy kind of solutions.

00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  And with SpaceX, they weren't even getting to the point of the booster surviving reentry long enough to be able to pull the parachutes. Yeah. You know, they're mass fractions, you know, and that varies.

00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,886
SPEAKER_1:  Every single rocket's different, you know, all the...

00:08:30,274 --> 00:08:33,310
SPEAKER_1:  You know, for instance, Rocket Lab uses carbon composite.

00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:34,654
SPEAKER_1:  fuselage and tanks.

00:08:35,074 --> 00:08:38,718
SPEAKER_1:  or you know same thing and that's very very lightweight has

00:08:39,138 --> 00:08:42,238
SPEAKER_1:  really good mass fractions and therefore their drag coefficients and things like that.

00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,574
SPEAKER_1:  we're able to survive reentry.

00:08:44,994 --> 00:08:48,126
SPEAKER_1:  of the first stage, which is something that SpaceX wasn't able to do at the time.

00:08:48,642 --> 00:08:52,830
SPEAKER_1:  Um, what's what the kind of the big, I think breakthrough for SpaceX with reusing the booster.

00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,462
SPEAKER_1:  Is they uh...

00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:57,950
SPEAKER_1:  they realized we have to basically slow down before we hit the atmosphere.

00:08:58,242 --> 00:09:05,566
SPEAKER_1:  So they actually do what they used to call a reentry burn, which I still think is the correct term, because it is reentering the atmosphere. But now they call it the entry burn.

00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,126
SPEAKER_1:  and they light up three of the nine Merlin engines.

00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:12,574
SPEAKER_1:  Not only to slow it down, but actually even while those engines are firing it creates like a

00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:14,910
SPEAKER_1:  a literal like force field as it's.

00:09:15,266 --> 00:09:17,054
SPEAKER_1:  falling through the atmosphere.

00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:19,422
SPEAKER_1:  Interesting. And, uh, but it also.

00:09:19,874 --> 00:09:21,662
SPEAKER_1:  decreases the velocity by almost half.

00:09:21,954 --> 00:09:25,118
SPEAKER_1:  are around half and then that therefore decreases the amount of

00:09:25,506 --> 00:09:29,278
SPEAKER_1:  You know, the biggest thing with the atmosphere is that as it gets compressed against...

00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,038
SPEAKER_1:  the front of any.

00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,246
SPEAKER_1:  anything flying through the atmosphere.

00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,486
SPEAKER_1:  the compressed atoms just get hot.

00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:40,062
SPEAKER_1:  and they can get so hot they turn into a plasma and they get so hot they can just absolutely destroy anything.

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:43,038
SPEAKER_1:  So they slow down enough that the

00:09:43,394 --> 00:09:44,478
SPEAKER_1:  Air molecules don't end up.

00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,902
SPEAKER_1:  destroying the vehicle on reentry.

00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:54,686
SPEAKER_1:  And then they realized, I think at some point it's probably a similar crossover. They're like, well, if we're lighting the engines already and it slowed down in the atmosphere, we can just use that.

00:09:55,266 --> 00:09:56,254
SPEAKER_1:  Same engine to land.

00:09:57,122 --> 00:09:59,390
SPEAKER_1:  And so like, well, what if we just stuck landing legs on it?

00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,502
SPEAKER_1:  just landed the thing vertically and.

00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:06,974
SPEAKER_1:  Next thing you know is December 21st, 2015. They did exactly that for the first time. I feel part of the press ocean.

00:10:07,298 --> 00:10:09,923
SPEAKER_0:  So you were there before that then, right? Yeah, yep.

00:10:09,923 --> 00:10:13,950
SPEAKER_1:  2014. Yep, early 2014. So that and for me, like that was so fun watching.

00:10:14,402 --> 00:10:17,342
SPEAKER_1:  That was the peak of me just becoming obsessed with.

00:10:17,794 --> 00:10:20,126
SPEAKER_1:  uh, with this idea I'm watching with.

00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:25,630
SPEAKER_1:  Like in back in the day, it was like months between launches. You know, so a launch was like a big idea. Wake up at 3 a.m.

00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,838
SPEAKER_1:  to watch this landing attempt or whatever, you know.

00:10:28,322 --> 00:10:30,718
SPEAKER_1:  Every, you know, there's CRS four.

00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:33,278
SPEAKER_1:  Almost landed, CRS5.

00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:38,398
SPEAKER_1:  Almost landed CRS6, CRS7 blew up. I was watching that on, I think it was like a Saturday morning.

00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:42,302
SPEAKER_1:  or maybe a Sunday morning. And I remember watching that and watch it blow up. I'm sick of it.

00:10:43,138 --> 00:10:44,190
SPEAKER_1:  Now what, you know?

00:10:44,962 --> 00:10:46,206
SPEAKER_1:  It blew up on a scent.

00:10:46,658 --> 00:10:50,270
SPEAKER_1:  It was their first failure. So it was their 18th flight, I believe.

00:10:50,882 --> 00:10:53,214
SPEAKER_1:  Sierra 7, the upper stage had a...

00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:58,846
SPEAKER_1:  one of the bottles inside the tanks that are filled with helium and one of those bottles broke off on a send.

00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:04,958
SPEAKER_1:  and actually just completely over pressured the upper stage and the upper stage blew up and the whole rocket went kaboom.

00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,774
SPEAKER_1:  in an uncontrolled manner.

00:11:08,354 --> 00:11:14,814
SPEAKER_1:  And so, so then they came back with vengeance. When they came back, the first mission back is the first time that they landed a rocket, which was awesome.

00:11:15,138 --> 00:11:17,758
SPEAKER_1:  So the return to flight after the anomaly was...

00:11:17,986 --> 00:11:18,334
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:11:18,658 --> 00:11:20,533
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it was landing a rocket.

00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  I stuck the landing. Yep, nailed it. Well, actually the first time, so the first time you were there, what was that like?

00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  What do you remember from that day?

00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:36,158
SPEAKER_1:  Just, I was surprised at how much bigger the rocket was than I imagined. I was, I originally, when I was going down to Kennedy Space Center, I was disappointed that I wasn't seeing like a.

00:11:36,674 --> 00:11:37,022
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

00:11:37,314 --> 00:11:39,774
SPEAKER_1:  I didn't know a ton about rockets. I knew enough to like, no.

00:11:40,162 --> 00:11:46,750
SPEAKER_1:  what a space shuttle was, what like the Saturn V was, you know, but that was probably about the end of my knowledge. I just remember being disappointed.

00:11:47,202 --> 00:11:50,238
SPEAKER_1:  that I wasn't seeing a big quote unquote NASA rocket flying.

00:11:50,498 --> 00:11:53,502
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I was thinking in my head like, oh, I'm gonna see this launch. It's probably gonna be like.

00:11:54,178 --> 00:11:58,078
SPEAKER_1:  you know, three stories tall or something, you know, just some little skinny little stick and

00:11:58,914 --> 00:12:03,102
SPEAKER_1:  little firecracker and yay, you know, and I think I'd almost been pitched that too, I think.

00:12:03,554 --> 00:12:09,950
SPEAKER_1:  the people that I was working for at the time, I think they kind of were downplaying it. It's like, well, it's not a big rocket, it's not gonna be that exciting, you know?

00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:11,838
SPEAKER_1:  But we get out there to the pad and I'm like.

00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:15,390
SPEAKER_1:  This thing's huge. This is not a small rocket. Like, this is-

00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:19,902
SPEAKER_1:  It's 70 meters tall, 220 feet tall. It's huge.

00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:26,462
SPEAKER_1:  Um, and I think people forget like the scale of that, you know, it might look skinny and tall and all this stuff, but.

00:12:26,978 --> 00:12:31,550
SPEAKER_1:  It's still a very, very large piece of machinery. It's physically about as large as you can ship.

00:12:31,874 --> 00:12:34,334
SPEAKER_1:  The booster is about as big as you can ship across the country, period.

00:12:34,786 --> 00:12:39,358
SPEAKER_1:  without like completely shutting down highways. You know, it is made within those exact specifications of.

00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:44,190
SPEAKER_1:  of having lane privileges and bridges and everything. It's 12 feet wide.

00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:47,070
SPEAKER_1:  3.7 meters wide and it's 45 meters long.

00:12:47,586 --> 00:12:49,566
SPEAKER_1:  So it's like exactly what you can fit.

00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:50,878
SPEAKER_1:  with a

00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:55,646
SPEAKER_1:  pretty standard, you know, like before we start getting into crazy amounts of problems shipping the rocket.

00:12:56,066 --> 00:13:01,246
SPEAKER_1:  It's huge. It's huge. And people just don't understand that. And so when I saw with my own eyes, I remember just being like,

00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:03,166
SPEAKER_1:  This is so much cooler than I thought.

00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  It's hard to believe that that thing is gonna have to lift off the ground and launch up into the air Maybe that's the most humbling aspect of it. That's something that size.

00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:17,598
SPEAKER_0:  Humans have come up with a way to take something that size and launch it up into the air.

00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,790
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, there's certainly a very humbling aspect when you watch it actually leave.

00:13:21,922 --> 00:13:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  Was there sound to it? Was there like a feeling? What were the different experiences that you first remember?

00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,990
SPEAKER_1:  Well, ironically, I didn't end up getting to see that one fly.

00:13:29,506 --> 00:13:32,318
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, I went home. My camera saw it. I left my camera out there.

00:13:32,674 --> 00:13:34,078
SPEAKER_1:  like a remote triggered camera.

00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:42,366
SPEAKER_1:  My first images as a launch photographer at the time was CRS3, but I went home. It scrubbed too many times. Now this is back in the day. They were scrubbing like.

00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,174
SPEAKER_1:  often and they'd be like a three day, five day, seven day, you just never knew.

00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,494
SPEAKER_1:  So I go home and I watch the live stream of it. So I didn't even get to experience.

00:13:50,818 --> 00:13:58,878
SPEAKER_1:  My first launch and anyone that's ever tried to, you know, go to a launch is, can probably empathize because yeah, scrubs are very common in the space flight world.

00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,998
SPEAKER_1:  So that one I didn't get to see, but since then obviously I've been able to.

00:14:04,322 --> 00:14:06,197
SPEAKER_1:  attend very many launches.

00:14:06,197 --> 00:14:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  How much do you understand the control involved in the landing? How difficult is that problem?

00:14:09,986 --> 00:14:15,902
SPEAKER_1:  I couldn't tell you a single thing about the code and the avionics behind it, but I can tell you all the hardware that makes it happen.

00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:16,894
SPEAKER_1:  if that helps.

00:14:16,994 --> 00:14:21,630
SPEAKER_0:  Well, that, I mean, to me, it seems like whenever I talk to people, they say it's not.

00:14:22,466 --> 00:14:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  that big of a deal in terms of the level of intelligence and the control. But to me, it's just like when you observe it.

00:14:28,674 --> 00:14:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  It seems incredible.

00:14:30,114 --> 00:14:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  because of all the variables involved.

00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  all the uncertainties involved, all the...

00:14:35,682 --> 00:14:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  Um, because there's aerodynamics, I mean, like there's different temperatures. There's so much going on with the fuel, the burning.

00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,918
SPEAKER_0:  the combustion, just everything that's going on.

00:14:46,306 --> 00:14:49,278
SPEAKER_0:  to be able to perform control at such high stakes.

00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  Effectively.

00:14:50,754 --> 00:14:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  Like, you know, that code is probably not written in JavaScript, I guess is what I'm saying.

00:14:55,522 --> 00:14:56,542
SPEAKER_1:  Actually, no, I don't.

00:14:56,802 --> 00:15:01,214
SPEAKER_1:  If I remember, again, this is well outside of my domain, but.

00:15:01,794 --> 00:15:02,334
SPEAKER_1:  um...

00:15:02,626 --> 00:15:05,406
SPEAKER_1:  I'm, they're coding in a common language, it's...

00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:06,855
SPEAKER_1:  is

00:15:06,855 --> 00:15:07,605
SPEAKER_0:  probably going to be C.

00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:15,038
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is and that was one of the things that's weird is that Elon when he you know started SpaceX like we're just gonna code in the most common language so that

00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,398
SPEAKER_1:  We don't have to like have people learn this archaic, you know.

00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:23,102
SPEAKER_1:  weird thing and we can just literally pull people off the streets and be like, here, write it.

00:15:23,202 --> 00:15:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  That's probably C++. I mean, it'd be epic if it was like Python or something, but I think reliable systems have to be written in C++ probably.

00:15:31,714 --> 00:15:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  which is a common language, which is something I imagine like NASA engineers would probably have to use in some kind of proprietary language.

00:15:38,658 --> 00:15:40,222
SPEAKER_0:  in the olden days.

00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:44,359
SPEAKER_0:  for security, for privacy, all that kind of stuff. eig already beast got that

00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:48,958
SPEAKER_1:  old, old days, like they were inventing code and language from scratch.

00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, for sure. It's still incredible that it's able to do that. Like just the feat of engineering involved is just, it's truly.

00:15:57,986 --> 00:16:02,398
SPEAKER_0:  It's like one of the marvels to observe about these rockets coming back to Earth.

00:16:03,074 --> 00:16:04,542
SPEAKER_0:  that they're able to land.

00:16:04,962 --> 00:16:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  Like the drama of it is just incredible to see.

00:16:07,714 --> 00:16:15,710
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, well, one of the fun things to remember too, specifically with the Falcon 9 and the Falcon 9, or Falcon Heavy boosters, I mean, it's the same thing basically.

00:16:15,938 --> 00:16:16,350
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:16:16,674 --> 00:16:19,102
SPEAKER_1:  they shut down all but one of the nine engines.

00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:22,142
SPEAKER_1:  and even with that one engine at its minimum throttle setting.

00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:24,542
SPEAKER_1:  It's still too much thrust to hover.

00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,558
SPEAKER_1:  So as this rocket's coming down.

00:16:27,298 --> 00:16:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  if they start a little bit too early, if they light that engine too early.

00:16:31,138 --> 00:16:32,702
SPEAKER_1:  it will actually stop above the ground.

00:16:33,218 --> 00:16:34,270
SPEAKER_1:  and will not be able to.

00:16:34,658 --> 00:16:35,198
SPEAKER_1:  Lower itself.

00:16:35,874 --> 00:16:39,710
SPEAKER_1:  It will literally stop like, say it stopped 200 feet above the ground.

00:16:40,578 --> 00:16:43,454
SPEAKER_1:  their only option is to kill the engine and then it's just gonna fall those 200 feet

00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:44,894
SPEAKER_1:  So they, it's.

00:16:45,122 --> 00:16:47,614
SPEAKER_1:  what we call like a suicide burn or a hover slam kind of.

00:16:48,002 --> 00:16:48,958
SPEAKER_1:  interchangeable terms.

00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,646
SPEAKER_1:  because your thrust to weight ratio is never below one.

00:16:52,226 --> 00:16:55,774
SPEAKER_1:  So they have to actually literally be riding the throttle. So what you do is you kind of start.

00:16:56,194 --> 00:17:03,390
SPEAKER_1:  Ideally, you know, you kind of start like in the middle of your window of throttle range. So let's pretend your engine can throttle down to 40%.

00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,086
SPEAKER_1:  of its maximum rated thrust.

00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,422
SPEAKER_1:  You might start at like 70% of thrust.

00:17:07,714 --> 00:17:18,238
SPEAKER_1:  in the middle of that like window of where it could burn. So that, so if all of a sudden it's kind of coming in too hot, you have room to throttle up. If you're coming into, you're actually, you know, a little too early, you throttle it down. You have a little bit of wiggle room.

00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:25,662
SPEAKER_1:  It's just amazing how smoothly and how perfectly they're able to still control that thing, even though they're down to one engine out of the nine.

00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:30,398
SPEAKER_1:  and they're still riding like the finest margin of what's possible. They're continually playing with that to try to get it.

00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,822
SPEAKER_1:  because every every bit of fuel they're using and proponent they're using

00:17:34,114 --> 00:17:34,686
SPEAKER_1:  to land.

00:17:35,074 --> 00:17:43,038
SPEAKER_1:  is propellant they weren't using to put something into space. So they want that to be as efficient as possible. They're really like watching them hone that in and.

00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:48,990
SPEAKER_1:  and just continue to evolve and edit that and just get it to be the workhorse. We're coming up on 100.

00:17:49,314 --> 00:17:50,654
SPEAKER_1:  consecutive landings.

00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:56,254
SPEAKER_1:  perfect landings, 100. I think they've done like 150 something landings altogether, 168, 160 altogether.

00:17:56,706 --> 00:17:58,014
SPEAKER_1:  but we're talking like in a row.

00:17:58,402 --> 00:18:02,750
SPEAKER_1:  without blowing up, which five years ago was completely experimental and insane.

00:18:03,394 --> 00:18:04,702
SPEAKER_1:  and now we're coming up to the point where we're-

00:18:05,058 --> 00:18:06,974
SPEAKER_1:  hundred in a row it's like this is becoming

00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:14,142
SPEAKER_1:  more reliable in the landing, which is not the primary mission. This is purely for SpaceX's like gain is to recover the booster.

00:18:14,402 --> 00:18:17,086
SPEAKER_1:  It has nothing to do with the effect of getting the payload on orbit.

00:18:17,474 --> 00:18:19,102
SPEAKER_1:  you know, most of the time. and

00:18:19,426 --> 00:18:22,750
SPEAKER_1:  The landing is really only for their their benefit in their gain

00:18:23,042 --> 00:18:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  Long term gain

00:18:24,098 --> 00:18:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  like it's a long-term investment.

00:18:25,954 --> 00:18:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  in being able to recover the boosters. Can you believe all this was done in basically 10 years? So we've seen this development.

00:18:34,274 --> 00:18:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  over a period of 10 years. So like where we started.

00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  Wow, commercial space flight.

00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  at scale.

00:18:42,242 --> 00:18:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  today where it's almost uh...

00:18:44,674 --> 00:18:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  almost starting to

00:18:45,794 --> 00:18:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  be mundane. Watch AMN.

00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  How can I be able to do?

00:18:50,082 --> 00:18:53,086
SPEAKER_1:  I can't really believe it. I mean, obviously even just in the

00:18:53,538 --> 00:18:58,206
SPEAKER_1:  I think I'm a fairly fair weather fan really didn't start paying attention to like 2014.

00:18:58,562 --> 00:19:12,766
SPEAKER_1:  And just seeing what it was like back then to what it's like, like I don't watch every launch at all anymore. Like I'll catch the big ones. I'll stream some of the really big ones. But like back in the day, I, like I said, would wake up in the middle of the night to catch these streams or, you know, catch these launches and watch them.

00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:15,230
SPEAKER_1:  because they were such a big deal and there's maybe only.

00:19:15,842 --> 00:19:19,966
SPEAKER_1:  Five of them a year, you know? And so it's a really big deal. Nowadays it's like, oh yeah, there's...

00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,046
SPEAKER_1:  literally like two a week on average now.

00:19:22,306 --> 00:19:24,222
SPEAKER_1:  It's insane. From SpaceX alone.

00:19:25,026 --> 00:19:27,422
SPEAKER_1:  Let alone, you know, United Launch Alliance, Rocket Lab.

00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,462
SPEAKER_1:  any of the Chinese missions, you know, I mean, all of there's.

00:19:30,786 --> 00:19:32,318
SPEAKER_1:  It's insane, it's hard to...

00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,805
SPEAKER_1:  really really really hard to keep up with. i wonder what he is doing. the same blank sky, though not perfect,

00:19:34,805 --> 00:19:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  at which point in the future.

00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:43,582
SPEAKER_0:  the number of launches to orbit will exceed the number of launches of airplanes.

00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,255
SPEAKER_0:  like on the surface of Earth.

00:19:45,255 --> 00:19:47,326
SPEAKER_1:  I have to admit I kind of have a hard time.

00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:49,662
SPEAKER_1:  extrapolating out that far.

00:19:50,018 --> 00:19:55,262
SPEAKER_1:  You know, there's a lot of people that are like big futurists and really do think about like interplanetary stuff and think about colonizing Mars and stuff.

00:19:55,682 --> 00:19:57,118
SPEAKER_1:  I have a hard time predicting like.

00:19:57,506 --> 00:20:00,478
SPEAKER_1:  when Starship's gonna fly, the orbital launch. You know, and that's like-

00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:04,798
SPEAKER_1:  Inmanent ish like month or two scale timeframe and yet I'm still like

00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,918
SPEAKER_1:  I can't tell you anything about when we're gonna land on Mars or what that's...

00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:16,766
SPEAKER_1:  what that economy and what that, you know, the scale of launch operations is going to look like in order to do that because it's just so hard to, I wouldn't have predicted.

00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:21,982
SPEAKER_1:  or at today five years ago, you know, it's insane. It's so hard to predict and

00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:28,478
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, but it's funny because there's so many like new companies starting up trying to predict that and it's a really exciting.

00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,983
SPEAKER_1:  you know, startup culture.

00:20:30,983 --> 00:20:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  I think when you make certain engineering decisions...

00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:37,854
SPEAKER_0:  and hiring decisions and like what you focus on in terms of both business.

00:20:38,146 --> 00:20:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  and engineering.

00:20:39,362 --> 00:20:40,478
SPEAKER_0:  It's good to think.

00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  on the scale of 10, 20, 50, 100 years. It's one of the things that you'll

00:20:44,322 --> 00:20:45,278
SPEAKER_0:  exceptionally good at.

00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:46,430
SPEAKER_0:  which is asking.

00:20:47,074 --> 00:20:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  uh... the question of okay this might seem impossible right now but

00:20:50,818 --> 00:20:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  What's the obvious way to do this if we look out 20 years?

00:20:55,074 --> 00:20:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  And then you start to...

00:20:57,186 --> 00:21:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  make decisions. You said make decisions about robotics, about brain and computer interfaces, about...

00:21:02,146 --> 00:21:03,486
SPEAKER_0:  space travel there.

00:21:03,746 --> 00:21:04,190
SPEAKER_0:  Amik.

00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of sense when you look at the scale of 10, 20, 15, 100 years.

00:21:08,418 --> 00:21:12,606
SPEAKER_0:  and don't make any sense if you look at the scale of just months.

00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  but of course the actual work.

00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:17,950
SPEAKER_0:  of day to day is focused on the next few months.

00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  There's deadlines, there's missions you have to accomplish.

00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,735
SPEAKER_0:  Anyway, we are.

00:21:21,735 --> 00:21:24,735
SPEAKER_1:  turning back to the brief history.

00:21:24,735 --> 00:21:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  rockets.

00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  Alright.

00:21:26,434 --> 00:21:36,003
SPEAKER_0:  The Falcon Heavy, so what else is there? So we talked about Falcon 9 and the rapid development there. What other flavors of Falcon is there and how does that take us to Starship?

00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,910
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, realistically, the Falcon 9 evolved more or less.

00:21:39,394 --> 00:21:42,750
SPEAKER_1:  kind of like just got more powerful a little bit longer and more capable

00:21:43,618 --> 00:21:46,654
SPEAKER_1:  but nowadays they fly what's called the Block 5, even though it's like the-

00:21:47,202 --> 00:21:50,430
SPEAKER_1:  eighth or ninth iteration of the Falcon out, but they call it block five.

00:21:50,786 --> 00:21:53,214
SPEAKER_1:  It's the one that has the black landing legs, the black inner stage.

00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:57,246
SPEAKER_1:  They have a fleet of roughly ten or so that are doing the majority of the leg work these days.

00:21:57,538 --> 00:22:01,214
SPEAKER_1:  and they're flying up to 15 times, I think right now is the current.

00:22:02,018 --> 00:22:02,878
SPEAKER_1:  booster leader.

00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:06,206
SPEAKER_1:  They're also recovering the fairings to the nose cone of the rockets.

00:22:07,586 --> 00:22:09,758
SPEAKER_1:  frequently if not every time being recovered.

00:22:10,146 --> 00:22:10,654
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:22:11,202 --> 00:22:13,086
SPEAKER_1:  Same with the booster for the most part.

00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:17,726
SPEAKER_1:  And the only thing being expanded is the upper stage. And that's kind of where the Falcon nine is.

00:22:17,986 --> 00:22:19,582
SPEAKER_1:  ending it really doesn't make

00:22:20,162 --> 00:22:23,230
SPEAKER_1:  sense to develop that infrastructure any longer. So they went.

00:22:23,682 --> 00:22:26,142
SPEAKER_1:  with the next step, which is go even bigger.

00:22:27,074 --> 00:22:30,526
SPEAKER_1:  physically so they have more margin for upper stage reusability.

00:22:31,042 --> 00:22:33,598
SPEAKER_1:  And that's what we see with Starship and Super Heavy.

00:22:34,018 --> 00:22:35,166
SPEAKER_1:  So the super heavy booster.

00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:38,654
SPEAKER_1:  The whole system is confusing the whole system is kind of considered Starship

00:22:39,202 --> 00:22:44,958
SPEAKER_1:  But technically the Starship is just the upper stage, which is also like the spaceship, which is also the upper stage.

00:22:45,378 --> 00:22:48,222
SPEAKER_1:  And then the booster itself is considered the super heavy booster.

00:22:48,898 --> 00:22:53,598
SPEAKER_1:  And that's what they've been working on. Publicly, it came out in 2016 as the

00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:56,222
SPEAKER_1:  The timer is the ITS, the enter.

00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,982
SPEAKER_1:  Planetary Transportation System.

00:22:58,562 --> 00:23:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  Later and I think about 20s by the end of that year 2017 and kind of became known as the BFR the big

00:23:04,994 --> 00:23:06,750
SPEAKER_1:  Falcon Rocket? Yes.

00:23:07,138 --> 00:23:11,134
SPEAKER_1:  And then I think it was about end of 2018 they started calling it Starship

00:23:11,938 --> 00:23:12,958
SPEAKER_1:  But that is the...

00:23:13,186 --> 00:23:15,102
SPEAKER_1:  That is where we're at today and that's what they're.

00:23:15,362 --> 00:23:16,830
SPEAKER_1:  working full steam ahead on.

00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  And what about dragon? I know we mentioned dragon, crew dragon, cargo dragon.

00:23:21,602 --> 00:23:23,326
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so they went from the

00:23:23,618 --> 00:23:26,814
SPEAKER_1:  Cargo version of Dragon that flew about 20 times.

00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:32,158
SPEAKER_1:  successfully to the International Space Station, except for that one CRS-7 where the rocket blew up in the

00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,078
SPEAKER_1:  capsule obviously didn't make it to the ISS.

00:23:34,434 --> 00:23:44,894
SPEAKER_1:  Then they went into the Dragon 2, which has two variants. It has a crew variant, so we just call it crew dragon, and then there's the cargo version of Dragon 2.

00:23:45,378 --> 00:23:49,502
SPEAKER_1:  And that's just an updated, sleeker, sexier version of Dragon and it's...

00:23:49,954 --> 00:23:52,734
SPEAKER_1:  Ironically, it's heavier altogether, so it.

00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:59,262
SPEAKER_1:  You'll never see those cool return to launch site landing, the boosters coming back to land for CRS missions anymore like we used to.

00:23:59,586 --> 00:24:01,790
SPEAKER_1:  but they landed on the drone ship anyway.

00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:02,718
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:24:03,202 --> 00:24:10,238
SPEAKER_1:  And yeah, that's been flying successfully. That's kind of the, so there's the Starlink, Dragon, Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Starship system as kind of the whole.

00:24:10,946 --> 00:24:12,071
SPEAKER_1:  The whole SpaceX world.

00:24:12,071 --> 00:24:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  really in terms of the the the spaceships involved. So what to you are some of the major milestones in that history?

00:24:18,914 --> 00:24:19,998
SPEAKER_0:  We kind of mentioned a f-

00:24:20,706 --> 00:24:21,246
SPEAKER_0:  you.

00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. Sticking the landing. Kind of stands out.

00:24:24,674 --> 00:24:32,510
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I would say definitely the big ones, obviously, like any of the first, like the first flight of Falcon one, first flight of Falcon nine, first time they went to the International Space Station.

00:24:33,122 --> 00:24:35,262
SPEAKER_1:  the first time they landed a booster.

00:24:35,554 --> 00:24:37,630
SPEAKER_1:  The first time they reuse a booster, which is...

00:24:37,954 --> 00:24:41,822
SPEAKER_1:  Think about six months after, no, oh, it was a year after. Cheers, FF IT, and ellerzojs.

00:24:42,402 --> 00:24:42,814
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:24:43,074 --> 00:24:43,998
SPEAKER_1:  20th.

00:24:44,322 --> 00:24:48,254
SPEAKER_1:  It was the first time they reused one of those boosters, you know, and that was a big milestone. play.

00:24:48,578 --> 00:24:50,558
SPEAKER_1:  And we even, yeah, we recovered one.

00:24:50,882 --> 00:24:52,862
SPEAKER_1:  caught one, you know, it's like we got one now what?

00:24:53,474 --> 00:24:55,102
SPEAKER_1:  That was the first time that we flew one.

00:24:55,714 --> 00:25:00,094
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, then Flying Humans was a huge one. DM2, Bob and Doug.

00:25:00,322 --> 00:25:00,958
SPEAKER_1:  for NASA.

00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:08,574
SPEAKER_1:  Bob and Doug, yeah. Bob and Doug, that was incredible. That was a huge, huge step, I think, for SpaceX, with flying people.

00:25:08,898 --> 00:25:11,166
SPEAKER_0:  So it's a first major commercial.

00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,165
SPEAKER_0:  launching of humans out into space.

00:25:14,165 --> 00:25:16,926
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, and not just into space, because you know, there's been people that have...

00:25:17,538 --> 00:25:21,086
SPEAKER_1:  done space flights with suborbital hops.

00:25:21,346 --> 00:25:23,006
SPEAKER_1:  going into orbit.

00:25:23,298 --> 00:25:27,518
SPEAKER_1:  and especially docking and rendezvousing with the International Space Station is a big deal.

00:25:28,354 --> 00:25:34,782
SPEAKER_1:  Until you really understand the physics involved in the scale involved with like just crossing the carmine line going straight up versus

00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,822
SPEAKER_1:  going into orbit, like they're just completely different things almost.

00:25:38,274 --> 00:25:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  What about Starship?

00:25:41,346 --> 00:25:44,222
SPEAKER_0:  Are we in a place where we can talk about milestones with Starship?

00:25:44,674 --> 00:25:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  Has there been, or has it just been an epic journey of failure and successes of testing?

00:25:50,338 --> 00:25:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  and so on.

00:25:53,282 --> 00:25:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  What would you classify at this point as a...

00:25:56,418 --> 00:26:00,606
SPEAKER_0:  as a milestone, a starship or BFR, whatever the name is, was able to achieve.

00:26:00,834 --> 00:26:09,534
SPEAKER_1:  Well, so far the milestones we've seen, I'd say the first one would be the hop of, they call it Star Hopper, and it's basically a very rudimentary rocket, but it was the first time they...

00:26:09,762 --> 00:26:11,870
SPEAKER_1:  They utilized their new Raptor engine to produce.

00:26:12,162 --> 00:26:13,598
SPEAKER_1:  thrusted to fly something.

00:26:14,338 --> 00:26:15,134
SPEAKER_1:  It first flew like

00:26:15,522 --> 00:26:21,918
SPEAKER_1:  literally like three meters off the ground or something like tethered to the ground. Then it flew like 15 and then finally it flew 150 meters.

00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:25,502
SPEAKER_1:  And that was in 2019.

00:26:26,082 --> 00:26:29,630
SPEAKER_1:  And that was the first big milestone of Starship. And then after that we saw...

00:26:30,082 --> 00:26:34,398
SPEAKER_1:  SN5, SN6 kind of do the similar like 150 meter hops with a little bit more.

00:26:34,786 --> 00:26:38,974
SPEAKER_1:  elegant systems, you know, proving out more of their, their tank building, proving out more of their.

00:26:39,394 --> 00:26:41,374
SPEAKER_1:  you know, a lot of just subsystems and then.

00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:42,494
SPEAKER_1:  The big ones.

00:26:42,754 --> 00:26:44,446
SPEAKER_1:  Physically we're in N.

00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,838
SPEAKER_1:  End of 2020 and early 2021 when they flew the.

00:26:48,322 --> 00:26:50,590
SPEAKER_1:  SN 8, 9, 10, 11, and 15.

00:26:50,722 --> 00:26:52,597
SPEAKER_0:  What does the N stand for in SN? Hey guys, welcome back to cover SC?'s New Leave.

00:26:52,597 --> 00:26:53,347
SPEAKER_1:  I don't remember or

00:26:53,347 --> 00:26:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  start to number. Yeah. So I said these are just names, numbers.

00:26:57,826 --> 00:27:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  numerical representations of the different testing.

00:27:00,482 --> 00:27:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  efforts.

00:27:01,282 --> 00:27:04,657
SPEAKER_0:  They skipped some numbers, right? Yeah. If they scratch, uh,

00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:10,846
SPEAKER_1:  tests.

00:27:11,266 --> 00:27:22,302
SPEAKER_1:  One foot is always in front of someone else's foot and like the arm is not knowing what the leg is doing sometimes with that, right? They will have someone working on, you know, they'll just be like, I'm going to step up and build 40 of these tank sections.

00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:26,206
SPEAKER_1:  and you build the bulkhead and you build the down comer and you build the header tank blah blah blah

00:27:26,498 --> 00:27:31,486
SPEAKER_1:  And all of a sudden like, oh, we actually evolved that. We don't use that header tank now. So it's gonna go onto this one. So they'll have like parts of-

00:27:31,778 --> 00:27:32,830
SPEAKER_1:  certain rockets built.

00:27:33,186 --> 00:27:36,574
SPEAKER_1:  It's like, ask, literally scrap it. Like not scrap it like in the.

00:27:36,834 --> 00:27:39,038
SPEAKER_1:  you know, joke term, but like literally just go scrap it.

00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:42,993
SPEAKER_1:  And they, so yeah, they just evolve and iterate so quickly.

00:27:42,993 --> 00:27:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  There were some epic explosions.

00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:45,854
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:27:46,402 --> 00:27:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  I think Starship.

00:27:47,682 --> 00:27:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  something about it.

00:27:49,442 --> 00:27:50,846
SPEAKER_0:  probably just the amount of fuel.

00:27:51,234 --> 00:28:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  just leads to some epic failures. Would you say Starship is the source of the most epic failures in terms of size of explosion?

00:28:00,194 --> 00:28:15,486
SPEAKER_1:  So you can literally measure it in like a yield of explosive power, you know, like you could TNT. Like you can take a look at how much propellant is left over at the time of the explosion. And you know, Starship, what's flown so far, even though it's physically one of the largest flying objects ever.

00:28:15,842 --> 00:28:17,502
SPEAKER_1:  Just with the upper stage alone.

00:28:17,954 --> 00:28:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  They've not filled it more than like 10 or 20% full of propellant.

00:28:21,922 --> 00:28:25,630
SPEAKER_1:  And so it actually hasn't been, the failures have been really-

00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:26,942
SPEAKER_1:  epic looking.

00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,782
SPEAKER_1:  big visual fireballs, but in terms of space flight, they're still

00:28:31,234 --> 00:28:37,310
SPEAKER_1:  pretty small explosions, believe it or not. They could still go bigger. Oh yeah, a lot, a lot.

00:28:37,538 --> 00:28:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  and of course.

00:28:38,882 --> 00:28:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  the test payload of a Tesla Roadster was launched.

00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  I forget what year that was. Yeah, that was 2018. That was quite epic. Would you put that on the milestone? Seales 브라이�

00:28:47,266 --> 00:28:49,246
SPEAKER_1:  Oh yeah, Falcon Heavy demo was like.

00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:50,462
SPEAKER_1:  Definitely a.

00:28:50,818 --> 00:28:52,254
SPEAKER_0:  A big, big, big milestone, yeah.

00:28:52,802 --> 00:28:53,182
SPEAKER_0:  Is that?

00:28:53,506 --> 00:28:59,167
SPEAKER_0:  funny to you that there's a roadster floating out there. Do we know the location of that roadster at this point? Oh yeah.

00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:00,510
SPEAKER_1:  Whereisroadster.com

00:29:01,058 --> 00:29:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah? Oh yeah.

00:29:02,114 --> 00:29:04,382
SPEAKER_1:  Where's is it orbiting something? Yeah, it's orbiting the Sun

00:29:05,058 --> 00:29:06,590
SPEAKER_1:  So it's orbiting the sun.

00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:13,822
SPEAKER_1:  And its orbit is basically between the Earth's orbit and beyond Mars. So I think of like 2.5 AU, if I remember right. Like 2.5 AU � alles nicht zäh Let's fold it up and focus, and cover it up. Oh yes!

00:29:14,274 --> 00:29:17,630
SPEAKER_1:  It's beyond Mars' orbit at its highest point, and it's back at Earth.

00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:18,782
SPEAKER_1:  kind of at its lowest point.

00:29:18,946 --> 00:29:20,510
SPEAKER_0:  I wonder if there's a mission or a-

00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  you're going to.

00:29:22,082 --> 00:29:25,310
SPEAKER_0:  somehow connect with it once again and place extra things into it

00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:28,195
SPEAKER_0:  I wonder how challenging that is technically.

00:29:28,195 --> 00:29:30,494
SPEAKER_1:  Oh yeah, it could absolutely be done.

00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:34,398
SPEAKER_1:  You know, the hard thing at this point, because it's on an eccentric orbit.

00:29:34,658 --> 00:29:47,166
SPEAKER_1:  would be rendezvousing with it, because you kind of had to be in alignment with its orbit to really line up well with it. Yeah. But yeah, I mean, someday I don't see any reason why we couldn't at least send for sure an uncrewed, you know, a felon wanted to just fly a...

00:29:47,714 --> 00:29:51,166
SPEAKER_1:  a robot out there to check up on it photograph it or something like we could

00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,525
SPEAKER_1:  that could be well within the realm of things.

00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:56,990
SPEAKER_0:  get an optimus robot up there.

00:29:57,346 --> 00:30:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  So that was the story brilliantly told by you of the rockets for SpaceX. What about through the lens of engines?

00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  Can you give a brief history of the SpaceX rocket engines that were...

00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  used that we haven't covered. She's mentioned all started with the Merlin engine.

00:30:13,794 --> 00:30:15,454
SPEAKER_0:  and a customer engine what...

00:30:16,034 --> 00:30:17,598
SPEAKER_0:  their foot through that lens.

00:30:17,986 --> 00:30:24,990
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, what's there? The engines are relatively small number, which is, which is easy for us. So does the other Merlin and Merlin's evolved throughout time to be.

00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:29,566
SPEAKER_1:  from like the Merlin to the Merlin 1C to the Merlin 1D full thrust and all these other kind of

00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:31,326
SPEAKER_1:  tweaks of the same architecture.

00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,534
SPEAKER_1:  Kestrel ended with Falcon 1.

00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:38,014
SPEAKER_1:  They also have the Merlin vacuum engine, which is the upper stage engine for Falcon 9.

00:30:38,242 --> 00:30:43,678
SPEAKER_1:  Same relative system, but just optimized for vacuum. So as a much larger valve nozzle.

00:30:44,034 --> 00:30:50,078
SPEAKER_1:  There's the Draco thrusters, which you kind of can consider engines. Well, they are rocket engines, but they're just.

00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,358
SPEAKER_1:  Smaller, not like the...

00:30:51,714 --> 00:30:55,358
SPEAKER_1:  orbital engines, there's the super Draco engines, which are the abort thrusters.

00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:56,414
SPEAKER_1:  on

00:30:56,738 --> 00:30:57,918
SPEAKER_1:  on Crew Dragon Capsule.

00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,446
SPEAKER_1:  And then nowadays they have the Raptor engine.

00:31:00,994 --> 00:31:06,878
SPEAKER_1:  and the Raptor vacuum variant. But they've already had two versions of Raptor. We've already seen kind of the Raptor development engine.

00:31:07,426 --> 00:31:09,822
SPEAKER_1:  I'm kind of like a rapper one point five words.

00:31:10,114 --> 00:31:11,390
SPEAKER_1:  of taking hints of

00:31:11,714 --> 00:31:13,182
SPEAKER_1:  the future Raptor, but now we're.

00:31:13,474 --> 00:31:15,038
SPEAKER_1:  While within the, while within what-

00:31:15,394 --> 00:31:17,246
SPEAKER_1:  you'd consider a Raptor 2 variant.

00:31:17,954 --> 00:31:19,038
SPEAKER_1:  That's really it.

00:31:19,394 --> 00:31:21,214
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, for the Raptor.

00:31:21,602 --> 00:31:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe I'll ask you that separately, but I like in general.

00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  and people.

00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:27,390
SPEAKER_0:  Who doesn't know?

00:31:27,618 --> 00:31:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  whoever the astronaut is, but if you don't somehow know, go go go check his-

00:31:31,906 --> 00:31:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  your YouTube channel out. You're an incredible educator.

00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  about the the super technical and uh...

00:31:39,074 --> 00:31:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  the more sort of

00:31:40,258 --> 00:31:44,926
SPEAKER_0:  even though the philosophical the actual like the the actual space travel so you go down to the.

00:31:45,314 --> 00:31:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  raw details of it. And there's just great videos on the Raptor engine.

00:31:49,026 --> 00:31:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:31:50,338 --> 00:31:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  I think you have one on Marlin.

00:31:52,706 --> 00:31:56,478
SPEAKER_0:  and also the actual tours with Elon where he discusses some of those things.

00:31:56,738 --> 00:31:58,558
SPEAKER_0:  On one of the tours he says, uh...

00:31:58,978 --> 00:32:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  He's full of good lines that guy. He says something about.

00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,190
SPEAKER_0:  the number of fiddly bits.

00:32:04,578 --> 00:32:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  And he's, uh...

00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  the number of fiddly bits was decreased between

00:32:09,698 --> 00:32:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  Raptor.

00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:15,678
SPEAKER_0:  one or after one. Yeah. I think that's actually a really beautiful representation of, um,

00:32:16,386 --> 00:32:19,454
SPEAKER_0:  the engineering efforts there, which is constantly trying to simplify.

00:32:19,842 --> 00:32:22,302
SPEAKER_0:  uh... increase the efficiency of the engines but also

00:32:23,554 --> 00:32:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  simplify the design so you can manufacture it.

00:32:26,818 --> 00:32:29,726
SPEAKER_0:  And in general, simplification leads to...

00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  better performance and testing and everything. So the number of 50 bits.

00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:38,494
SPEAKER_0:  I'm sure there's a Wikipedia page on that now as an index is actually a really good one.

00:32:39,138 --> 00:32:42,878
SPEAKER_1:  And when you think about it, I don't know of any other company prior that had

00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:50,174
SPEAKER_1:  of try to measure their performance of their engine not in like thrust to weight ratio or like how efficient it is like in specific impulse but literally in like

00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,054
SPEAKER_1:  dollar to thrust ratio? Are you still here?

00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:56,286
SPEAKER_1:  Does this engine cost? How much thrust can it produce?

00:32:56,578 --> 00:32:56,990
SPEAKER_1:  and like.

00:32:57,474 --> 00:33:00,606
SPEAKER_1:  using that as a trade study instead of just like pure metrics of

00:33:01,154 --> 00:33:02,206
SPEAKER_1:  You know, because at the end of the day, like...

00:33:02,434 --> 00:33:07,518
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, if it's cheaper and does X amount of work, even if it's less efficient, it can actually be.

00:33:07,842 --> 00:33:08,638
SPEAKER_1:  better long term.

00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  And so I guess another way is not even just thrust.

00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know if that metric is used, but basically the cost of getting one kilogram.

00:33:17,474 --> 00:33:18,974
SPEAKER_0:  of thing up into space.

00:33:19,202 --> 00:33:21,827
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, that's basically what they're trying to minimize.

00:33:21,827 --> 00:33:22,430
SPEAKER_1:  Especially, yeah.

00:33:22,786 --> 00:33:23,294
SPEAKER_1:  at the

00:33:23,522 --> 00:33:31,006
SPEAKER_1:  at the end of the day, that is definitely the ultimate metric is how much does one kilogram cost to orbit eventually, you know, and but there's it's so funny because

00:33:31,746 --> 00:33:32,862
SPEAKER_1:  Spaceflight is just the ultimate.

00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:36,126
SPEAKER_1:  You know, it's the ultimate compromise. Every little thing.

00:33:36,642 --> 00:33:41,342
SPEAKER_1:  Any variable can just change everything else. So you can tweak so many different things to get to different.

00:33:41,794 --> 00:33:44,190
SPEAKER_1:  numbers and conclusions, you know, but even things like

00:33:44,706 --> 00:33:49,342
SPEAKER_1:  on your first stage when the rocket's pointing straight up and the engines are pointing straight down

00:33:49,762 --> 00:33:54,398
SPEAKER_1:  you're dealing more with the thrust to weight ratio of the rocket. What thrust is it producing versus how much?

00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,190
SPEAKER_1:  is gravity pulling down on it.

00:33:56,514 --> 00:33:59,966
SPEAKER_1:  is actually a more important metric than how raw, efficient the engine is.

00:34:00,514 --> 00:34:04,030
SPEAKER_1:  So it's funny then in space, it's kind of the opposite thrust to weight ratio it doesn't really matter.

00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:08,798
SPEAKER_1:  What really matters is the actual, the specific impulse is called.

00:34:09,218 --> 00:34:13,150
SPEAKER_1:  nozzle escape velocity of the or the ejection velocity of the

00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:17,982
SPEAKER_1:  how fast is the gas moving is like the more important number on orbit, but it's.

00:34:18,402 --> 00:34:21,054
SPEAKER_1:  It's just so crazy because there's all these like I would just love to see.

00:34:21,762 --> 00:34:26,014
SPEAKER_1:  the trade studies, you know, when you're like trying to figure out like, is this more important than this or this or this? like,

00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:30,846
SPEAKER_1:  You change this one little thing and all of a sudden, you know, like all the everything changes. It's just.

00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:35,518
SPEAKER_1:  Even the profile, the launch profile, the trajectory of it, the, I mean, everything.

00:34:36,514 --> 00:34:41,726
SPEAKER_0:  Everything I wonder what that trade-out discussions are like is you can't really perfectly plan everything

00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:34:42,818 --> 00:34:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  And you always have to have some.

00:34:45,122 --> 00:34:45,918
SPEAKER_0:  Spare.

00:34:46,178 --> 00:34:49,022
SPEAKER_0:  leave way and especially as you're...

00:34:49,602 --> 00:34:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  testing new vehicles like Starship.

00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:53,502
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, margins are important.

00:34:53,922 --> 00:34:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, having a margin, given all the uncertainty that's there.

00:34:57,218 --> 00:35:03,358
SPEAKER_0:  That's really interesting like how they do those kinds of trade-offs because they're also rapidly designing and redesigning and re-engineering.

00:35:04,578 --> 00:35:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  and uh... the-

00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:11,742
SPEAKER_0:  Ultimately, you want to give yourself the freedom to constantly innovate, but then through the process of testing.

00:35:12,514 --> 00:35:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  you solidify the thing that can be relied upon, especially if it's a crude mission.

00:35:17,346 --> 00:35:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  at that, how to do that in a rapid cycle.

00:35:20,322 --> 00:35:21,406
SPEAKER_1:  I remember at some point...

00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:25,854
SPEAKER_1:  that NASA, as they're leading up to flying humans for the first time for NASA.

00:35:26,338 --> 00:35:26,750
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:35:27,074 --> 00:35:29,630
SPEAKER_1:  You know, there's some talk that like, we're going to do a design freeze.

00:35:29,954 --> 00:35:32,542
SPEAKER_1:  because SpaceX does evolve and iterate so quickly.

00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:40,670
SPEAKER_1:  You know, they were saying that it was leading, because especially at the time, it was a mission called AMOS 6, and they lost a rocket. They only lost two rockets.

00:35:41,218 --> 00:35:42,590
SPEAKER_1:  ever really as far as um

00:35:43,202 --> 00:35:46,526
SPEAKER_1:  you know, trying to get something to space. For the Falcon 9, sorry.

00:35:47,106 --> 00:35:47,550
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:35:48,194 --> 00:35:48,638
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:35:48,866 --> 00:35:52,894
SPEAKER_1:  The second one, Amos 6, I mean, that was back in 2016. So it's been a long time.

00:35:53,602 --> 00:35:54,462
SPEAKER_1:  And uh...

00:35:54,914 --> 00:35:56,318
SPEAKER_1:  But at the time, you know, they're looking at.

00:35:56,898 --> 00:35:58,398
SPEAKER_1:  flying humans in the near future.

00:35:59,266 --> 00:36:00,926
SPEAKER_1:  And it's like, if you guys keep...

00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,230
SPEAKER_1:  tweaking this thing every time you take it out to the pad.

00:36:03,842 --> 00:36:05,118
SPEAKER_1:  really is gonna be a problem, you know?

00:36:05,442 --> 00:36:06,846
SPEAKER_1:  And so there is some pressure.

00:36:07,714 --> 00:36:10,110
SPEAKER_1:  from NASA to kind of slow down on that iterative process.

00:36:10,786 --> 00:36:15,870
SPEAKER_1:  And, but that is also why they were able to evolve Falcon 9 to be what it is today is because they did.

00:36:16,418 --> 00:36:22,846
SPEAKER_1:  evolve it so quickly. Literally like one after another was never really the same and we're definitely seeing that with Starship now. Like it's...

00:36:23,362 --> 00:36:25,406
SPEAKER_1:  It evolved so quickly.

00:36:25,794 --> 00:36:27,902
SPEAKER_1:  that you just can't even keep up with it, you know?

00:36:28,066 --> 00:36:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  So there's a fascinating culture.

00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  Clash there. Have you just?

00:36:32,066 --> 00:36:34,974
SPEAKER_0:  in observing and interacting with NASA folks, seen them.

00:36:35,746 --> 00:36:39,422
SPEAKER_0:  sort of grow and change and evolve themselves, sort of inspired by this.

00:36:39,714 --> 00:36:41,438
SPEAKER_0:  New developments in commercial spaceflight.

00:36:41,634 --> 00:36:48,286
SPEAKER_1:  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a lot of, especially like around DM too, there's a lot of talks and the press conferences and stuff where you'd hear people say.

00:36:48,578 --> 00:36:55,454
SPEAKER_1:  You know, this was a big, this is well outside of our comfort zone to work with SpaceX in this manner because we're, we take this approach to things where.

00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:58,718
SPEAKER_1:  X, Y, and Z in this way, the way we normally certify things.

00:36:59,234 --> 00:37:01,150
SPEAKER_1:  and we're not used to SpaceX like.

00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:10,526
SPEAKER_1:  well, let's just try it, you know, like, and do something, you know, to a point. And so they said it ended up being fantastic. They loved working that way because it was just.

00:37:11,074 --> 00:37:13,310
SPEAKER_1:  Less paperwork almost and more just do.

00:37:13,922 --> 00:37:14,686
SPEAKER_1:  And, um...

00:37:15,138 --> 00:37:20,606
SPEAKER_1:  And but at the same time, SpaceX, I think even expressed, I don't remember if it was Hans Koenigsmann or someone in a press conference said.

00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:26,430
SPEAKER_1:  Well, we really liked having someone just double check us so that we're not doing something super stupid right before we test something, you know.

00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:29,598
SPEAKER_1:  So there was a cool collaboration because it is.

00:37:29,826 --> 00:37:31,550
SPEAKER_1:  two very different philosophies of.

00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:33,630
SPEAKER_1:  of development and managing.

00:37:33,954 --> 00:37:34,974
SPEAKER_1:  you know, space programs.

00:37:35,074 --> 00:37:37,566
SPEAKER_0:  I wanted to talk to you a lot about engines.

00:37:38,018 --> 00:37:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  and maybe about Starship and maybe about your own.

00:37:41,474 --> 00:37:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  becoming an actual astronaut, but like, let's just go there.

00:37:44,802 --> 00:37:45,278
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:37:45,506 --> 00:37:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  before all that and talk about.

00:37:48,226 --> 00:37:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  the actual culture of SpaceX.

00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  and your conversations with Elon. You've toured SpaceX facilities with him.

00:37:56,162 --> 00:37:58,238
SPEAKER_0:  You've interviewed him, you've interacted with him.

00:37:59,618 --> 00:38:09,310
SPEAKER_0:  What have you learned about rockets, about propulsion, about engineering, about design, about life from those interactions? What have you learned about rockets, about design, about engineering, about design, about life from those interactions?

00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,198
SPEAKER_0:  as an engineer as a

00:38:11,618 --> 00:38:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  as a leader, as a person.

00:38:14,498 --> 00:38:16,830
SPEAKER_1:  I would definitely say the biggest takeaway I've had from...

00:38:17,282 --> 00:38:18,014
SPEAKER_1:  by times.

00:38:18,402 --> 00:38:20,062
SPEAKER_1:  with Elon at SpaceX is.

00:38:20,994 --> 00:38:24,766
SPEAKER_1:  Really? Like the idea of questioning your constraints. He says that a lot.

00:38:25,602 --> 00:38:26,942
SPEAKER_1:  also does it a lot.

00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:28,414
SPEAKER_1:  Thank you.

00:38:28,866 --> 00:38:30,878
SPEAKER_1:  There'll be times where like.

00:38:31,746 --> 00:38:36,574
SPEAKER_1:  you'll see him change on a dime because he's like rethinking of something in a newer different way and

00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:37,982
SPEAKER_1:  For me, you know, I...

00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:42,878
SPEAKER_1:  I think we all put constraints on ourselves. We think about our own limits, you know, on

00:38:43,746 --> 00:38:48,670
SPEAKER_1:  on things that we can or cannot do. And I think it's made me kind of question like, why am I

00:38:49,282 --> 00:38:51,550
SPEAKER_1:  Why did I say no I can't do that or you know?

00:38:51,842 --> 00:38:52,414
SPEAKER_1:  Hey, hey.

00:38:52,674 --> 00:38:54,558
SPEAKER_1:  you know, just off the top of my head.

00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:56,158
SPEAKER_1:  A good example.

00:38:56,578 --> 00:38:58,974
SPEAKER_1:  I, so in Iowa, I live in Iowa.

00:38:59,266 --> 00:39:03,998
SPEAKER_1:  or half the time or whatever. There's a bike ride across the state of Iowa called Rag Bray.

00:39:04,418 --> 00:39:08,574
SPEAKER_1:  And every year you just, you know, like thousands of people get together and they ride across Iowa.

00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,622
SPEAKER_1:  And it was last summer.

00:39:11,042 --> 00:39:13,886
SPEAKER_1:  I met up with some friends and they were like, hey, do you want to go on Rag Bride this year? And I'm like...

00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,294
SPEAKER_1:  It's like a week away, they're like.

00:39:15,554 --> 00:39:16,478
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, you wanna go?

00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:17,470
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:23,486
SPEAKER_1:  And so I did, you know, without, and it was one of those moments where I was proud of myself because it's easy to just be like, no.

00:39:23,874 --> 00:39:27,646
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I'm not ready or this is my constraint is like I'm not in shape.

00:39:28,194 --> 00:39:37,095
SPEAKER_1:  But like just question that, you know? And so I think when it comes down to questioning your own constraints, it's yes, even to that level of like, why do you question yourself on what you can and cannot do?

00:39:37,095 --> 00:39:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  So that's for your personal life is really powerful, but a little bit more intuitive.

00:39:41,474 --> 00:39:42,910
SPEAKER_0:  I think what's really hard...

00:39:43,426 --> 00:39:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  is to question constraints in a place like aeronautics or robotics or autonomous vehicles or vehicles.

00:39:52,642 --> 00:39:53,278
SPEAKER_0:  because there's.

00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  People, there's experts everywhere.

00:39:56,226 --> 00:39:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  that have done it for decades.

00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  and everyone admires those experts and respects those experts, and for you to step into a room.

00:40:03,874 --> 00:40:06,398
SPEAKER_0:  annoying not much more than just

00:40:06,754 --> 00:40:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:08,990
SPEAKER_0:  What's in a Wikipedia article?

00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  and to just use your intuition and first principles thinking to disagree with the experts.

00:40:15,874 --> 00:40:19,006
SPEAKER_0:  That takes some guts, I think.

00:40:19,266 --> 00:40:25,310
SPEAKER_1:  Well, you can't have everyone doing that either. You know, like there has to be some humility of knowing that something is a hardened.

00:40:26,018 --> 00:40:31,902
SPEAKER_1:  concept and a hard and you know like especially i'm not an engineer i don't i don't do this stuff you know what i can imagine

00:40:32,258 --> 00:40:35,454
SPEAKER_1:  You sitting there having spent six years on a type of valve that

00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:39,038
SPEAKER_1:  perfectly manages crowd-genetic propellants or whatever. Someone walks in and says,

00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:43,710
SPEAKER_1:  Why don't you just put a heater element in there? Or something that's, you know, something like bec- because-

00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  You've done that 40 times or whatever.

00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:49,790
SPEAKER_1:  I'm sure there are things like that that are.

00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,518
SPEAKER_1:  very frustrating but

00:40:51,906 --> 00:40:53,781
SPEAKER_1:  But see, the thing is- That's like, you know-

00:40:53,781 --> 00:40:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  The thing is with the experts, they're always going to be frustrated.

00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  when the newbie comes in with their first principles thinking.

00:41:00,898 --> 00:41:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  but sometimes that frustration is justified and sometimes it's not.

00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  Sometimes it's just stubbornness.

00:41:06,722 --> 00:41:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  for failing to acknowledge a better way.

00:41:08,962 --> 00:41:10,494
SPEAKER_0:  and I've seen it both directions.

00:41:10,722 --> 00:41:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  which is really interesting. Ryze is nearly as effective as any slow speed mouse where you can tolerate tasks you need...

00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  You need both, but that tension is always going to be there.

00:41:15,426 --> 00:41:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  and there has to be almost like a dictatorial.

00:41:18,626 --> 00:41:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  imperative that breaks through.

00:41:21,186 --> 00:41:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  the expertise of the way things have been done in the past.

00:41:25,346 --> 00:41:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  to push forward like a new way of doing it. Elon's done that. I've seen a lot of...

00:41:30,658 --> 00:41:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  great engineers do that in the machine learning world because there's been so much development

00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:40,222
SPEAKER_0:  I've seen that happen. Usually when there's like rapid development that starts.

00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:42,206
SPEAKER_0:  common to play.

00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:45,790
SPEAKER_0:  And yeah, and I've seen that autonomous vehicle space.

00:41:46,274 --> 00:41:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  Brain computer interfaces that Elon has evolved with all of it

00:41:49,826 --> 00:41:51,070
SPEAKER_0:  It's kind of fascinating to watch.

00:41:51,394 --> 00:41:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:41:52,002 --> 00:41:55,294
SPEAKER_0:  What about the actual design and engineering of the engine? What about the design and engineering of the engine?

00:41:55,906 --> 00:41:58,398
SPEAKER_0:  about so many different kinds of engines.

00:41:59,042 --> 00:42:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  over the past few years.

00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:06,078
SPEAKER_0:  Just like what stands out to you about the way that engineering is done at SpaceX or that-

00:42:06,562 --> 00:42:07,614
SPEAKER_0:  Elon does engineering.

00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:09,022
SPEAKER_0:  Dude.

00:42:09,122 --> 00:42:10,206
SPEAKER_1:  hardest thing to do.

00:42:11,586 --> 00:42:15,358
SPEAKER_1:  kind of remember is like how much stuff was developed in the 50s and 60s.

00:42:15,842 --> 00:42:19,102
SPEAKER_1:  You know, the concepts finally being utilized today were.

00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,278
SPEAKER_1:  already literally done in the sixties. Yeah,

00:42:21,506 --> 00:42:23,838
SPEAKER_1:  You know, so a lot of the things that SpaceX is doing isn't.

00:42:24,162 --> 00:42:25,406
SPEAKER_1:  a novel concept.

00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:31,710
SPEAKER_1:  per se, you know, they're like, for instance, the Raptor engine utilizes the full flow stage combustion cycle engine.

00:42:32,482 --> 00:42:35,358
SPEAKER_1:  And that was already developed by the Soviets in the 60s.

00:42:35,778 --> 00:42:37,566
SPEAKER_1:  for an engine called the RD270.

00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:38,366
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:42:38,626 --> 00:42:42,686
SPEAKER_1:  It makes sense, like on paper, 100% it makes sense because you're

00:42:43,074 --> 00:42:45,630
SPEAKER_1:  basically extracting the absolute maximum.

00:42:46,722 --> 00:42:47,646
SPEAKER_1:  of

00:42:48,258 --> 00:42:50,398
SPEAKER_1:  chemical energy in both propellants.

00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:58,078
SPEAKER_1:  And at the end of the day, you have to be dumb enough to say we're gonna try using this thing because it's actually really complicated to do.

00:42:58,434 --> 00:42:59,262
SPEAKER_1:  to do what they're doing.

00:42:59,778 --> 00:43:04,382
SPEAKER_1:  But at the same time, like so are so are rockets. Like rocket engines already stupid complicated. So adding.

00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:05,278
SPEAKER_1:  You don't.

00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,134
SPEAKER_1:  10, 20% more.

00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,566
SPEAKER_1:  you know, painting the butt during the R&D.

00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,006
SPEAKER_1:  If it's, you know.

00:43:11,554 --> 00:43:16,286
SPEAKER_1:  in the long, long, long 20, 30 year existence or whatever, you know, like future of that engine.

00:43:16,642 --> 00:43:18,750
SPEAKER_1:  Is that gonna be worth it? Obviously SpaceX said-

00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:21,726
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I think we can actually develop this Raptor engine.

00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:24,670
SPEAKER_1:  So it's just interesting to see the things that have been.

00:43:25,058 --> 00:43:28,062
SPEAKER_1:  Look, even reusability, you know, like the space shuttle was reusable.

00:43:29,154 --> 00:43:33,246
SPEAKER_1:  It's fully the upper stage, you know, the shuttle itself, the orbiter was.

00:43:33,634 --> 00:43:37,470
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I mean, that thing was for all intents and purposes, a reusable rocket.

00:43:38,306 --> 00:43:41,598
SPEAKER_1:  Now did it live up to its expectations? Not necessarily.

00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:46,814
SPEAKER_1:  So it left a lot of bad taste in people's mouth on the ideas of reusability.

00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  So for SpaceX to kind of come back into the room and sit on the table and say

00:43:50,082 --> 00:43:55,838
SPEAKER_1:  We're gonna use a reusable rocket. Specifically, we're gonna do a fully reusable rocket. You know, a lot of people are, even still today, a lot of people going...

00:43:56,994 --> 00:43:58,302
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, you're not going to be able to do that.

00:43:59,298 --> 00:44:00,670
SPEAKER_0:  Even today. Even today.

00:44:00,994 --> 00:44:04,318
SPEAKER_0:  So long-term, you're not gonna be able to reuse a scale.

00:44:05,794 --> 00:44:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:44:06,594 --> 00:44:06,910
SPEAKER_1:  Bye.

00:44:07,554 --> 00:44:10,974
SPEAKER_1:  Definitely, I think the number of people that are saying that today is...

00:44:11,362 --> 00:44:17,118
SPEAKER_1:  a small portion of those that were saying that type of thing five years ago. You know, Elon did that announcement in 2016.

00:44:17,634 --> 00:44:20,030
SPEAKER_1:  for the ITS. It was very...

00:44:20,354 --> 00:44:22,974
SPEAKER_1:  Very aspirational and people were just like, yeah.

00:44:23,554 --> 00:44:23,966
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

00:44:24,322 --> 00:44:25,854
SPEAKER_1:  And there's a large number of people that had the-

00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,118
SPEAKER_1:  factual reasons to think that and do that.

00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:35,326
SPEAKER_1:  You know, at the time they'd only landed like two rockets or something, you know, when they did that, or maybe three, it was a very small number.

00:44:35,778 --> 00:44:40,958
SPEAKER_1:  When they announced that actually they had just lost a couple months prior, they just lost a mo six. So they like.

00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:48,126
SPEAKER_1:  there were still this young blossoming company and they come in and be like, we've figured out reusability and now we're gonna go full scale and make the world's biggest, most heaviest.

00:44:48,418 --> 00:44:52,766
SPEAKER_1:  most powerful rocket ever and we're going to fully reuse it and it's going to go to Mars.

00:44:53,826 --> 00:44:56,190
SPEAKER_1:  pretty out there, like it really was and.

00:44:56,674 --> 00:45:04,510
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. You know, it's all about perspective. But now again, we're coming up on 100 consecutive landings of an orbital class rocket that's.

00:45:04,866 --> 00:45:08,382
SPEAKER_1:  you know, 45 meters tall, 3.7 meters wide. Like this thing is huge.

00:45:08,866 --> 00:45:10,686
SPEAKER_1:  Why is 20 metric tons even empty?

00:45:11,074 --> 00:45:11,774
SPEAKER_1:  when it's landing.

00:45:12,482 --> 00:45:16,990
SPEAKER_1:  That thing's already huge. So seeing the success of that, I think people are now more like, well, okay.

00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,686
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe, maybe there is actually.

00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:22,046
SPEAKER_1:  the opportunity to be fully reasonable. That's definitely probably the biggest.

00:45:22,562 --> 00:45:24,126
SPEAKER_1:  constraint that I think has been questioned.

00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:25,726
SPEAKER_1:  That is being.

00:45:25,858 --> 00:45:29,502
SPEAKER_0:  Yep. And then of course, like the broader one of costs of bringing down costs.

00:45:30,882 --> 00:45:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  that you're able to kind of bring down costs so much.

00:45:36,162 --> 00:45:37,854
SPEAKER_0:  Something like colonizing Mars.

00:45:38,242 --> 00:45:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  or many trips to Mars will be a possibility.

00:45:40,642 --> 00:45:41,822
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, people don't even...

00:45:42,274 --> 00:45:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  It seems so far out.

00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  That don't even.

00:45:45,186 --> 00:45:51,166
SPEAKER_0:  have time or give effort to questioning it. But this is the implied questioning. Can you really do?

00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:53,333
SPEAKER_0:  that many launches actually.

00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:53,758
SPEAKER_1:  do it.

00:45:54,018 --> 00:45:58,526
SPEAKER_1:  can actually do it. Yeah, it's looking. I think it's one of the things where you look at the curve, you know, you look at it like

00:45:58,978 --> 00:46:00,990
SPEAKER_1:  10 years ago, that was ridiculous.

00:46:01,698 --> 00:46:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  Following this curve, if SpaceX goes from, you know, two years ago launching, I don't remember what it was, 40 times to 60 times to 100 times this year.

00:46:09,826 --> 00:46:10,206
SPEAKER_1:  amount.

00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:13,374
SPEAKER_1:  And if we just keep extrapolating that out, if they...

00:46:13,794 --> 00:46:16,414
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe not that exponential, maybe it goes more linear or whatever.

00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:18,942
SPEAKER_1:  What's 20, 30 years like?

00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:23,134
SPEAKER_1:  the amount of stuff we can put on orbit and the potential we have to do things.

00:46:23,522 --> 00:46:26,654
SPEAKER_1:  Absolutely. Now I don't want to put a time frame, like, you know, yeah, I think.

00:46:27,426 --> 00:46:34,526
SPEAKER_1:  But you gotta think, we're increasing the number of launches, we're increasing the amount of things in space, we're increasing the amount of payload on orbit.

00:46:35,138 --> 00:46:38,238
SPEAKER_1:  that's probably not going to decrease anytime soon. And therefore,

00:46:39,586 --> 00:46:42,590
SPEAKER_1:  Eventually, like the idea of going to Mars is absolutely

00:46:43,042 --> 00:46:43,454
SPEAKER_1:  Reasonable.

00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  Let me ask a difficult question.

00:46:45,634 --> 00:46:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  I need to be asked here.

00:46:48,194 --> 00:46:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  Can SpaceX continue?

00:46:50,978 --> 00:46:52,798
SPEAKER_0:  It successes without Elon.

00:46:53,986 --> 00:46:56,030
SPEAKER_0:  this long-term mission to Mars.

00:46:57,634 --> 00:47:02,014
SPEAKER_0:  I think the discussion about Tesla and autopilot or robotics.

00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  or a neural link with brain computer interfaces.

00:47:04,994 --> 00:47:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  is a question wholly separate from the SpaceX question.

00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:11,582
SPEAKER_0:  because there's a lot of other competitors.

00:47:12,418 --> 00:47:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  doing.

00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  uh... some

00:47:16,482 --> 00:47:19,454
SPEAKER_0:  different but amazing engineering that Tesla is doing.

00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  in both autonomous vehicles, semi-autonomy or full autonomy.

00:47:23,906 --> 00:47:27,230
SPEAKER_0:  and obviously in vehicle design and electric vehicles.

00:47:27,682 --> 00:47:30,654
SPEAKER_0:  There's a lot of people that are doing incredible brain computer interfaces.

00:47:31,298 --> 00:47:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  but while there is a lot of competitors to SpaceX, and we'll talk about many of them, they're doing amazing work, it seems like he's really driving progress here.

00:47:40,258 --> 00:47:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  over the past 10 years.

00:47:41,922 --> 00:47:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  What do you think about that?

00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

00:47:44,802 --> 00:47:45,758
SPEAKER_1:  The first thing I think.

00:47:46,562 --> 00:47:52,606
SPEAKER_1:  remind people is just how many brilliant people do work in each of these companies, obviously.

00:47:52,962 --> 00:47:53,886
SPEAKER_1:  the

00:47:54,114 --> 00:48:00,638
SPEAKER_1:  some of the best teams assembled ever. Just incredible people. He knows this. He will gladly tell people and he says it often like.

00:48:01,218 --> 00:48:04,030
SPEAKER_1:  the amazing people, the amazing teams here. So it is important to remember that.

00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:05,054
SPEAKER_1:  um...

00:48:05,474 --> 00:48:08,190
SPEAKER_1:  That being said, like there is something to Elon's...

00:48:09,378 --> 00:48:11,102
SPEAKER_1:  just super far forward.

00:48:11,714 --> 00:48:15,582
SPEAKER_1:  not taking no for an answer on things approach that and

00:48:16,194 --> 00:48:16,894
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:48:17,346 --> 00:48:19,070
SPEAKER_1:  Almost to his dismay, I think.

00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:26,110
SPEAKER_1:  He is afraid of the sunk cost fallacy so much that it almost almost gets to the border of like being

00:48:26,498 --> 00:48:33,854
SPEAKER_1:  You know, like throw out everything before it's even, we've known or not, but at the same time, like it moves the needle so fast so far.

00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:37,854
SPEAKER_1:  So as far as the question of would SpaceX continue to like...

00:48:38,274 --> 00:48:41,502
SPEAKER_1:  succeeding and be able to ultimately go to Mars without Elon.

00:48:42,082 --> 00:48:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  The Mars thing I think would probably be hard to uphold.

00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:48,030
SPEAKER_1:  I think a lot of that drive for Mars is from Elon.

00:48:48,802 --> 00:48:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  It is maybe too fantastical for the average person and the average employee and maybe the average CEO that might step in.

00:48:55,618 --> 00:48:58,243
SPEAKER_1:  have a company's mission be to go to Mars. or even go to Mars.

00:48:58,243 --> 00:49:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. Clearly because, like you said,

00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  The Mars plan was non-existent for NASA. Yeah.

00:49:04,194 --> 00:49:05,278
SPEAKER_1:  Still really, there isn't.

00:49:06,338 --> 00:49:07,230
SPEAKER_1:  You know, so.

00:49:08,354 --> 00:49:09,214
SPEAKER_1:  I think.

00:49:09,378 --> 00:49:09,694
SPEAKER_0:  If

00:49:09,986 --> 00:49:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  And how many people, and sorry to interrupt, how many people are talking about...

00:49:13,698 --> 00:49:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  It's obvious that we need to become multi-planetary.

00:49:16,674 --> 00:49:17,822
SPEAKER_1:  Right, there's not a...

00:49:18,786 --> 00:49:21,191
SPEAKER_1:  There's the Mars Society and like.

00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  serious leaders of engineering.

00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  efforts or nations and so on. Yeah.

00:49:27,074 --> 00:49:29,758
SPEAKER_0:  Which it does seem if you think about it.

00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  that it's obvious.

00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:32,702
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, and the grand.

00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:34,805
SPEAKER_1:  eventuality it is obvious

00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:38,718
SPEAKER_0:  of human civilization, this whole human experiment we have here.

00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  which should be expanding out into the company.

00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:42,686
SPEAKER_1:  100%.

00:49:43,202 --> 00:49:44,094
SPEAKER_1:  So I think the...

00:49:44,322 --> 00:49:49,022
SPEAKER_1:  big mission if we're measuring SpaceX's success on getting to Mars or not.

00:49:49,506 --> 00:49:51,070
SPEAKER_1:  I think they'd have a really hard time.

00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:55,134
SPEAKER_1:  continuing to fulfill that drive without Elon at the helm.

00:49:55,714 --> 00:49:56,126
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:49:56,482 --> 00:49:57,022
SPEAKER_1:  Now.

00:49:57,538 --> 00:50:02,526
SPEAKER_1:  I think there's a certain balance and beauty of Elon, specifically when it was Tesla and SpaceX.

00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  where

00:50:03,682 --> 00:50:05,182
SPEAKER_1:  Elon will go in.

00:50:05,826 --> 00:50:11,806
SPEAKER_1:  you know, have mild tornadoes around the factory and the engineering, you know, and like mix everything up and, and.

00:50:12,162 --> 00:50:16,222
SPEAKER_1:  things get sometimes just totally thrown together, and totally just like.

00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:19,870
SPEAKER_1:  get it done just to get it done and start moving that direction.

00:50:20,258 --> 00:50:23,358
SPEAKER_1:  and then he'll leave and go do that same thing, you know, at SpaceX or Tesla, vice versa.

00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:31,294
SPEAKER_1:  And then there's a little bit of a calm where people come back in and they fill in those caps. I think that's kind of always been a pretty healthy thing, honestly, is like.

00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:32,542
SPEAKER_1:  I think if he...

00:50:32,962 --> 00:50:35,294
SPEAKER_1:  is too focused on any one thing.

00:50:35,938 --> 00:50:38,494
SPEAKER_1:  It almost is like a spin too much, you know, like it's like.

00:50:38,978 --> 00:50:45,982
SPEAKER_1:  The too many tornadoes. Yeah, too many tornadoes. And I think it could almost be like you need someone to come back in and like.

00:50:46,722 --> 00:50:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  you know, like backfill almost because I've heard definitely stories of like

00:50:50,146 --> 00:50:53,566
SPEAKER_1:  Like, well, probably a good example would be last.

00:50:53,858 --> 00:50:56,638
SPEAKER_1:  Last, what was that last year? Two years ago, 2020.

00:50:57,474 --> 00:50:58,206
SPEAKER_1:  Too, yeah.

00:50:58,306 --> 00:50:58,878
SPEAKER_0:  Was that? Yeah.

00:50:59,138 --> 00:50:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  Or no?

00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:00,542
SPEAKER_1:  2021.

00:51:00,994 --> 00:51:03,230
SPEAKER_1:  They did the first full stack of...

00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  Starship Super Heavy.

00:51:05,122 --> 00:51:09,118
SPEAKER_1:  And they call it the big surge. All of a sudden, like thousands of SpaceX employees.

00:51:09,538 --> 00:51:10,974
SPEAKER_1:  you know, came down to Starbase.

00:51:11,266 --> 00:51:15,230
SPEAKER_1:  and they just started building like you wouldn't freaking believe. I mean, it's just things.

00:51:15,714 --> 00:51:20,030
SPEAKER_1:  going crazy. It was actually in the middle of that first interview I did with him, was in the middle of that surge.

00:51:20,418 --> 00:51:26,942
SPEAKER_1:  There was like commotion like you wouldn't believe. You couldn't hardly talk because there's just so much going on. People just welding and blah blah blah, you know.

00:51:27,618 --> 00:51:29,886
SPEAKER_1:  Everything they did during that period was basically scrap.

00:51:31,074 --> 00:51:31,646
SPEAKER_1:  Cause it was just.

00:51:32,002 --> 00:51:33,566
SPEAKER_1:  Not done very well.

00:51:34,562 --> 00:51:35,006
SPEAKER_1:  BUT

00:51:35,682 --> 00:51:37,982
SPEAKER_1:  They got a fully stacked Starship rocket.

00:51:38,434 --> 00:51:39,294
SPEAKER_1:  Out on the launch pad.

00:51:40,226 --> 00:51:41,502
SPEAKER_1:  You know, and it's set.

00:51:41,794 --> 00:51:44,062
SPEAKER_1:  I think at some point you kind of have to...

00:51:44,802 --> 00:51:47,646
SPEAKER_1:  Stabilize some things enough and just say like, this is what we're doing.

00:51:48,226 --> 00:51:51,166
SPEAKER_1:  to catalyze some things and say, now do this. It's almost like.

00:51:51,682 --> 00:51:53,557
SPEAKER_1:  Do it for fake, now do it for real almost.

00:51:53,557 --> 00:51:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  funny cause through that time.

00:51:55,298 --> 00:51:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  I had a lot of conversation with them.

00:51:58,274 --> 00:52:00,382
SPEAKER_0:  That process was hugely stressful.

00:52:00,738 --> 00:52:04,542
SPEAKER_0:  There was a sense, I don't know where that sense is today, but there's a sense that's Starship.

00:52:04,962 --> 00:52:06,814
SPEAKER_0:  is going to be very hard to pull off.

00:52:07,842 --> 00:52:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  like borderline impossible to pull off. And that was really weighing heavy on him and the team and everybody.

00:52:15,106 --> 00:52:18,750
SPEAKER_0:  So to have this chaos of development is fascinating. Yeah.

00:52:19,042 --> 00:52:22,110
SPEAKER_1:  Big time. I think they really had to push.

00:52:22,946 --> 00:52:25,694
SPEAKER_1:  You know, if they hadn't done that, if they hadn't done that big push.

00:52:27,426 --> 00:52:31,486
SPEAKER_1:  You know, we might only be now seeing a rocket stacked for the first time.

00:52:31,746 --> 00:52:32,062
SPEAKER_1:  Tom.

00:52:32,578 --> 00:52:37,982
SPEAKER_1:  It might be a lot more finished rocket, a lot more high fidelity, a lot more flight-worthy rocket finished.

00:52:38,498 --> 00:52:39,870
SPEAKER_1:  and stacks but...

00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:43,966
SPEAKER_1:  and they might not have to walk stuff backwards, but at the same time, like you do have to...

00:52:44,258 --> 00:52:44,990
SPEAKER_1:  in this world.

00:52:45,282 --> 00:52:47,582
SPEAKER_1:  You do have to push really hard.

00:52:48,002 --> 00:52:49,182
SPEAKER_1:  uh, to make.

00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:51,966
SPEAKER_1:  rapid iteration and rapid change in progress. residents.

00:52:52,386 --> 00:52:53,511
SPEAKER_1:  It's interesting, I don't know.

00:52:53,511 --> 00:52:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  So lingering on that.

00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  Another

00:52:57,058 --> 00:53:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  question I really should ask you because of

00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  you've seen

00:53:02,658 --> 00:53:05,118
SPEAKER_0:  You've been in awe of the amazing development.

00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:10,430
SPEAKER_0:  of space travel technology over the past few years.

00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:12,446
SPEAKER_0:  What do you think about Elon?

00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

00:53:14,722 --> 00:53:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  So in this.

00:53:16,514 --> 00:53:24,702
SPEAKER_0:  perfect balance, optimized reallocation of tornadoes throughout the various efforts in human civilization.

00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  Do you think?

00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  Do you worry about his involvement on Twitter?

00:53:29,634 --> 00:53:32,382
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, personally, I just, I see that as a lot.

00:53:32,962 --> 00:53:34,814
SPEAKER_1:  less important than and

00:53:35,298 --> 00:53:41,822
SPEAKER_1:  Personally for me, inspirational than Starship and the work done at SpaceX and Tesla, to me those were two very...

00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:44,958
SPEAKER_1:  impactful and really, really just.

00:53:45,218 --> 00:53:46,110
SPEAKER_1:  generally like

00:53:46,786 --> 00:53:50,462
SPEAKER_1:  you know, they're uniting, like, you know, something to rally around, get excited about.

00:53:50,786 --> 00:53:53,470
SPEAKER_1:  rally and just like a future look forward to.

00:53:53,922 --> 00:53:55,582
SPEAKER_1:  uh... you know the idea of her gonna be

00:53:56,002 --> 00:53:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  building the world's most powerful biggest rocket ever and it's eventually going to be able to

00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:01,278
SPEAKER_1:  get humans on Mars for the first time.

00:54:01,762 --> 00:54:04,478
SPEAKER_1:  and we're going to transition the world into fully sustainable.

00:54:04,706 --> 00:54:08,254
SPEAKER_1:  awesome, just totally badass cars that do all these cool things.

00:54:08,802 --> 00:54:10,174
SPEAKER_1:  To me those were like that bra-

00:54:10,498 --> 00:54:13,214
SPEAKER_1:  sense of unity and a sense of like we can do this.

00:54:14,402 --> 00:54:15,422
SPEAKER_1:  Personally, I just don't.

00:54:16,066 --> 00:54:19,966
SPEAKER_1:  think that social media, no matter what it is, I don't see that.

00:54:20,226 --> 00:54:22,590
SPEAKER_1:  in the social media and I don't see.

00:54:22,946 --> 00:54:23,390
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:27,422
SPEAKER_1:  Any sort of politicking is ever anything that's really ever uniting thing.

00:54:27,874 --> 00:54:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  I understand that I totally agree with you especially space on sparring it is I have to push back I do think

00:54:33,986 --> 00:54:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  the impact of social media.

00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  the basic

00:54:39,138 --> 00:54:40,670
SPEAKER_0:  level of uh...

00:54:41,826 --> 00:54:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  meaningful connections.

00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  of this collective intelligence that we call human civilization.

00:54:48,098 --> 00:54:59,902
SPEAKER_0:  through the medium of digital communication, which is social media, I think that can have a huge impact. It could be the very vehicle that increases the inspiration that SpaceX does and all different.

00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, the thing I've criticized them.

00:55:02,722 --> 00:55:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  a bunch for is like why?

00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  bring politics into this.

00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:10,430
SPEAKER_0:  So the political divisions that we see on Twitter.

00:55:10,658 --> 00:55:11,518
SPEAKER_0:  feeding them.

00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  is tricky.

00:55:13,634 --> 00:55:14,238
SPEAKER_0:  Um

00:55:14,754 --> 00:55:19,678
SPEAKER_0:  It's tricky to sort of understand what is the value of that? What is the contribution of that?

00:55:20,162 --> 00:55:20,958
SPEAKER_0:  to uh...

00:55:21,442 --> 00:55:24,030
SPEAKER_0:  to this whole effort with God going on.

00:55:24,482 --> 00:55:27,230
SPEAKER_0:  That has been a big challenge, but that said, like...

00:55:27,522 --> 00:55:28,894
SPEAKER_0:  Again, this tornado.

00:55:30,306 --> 00:55:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  the number of tornadoes in social media, I think is really important because

00:55:34,338 --> 00:55:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  Social media has such a huge impact on us as a society. 됩니다

00:55:40,322 --> 00:55:41,886
SPEAKER_0:  have a transparent

00:55:42,786 --> 00:55:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  Have a bit of turmoil?

00:55:45,922 --> 00:55:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it's like Tom Way says, I like my town with a bit of drop of poison, with a little drop of poison.

00:55:51,234 --> 00:55:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  So like a little bit of that.

00:55:53,442 --> 00:55:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  Um, shake things up. I think might be really healthy. I just.

00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:59,358
SPEAKER_0:  worry about the long-term impact on the whole.

00:55:59,618 --> 00:56:03,550
SPEAKER_0:  Mars projects through that. It's a, but you know what?

00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  This life one of the reasons that's fun is uh

00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:10,174
SPEAKER_0:  through the chaos.

00:56:10,882 --> 00:56:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  Like, none of us know how it's gonna turn out and...

00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  Hopefully we try to help each other to make sure it turns out well.

00:56:17,282 --> 00:56:23,678
SPEAKER_1:  And this really isn't like anything about my personal like politics or anything like that, but really just generally.

00:56:24,418 --> 00:56:25,598
SPEAKER_1:  Any of my friends that are-

00:56:25,826 --> 00:56:26,174
SPEAKER_1:  like

00:56:26,434 --> 00:56:33,982
SPEAKER_1:  The first thing you hear about them in their day is something that happened in politics or something that some world leaders doing or not doing or saying and not saying.

00:56:34,914 --> 00:56:35,614
SPEAKER_1:  I just don't.

00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:36,510
SPEAKER_1:  Find that.

00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:44,734
SPEAKER_1:  to be the most important thing, really. I know that obviously that can affect a lot of people that has big real world consequences, politics do.

00:56:45,378 --> 00:56:51,518
SPEAKER_1:  Well, like, I just re- and this is just me. I'm such a like, he'll come together, you know,下去 for a while.

00:56:51,938 --> 00:56:55,294
SPEAKER_1:  that I just really think like you need something bigger than bickering about.

00:56:56,130 --> 00:57:00,734
SPEAKER_1:  you know, what people said and did and what they voted on and all this stuff.

00:57:00,962 --> 00:57:01,822
SPEAKER_1:  to really...

00:57:02,274 --> 00:57:06,398
SPEAKER_1:  Push humanity forward. Like I, you know, I know that politics and, and they're, and

00:57:07,394 --> 00:57:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  by extracting that social media can affect.

00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:14,398
SPEAKER_1:  things like space flight and even our like planetary defense like be able to defend ourselves against asteroids like if

00:57:15,074 --> 00:57:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  Politics has their way and everything goes to crap and we don't even get to, you know.

00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:21,790
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, we're not gonna be able to, you know.

00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:23,614
SPEAKER_1:  Continue space flight and things like that.

00:57:24,194 --> 00:57:28,606
SPEAKER_1:  But like, I don't know. I just think there's better ways to do it and more uniting ways to do it than...

00:57:29,282 --> 00:57:31,518
SPEAKER_1:  than what feels like immature.

00:57:31,746 --> 00:57:33,022
SPEAKER_1:  name calling sometimes, you know.

00:57:33,154 --> 00:57:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I think the political bickering that most people talk about that's on top of most people's minds.

00:57:38,306 --> 00:57:41,982
SPEAKER_0:  is the thing that will be completely forgotten by history. It has actually very little impact.

00:57:42,498 --> 00:57:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, politics matters, but like 1% of it. I think most of it.

00:57:46,882 --> 00:57:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  is just.

00:57:48,834 --> 00:57:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  political

00:57:49,762 --> 00:57:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  bickering the push and pull.

00:57:51,778 --> 00:58:09,598
SPEAKER_0:  of the red team and the blue team, and then the news media that feeds off the division for the attention, and it's just like a fun athletic event almost with the blue team and the red team. So, that you kind of have to have a historical perspective on it like most things.

00:58:10,434 --> 00:58:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  will not really have a significant impact and we should focus on development of science.

00:58:15,938 --> 00:58:19,326
SPEAKER_0:  technology engineering which is the thing that grows the pie.

00:58:19,618 --> 00:58:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  100% is this is what the economists know well

00:58:22,754 --> 00:58:29,129
SPEAKER_0:  which is the innovation, the engineering, that's what actually makes everybody richer. This kind of political bickering is just eating.

00:58:29,129 --> 00:58:33,534
SPEAKER_1:  the pie and not just richer, but it improves their lives. You know, we can look at-

00:58:33,826 --> 00:58:34,334
SPEAKER_1:  Every.

00:58:34,722 --> 00:58:36,254
SPEAKER_1:  modern technology that is.

00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:40,862
SPEAKER_1:  bestowed upon us today, air conditioning, electricity, internet access, fresh, clean water.

00:58:41,122 --> 00:58:42,462
SPEAKER_1:  running water, blah blah blah.

00:58:42,722 --> 00:58:45,854
SPEAKER_1:  You know, 100 years ago, so many of the things I listed either didn't exist.

00:58:46,146 --> 00:58:48,254
SPEAKER_1:  or were only accessible by the ultra wealthy.

00:58:48,802 --> 00:58:54,046
SPEAKER_1:  And it's through the innovation of technology and engineering and education that we're able to.

00:58:55,074 --> 00:59:03,806
SPEAKER_1:  be that even someone below the poverty line in the most of the developed world will have a good number of those things in their life. And that's just continuing to increase and continuing to get better.

00:59:04,482 --> 00:59:06,942
SPEAKER_1:  So I think, yeah, that's, to me that's...

00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  in the grand scheme more important.

00:59:09,922 --> 00:59:10,302
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:11,070
SPEAKER_1:  to each their own.

00:59:12,258 --> 00:59:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  Speaking of amazing technological development.

00:59:15,906 --> 00:59:17,982
SPEAKER_0:  You have a few videos on this, but...

00:59:18,306 --> 00:59:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  How does a rocket engine work?

00:59:20,866 --> 00:59:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  you're wearing some of the instruction manuals. But for one type of it, like what's the fuel, what are the types of different rock is that you can kind of.

00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  Give an overview.

00:59:33,186 --> 00:59:33,534
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:59:34,018 --> 00:59:36,510
SPEAKER_1:  Ultimately, a rocket engine converts.

00:59:36,866 --> 00:59:38,398
SPEAKER_1:  high pressure and heat.

00:59:38,786 --> 00:59:43,102
SPEAKER_1:  into kinetic energy. That's the only real job of a rocket engine is to take

00:59:43,714 --> 00:59:48,478
SPEAKER_1:  High pressure gas, hot high pressure gas. I'm very energized. There's a lot of energy involved

00:59:49,058 --> 00:59:50,270
SPEAKER_1:  And then literally.

00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:52,030
SPEAKER_1:  turning that into.

00:59:52,962 --> 00:59:55,550
SPEAKER_1:  molecules shooting in one direction into kinetic energy.

00:59:56,034 --> 00:59:56,798
SPEAKER_1:  So, um.

00:59:57,154 --> 00:59:59,486
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, what you do basically, you know, I mean...

00:59:59,778 --> 01:00:03,166
SPEAKER_1:  The simplest version of it is, of course, like famously a balloon. Take a balloon.

01:00:03,554 --> 01:00:05,438
SPEAKER_1:  Fill it up with air, you've got a pressure.

01:00:05,794 --> 01:00:08,702
SPEAKER_1:  You let go of it, some of the air shoots out in a...

01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:10,302
SPEAKER_1:  general direction ish.

01:00:10,722 --> 01:00:13,694
SPEAKER_1:  you converted that pressure into kinetic energy. Now, if you start scaling that up.

01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:16,958
SPEAKER_1:  You know, you can continue to do something like that, like...

01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:22,686
SPEAKER_1:  cold gas thruster would be kind of the most simple and easiest rocket engine to make would be a cold gas thruster

01:00:23,138 --> 01:00:28,190
SPEAKER_1:  And all that is you literally just take air, or specifically nitrogen, because it's a little bit more dense than all the others.

01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:30,270
SPEAKER_1:  or you know, the majority of our atmosphere.

01:00:30,658 --> 01:00:33,246
SPEAKER_1:  You can, or sorry, it's more sparse.

01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:34,270
SPEAKER_1:  You can

01:00:34,626 --> 01:00:35,614
SPEAKER_1:  condense that down.

01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:37,406
SPEAKER_1:  a really high pressure bottle.

01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:44,766
SPEAKER_1:  and then just literally shoot it through what's called a D-Lavelle nozzle, which is something that chokes the flow a little bit, gets it to be...

01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:45,470
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:48,158
SPEAKER_1:  takes it and gets it into supersonic speeds.

01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:52,094
SPEAKER_1:  Once it's at supersonic speed, you actually can't choke it down anymore. You'll just...

01:00:52,386 --> 01:00:55,678
SPEAKER_1:  constrict the flow of mass flow, constrict the airflow.

01:00:56,194 --> 01:01:06,238
SPEAKER_1:  So you actually go opposite, you start making it wider. And once it's already at supersonic speeds, if you expand it and make it wider, it actually gets faster and faster. So at first, when it's subsonic gas...

01:01:06,818 --> 01:01:09,310
SPEAKER_1:  you start shrinking, you can strict the flow.

01:01:09,762 --> 01:01:14,878
SPEAKER_1:  You know, it's actually speeding up just like, you know, a highway if you go from, you know, or any of these examples, like a,

01:01:15,490 --> 01:01:25,982
SPEAKER_1:  water hose you you know if you pinch it down you want to flow the same amount of water from point a to point b through a smaller pipe you can you can flow more water you're the same amount of water from point a to point b with a smaller pipe it just has to go faster

01:01:26,786 --> 01:01:31,774
SPEAKER_1:  So obviously you can constrict it, but at some point you actually get to a physical limitation and that happens to be the speed of sound.

01:01:32,418 --> 01:01:34,238
SPEAKER_1:  Once it gets to the local speed of sound.

01:01:34,722 --> 01:01:35,134
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:01:35,394 --> 01:01:39,742
SPEAKER_1:  you can then actually do the opposite. You actually expand it back out and you're continuing to convert.

01:01:40,194 --> 01:01:40,606
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:41,278
SPEAKER_0:  the

01:01:41,378 --> 01:01:43,518
SPEAKER_1:  the pressure into velocity.

01:01:43,746 --> 01:01:46,238
SPEAKER_1:  at that point, but it's now supersonic. And what's interesting is

01:01:46,818 --> 01:01:53,310
SPEAKER_1:  While you're doing that, you're actually cooling it down too. Each bit of that pipe that you're making wider and wider and wider, you're cooling down.

01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:56,254
SPEAKER_1:  So the more heat energy you have to work with.

01:01:56,738 --> 01:01:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  the more work you can actually do. So at some point a hot

01:01:59,842 --> 01:02:01,758
SPEAKER_1:  high pressure rocket engine is the best.

01:02:02,338 --> 01:02:05,150
SPEAKER_1:  source of like that's the ultimate amount of work you can do.

01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  And the nozzle, so as you're saying, there's a bunch of different design options.

01:02:09,954 --> 01:02:13,278
SPEAKER_0:  but it's a critical part of this, how you do that conversion.

01:02:13,538 --> 01:02:16,638
SPEAKER_1:  Which is basically like how much can you convert?

01:02:16,962 --> 01:02:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  is really like the ultimate game. How much

01:02:19,682 --> 01:02:20,446
SPEAKER_1:  Pressure and heat.

01:02:20,802 --> 01:02:22,302
SPEAKER_1:  Can we convert into thrust?

01:02:22,754 --> 01:02:24,670
SPEAKER_1:  Like that's really at the end of the day, that's what a rocket engine.

01:02:25,634 --> 01:02:28,094
SPEAKER_1:  So you have to have a powerful enough rocket engine to actually lift.

01:02:28,674 --> 01:02:31,454
SPEAKER_1:  the rocket and well, rocket is mostly just fuel.

01:02:31,778 --> 01:02:33,822
SPEAKER_1:  It's like 90, 90 plus percent.

01:02:34,722 --> 01:02:37,342
SPEAKER_1:  the weight of fuel. You just have to lift the fuel that's going to take it.

01:02:38,082 --> 01:02:39,957
SPEAKER_1:  uh... you know into orbit and that's

01:02:39,957 --> 01:02:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  The Thing.

01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  specifically for rockets, you're just saying generally rocket engines but

01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:45,950
SPEAKER_0:  for the task of.

01:02:46,274 --> 01:02:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  going to orbit.

01:02:47,682 --> 01:02:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  You're fighting gravity, earth gravity.

01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  which is fundamentally different than moon gravity or Mars gravity.

01:02:55,266 --> 01:02:57,982
SPEAKER_0:  or like you said, traveling out to space earth.

01:02:58,242 --> 01:02:58,974
SPEAKER_0:  has a pretty.

01:02:59,458 --> 01:03:00,254
SPEAKER_0:  intense.

01:03:00,994 --> 01:03:02,014
SPEAKER_0:  gravity.AT health.

01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:09,694
SPEAKER_1:  to overcome. We're lucky. Because I think if it was 10% either way, like 10% harder, it'd be like, oh, we could still do it.

01:03:10,114 --> 01:03:13,854
SPEAKER_1:  You know, with our current technology, we'd still be able to get stuff into orbit, man.

01:03:14,114 --> 01:03:15,806
SPEAKER_1:  Things like reusability and.

01:03:16,226 --> 01:03:21,406
SPEAKER_1:  this commercialization, the success that we've seen in the last 10 years, we would just be on two thin margins, I think.

01:03:21,826 --> 01:03:24,094
SPEAKER_1:  10% easier and we would have been like.

01:03:24,418 --> 01:03:28,222
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, it's just like totally different. It's so much easier. It's like this big.

01:03:28,642 --> 01:03:31,454
SPEAKER_1:  you know, sliding scale and 10% in either direction we'd be.

01:03:31,842 --> 01:03:37,854
SPEAKER_1:  either screwed or really happy, you know, as far as getting into space. So it's just hard enough that it.

01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:41,150
SPEAKER_1:  things like fully reusable becomes very, very, very difficult.

01:03:41,698 --> 01:03:43,134
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's completely achievable.

01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:48,638
SPEAKER_1:  We have all the pieces to make it achievable. It does not disobey any laws of physics. It does not disobey any-

01:03:48,994 --> 01:03:52,094
SPEAKER_1:  There's no like hard stops, it's just very, very, very hard.

01:03:52,770 --> 01:04:01,438
SPEAKER_1:  And so ultimately, yeah, like on Earth for the first bit of launch again, when the rocket's pointing straight up and the engines are pointing straight down, the pointy end up flaming down.

01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:03,006
SPEAKER_1:  You're fighting gravity.

01:04:03,458 --> 01:04:07,006
SPEAKER_1:  And so that's kind of your biggest enemy outside of the Earth's atmosphere too.

01:04:07,330 --> 01:04:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  So what kind of sources of fuel is there?

01:04:11,106 --> 01:04:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  This is Chemical Rockets Liquisol-Gas Hybrid.

01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  uh... this electric so what

01:04:16,482 --> 01:04:22,686
SPEAKER_0:  what are the kinds of fuels we're talking about, what are oxidizers, what, can you just explain your shirt, I guess? hahaha

01:04:22,978 --> 01:04:24,103
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:04:24,103 --> 01:04:26,430
SPEAKER_1:  the components in the shirt.

01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:32,830
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, so really, I mean, fuels, it's, there's kind of two terms. Well, you'll generally hear the word propellant.

01:04:33,122 --> 01:04:37,534
SPEAKER_1:  being used as anything that is used to propel a spacecraft or used in a rocket engine.

01:04:37,986 --> 01:04:39,774
SPEAKER_1:  You can have a fuel.

01:04:40,354 --> 01:04:43,262
SPEAKER_1:  You have to have a fuel, you have to have an oxidizer, and you have to have a spark.

01:04:43,522 --> 01:04:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  to actually get those things burning.

01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:47,390
SPEAKER_1:  And that's just a general law of like.

01:04:48,066 --> 01:04:50,398
SPEAKER_1:  the universe. You have to have fuel and oxidizer and a spark.

01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:51,454
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:04:51,746 --> 01:04:52,926
SPEAKER_1:  Now some fuels will.

01:04:53,442 --> 01:04:56,414
SPEAKER_1:  by themselves spark like hypergolic fuels.

01:04:56,770 --> 01:04:59,678
SPEAKER_1:  but ultimately you're always left with some kind of fuel oxidizer in a spark.

01:05:00,098 --> 01:05:05,374
SPEAKER_1:  So the general ones used most often in rockets, liquid oxygen is kind of the king of...

01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:06,206
SPEAKER_1:  Well, there's...

01:05:06,466 --> 01:05:09,310
SPEAKER_1:  Better oxidizers, but they're extremely, extremely hard to work with.

01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:10,206
SPEAKER_1:  Like fluorine.

01:05:10,722 --> 01:05:11,198
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:05:11,618 --> 01:05:13,246
SPEAKER_1:  but generally liquid oxygen.

01:05:13,602 --> 01:05:18,270
SPEAKER_1:  So you just chill oxygen down to its liquid state minus 183 degrees Celsius.

01:05:18,754 --> 01:05:24,062
SPEAKER_1:  So it can be dense enough to store in tanks. You know, it's a thousand times more dense when it's in a liquid than it is.

01:05:24,514 --> 01:05:25,150
SPEAKER_1:  as a guest.

01:05:25,538 --> 01:05:27,838
SPEAKER_1:  RP1, which is basically kerosene.

01:05:28,322 --> 01:05:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  is a very common fuel.

01:05:31,426 --> 01:05:34,622
SPEAKER_1:  Another common fuel nowadays is methane, liquid methane.

01:05:35,202 --> 01:05:42,334
SPEAKER_1:  Liquid hydrogen is another, it's the most efficient potential for the most efficient since it's one of the lightest molecules.

01:05:42,434 --> 01:05:42,814
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:05:43,778 --> 01:05:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  Correct me if I'm wrong, but the...

01:05:45,794 --> 01:05:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  Falcon 9 uses kerosene.

01:05:48,098 --> 01:05:50,526
SPEAKER_0:  And then Starship uses methane.

01:05:50,626 --> 01:05:54,001
SPEAKER_1:  Yep. Liquid methane? Yep, for fuel. And they both use liquid oxygen for their oxidizer.

01:05:54,001 --> 01:05:55,166
SPEAKER_0:  oxidizer okay yep

01:05:55,778 --> 01:05:59,998
SPEAKER_1:  But then, you know, if you get into hypergolics, you'll normally have nitrogen tetroxide.

01:06:00,322 --> 01:06:03,262
SPEAKER_1:  which is your oxidizer and some form of hydrazine.

01:06:03,906 --> 01:06:04,670
SPEAKER_1:  for your fuel.

01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:05,918
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:06:06,434 --> 01:06:12,382
SPEAKER_1:  There's solid rocket propellants, like solid rocket boosters, and those are actually pre-mixed. Your oxidizer is inherently like.

01:06:12,866 --> 01:06:15,491
SPEAKER_1:  baked, literally like kind of baked into the sludge of.

01:06:15,491 --> 01:06:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  of

01:06:16,226 --> 01:06:18,750
SPEAKER_0:  So like for SpaceX it's all uh...

01:06:19,106 --> 01:06:23,006
SPEAKER_0:  chemical liquid fuels. Yep, yep. So how many solid?

01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:24,062
SPEAKER_0:  BASS

01:06:24,322 --> 01:06:27,697
SPEAKER_0:  are they still being used today? they're most rockets

01:06:27,697 --> 01:06:35,070
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, and the United States really is the only ones that, well, the only ones that I guess early on, because it was really just the Soviet Union versus the United States.

01:06:35,298 --> 01:06:37,694
SPEAKER_1:  The United States started to use solids pretty early on.

01:06:37,986 --> 01:06:41,662
SPEAKER_1:  They're simple and easy, but these days, like, you know, you'll still see them kind of as

01:06:42,242 --> 01:06:44,286
SPEAKER_1:  traditionally like boosters, like they're used.

01:06:44,674 --> 01:06:45,022
SPEAKER_0:  to.

01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:45,598
SPEAKER_0:  just.

01:06:45,954 --> 01:06:49,022
SPEAKER_1:  Help get something off the ground or help give it a little extra boost

01:06:49,474 --> 01:06:52,254
SPEAKER_1:  So the space shuttle famously had those two huge white.

01:06:52,578 --> 01:06:55,038
SPEAKER_1:  solid rocket boosters attached to the orange fuel tank.

01:06:55,298 --> 01:06:56,734
SPEAKER_1:  Those are solid rocket propellants.

01:06:57,090 --> 01:07:02,302
SPEAKER_1:  Things like the Atlas V can have up to five smaller solid rocket boosters.

01:07:02,594 --> 01:07:04,766
SPEAKER_1:  There's very few rockets that use a pure.

01:07:05,314 --> 01:07:09,374
SPEAKER_1:  at least these days that use a pure solid rocket motor for its first stage.

01:07:09,858 --> 01:07:14,782
SPEAKER_1:  There still are, especially in China, there's a lot of startup rocket companies that kind of use just missile technology.

01:07:15,106 --> 01:07:17,726
SPEAKER_1:  You know, there might use like a, there might just be a variant of an ICBM.

01:07:18,306 --> 01:07:21,086
SPEAKER_1:  Um, that just use solid rocket field. Cause it is very.

01:07:21,506 --> 01:07:24,414
SPEAKER_1:  relatively easy to develop, you know, model rockets use.

01:07:24,962 --> 01:07:26,750
SPEAKER_1:  solid rocket motors and stuff like that. After then.

01:07:27,458 --> 01:07:30,558
SPEAKER_1:  They're still around, but they're just not as elegant and not as a.

01:07:31,042 --> 01:07:33,214
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, not as as used these days.

01:07:33,346 --> 01:07:35,902
SPEAKER_0:  What are rocket engine cycles?

01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:40,478
SPEAKER_0:  I think getting more towards your shirt question. You have a really good video called.

01:07:41,186 --> 01:07:46,494
SPEAKER_0:  I mean a lot of your videos that are technical are just exceptionally well done.

01:07:47,426 --> 01:07:48,126
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah...

01:07:49,026 --> 01:07:54,718
SPEAKER_0:  You deserve all the props you get. I mean, thank you for doing this work. Really, really, really well done.

01:07:54,978 --> 01:07:58,718
SPEAKER_0:  So it's called rocket engine cycles. How do you power a rocket engine?

01:07:59,106 --> 01:08:02,334
SPEAKER_0:  and you go through all the different options. Is there something you could say about?

01:08:02,754 --> 01:08:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  open cycle, close cycle, full flow.

01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:09,854
SPEAKER_0:  all the different variants that you can use words to explain.

01:08:09,954 --> 01:08:11,829
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, without all the pretty pictures.

01:08:11,829 --> 01:08:12,579
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, without the pretty...

01:08:12,579 --> 01:08:16,670
SPEAKER_1:  pictures. So ultimately, you know, like we said, we your ultimate goals you want to get

01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:17,918
SPEAKER_1:  heat and pressure.

01:08:18,562 --> 01:08:19,454
SPEAKER_1:  into an engine.

01:08:19,874 --> 01:08:23,422
SPEAKER_1:  So obviously at some point you can either make really thick tanks of your rocket.

01:08:24,002 --> 01:08:24,638
SPEAKER_1:  You can like.

01:08:25,090 --> 01:08:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  get it so thick that you store the propellants in really, really high pressures.

01:08:28,578 --> 01:08:32,254
SPEAKER_1:  But obviously like that doesn't scale very well. At some point your rocket's so heavy you can't even-

01:08:32,514 --> 01:08:33,822
SPEAKER_1:  leave the ground or you know, it's just.

01:08:34,466 --> 01:08:37,086
SPEAKER_1:  so much of your mass is just literally the walls of the rocket. so

01:08:37,474 --> 01:08:39,806
SPEAKER_1:  At some point, people realize, hey, we could actually just pump.

01:08:40,386 --> 01:08:44,766
SPEAKER_1:  the fuels and the oxidizer into the engine at a high pressure and increase the pressure.

01:08:45,090 --> 01:08:45,598
SPEAKER_1:  through a pump.

01:08:46,178 --> 01:08:47,902
SPEAKER_1:  Obviously a pump is going to require energy.

01:08:48,226 --> 01:08:49,822
SPEAKER_1:  You have to get that energy from somewhere.

01:08:50,338 --> 01:08:53,054
SPEAKER_1:  And again, at some point people were like, well.

01:08:53,314 --> 01:08:53,982
SPEAKER_1:  Rock and serve.

01:08:54,658 --> 01:08:58,430
SPEAKER_1:  There's already rocket fuel here. You know, we'll just use some of the energy from the rocket fuel.

01:08:58,754 --> 01:08:59,518
SPEAKER_1:  spin these pumps.

01:09:00,226 --> 01:09:02,366
SPEAKER_1:  So that would be considered like open cycle.

01:09:02,818 --> 01:09:03,486
SPEAKER_1:  close cycle.

01:09:03,842 --> 01:09:06,270
SPEAKER_1:  full flow stage combustion cycles are ways to.

01:09:07,138 --> 01:09:08,030
SPEAKER_1:  Tap into the propellant.

01:09:08,290 --> 01:09:11,550
SPEAKER_1:  Actually on them there's tap off, expand or sec, I mean all of them kind of do the same thing.

01:09:11,906 --> 01:09:14,142
SPEAKER_1:  but you end up at some point spinning a turbine.

01:09:14,402 --> 01:09:15,934
SPEAKER_1:  a turbine.

01:09:16,258 --> 01:09:18,814
SPEAKER_1:  can take some of the heat energy and the.

01:09:19,074 --> 01:09:20,030
SPEAKER_1:  and the pressure.

01:09:20,674 --> 01:09:21,726
SPEAKER_1:  of an engine.

01:09:21,986 --> 01:09:22,846
SPEAKER_1:  and then they can...

01:09:23,074 --> 01:09:28,222
SPEAKER_1:  that can be connected to a shaft to pumps and those pumps can increase the pressure of the propellants.

01:09:29,122 --> 01:09:30,590
SPEAKER_1:  and force it into the combustion chamber.

01:09:31,202 --> 01:09:31,646
SPEAKER_1:  Now.

01:09:32,098 --> 01:09:33,406
SPEAKER_1:  The difference between open cycle...

01:09:33,986 --> 01:09:36,350
SPEAKER_1:  closed cycle full flow all those is what happens.

01:09:37,154 --> 01:09:38,782
SPEAKER_1:  after the gas has-

01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:41,374
SPEAKER_1:  flown through the turbine. So after you've used.

01:09:41,698 --> 01:09:44,446
SPEAKER_1:  the turbine and spun up the engine.

01:09:45,058 --> 01:09:47,326
SPEAKER_1:  What happens to that gas? So in an open cycle engine...

01:09:47,714 --> 01:09:49,886
SPEAKER_1:  You basically have like a separate small.

01:09:50,178 --> 01:09:52,926
SPEAKER_1:  rocket engine in a sense. It's a gas generator, they call it.

01:09:53,378 --> 01:09:54,654
SPEAKER_1:  and that will be used.

01:09:55,010 --> 01:10:03,870
SPEAKER_1:  to create some, you know, take a little, we'll say 10% of your propellant flowing to the engine. Instead you reroute it to like a smaller rocket engine called the gas generator.

01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:05,598
SPEAKER_1:  You point that at your turbine.

01:10:06,018 --> 01:10:09,886
SPEAKER_1:  and that will spin your turbine up to ridiculous speeds, 30,000 plus RPM.

01:10:10,498 --> 01:10:14,494
SPEAKER_1:  And then after it spins, it's wasted most of its energy.

01:10:14,946 --> 01:10:16,126
SPEAKER_1:  and it's just dumped overboard.

01:10:16,738 --> 01:10:22,206
SPEAKER_1:  That would be open cycle. You're not worrying about it after that point, but you are left with a lot of unburnt.

01:10:22,658 --> 01:10:23,838
SPEAKER_1:  you know, unused fuel.

01:10:24,258 --> 01:10:27,294
SPEAKER_1:  a good amount of that fuel is just completely, especially because the turbine.

01:10:27,586 --> 01:10:29,086
SPEAKER_1:  You have to keep it.

01:10:29,346 --> 01:10:29,950
SPEAKER_1:  from melting.

01:10:30,434 --> 01:10:32,126
SPEAKER_1:  So you can't run it at like optimal.

01:10:32,866 --> 01:10:33,470
SPEAKER_1:  ratios.

01:10:34,050 --> 01:10:37,022
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not necessarily stoichiometric and a rocket engine you actually don't want.

01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:40,702
SPEAKER_1:  it to be near stoichiometric where you releasing all the energy.

01:10:40,930 --> 01:10:42,270
SPEAKER_1:  You actually want to release.

01:10:42,818 --> 01:10:47,422
SPEAKER_1:  You actually want to be throwing out the lighter molecules so it can be shot out faster generally in the engine.

01:10:47,778 --> 01:10:51,614
SPEAKER_1:  So, but in order to have a turbine survive, you have to actually cool.

01:10:51,938 --> 01:10:53,598
SPEAKER_1:  You have to have the gas going through it.

01:10:54,178 --> 01:10:56,766
SPEAKER_1:  It can't be stupid stupid hotter, so you're just going to melt your turbine.

01:10:57,378 --> 01:11:01,342
SPEAKER_1:  So they normally, especially in the open cycle, just run it really fuel rich.

01:11:01,730 --> 01:11:04,382
SPEAKER_1:  So there's a lot of extra fuel being pumped into it.

01:11:04,962 --> 01:11:06,910
SPEAKER_1:  that will keep the temperatures at a reasonable.

01:11:07,682 --> 01:11:09,150
SPEAKER_1:  at a reasonable temperature.

01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:12,862
SPEAKER_1:  So you end up with this like dark, sooty smoke pouring out of that gas generator.

01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:15,742
SPEAKER_1:  That's just unburned fuel, just wasted fuel.

01:11:16,066 --> 01:11:21,534
SPEAKER_1:  and never got a chance to be used. Oh, interesting. You know, like in the combustion chamber, it's not being used to propel the rocket.

01:11:21,762 --> 01:11:22,910
SPEAKER_1:  You know, it's just being used.

01:11:23,138 --> 01:11:24,830
SPEAKER_1:  to cool down the repellent.

01:11:25,122 --> 01:11:29,950
SPEAKER_1:  that's being used to spin the turbine, that's being used to spin the pumps, to push a lot of propellant into the engine.

01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:31,166
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:11:32,066 --> 01:11:37,278
SPEAKER_1:  You know, it doesn't take too long before, you know, you're a greedy rocket scientist being like, look at all this wasted propellant.

01:11:37,666 --> 01:11:41,022
SPEAKER_1:  all this potential energy that's just literally being spewed out the side of the rocket.

01:11:41,762 --> 01:11:43,550
SPEAKER_1:  So that's where the close cycle comes in.

01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:47,070
SPEAKER_1:  So now we get to get that propellant, take it from basically.

01:11:47,746 --> 01:11:51,870
SPEAKER_1:  what was being wasted through the turbine, and you're going to try pumping it back into the engine.

01:11:52,482 --> 01:11:53,502
SPEAKER_1:  Now you don't literally.

01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:54,558
SPEAKER_1:  Just pump.

01:11:55,074 --> 01:11:55,454
SPEAKER_1:  that

01:11:55,682 --> 01:11:56,638
SPEAKER_1:  that gasset's

01:11:56,994 --> 01:12:00,990
SPEAKER_1:  you know, that hot, that gas into the engine is actually way too low of pressure

01:12:01,602 --> 01:12:03,102
SPEAKER_1:  compared to the main

01:12:03,362 --> 01:12:07,486
SPEAKER_1:  combustion chamber. By that point, by the time it's gone through the turbine, it's lost most of its pressure and heat.

01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:10,142
SPEAKER_1:  to the turbine. I tried pumping it into the engine.

01:12:10,498 --> 01:12:13,054
SPEAKER_1:  you know, just taking that pipe and sticking it right into the combustion chamber.

01:12:13,794 --> 01:12:16,798
SPEAKER_1:  and the much higher pressure, hotter combustion chamber would just go backwards.

01:12:17,218 --> 01:12:17,566
SPEAKER_1:  and a

01:12:17,794 --> 01:12:20,990
SPEAKER_1:  Right. Stall out the engine and blow up the engine and whatever. There you go.

01:12:21,538 --> 01:12:23,582
SPEAKER_1:  So what they actually do is they normally will send.

01:12:24,034 --> 01:12:28,478
SPEAKER_1:  There might be some variations of this, but the general concept is you actually flow all of your fuel.

01:12:28,738 --> 01:12:30,526
SPEAKER_1:  or all of your oxidizer.

01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:31,582
SPEAKER_1:  through the turbine.

01:12:32,482 --> 01:12:33,694
SPEAKER_1:  So that would be close cycle.

01:12:34,306 --> 01:12:37,214
SPEAKER_1:  So there's fuel rich closed cycle, which would be your flowing.

01:12:37,602 --> 01:12:39,326
SPEAKER_1:  all of the fuel through the turbine.

01:12:39,970 --> 01:12:40,990
SPEAKER_1:  Or there's oxidizer.

01:12:41,474 --> 01:12:45,214
SPEAKER_1:  close cycle, which is where you're flowing all of the oxidizer that's going into the engine through the turbine.

01:12:45,378 --> 01:12:45,726
SPEAKER_0:  Mm-hmm.

01:12:45,826 --> 01:12:46,590
SPEAKER_1:  Now the trick here...

01:12:47,266 --> 01:12:49,150
SPEAKER_1:  is you have to have that turbine.

01:12:49,666 --> 01:12:57,086
SPEAKER_1:  after it's done its work. So after it's taken some of the potential energy, some of the heat energy from, we're not calling it a pre-burner by the way, instead of it being a gas generator.

01:12:57,666 --> 01:12:59,646
SPEAKER_1:  you now call that device that's.

01:12:59,874 --> 01:13:00,734
SPEAKER_1:  creating pressure.

01:13:01,282 --> 01:13:04,830
SPEAKER_1:  to spin the turbine. You're now calling that a pre-burner because it's just going to pre-burn.

01:13:05,282 --> 01:13:06,846
SPEAKER_1:  some of your fuel or some of your oxidizer.

01:13:07,682 --> 01:13:12,638
SPEAKER_1:  The trick is that has to be by the time it's gone through the turbine, it has to be higher pressure.

01:13:13,474 --> 01:13:14,526
SPEAKER_1:  than the combustion chamber.

01:13:14,786 --> 01:13:16,766
SPEAKER_1:  because otherwise it's going to go backward still.

01:13:17,378 --> 01:13:20,606
SPEAKER_1:  So you really have to get that pre-burner up to ridiculously.

01:13:20,834 --> 01:13:21,662
SPEAKER_1:  high pressures.

01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:25,982
SPEAKER_1:  like at least 20% higher than your main combustion chamber. And these combustion chambers.

01:13:26,242 --> 01:13:27,422
SPEAKER_1:  No, we're talking about engines that are at.

01:13:27,938 --> 01:13:28,254
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:29,374
SPEAKER_1:  200

01:13:29,602 --> 01:13:35,326
SPEAKER_1:  100 to 200 even in SpaceX's Raptor engine up to 300 bar in the main combustion chamber. So that's

01:13:35,906 --> 01:13:38,590
SPEAKER_1:  What is that 4500 psi basically.

01:13:38,946 --> 01:13:44,254
SPEAKER_1:  insane amounts of pressure inside these combustion chambers. So your turbine has to be even above that or your.

01:13:44,642 --> 01:13:48,542
SPEAKER_1:  your gas generator or your pre-burner, sorry, has to be higher pressure than that even.

01:13:48,802 --> 01:13:51,326
SPEAKER_1:  in order to have the flow going the right direction through the engine.

01:13:52,098 --> 01:13:54,750
SPEAKER_1:  So now you'll have those closed cycles. Have a safe day, take care.

01:13:55,106 --> 01:13:56,958
SPEAKER_1:  fuel rich, you have oxidizer rich.

01:13:57,506 --> 01:14:01,950
SPEAKER_1:  The tricks now, you're starting to get, it's crazy. There's just so many compromises. Every little-

01:14:02,274 --> 01:14:05,086
SPEAKER_1:  decision you have of like, oh, I did this, now I, you know, I'll now.

01:14:05,666 --> 01:14:06,238
SPEAKER_1:  gonna do this.

01:14:06,626 --> 01:14:09,086
SPEAKER_1:  For instance, fuel rich if you ran kerosene.

01:14:09,666 --> 01:14:12,542
SPEAKER_1:  You know how I mentioned soot coming out of the gas generator.

01:14:13,154 --> 01:14:15,006
SPEAKER_1:  Well, if you run soot...

01:14:15,522 --> 01:14:15,966
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:14:16,962 --> 01:14:20,958
SPEAKER_1:  through your engine like that and how to go through your injectors, like back into the engine.

01:14:21,282 --> 01:14:26,654
SPEAKER_1:  It'll clog the pores of the injectors and it'll end up blowing up the engine. The soot itself is so damaging.

01:14:27,362 --> 01:14:30,791
SPEAKER_1:  that you can't really run a fuel rich kerosene engine.

01:14:30,791 --> 01:14:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  exactly is so it's like fuel somehow mixed up with the smoke like what

01:14:35,458 --> 01:14:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  I wonder what.

01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  What is it, chemically? Is this some weird...

01:14:39,202 --> 01:14:40,318
SPEAKER_1:  It's mostly just carbon.

01:14:40,898 --> 01:14:45,918
SPEAKER_1:  It's mostly just that carbon, solid chunks of carbon, and it can cake up.

01:14:46,338 --> 01:14:47,294
SPEAKER_1:  and just literally like.

01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:48,030
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:51,710
SPEAKER_1:  Like, it's like ash almost, you know, like.

01:14:51,938 --> 01:14:55,102
SPEAKER_1:  at some point, you know, especially under those high pressures and high temperatures.

01:14:55,682 --> 01:15:01,086
SPEAKER_1:  it can physically build up and turn into stalagmites and stalactites of carbon.

01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:02,334
SPEAKER_1:  Really hard.

01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:05,470
SPEAKER_1:  you know, forged in a rocket engine carbon.

01:15:05,922 --> 01:15:09,374
SPEAKER_0:  I wonder how you figure all that out too, is that to be experimented? Some of that has come-

01:15:09,634 --> 01:15:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  chemistry like theoretical but like you're gonna have to build the thing at scale.

01:15:13,794 --> 01:15:17,919
SPEAKER_0:  and actually test it and try on her. There's many decades.

01:15:17,919 --> 01:15:23,870
SPEAKER_1:  And many pieces of vengeance that you're trying to piece back together going like what the hell happened here? Yeah, what happened?

01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. OK, so that's close cycle. So how do we get to full flow?

01:15:28,674 --> 01:15:34,494
SPEAKER_1:  So in either of those situations, you're still actually just having the opposite. So if you're fuel rich, all the fuel is going through the turbine.

01:15:35,074 --> 01:15:38,206
SPEAKER_1:  but only a tiny bit of oxygen is actually being.

01:15:38,498 --> 01:15:40,606
SPEAKER_1:  put into that pre-burner to spin the pumps.

01:15:41,346 --> 01:15:44,702
SPEAKER_1:  and the rest of the oxygen is actually going through the pump.

01:15:45,026 --> 01:15:46,942
SPEAKER_1:  the primary pump and straight into the combustion chamber.

01:15:47,842 --> 01:15:51,326
SPEAKER_1:  Now full flow, the idea is you're going to actually pre-burn both your propellants.

01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:53,726
SPEAKER_1:  Both of your propellants are going to go through a preburner.

01:15:54,274 --> 01:15:55,742
SPEAKER_1:  and they're both going to end up spinning.

01:15:56,418 --> 01:15:57,150
SPEAKER_1:  One of the pumps.

01:15:57,730 --> 01:16:02,046
SPEAKER_1:  So you'll have a gas, a fuel rich pre-burner and you're going to have an oxygen rich pre-burner.

01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:04,094
SPEAKER_1:  Each one of those is going to.

01:16:04,738 --> 01:16:07,422
SPEAKER_1:  get just, you know, they're gonna heat it up just enough.

01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:09,566
SPEAKER_1:  and get it up to just enough pressure.

01:16:10,114 --> 01:16:13,790
SPEAKER_1:  to spin up that turbine as fast as they need to do to get the pumps up to the right pressure.

01:16:14,402 --> 01:16:18,366
SPEAKER_1:  and still have enough pressure through the turbine to overcome the pressure inside the main combustion chamber.

01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:24,926
SPEAKER_1:  and they're both going to arrive. Both your fuel and your oxidizer are going to arrive in the main combustion chamber as hot gas is already.

01:16:25,506 --> 01:16:27,390
SPEAKER_1:  So what was liquid oxygen is now.

01:16:27,650 --> 01:16:32,670
SPEAKER_1:  gaseous oxygen. What was liquid methane is now gaseous methane and they're meeting in this combustion chamber.

01:16:33,058 --> 01:16:40,766
SPEAKER_1:  at still ridiculously high pressures again. And for SpaceX's Raptor engine, they're meeting at 300 bar.

01:16:41,282 --> 01:16:42,846
SPEAKER_1:  insane amounts of pressure.

01:16:43,330 --> 01:16:47,614
SPEAKER_1:  and then they combust from there on because they're already a gas-gas interaction.

01:16:47,874 --> 01:16:49,886
SPEAKER_1:  They're happy to burn, they're ready to.

01:16:50,306 --> 01:16:55,166
SPEAKER_1:  They're ready to burn, they're ready to mingle, as opposed to having a gas-liquid interaction, which is what's a lot more normal.

01:16:55,682 --> 01:17:00,766
SPEAKER_1:  you'll have two different states of matter and they just might not, they might take a little more coaxing to-

01:17:01,122 --> 01:17:01,534
SPEAKER_1:  What's that word?

01:17:02,786 --> 01:17:03,102
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:17:04,226 --> 01:17:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  Coaxing coaxing that doesn't sound like a song correct. Right coaxing coaxing. Yeah. Yeah

01:17:10,818 --> 01:17:11,582
SPEAKER_0:  Alright. I don't know.

01:17:12,034 --> 01:17:13,909
SPEAKER_1:  We'll cut that in post.

01:17:13,909 --> 01:17:15,409
SPEAKER_0:  We'll have Morgan Freeman.

01:17:15,409 --> 01:17:17,982
SPEAKER_1:  over double. Yeah, over double. Right on.

01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:23,747
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, the fascinating thing is their coats as gases.

01:17:23,747 --> 01:17:27,870
SPEAKER_1:  combustion chamber. Look at that word. But yeah, they just take a little bit more.

01:17:28,354 --> 01:17:30,846
SPEAKER_1:  It takes more time in the combustion chamber to have.

01:17:31,266 --> 01:17:37,553
SPEAKER_1:  liquid gas interaction like mix together and and we unleash as much of their energy as you can before it exits the system or some

01:17:37,553 --> 01:17:44,222
SPEAKER_0:  the trade-offs here in terms of efficiency, which is most efficient and then also complexity of the design and the engineering.

01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  and the cost of the design and the engineering. Like what are the different trade-offs between open cycle, closed cycle and full flow?

01:17:50,146 --> 01:17:51,806
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's a pretty, it's kind of like a.

01:17:52,674 --> 01:17:53,918
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, what's the-

01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:56,990
SPEAKER_1:  the bears, the Goldilocks, you know, like it's like.

01:17:57,282 --> 01:17:58,878
SPEAKER_1:  You kind of generally

01:17:59,202 --> 01:18:00,414
SPEAKER_1:  The easiest is open cycle.

01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:03,838
SPEAKER_1:  because you're just expelling the exhaust gas.

01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:08,350
SPEAKER_1:  the gas generator exhaust. You're not having to worry about it. You just spin up that thing as much as you need.

01:18:08,738 --> 01:18:10,494
SPEAKER_1:  and deal with it, right? No big deal.

01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:12,350
SPEAKER_1:  Um, close cycles.

01:18:12,578 --> 01:18:18,014
SPEAKER_1:  offers 10 to 15% greater performance generally because you're not wasting that propellant.

01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:23,198
SPEAKER_1:  And but it's it's complicated. It's a lot more complicated, especially if you're doing oxygen rich. Now you're having

01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:25,150
SPEAKER_1:  Cassius Oxygen.

01:18:26,018 --> 01:18:29,182
SPEAKER_1:  in your engine, which just generally wants to react with everything.

01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:31,070
SPEAKER_1:  It's just a recipe like hot.

01:18:31,682 --> 01:18:33,438
SPEAKER_1:  Oxygen is just a recipe for-

01:18:33,730 --> 01:18:35,998
SPEAKER_1:  things to catch on fire that shouldn't be on fire.

01:18:36,642 --> 01:18:40,350
SPEAKER_1:  So metals, you know, under those conditions, supports have been out there for a while.

01:18:40,898 --> 01:18:42,238
SPEAKER_1:  spontaneously start burning.

01:18:42,658 --> 01:18:53,342
SPEAKER_1:  You'll actually turn your metal and it will now become fuel. You'll be engine rich before you know it because your hot oxygen is beating and using that engine as fuel basically.

01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:54,142
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:18:54,466 --> 01:19:00,446
SPEAKER_1:  Oxygen rich is generally very hard, but that is what the Soviet Union ended up doing with almost their entire line of engines was.

01:19:00,706 --> 01:19:01,886
SPEAKER_1:  close cycle oxygen rich.

01:19:02,754 --> 01:19:04,030
SPEAKER_1:  But you know, so those two are kind of.

01:19:04,322 --> 01:19:04,894
SPEAKER_1:  Generally.

01:19:05,122 --> 01:19:05,662
SPEAKER_1:  hard but

01:19:05,890 --> 01:19:06,366
SPEAKER_1:  Offer.

01:19:06,978 --> 01:19:14,174
SPEAKER_1:  performance benefits over open cycle. But at the end of the day, you know, full flow is by far the it's the ultimate of all of them. It's the most difficult.

01:19:14,754 --> 01:19:17,278
SPEAKER_1:  but it also has the most potential to be the most efficient.

01:19:17,730 --> 01:19:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  Starship, the Raptor 2, why is that engine using full flow?

01:19:22,018 --> 01:19:29,246
SPEAKER_1:  because it's the best. I mean, it's just physics-wise, if you're trying to extract as much energy out of your propellants, there just isn't another cycle type that...

01:19:29,762 --> 01:19:35,070
SPEAKER_1:  that is better than it but of course it's very very hard to develop you know so far to date

01:19:35,554 --> 01:19:37,502
SPEAKER_1:  The RD-270 in the 60s was built.

01:19:38,146 --> 01:19:44,318
SPEAKER_1:  There is a powerhead demonstrator built in the United States in the 90s and early 2000s, I think, maybe just the early 2000s.

01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:47,166
SPEAKER_1:  that was just the power, just the.

01:19:47,394 --> 01:19:50,814
SPEAKER_1:  the pumps and the turbines and the pre-burners. No chamber, no nothing.

01:19:51,266 --> 01:19:55,518
SPEAKER_1:  That was a big deal. Only the United States took millions of dollars to just develop that.

01:19:55,906 --> 01:19:57,214
SPEAKER_1:  And then there's SpaceX's Raptor engine.

01:19:57,666 --> 01:19:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  So you talked about the combustion chamber.

01:20:00,034 --> 01:20:03,102
SPEAKER_0:  how damn hot things get high pressure.

01:20:04,898 --> 01:20:09,278
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of heat. How do you keep the thing cool? You have a great video on this? collapse applying heat to bones.

01:20:09,506 --> 01:20:11,646
SPEAKER_0:  How do you get it from, from...

01:20:12,130 --> 01:20:12,990
SPEAKER_0:  Probably call it M-

01:20:13,762 --> 01:20:14,718
SPEAKER_0:  Metal rich.

01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:17,475
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know why he is laughing though.

01:20:17,475 --> 01:20:20,062
SPEAKER_0:  from like the metal from melting.

01:20:20,610 --> 01:20:25,502
SPEAKER_1:  Well, one of the ways is to let it be engine rich. It was actually, you can use a blade of cooling. You can literally let...

01:20:25,922 --> 01:20:31,646
SPEAKER_1:  Make the walls thicker than you normally make it. Make it out of a material that will ablate away, that will kind of chip away and take some of the heat away with it.

01:20:32,194 --> 01:20:33,406
SPEAKER_1:  Very, again, primitive.

01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:38,398
SPEAKER_1:  And it's actually what SpaceX first used on their first Merlin engines, they used a blade of cooling.

01:20:38,978 --> 01:20:40,542
SPEAKER_1:  So it's basically a carbon nozzle.

01:20:40,994 --> 01:20:41,950
SPEAKER_1:  and you just let it.

01:20:42,466 --> 01:20:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  the inner layer of the engine was carbon, and you just let it get...

01:20:47,554 --> 01:20:50,974
SPEAKER_1:  chewed away and eaten away and that's just something you factor in.

01:20:51,394 --> 01:20:52,094
SPEAKER_1:  It's not

01:20:52,354 --> 01:20:53,406
SPEAKER_1:  uh, very

01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:56,382
SPEAKER_1:  elegant and it's definitely not reusable.

01:20:56,610 --> 01:20:57,735
SPEAKER_1:  In that sense, so this.

01:20:57,735 --> 01:20:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  Probably really good models.

01:21:00,002 --> 01:21:04,158
SPEAKER_0:  about like how it melts away, the rate at which it melts away to know what thickness.

01:21:04,738 --> 01:21:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. That's a dangerous.

01:21:07,298 --> 01:21:09,662
SPEAKER_1:  I just think the question seems so silly.

01:21:09,954 --> 01:21:17,854
SPEAKER_1:  So obviously you probably, you know, again, it's not the most elegant. The problem too, your geometry physically is changing too, as you're eroding the walls.

01:21:18,274 --> 01:21:27,358
SPEAKER_1:  Now things like your expansion ratio or the ratio between your throat and the nozzle exit is changing because the thickness, like the throat's diameter is actually, like everything's changing. So.

01:21:27,778 --> 01:21:28,903
SPEAKER_1:  It's not great.

01:21:28,903 --> 01:21:36,958
SPEAKER_0:  It might not be melting away uniformly. There could be some like weird pockets for aerodynamics. A bunch of chaos just can...

01:21:37,218 --> 01:21:38,782
SPEAKER_1:  I can't imagine having to like...

01:21:39,138 --> 01:21:40,990
SPEAKER_1:  Figure all that stuff out, honestly. Who were you before you started if you think you can complete Déjà Vu?

01:21:41,346 --> 01:21:49,566
SPEAKER_1:  So the more elegant thing to do, there's a couple other things you can do, but kind of the most common one, especially when we're dealing with liquid-fueled rockets.

01:21:49,954 --> 01:21:51,582
SPEAKER_1:  is something called regeneratively cool.

01:21:52,226 --> 01:21:56,030
SPEAKER_1:  And the idea is you basically just flow fuel or oxidizer.

01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:59,358
SPEAKER_1:  through the walls of the nozzle in the chamber.

01:21:59,938 --> 01:22:04,990
SPEAKER_1:  before they go through like into the injector into the actual combustion chamber.

01:22:05,346 --> 01:22:06,718
SPEAKER_1:  By doing that, your.

01:22:06,946 --> 01:22:11,006
SPEAKER_1:  you're taking heat out of the metal of the walls.

01:22:11,298 --> 01:22:17,662
SPEAKER_1:  and you're putting it into the propellant. So you're typically heating the propellant up, which is, remember when I said there's a gas interaction versus a liquid, like.

01:22:17,954 --> 01:22:20,542
SPEAKER_1:  liquid gas lots of times, even if you pump them both at.

01:22:20,994 --> 01:22:22,206
SPEAKER_1:  you know, as...

01:22:22,658 --> 01:22:24,638
SPEAKER_1:  They, you know, are both being pumped as liquids.

01:22:25,058 --> 01:22:29,278
SPEAKER_1:  By the time it goes through the walls of the chamber, lots of times one of them is phase changed into a gas.

01:22:29,538 --> 01:22:31,454
SPEAKER_1:  So now you do have that gas liquid interaction.

01:22:31,970 --> 01:22:33,342
SPEAKER_1:  That's because they're using that.

01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:36,862
SPEAKER_1:  the fuel or the oxidizer to cool the walls of the engine.

01:22:37,282 --> 01:22:39,902
SPEAKER_1:  So when you look at a rocket engine, although it looks like, you know, a nice.

01:22:40,642 --> 01:22:43,550
SPEAKER_1:  beautifully uniform cylinder, you know, smooth thing.

01:22:43,842 --> 01:22:44,542
SPEAKER_1:  There's

01:22:44,770 --> 01:22:46,238
SPEAKER_1:  Either there's sometimes like a.

01:22:46,946 --> 01:22:47,582
SPEAKER_1:  channels.

01:22:47,810 --> 01:22:49,630
SPEAKER_1:  actually like milled into the walls.

01:22:49,922 --> 01:22:57,502
SPEAKER_1:  that they run fuel through. And even though they're tight, they can be like two, three millimeters thick, they'll actually still have a channel that goes down and U-turns and comes around and comes back.

01:22:58,178 --> 01:23:00,702
SPEAKER_1:  all the way down to the tip of the nozzle and everything. So it's.

01:23:00,962 --> 01:23:02,087
SPEAKER_1:  Just insane, you know the-

01:23:02,087 --> 01:23:05,118
SPEAKER_0:  Isn't that pre-designed and that's like...

01:23:05,410 --> 01:23:05,822
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

01:23:06,178 --> 01:23:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  So they design those channels. Yeah.

01:23:08,418 --> 01:23:11,239
SPEAKER_0:  There's probably some optimization there, like how the flow happens.

01:23:11,239 --> 01:23:16,158
SPEAKER_1:  Well, especially because you're thinking about a conical thing or like a semi-conical thing where the

01:23:16,578 --> 01:23:20,766
SPEAKER_1:  Areas getting smaller and smaller and smaller, or flowing the same amount of propellant through it?

01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:23,678
SPEAKER_1:  as you are down. You know what I mean? Propellant has to.

01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:27,262
SPEAKER_1:  They have all these unique things like, you know, sometimes different.

01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:31,102
SPEAKER_1:  manifolds where they'll inject more or less fuel in certain areas and

01:23:31,426 --> 01:23:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  There must be like propellant simulation software.

01:23:34,658 --> 01:23:36,254
SPEAKER_0:  Cause they can't, surely can't like.

01:23:37,058 --> 01:23:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  test this on actual physical.

01:23:40,002 --> 01:23:41,662
SPEAKER_1:  Well, back in the day, they had to just build it.

01:23:42,114 --> 01:23:43,239
SPEAKER_1:  What do you mean back?

01:23:43,239 --> 01:23:49,342
SPEAKER_0:  in the day, walked uphill in both ways. It was like, I mean.

01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  like anything back in the day before computers.

01:23:53,666 --> 01:23:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  Will you like head like.

01:23:55,554 --> 01:23:56,222
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah

01:23:56,770 --> 01:23:58,645
SPEAKER_1:  I just had to do it. And they're like, you're.

01:23:58,645 --> 01:24:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  Simulation or modeling was like a sheet of paper where you're like calculating stuff.

01:24:02,434 --> 01:24:09,758
SPEAKER_1:  Well, but you can heat flux, you know, like you can literally see how much energy and how much heat is inside the combustion chamber, how much

01:24:10,402 --> 01:24:16,222
SPEAKER_1:  You know, and that is a measurable thing even without a computer. Now I'm not near smart enough to do any of this. Like I've never tried.

01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:23,774
SPEAKER_1:  measuring the heat flux of anything. I barely even know what that means. I'm just smart enough to regurgitate it. You haven't lived, my friend. You haven't lived.

01:24:24,098 --> 01:24:29,918
SPEAKER_1:  But that is something that people would calculate and they find out, okay, copper, you know, does a better job of transferring the heat.

01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:33,790
SPEAKER_1:  between the walls of it and into the propellant, blah blah blah blah blah compared to XYZ.

01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:35,326
SPEAKER_1:  So...

01:24:35,554 --> 01:24:36,679
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, you know.

01:24:36,679 --> 01:24:38,782
SPEAKER_0:  materials people. I've met

01:24:39,170 --> 01:24:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  just in all walks of life, especially just through MIT, through everywhere.

01:24:44,002 --> 01:24:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  Where's some people?

01:24:46,178 --> 01:24:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  are just like...

01:24:47,714 --> 01:24:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  100x

01:24:49,442 --> 01:24:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  smarter than anyone you've ever met at a particular thing.

01:24:53,858 --> 01:24:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  Like you mentioned copper, they'll know the heat dissipation through different materials. So I understand that like.

01:24:59,810 --> 01:25:03,935
SPEAKER_0:  more than it's like holy shit it's possible for human beings to deeply

01:25:03,935 --> 01:25:06,334
SPEAKER_1:  understand a thing. Dude, aerospace is.

01:25:06,658 --> 01:25:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  full of that. People that are so.

01:25:09,634 --> 01:25:11,038
SPEAKER_1:  niche in some.

01:25:11,426 --> 01:25:16,510
SPEAKER_1:  that no other person has ever even remotely thought of. Yet this person has done it.

01:25:16,930 --> 01:25:26,814
SPEAKER_1:  40,000 different ways in an environment being like, well, we found out that if we turn it four degrees that way and add 4% niobium, you know, like just things you're like.

01:25:27,618 --> 01:25:30,993
SPEAKER_1:  What is your life and how do you know this?

01:25:30,993 --> 01:25:34,238
SPEAKER_0:  If I anything about them, they usually don't think it's a big deal.

01:25:34,914 --> 01:25:39,550
SPEAKER_0:  They're usually like, they're so notch-a-lon about it that if you don't actually...

01:25:39,906 --> 01:25:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  You have to know enough.

01:25:42,050 --> 01:25:44,254
SPEAKER_0:  You actually have to know quite a lot to appreciate.

01:25:45,378 --> 01:25:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  how much more they know.

01:25:46,818 --> 01:25:49,918
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, because otherwise you won't even notice it because they're popular.

01:25:50,178 --> 01:25:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  Culture doesn't celebrate the intricacies of.

01:25:53,602 --> 01:25:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  uh... scientific or engineering mastery

01:25:56,514 --> 01:26:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  which is interesting. There's all these people that lurk in the shadows. They're just geniuses. Like you see, you have like the LeBron's.

01:26:03,842 --> 01:26:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  like good at basketball, so we understand that they're good at basketball. They do this thing with the ball and the hoop, and they do it really well, better than a lot of other people under pressure.

01:26:12,322 --> 01:26:16,447
SPEAKER_1:  Like we celebrate. It's a big public spectacle. Yeah. Look how great they are. Yeah.

01:26:16,447 --> 01:26:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  the people like, yeah, at these aerospace companies and NASA SpaceX

01:26:22,146 --> 01:26:27,358
SPEAKER_0:  the kind of stuff they're doing. I mean, there's geniuses there. It's actually really inspiring.

01:26:27,842 --> 01:26:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:26:28,642 --> 01:26:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  I've interacted with a lot of brilliant people in the software world.

01:26:32,386 --> 01:26:34,398
SPEAKER_0:  And maybe because I don't deeply understand.

01:26:34,818 --> 01:26:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  a lot of hardware stuff, materials engineering, mechanical engineering.

01:26:38,882 --> 01:26:40,862
SPEAKER_0:  Those people seem like so much smarter.

01:26:41,442 --> 01:26:44,798
SPEAKER_0:  It's always like the grass is green or whatever the expression is. But

01:26:45,442 --> 01:26:50,782
SPEAKER_0:  There is a depth of understanding that engineers have that do like mechanical engineering.

01:26:51,138 --> 01:26:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  that's just awe-inspiring.

01:26:52,866 --> 01:26:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  to me.

01:26:54,306 --> 01:26:55,390
SPEAKER_1:  Not to get too like.

01:26:55,746 --> 01:26:56,318
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:26:56,674 --> 01:27:06,334
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know what the word would be, introverted or something or whatever, but that's actually kind of the whole point of Everyday Astronaut. That's almost the whole point of what I do each year. From the beginning, I-

01:27:06,690 --> 01:27:09,726
SPEAKER_1:  did a thing called the Astro Awards, trying to be like an award show.

01:27:10,306 --> 01:27:18,302
SPEAKER_1:  hoping to lift up and celebrate and shine a spotlight on the people that are actually doing the hard work and try to treat them like the rock stars that they are that we

01:27:18,882 --> 01:27:21,310
SPEAKER_1:  don't know about. I think that's one of the things that for sure I think-

01:27:22,178 --> 01:27:24,062
SPEAKER_1:  I think Elon definitely helped make.

01:27:24,482 --> 01:27:25,150
SPEAKER_1:  Space Fight Cool.

01:27:25,666 --> 01:27:28,606
SPEAKER_1:  helped make that like a celebration thing where people are

01:27:29,058 --> 01:27:32,894
SPEAKER_1:  physically out cheering for rockets and science and space exploration.

01:27:33,346 --> 01:27:36,958
SPEAKER_1:  But I think that's just the beginning you know I think like this should be a thing where.

01:27:37,186 --> 01:27:38,110
SPEAKER_1:  the general public.

01:27:38,530 --> 01:27:48,350
SPEAKER_1:  uh looks to these people as as the coolest ones as the coolest places to work as the most important things you know sports are great and everything a big formula one fan and things like that but.

01:27:48,898 --> 01:27:50,334
SPEAKER_1:  You know, at the same time, like.

01:27:50,978 --> 01:27:52,638
SPEAKER_1:  We should be celebrating the people.

01:27:52,866 --> 01:28:00,510
SPEAKER_1:  doing this crazy work, clocking in countless hours, just trying to figure out this one little thing that's gonna help us further our understanding. I mean, what's cooler than a-

01:28:00,610 --> 01:28:01,790
SPEAKER_0:  giant thing.

01:28:02,370 --> 01:28:03,742
SPEAKER_0:  with a really hot-

01:28:04,002 --> 01:28:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  FIRE!

01:28:04,770 --> 01:28:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  that goes boom and goes up into the air. I mean, like, there's no-

01:28:09,954 --> 01:28:17,694
SPEAKER_0:  It's like to me, like bridges are inspiring. It's like incredible architecture design and like the humans are able to.

01:28:18,114 --> 01:28:18,878
SPEAKER_0:  work

01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  against nature build these gigantic metal things but like rockets.

01:28:24,482 --> 01:28:26,814
SPEAKER_0:  with like a tiny little humans on top of them.

01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, flying out into space is sick. It's the coolest possible thing. Everything comes together. All the different disciplines come together for the high stakes drama of.

01:28:37,474 --> 01:28:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  you know, riding that super powerful thing up.

01:28:41,186 --> 01:28:46,061
SPEAKER_0:  away from the thing we call home Earth. That is so amazing. Exactly, so freaking.

01:28:46,061 --> 01:28:53,022
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I think that's kind of part of my story arc is I just used to be a huge car and motorcycle guy. So I think he's a great guy because especially after traveling like soft rough roads, I just

01:28:53,602 --> 01:28:55,358
SPEAKER_1:  You know, things that go fast and you know.

01:28:56,258 --> 01:28:57,502
SPEAKER_1:  loud and go fast and.

01:28:57,762 --> 01:29:01,022
SPEAKER_1:  make lots of power. And at the end of the day, like at some point you realize

01:29:01,634 --> 01:29:05,534
SPEAKER_1:  Nothing goes faster and it's louder and makes more power in the rocket. You know, I think that's...

01:29:05,826 --> 01:29:10,750
SPEAKER_1:  I think that's kind of where I eventually just ended up, you know, wound up there just because there is nothing cooler than that.

01:29:11,330 --> 01:29:13,955
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, that's the ultimate level of reach as a car guy is.

01:29:13,955 --> 01:29:21,758
SPEAKER_1:  become a rocket guy. Yeah, 100%. And at some point, some car guys literally become rocket guys and strap rockets to cars and try and break land speed records, you know? Yep.

01:29:22,242 --> 01:29:24,830
SPEAKER_1:  It's the same universe here, and yeah.

01:29:25,346 --> 01:29:31,870
SPEAKER_0:  So Elon, with your conversation with him on the Raptor 2, what's talking about, you were talking about...

01:29:32,194 --> 01:29:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  Like there's an excessive amount of cooling to be on the safe side as you're developing the engine. What kind of cooling was that?

01:29:38,562 --> 01:29:44,670
SPEAKER_1:  So that would be film cooling. So remember how a little bit ago we were talking about keeping the turbine from melting? You can just run it.

01:29:44,994 --> 01:29:47,134
SPEAKER_1:  off of like off nominal basically off.

01:29:47,682 --> 01:29:51,486
SPEAKER_1:  You know, typically fuel rich, just run more fuel through that so it's cool enough.

01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:57,310
SPEAKER_1:  You can actually do that locally kind of in your engine. So you can keep it so, you know, imagine a combustion chamber.

01:29:57,890 --> 01:30:01,118
SPEAKER_1:  and the top of it's just a flat, like imagine a shower head.

01:30:01,442 --> 01:30:04,094
SPEAKER_1:  and then you have like, you know, the combustion chamber attached to it.

01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:10,590
SPEAKER_1:  the outer perimeter there, the part where the flame front would be touching the walls, you can actually have just more fuel injectors.

01:30:10,978 --> 01:30:13,758
SPEAKER_1:  So you're injecting locally a more fuel rich.

01:30:14,178 --> 01:30:16,446
SPEAKER_1:  zone along the entire nozzle.

01:30:16,962 --> 01:30:18,270
SPEAKER_1:  and that would be called film cooling.

01:30:18,722 --> 01:30:23,166
SPEAKER_1:  So it's less efficient though. Again, you're kind of wasting fuel. There's fuel that's running.

01:30:23,554 --> 01:30:25,758
SPEAKER_1:  you know, and your mixture ratio is off.

01:30:26,178 --> 01:30:32,638
SPEAKER_1:  but only for a little portion of the big picture. So that's one of those compromises. You can do additional film cooling.

01:30:33,026 --> 01:30:34,654
SPEAKER_1:  to make sure you're not melting your engine.

01:30:35,106 --> 01:30:37,502
SPEAKER_1:  uh... you know but at the cost of performance usually

01:30:37,986 --> 01:30:42,430
SPEAKER_1:  But you can also be smart and use film cooling. You know, there's fun little clever tricks.

01:30:42,754 --> 01:30:47,518
SPEAKER_1:  For instance, you'll notice on the F1 engine that was on the Saturn V.

01:30:47,842 --> 01:30:50,430
SPEAKER_1:  the biggest rocket that had been built.

01:30:50,754 --> 01:30:52,542
SPEAKER_1:  to date prior now to Starship.

01:30:53,026 --> 01:30:53,374
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:30:54,146 --> 01:30:57,630
SPEAKER_1:  The F1 has this huge, huge, huge engines. There's five of them.

01:30:58,082 --> 01:30:59,358
SPEAKER_1:  on the Saturn V and

01:30:59,938 --> 01:31:03,870
SPEAKER_1:  you'll notice that like the gas generator has a pipe that comes down.

01:31:04,354 --> 01:31:08,286
SPEAKER_1:  and then it actually splits off in a manifold and wraps around part of the nozzle.

01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:10,142
SPEAKER_1:  And that manifold.

01:31:10,946 --> 01:31:13,918
SPEAKER_1:  takes the hot gas from the turbine.

01:31:14,178 --> 01:31:16,158
SPEAKER_1:  Which is actually, I mean, it's not hot.

01:31:16,642 --> 01:31:18,846
SPEAKER_1:  It's actually cold gas compared to the combustion chamber.

01:31:19,170 --> 01:31:23,230
SPEAKER_1:  But it's, you know, in human terms, it's still, you wouldn't want to put your hand in it, not live.

01:31:23,586 --> 01:31:26,622
SPEAKER_1:  Um, and it actually pipes that gas.

01:31:26,978 --> 01:31:30,590
SPEAKER_1:  into the nozzle so that it creates a film cooling, an actual

01:31:30,882 --> 01:31:31,678
SPEAKER_1:  Boundary Layer.

01:31:32,066 --> 01:31:35,550
SPEAKER_1:  of cooler gas against the hotter combustion chamber gas.

01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:37,406
SPEAKER_1:  So basically repurposing.

01:31:37,794 --> 01:31:40,766
SPEAKER_1:  that gas that was normally wasted and they pump it back into the engine.

01:31:41,282 --> 01:31:45,534
SPEAKER_1:  and then into the nozzle like kind of further down. So the trick there is it has to be.

01:31:46,114 --> 01:31:47,646
SPEAKER_1:  far enough down that the pressure.

01:31:48,130 --> 01:31:51,998
SPEAKER_1:  at the, in the nozzle, because remember, as the nozzle gets bigger and bigger and bigger, the pressure's getting lower and lower.

01:31:52,322 --> 01:31:55,614
SPEAKER_1:  and the temperature's getting lower and lower. So you have to find this trade-off point where...

01:31:56,098 --> 01:31:57,086
SPEAKER_1:  The pressure is.

01:31:57,602 --> 01:32:02,590
SPEAKER_1:  is lower than that gas from the turbine and then you pump it in

01:32:02,818 --> 01:32:05,726
SPEAKER_1:  and it's cooler than the gas still is in the nozzle.

01:32:06,050 --> 01:32:11,614
SPEAKER_1:  and it can help not melt your nozzle. So you'll notice that the F1 is actually a good example of regen cooling. So that OK.

01:32:11,842 --> 01:32:14,462
SPEAKER_1:  walls you can physically see the pipes actually.

01:32:14,882 --> 01:32:18,526
SPEAKER_1:  on the F1 because it's so big and they just literally used pipes and bent them and

01:32:18,914 --> 01:32:23,582
SPEAKER_1:  You can see the coolant channels all the way up and down the engine until you get to that manifold.

01:32:24,034 --> 01:32:25,630
SPEAKER_1:  Then from there on, it just has...

01:32:25,858 --> 01:32:31,998
SPEAKER_1:  what's called a nozzle extension, and it keeps going and going and going, and that section of nozzle is cooled by the film cooling.

01:32:32,226 --> 01:32:33,118
SPEAKER_1:  of the gas generator.

01:32:34,082 --> 01:32:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, the aerodynamics of.

01:32:36,674 --> 01:32:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  Cooler gas and the hot gas.

01:32:40,290 --> 01:32:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  because you have to have this kind of

01:32:42,434 --> 01:32:46,654
SPEAKER_0:  layer, right? To protect a layer of cool, like understanding that.

01:32:47,010 --> 01:32:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  now this is probably has to do a modern times this probably really dissimilar sed animated

01:32:52,514 --> 01:32:55,102
SPEAKER_0:  and to do that in terms of pressure too, like.

01:32:55,842 --> 01:32:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  to make sure it's in the right place. Yeah, that doesn't-

01:32:58,402 --> 01:33:01,310
SPEAKER_1:  Like, go back up. Go backwards, exactly. If they have that manifold.

01:33:01,794 --> 01:33:03,390
SPEAKER_1:  Even six inches too high.

01:33:03,618 --> 01:33:04,350
SPEAKER_1:  on that nozzle.

01:33:04,706 --> 01:33:06,910
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's just gonna go upwards, you know?

01:33:07,330 --> 01:33:09,205
SPEAKER_1:  Pressure always wants to flow from high to low.

01:33:09,205 --> 01:33:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  the number of options you have here that result in it going boom.

01:33:13,698 --> 01:33:19,870
SPEAKER_0:  is very large. Near infinity, yeah. Especially because, I mean, you can't do like a small model of it.

01:33:20,162 --> 01:33:27,230
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe you can. No, you can't. You really scale very well. No, you have to do the full testing. And that's why you have all the kind of.

01:33:27,586 --> 01:33:28,030
SPEAKER_0:  That's.

01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:32,126
SPEAKER_0:  That's why you have with Starship all the tests that you know.

01:33:32,962 --> 01:33:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  You think why would you?

01:33:34,402 --> 01:33:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  Need to do so many static fires and so many tests and why is it failing so many times? Can't you get it right?

01:33:39,714 --> 01:33:42,339
SPEAKER_0:  but like it's very tough to get it right. MUFFLED

01:33:42,339 --> 01:33:45,086
SPEAKER_1:  And when you're pushing the boundaries, you want to know.

01:33:45,378 --> 01:33:48,574
SPEAKER_1:  where and how it's going to fail. That's right. So that's.

01:33:48,930 --> 01:33:57,214
SPEAKER_1:  That's a luxury that SpaceX does have with the scale of Raptor. You know, they're building Raptor cheaper than probably almost any other engine, you know, maybe besides some of their own, at least at that scale.

01:33:57,890 --> 01:34:02,846
SPEAKER_1:  Um, then before they're testing, you know, I think since last March or last April.

01:34:03,170 --> 01:34:08,638
SPEAKER_1:  They've tested a thousand Raptors, you know, a thousand engine fires, I guess, not just Raptors, but...

01:34:09,154 --> 01:34:11,646
SPEAKER_1:  You know, that's just an insane amount of data.

01:34:11,970 --> 01:34:18,622
SPEAKER_1:  and an insane amount of edge cases to learn, oh my God, we found out that we were actually slightly overspinning our turbine at this degree and this frequency.

01:34:18,978 --> 01:34:25,182
SPEAKER_1:  as harmonic at this blah blah blah and all of a sudden you realize it's rattling and you know it did this and then you can engineer around that you know it's like

01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:26,174
SPEAKER_1:  it.

01:34:26,402 --> 01:34:27,422
SPEAKER_1:  I'll ultimately.

01:34:28,258 --> 01:34:30,270
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I think Elon said something like.

01:34:30,722 --> 01:34:31,614
SPEAKER_1:  higher production rate.

01:34:32,098 --> 01:34:34,686
SPEAKER_1:  solves many ills or something along those lines.

01:34:35,106 --> 01:34:41,182
SPEAKER_1:  And it's just true if you have an insane amount of engines and an insane amount of data and insane amount of failures to learn from.

01:34:41,698 --> 01:34:47,646
SPEAKER_1:  You just know your system inside and out. You know those margins. You know where the failure points are. You know how to engineer around them.

01:34:48,354 --> 01:34:49,726
SPEAKER_1:  That's how I approach dating.

01:34:49,826 --> 01:34:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  No, I'm just kidding.

01:34:52,546 --> 01:34:53,950
SPEAKER_0:  Cause we're talking about engines.

01:34:54,338 --> 01:34:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  So

01:34:55,266 --> 01:34:59,614
SPEAKER_0:  Most rockets, I think all rockets have multiple stages today.

01:34:59,874 --> 01:35:07,838
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe they'll take us into discussion of what ideas that could be for single stage to orbit rockets. But can you describe this whole thing that you've been mentioning here and there?

01:35:08,130 --> 01:35:09,886
SPEAKER_0:  multiple stages of a rocket.

01:35:10,050 --> 01:35:11,710
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, no, that's a good question. So.

01:35:12,226 --> 01:35:18,942
SPEAKER_1:  Ultimately, you know, like I said, you're kind of pushing about 90% the rockets like basically just fuel with some skin on it. You know what I mean?

01:35:19,426 --> 01:35:20,606
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

01:35:21,154 --> 01:35:22,494
SPEAKER_1:  That skin weighs a lot of.

01:35:23,010 --> 01:35:25,470
SPEAKER_1:  you know, skin and the engines do weigh a lot.

01:35:25,762 --> 01:35:30,462
SPEAKER_1:  You know, like I said, the Falcon 9 on someone's about 20 tons. Just the booster is about 20 metric tons.

01:35:31,010 --> 01:35:34,910
SPEAKER_1:  So it's not an insignificant amount of weight. So the idea is...

01:35:35,234 --> 01:35:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  With staging.

01:35:36,226 --> 01:35:38,302
SPEAKER_1:  is you ditch anything you don't need, more or less.

01:35:38,978 --> 01:35:44,638
SPEAKER_1:  So Falcon 9 is a perfect rocket to think about this because you have a upper stage.

01:35:44,898 --> 01:35:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  and you have a booster, you know, our first stage.

01:35:47,330 --> 01:35:54,942
SPEAKER_1:  And the first stage burns through all this fuel. Once it's out of fuel, you let go of the second stage and ta-da, you actually just basically started and lit.

01:35:55,426 --> 01:35:57,086
SPEAKER_1:  a brand new fresh rocket.

01:35:57,378 --> 01:35:59,774
SPEAKER_1:  You know, this brand new fresh rocket now doesn't have all that.

01:36:00,130 --> 01:36:01,438
SPEAKER_1:  that 20 tons attached to it.

01:36:01,890 --> 01:36:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  so it's a lot lighter. It doesn't need nearly as many engines to push it around. It needs just one instead of nine.

01:36:08,258 --> 01:36:14,142
SPEAKER_1:  Its engine can be optimized for the vacuum of space as opposed to having to operate at sea level with all of our

01:36:14,786 --> 01:36:18,718
SPEAKER_1:  Relative actually pretty thick atmosphere, you know, relatively so.

01:36:19,298 --> 01:36:22,718
SPEAKER_1:  So staging is basically the idea that you get rid of things you don't need.

01:36:23,298 --> 01:36:25,598
SPEAKER_1:  On Earth, again, kind of that whole like 10%

01:36:26,274 --> 01:36:27,358
SPEAKER_1:  of 10% easier.

01:36:27,650 --> 01:36:30,302
SPEAKER_1:  If it was 10% easier, single-stage orbit would be no big deal.

01:36:30,658 --> 01:36:31,998
SPEAKER_1:  And it probably would have been like the.

01:36:33,122 --> 01:36:34,078
SPEAKER_1:  the way to get to orbit.

01:36:34,306 --> 01:36:35,358
SPEAKER_1:  choice just because like

01:36:35,970 --> 01:36:36,958
SPEAKER_1:  It's not that hard.

01:36:37,826 --> 01:36:38,590
SPEAKER_1:  with our

01:36:39,074 --> 01:36:39,998
SPEAKER_1:  Earth as it is.

01:36:40,354 --> 01:36:41,854
SPEAKER_1:  with physics as it is. It's just...

01:36:42,786 --> 01:36:44,638
SPEAKER_1:  It's doable and we've had.

01:36:45,506 --> 01:36:52,350
SPEAKER_1:  And you know, we almost kind of actually the first rocket to take humans into orbit from the United States.

01:36:52,770 --> 01:36:54,046
SPEAKER_1:  which was the

01:36:54,882 --> 01:36:55,902
SPEAKER_1:  Atlas rocket.

01:36:56,802 --> 01:36:58,270
SPEAKER_1:  was kind of a stage and a half.

01:36:58,722 --> 01:37:00,766
SPEAKER_1:  It actually only had like one big fuel tank.

01:37:01,186 --> 01:37:03,966
SPEAKER_1:  And what they did is they actually dropped off two of its three engines.

01:37:04,386 --> 01:37:07,550
SPEAKER_1:  So it just ditched some of the engines, but if it hadn't done that, you know, so kind of-

01:37:07,842 --> 01:37:13,758
SPEAKER_1:  People were like, well, that was single stage. It's like, it still had a staging event. It still had a ditch mass in order to even make it into orbit. Had it not done that.

01:37:14,242 --> 01:37:15,934
SPEAKER_1:  it would have not been able to get into orbit.

01:37:16,578 --> 01:37:18,750
SPEAKER_1:  So you pretty quickly look at your trade and say.

01:37:19,010 --> 01:37:21,854
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, well, if I want to stick to single-stage orbit.

01:37:22,178 --> 01:37:23,486
SPEAKER_1:  My payload mass becomes.

01:37:24,322 --> 01:37:26,430
SPEAKER_1:  You know, like you might be able to put like

01:37:26,882 --> 01:37:31,614
SPEAKER_1:  You know, a Falcon 9 booster on its own. Like if you just flew one of the side core boosters to a Falcon Heavy.

01:37:31,938 --> 01:37:34,974
SPEAKER_1:  with a nose cone on it and everything just said, I'm just going to fly this on its own.

01:37:35,618 --> 01:37:37,662
SPEAKER_1:  you might be able to put like,

01:37:38,338 --> 01:37:38,718
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

01:37:39,266 --> 01:37:42,302
SPEAKER_1:  10 kilograms into space or something, very small amount.

01:37:42,882 --> 01:37:45,054
SPEAKER_1:  We'll throw a second stage on that thing and now you can put.

01:37:45,474 --> 01:37:46,046
SPEAKER_1:  you know.

01:37:46,338 --> 01:37:48,830
SPEAKER_1:  17,000 kilograms into space.

01:37:49,282 --> 01:37:52,318
SPEAKER_1:  So it's just an order, you know, orders of magnitude more.

01:37:52,898 --> 01:37:56,350
SPEAKER_1:  payload capacity because you did staging, because you ditched the residual weight.

01:37:56,962 --> 01:37:58,014
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:37:58,690 --> 01:38:00,318
SPEAKER_1:  The other thing that's...

01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:02,718
SPEAKER_1:  about that too is that

01:38:03,074 --> 01:38:09,854
SPEAKER_1:  the engines again that operate at sea level are often not great in space and vice versa. Like you physically...

01:38:10,210 --> 01:38:10,526
SPEAKER_1:  Can't.

01:38:10,850 --> 01:38:14,590
SPEAKER_1:  are most optimized for space engines you can't even operate at sea level.

01:38:14,850 --> 01:38:15,838
SPEAKER_1:  destroy themselves.

01:38:16,258 --> 01:38:17,694
SPEAKER_1:  due to something called flow separation.

01:38:18,338 --> 01:38:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:38:19,554 --> 01:38:23,646
SPEAKER_1:  not only are you getting the benefit of ditching all the weight, you're also able to use it much more efficient.

01:38:24,162 --> 01:38:26,654
SPEAKER_1:  and typically a much less powerful engine.

01:38:26,754 --> 01:38:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  space.

01:38:30,210 --> 01:38:31,614
SPEAKER_0:  the multi-stage rockets.

01:38:32,706 --> 01:38:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  uh... that maybe the dream would be uh...

01:38:35,362 --> 01:38:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  if we weren't living on Earth.

01:38:37,058 --> 01:38:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  But maybe we can on Earth.

01:38:38,914 --> 01:38:43,166
SPEAKER_0:  to have a single stage to orbit rocket where it's all one package.

01:38:43,842 --> 01:38:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  Reusable.

01:38:45,634 --> 01:38:47,509
SPEAKER_1:  Reusable gets even harder. Yeah.

01:38:47,509 --> 01:38:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  and harder. So first of all, what is

01:38:49,826 --> 01:38:53,406
SPEAKER_0:  Just a ling on it. What is the single stage to orbit rocket?

01:38:53,922 --> 01:38:55,582
SPEAKER_0:  And why is it so hard to achieve?

01:38:56,066 --> 01:39:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  on earth. You already kind of explained it a little bit, but if we were to say, that's your assignment.

01:39:01,922 --> 01:39:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:39:02,562 --> 01:39:05,150
SPEAKER_0:  Tim, you're supposed to get together with Elon and.

01:39:05,442 --> 01:39:08,190
SPEAKER_0:  other brilliant people and like you have to do this.

01:39:09,442 --> 01:39:10,174
SPEAKER_0:  Why is it so hard?

01:39:10,690 --> 01:39:12,350
SPEAKER_1:  Why is it so hard?

01:39:13,890 --> 01:39:17,406
SPEAKER_1:  Your the the payload fraction of a rocket is

01:39:18,114 --> 01:39:20,798
SPEAKER_1:  like three to five or six or 7% would be like.

01:39:21,634 --> 01:39:22,430
SPEAKER_1:  You know, that's...

01:39:22,914 --> 01:39:26,206
SPEAKER_1:  the amount of payload compared to the total mass of the rocket. Like you're lucky to get into.

01:39:27,010 --> 01:39:27,934
SPEAKER_1:  beyond 5%.

01:39:28,546 --> 01:39:31,326
SPEAKER_1:  So if you're now having to deal with the weight of the rocket.

01:39:31,586 --> 01:39:33,438
SPEAKER_1:  by the time you're in orbit, like you're...

01:39:33,762 --> 01:39:34,654
SPEAKER_1:  payload fraction just.

01:39:35,138 --> 01:39:38,046
SPEAKER_1:  You're talking about like margins, it's such.

01:39:39,042 --> 01:39:41,182
SPEAKER_1:  It's so small amount of leftover.

01:39:41,666 --> 01:39:43,134
SPEAKER_1:  if you have to take all of it with you.

01:39:43,938 --> 01:39:45,598
SPEAKER_1:  So the sooner you can ditch weight, the better.

01:39:45,922 --> 01:39:47,774
SPEAKER_1:  The sooner you can ditch weight, the better. The sooner you can...

01:39:48,034 --> 01:39:50,910
SPEAKER_1:  You know, and that's what you're doing a rocket the whole time is actually ditching weight.

01:39:51,394 --> 01:39:52,638
SPEAKER_1:  All of that fuel

01:39:52,866 --> 01:39:57,118
SPEAKER_1:  All that big giant flame you see is literally mass being thrown out the back of the rocket.

01:39:57,602 --> 01:40:04,094
SPEAKER_1:  but what typically isn't expended, at least during nominal operations, you're not seeing the engines being expelled out the thing.

01:40:04,354 --> 01:40:08,062
SPEAKER_1:  until you get to staging, of course. And that's where you're ditching all that dead weight.

01:40:08,450 --> 01:40:09,566
SPEAKER_1:  So single-stage orbit.

01:40:10,242 --> 01:40:12,702
SPEAKER_1:  Your margins just become so small that it

01:40:13,122 --> 01:40:13,470
SPEAKER_1:  It's.

01:40:13,730 --> 01:40:14,878
SPEAKER_1:  Border is not impossible.

01:40:15,618 --> 01:40:20,798
SPEAKER_1:  But it's just at the end of the day, like almost no matter who you are, you end up saying it's just simply not worth it. I gotta be...

01:40:21,154 --> 01:40:24,254
SPEAKER_1:  If you have two rockets that are using the same amount of propellant.

01:40:24,578 --> 01:40:26,686
SPEAKER_1:  You know, they're the same physical sizes and one of them.

01:40:27,202 --> 01:40:29,726
SPEAKER_1:  cutting on a third and has another little engine.

01:40:30,114 --> 01:40:33,118
SPEAKER_1:  It'll have 100 or 1000 times more payload capacity.

01:40:33,410 --> 01:40:34,686
SPEAKER_1:  than the one sitting right next to it.

01:40:35,426 --> 01:40:40,062
SPEAKER_1:  And now, so there's tricks you can do to like try to offset that things like Aerospike engines, which

01:40:40,450 --> 01:40:41,278
SPEAKER_1:  operate at.

01:40:41,506 --> 01:40:41,854
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

01:40:42,082 --> 01:40:45,950
SPEAKER_1:  as efficiently at sea level, as efficiently at sea level.

01:40:46,274 --> 01:40:47,614
SPEAKER_1:  and just buy their.

01:40:47,842 --> 01:40:51,902
SPEAKER_1:  By the way, they're designed the physics of them. They're also efficient in a vacuum, too

01:40:52,482 --> 01:40:52,798
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:40:53,602 --> 01:40:54,910
SPEAKER_1:  You can do things like that.

01:40:55,266 --> 01:40:56,382
SPEAKER_1:  And at the end of the day though...

01:40:56,738 --> 01:41:05,790
SPEAKER_1:  you just end up with a worse rocket than if you had just done stage, like no matter what. And people say like, well, what if you had developed the new technologies? Like, okay, apply that technology to a multi-stage rocket.

01:41:06,658 --> 01:41:09,438
SPEAKER_1:  and it's gonna do better, you know, no matter where you end up.

01:41:09,922 --> 01:41:12,547
SPEAKER_1:  It's just always better to ditch that weight. Is there a cost-

01:41:12,547 --> 01:41:14,110
SPEAKER_0:  to having multi-stage.

01:41:14,530 --> 01:41:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  because you can still reuse the different stages.

01:41:16,802 --> 01:41:19,646
SPEAKER_1:  that's the dream is, you know, becomes easier to reuse.

01:41:20,162 --> 01:41:24,542
SPEAKER_1:  multiple stages because now you know like the booster doesn't have to survive orbital.

01:41:24,802 --> 01:41:27,582
SPEAKER_1:  reentry temperatures and extreme environments.

01:41:27,938 --> 01:41:33,534
SPEAKER_1:  and you only have to make survival the upper stage. So you only have to put a big heat shield. I mean, Starship's the perfect-

01:41:34,018 --> 01:41:36,318
SPEAKER_1:  of this the upper stage has a big giant heat shield

01:41:36,674 --> 01:41:39,998
SPEAKER_1:  The booster doesn't need it because it's not going, the booster's not going to orbit, it's only going.

01:41:40,610 --> 01:41:47,422
SPEAKER_1:  a fifth or a quarter of orbital velocity. So it's heat that it experiences is survivable just by the stainless steel. You don't need.

01:41:47,842 --> 01:41:48,862
SPEAKER_1:  an additional heat shield.

01:41:49,346 --> 01:41:49,726
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

01:41:50,114 --> 01:41:55,966
SPEAKER_1:  So all of a sudden, if you're trying to reuse, pretend that you just welded the two stages of Starship together, remove those engines on Starship.

01:41:56,418 --> 01:42:03,582
SPEAKER_1:  That whole vehicle, if you're trying to reuse it, the whole vehicle now has to have a heat shield on one side of it. The whole thing has to have these big heavy wings.

01:42:03,970 --> 01:42:04,990
SPEAKER_1:  By the time you come down to it, there's...

01:42:05,218 --> 01:42:07,230
SPEAKER_1:  Probably just zero payload capacity.

01:42:07,586 --> 01:42:10,206
SPEAKER_1:  You basically put your fuel tank in space, you know? Good job.

01:42:10,530 --> 01:42:13,022
SPEAKER_0:  So the dream of a single stage orbit.

01:42:13,634 --> 01:42:14,398
SPEAKER_0:  A rocket.

01:42:14,978 --> 01:42:15,390
SPEAKER_0:  is.

01:42:15,650 --> 01:42:17,182
SPEAKER_0:  Is that just even the wrong?

01:42:17,698 --> 01:42:18,654
SPEAKER_0:  dream on Earth.

01:42:18,978 --> 01:42:19,582
SPEAKER_1:  That's what.

01:42:19,938 --> 01:42:24,830
SPEAKER_1:  Most convention tells you you know by the time if if you're you're if your goal is cheap

01:42:25,314 --> 01:42:31,166
SPEAKER_1:  then you're going to have a physically larger rocket that has more engines, that has more propellant.

01:42:31,522 --> 01:42:36,062
SPEAKER_1:  blah blah blah to put the same amount of mass into orbit compared to something else. You know, we're talking like.

01:42:36,450 --> 01:42:42,206
SPEAKER_1:  Rocket Labs Electron, a really small rocket. It's like, I think 1.3 meters wide and something like, you know,

01:42:42,562 --> 01:42:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  18 meters tall or something. It's a small rocket.

01:42:46,050 --> 01:42:49,662
SPEAKER_1:  If you were to, you know, and it can put something like 300.

01:42:49,890 --> 01:42:51,678
SPEAKER_1:  or so kilograms into orbit.

01:42:53,026 --> 01:42:57,918
SPEAKER_1:  You can either launch something that size or again, like a full like big old Falcon nine.

01:42:58,178 --> 01:42:58,718
SPEAKER_1:  Booster.

01:42:59,106 --> 01:43:00,414
SPEAKER_1:  The huge, huge thing.

01:43:00,898 --> 01:43:03,710
SPEAKER_1:  and that would be lucky to put 300 kilograms into orbit.

01:43:03,938 --> 01:43:07,806
SPEAKER_1:  You know, so it's like, which one's going to be cheaper to build, you know, ship around.

01:43:08,322 --> 01:43:10,782
SPEAKER_1:  all this stuff and then you also look at you have fixed costs like.

01:43:11,490 --> 01:43:13,150
SPEAKER_1:  The idea of flying a...

01:43:13,634 --> 01:43:17,278
SPEAKER_1:  But this, again, everything in rocket science is a compromise, because now you have

01:43:17,634 --> 01:43:20,798
SPEAKER_1:  Things like people on console time, all the people that are, you know.

01:43:21,058 --> 01:43:22,910
SPEAKER_1:  on coms and working on the rocket.

01:43:23,138 --> 01:43:24,222
SPEAKER_1:  going down to the pad.

01:43:24,482 --> 01:43:34,078
SPEAKER_1:  You know filing paperwork doing range control making sure there's not planes and boats in the way. Flight termination people you have all these fixed costs for any launch i don't care how big the rocket is.

01:43:34,402 --> 01:43:36,318
SPEAKER_1:  there's a relatively fixed cost.

01:43:36,930 --> 01:43:38,078
SPEAKER_1:  So now you say like, okay.

01:43:38,498 --> 01:43:41,630
SPEAKER_1:  I'm gonna be paying, well let's just make a winner. I'm gonna pay $5 million.

01:43:42,594 --> 01:43:47,774
SPEAKER_1:  fly a rocket between all the people going on site, all the propellant, all the licenses, blah, blah, blah.

01:43:48,546 --> 01:43:50,718
SPEAKER_1:  If your fixed cost is $5 million, you can put...

01:43:51,138 --> 01:43:52,606
SPEAKER_1:  300 kilograms in space versus.

01:43:53,058 --> 01:43:55,102
SPEAKER_1:  you have a $5 million cost of operation.

01:43:55,554 --> 01:43:56,158
SPEAKER_1:  and you can put.

01:43:56,546 --> 01:43:58,494
SPEAKER_1:  5,000 kilograms into space, like it.

01:43:59,010 --> 01:43:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  it's

01:44:00,322 --> 01:44:03,454
SPEAKER_1:  the business case is gonna send you in one direction pretty quickly.

01:44:03,682 --> 01:44:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  So you mentioned aerospike engines.

01:44:06,306 --> 01:44:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  I think the internet...

01:44:08,834 --> 01:44:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  inform me of your love affair with the house by catching, find somebody.

01:44:13,858 --> 01:44:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  that looks at you the way Tim Na looks at Aerospark engines.

01:44:17,282 --> 01:44:17,918
SPEAKER_0:

01:44:18,786 --> 01:44:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  Can you explain what these are, how do they work, what's beautiful to them, how practical are they, why don't we use them?

01:44:29,154 --> 01:44:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  Does it just boil down to the design of the nozzle?

01:44:32,290 --> 01:44:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  So maybe can you explain how is it possible to achieve this thing?

01:44:35,522 --> 01:44:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  for an engine to be as efficient in a vacuum and sea level.

01:44:40,610 --> 01:44:41,150
SPEAKER_0:  conditions.

01:44:41,314 --> 01:44:49,822
SPEAKER_1:  You know what I love about this is that every question you've asked me is like a one hour video on my YouTube channel. I was like, now boil it down to 45 seconds. Go.

01:44:50,146 --> 01:44:52,862
SPEAKER_1:  So the Aerospike engine basically...

01:44:53,282 --> 01:44:55,806
SPEAKER_1:  is an inside out engine more or less.

01:44:56,098 --> 01:45:01,086
SPEAKER_1:  So with a traditional engine, we've talked about the combustion chamber and the throat, and then it expands out into the nozzle.

01:45:01,506 --> 01:45:03,166
SPEAKER_1:  Those walls are containing.

01:45:03,586 --> 01:45:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  The pressure, right?

01:45:05,314 --> 01:45:09,502
SPEAKER_1:  Air spike is the opposite. Basically, the pressure of the engine is on the outside of it.

01:45:09,826 --> 01:45:12,574
SPEAKER_1:  and it's pushing inward against a spike.

01:45:13,314 --> 01:45:17,854
SPEAKER_1:  So it's almost like the difference of if you were.

01:45:18,498 --> 01:45:20,222
SPEAKER_1:  Let me think about this. We're standing in my cub.

01:45:20,610 --> 01:45:30,014
SPEAKER_1:  tent or a teepee right and you put your arms at the top and you pushed your arms out like into an iron cross or something you know you can physically lift the tent just by pushing outwards on

01:45:30,370 --> 01:45:31,390
SPEAKER_1:  the tent walls, right?

01:45:31,970 --> 01:45:35,774
SPEAKER_1:  Well, that would be like a traditional nozzle. Now, aerospace would be almost like squeezing an ice cube.

01:45:36,226 --> 01:45:39,518
SPEAKER_1:  If you squeeze an ice cube, you can push in on it and kind of that wedge force.

01:45:39,906 --> 01:45:40,830
SPEAKER_1:  We'll shoot that ice cube.

01:45:41,506 --> 01:45:45,310
SPEAKER_1:  So that's kind of what is happening. You have the high pressure gases on the outside of the spike.

01:45:45,634 --> 01:45:49,406
SPEAKER_1:  squeezing in on that spike and that's and then that's pushing up against the

01:45:49,666 --> 01:45:51,358
SPEAKER_1:  because it's equal on both sides.

01:45:51,714 --> 01:45:52,958
SPEAKER_1:  against the kind of the ramp.

01:45:53,314 --> 01:45:54,750
SPEAKER_1:  is pushing up against the rocket.

01:45:55,170 --> 01:45:58,078
SPEAKER_1:  So that's where that force comes in, against the nozzle and against the chambers.

01:45:58,786 --> 01:46:02,366
SPEAKER_1:  The hard part with an aerospike. So the cool, okay, I guess the cool thing about an aerospike.

01:46:02,850 --> 01:46:03,166
SPEAKER_1:  is.

01:46:04,098 --> 01:46:05,662
SPEAKER_1:  that it can operate.

01:46:06,018 --> 01:46:06,494
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

01:46:07,010 --> 01:46:12,222
SPEAKER_1:  In space, you can have what's known as a really big expansion ratio. So that's your ratio between the throat.

01:46:12,450 --> 01:46:13,342
SPEAKER_1:  the area of the throat.

01:46:13,762 --> 01:46:15,934
SPEAKER_1:  versus the area of the nozzle exit.

01:46:16,226 --> 01:46:16,606
SPEAKER_1:  Mm-hmm.

01:46:16,834 --> 01:46:19,198
SPEAKER_1:  And remember how the bigger the nozzle is.

01:46:19,458 --> 01:46:23,934
SPEAKER_1:  the it's continually just converting more and more is converting that high energy.

01:46:24,258 --> 01:46:24,574
SPEAKER_1:  Hot.

01:46:25,154 --> 01:46:26,750
SPEAKER_1:  high pressure gas into cooler.

01:46:27,682 --> 01:46:28,094
SPEAKER_1:  and.

01:46:28,322 --> 01:46:33,918
SPEAKER_1:  cooler, lower pressure and faster gas. So each little millimeter along that nozzle is just getting it.

01:46:34,338 --> 01:46:36,638
SPEAKER_1:  lower pressure and cooler, but faster.

01:46:37,378 --> 01:46:40,286
SPEAKER_1:  Now if you take a big nozzle on earth and you at sea level.

01:46:40,578 --> 01:46:41,950
SPEAKER_1:  and you fire it, you can actually get.

01:46:42,210 --> 01:46:44,638
SPEAKER_1:  even though we're going from say 300 bar the Raptor engine.

01:46:45,122 --> 01:46:49,022
SPEAKER_1:  You know, our atmosphere at sea level is about one bar. It's pretty much exactly one bar.

01:46:49,346 --> 01:46:50,686
SPEAKER_1:  depending on conditions.

01:46:51,074 --> 01:46:51,390
SPEAKER_1:  but.

01:46:51,682 --> 01:46:55,486
SPEAKER_1:  you can actually get a nozzle to get way below.

01:46:55,746 --> 01:46:56,798
SPEAKER_1:  one bar of pressure.

01:46:57,346 --> 01:46:58,846
SPEAKER_1:  So every little, you know.

01:46:59,106 --> 01:47:00,382
SPEAKER_1:  You can go from 300 bar.

01:47:00,738 --> 01:47:02,302
SPEAKER_1:  in just two meters down to.

01:47:02,626 --> 01:47:04,126
SPEAKER_1:  one bar or below one bar.

01:47:04,578 --> 01:47:07,998
SPEAKER_1:  There's actually a limit. You can actually only expand it below.

01:47:08,354 --> 01:47:12,798
SPEAKER_1:  You know, we'll say something like 70% so you can get down to like 0.7 bar.

01:47:13,282 --> 01:47:18,302
SPEAKER_1:  at nozzle exit before the pressure of the atmosphere is actually squeezing in on that exhaust.

01:47:18,850 --> 01:47:20,926
SPEAKER_1:  and tearing it away from the walls of the engine.

01:47:21,954 --> 01:47:23,326
SPEAKER_1:  walls of the nozzle exit.

01:47:23,554 --> 01:47:27,742
SPEAKER_1:  And what happens is it's kind of unpredictable. You get these pockets, these oscillations.

01:47:28,034 --> 01:47:30,910
SPEAKER_1:  and they'll be so extreme that they'll end up just destroying the nozzle.

01:47:31,586 --> 01:47:32,926
SPEAKER_1:  So you can't lower.

01:47:33,218 --> 01:47:35,166
SPEAKER_1:  You can't have a bigger expansion ratio.

01:47:35,586 --> 01:47:37,502
SPEAKER_1:  then again, relatively speaking, something like.

01:47:37,794 --> 01:47:39,614
SPEAKER_1:  Like you can't go below.

01:47:40,066 --> 01:47:41,726
SPEAKER_1:  You can't get that pressure exit.

01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:45,886
SPEAKER_1:  much below ambient air pressure before flow separation can destroy the engine.

01:47:46,050 --> 01:47:47,934
SPEAKER_0:  So how come this engine...

01:47:48,162 --> 01:47:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  can do so in different pressure conditions.

01:47:51,682 --> 01:47:52,958
SPEAKER_1:  So because it's inside out.

01:47:53,538 --> 01:47:56,830
SPEAKER_1:  the ambient pressure is pushing the exhaust gas into the wall.

01:47:57,570 --> 01:48:02,334
SPEAKER_1:  as opposed to a conventional engine that exhaust, the ambient air is actually squeezing.

01:48:02,626 --> 01:48:05,150
SPEAKER_1:  the exhaust gas away from the walls of the engine.

01:48:05,794 --> 01:48:08,830
SPEAKER_1:  And that squeezing away from is what can be destructive.

01:48:09,186 --> 01:48:11,198
SPEAKER_1:  So that since it's kind of inside out.

01:48:11,554 --> 01:48:14,622
SPEAKER_1:  The ambient air is pushing the exhaust gas into the engine walls.

01:48:14,914 --> 01:48:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  So you can't have flow separation. You won't have flow separation.

01:48:18,434 --> 01:48:20,670
SPEAKER_1:  Now what happens is so you can have this huge.

01:48:21,058 --> 01:48:24,158
SPEAKER_1:  amazingly efficient vacuum engine that has a.

01:48:24,418 --> 01:48:28,478
SPEAKER_1:  we'll say a 200 to one expansion ratio, which is really big. A lot of C level engines are.

01:48:28,930 --> 01:48:32,030
SPEAKER_1:  like 35, 40, 50 to one expansion ratios.

01:48:32,546 --> 01:48:37,630
SPEAKER_1:  And then in space, you know, it's common to use like 150, 180, 201 expansion ratios.

01:48:38,274 --> 01:48:40,350
SPEAKER_1:  So in the airspec can have something like 200 to one.

01:48:40,898 --> 01:48:49,150
SPEAKER_1:  It's just that the at sea level is kind of just getting pushed and it's kind of getting cut off early almost, but it doesn't matter. It's not like destructive. It's just not running at its maximum efficiency.

01:48:49,666 --> 01:48:53,054
SPEAKER_1:  as it climbs in altitude as the ambient air gets thinner and thinner and thinner.

01:48:53,698 --> 01:48:57,886
SPEAKER_1:  It just inherently is pushing less and less and less against the walls of that.

01:48:58,146 --> 01:48:58,942
SPEAKER_1:  Aerospike Engine.

01:48:59,362 --> 01:49:01,630
SPEAKER_1:  so it actually continually gets more efficient.

01:49:02,466 --> 01:49:04,510
SPEAKER_1:  at, you know, as it climbs in altitude.

01:49:05,154 --> 01:49:07,198
SPEAKER_1:  As does the normal engine, but the difference is...

01:49:07,618 --> 01:49:09,406
SPEAKER_1:  that you can use that huge expansion ratio.

01:49:09,666 --> 01:49:11,614
SPEAKER_1:  at sea level and you can't use.

01:49:11,842 --> 01:49:13,086
SPEAKER_1:  a huge expansion ratio.

01:49:13,314 --> 01:49:15,454
SPEAKER_1:  at sea level with their traditional nozzle.

01:49:16,098 --> 01:49:18,723
SPEAKER_0:  Has anyone actually flown an Air Spike engine?

01:49:18,723 --> 01:49:22,206
SPEAKER_1:  No Aerospike engine to date has ever been flown on an orbital rocket.

01:49:22,498 --> 01:49:23,623
SPEAKER_1:  Why not? And w-

01:49:23,623 --> 01:49:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  I'd like to see a future where they're used.

01:49:26,082 --> 01:49:30,207
SPEAKER_1:  purely purely because I think they're cool. Yeah, you know in the same way.

01:49:30,207 --> 01:49:33,534
SPEAKER_0:  That's the core of your love affair with air spike engines.

01:49:33,666 --> 01:49:38,110
SPEAKER_1:  And I said this in my video actually outside before I came in here I saw.

01:49:38,530 --> 01:49:39,518
SPEAKER_1:  on RX-7.

01:49:39,970 --> 01:49:43,134
SPEAKER_1:  on the streets that I just love and that uses a rotary engine.

01:49:43,490 --> 01:49:45,086
SPEAKER_1:  on paper the rotary engine is like.

01:49:45,474 --> 01:49:49,342
SPEAKER_1:  more efficient, smaller, more efficient, all these things, but in practice it's like.

01:49:49,570 --> 01:49:51,550
SPEAKER_1:  The thing is actually just like unreliable hot.

01:49:52,002 --> 01:49:55,070
SPEAKER_1:  and it, you know, it, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Burns oil.

01:49:55,522 --> 01:49:58,718
SPEAKER_1:  Kind of the same thing with the AeroSpike engine. Like, yes on paper it's more efficient.

01:49:59,234 --> 01:50:03,038
SPEAKER_1:  but now you have a lot more surface area of your...

01:50:03,778 --> 01:50:06,462
SPEAKER_1:  your throat area no matter what is going to have.

01:50:06,786 --> 01:50:11,038
SPEAKER_1:  The throw of the rocket engine is always where it's the hottest. You know, it's the hardest thing to cool.

01:50:11,522 --> 01:50:12,638
SPEAKER_1:  And with an aerospike, if...

01:50:12,930 --> 01:50:15,774
SPEAKER_1:  you know, if it's inside out, now your throat is.

01:50:16,290 --> 01:50:23,870
SPEAKER_1:  no matter what, like way bigger. It's almost like the size of the nozzle exit normally, but now it's your hardest thing to cool and you have a ton of it.

01:50:24,386 --> 01:50:25,118
SPEAKER_1:  And you also have

01:50:25,346 --> 01:50:27,486
SPEAKER_1:  two edges of it no matter what. So even if you have like a

01:50:27,778 --> 01:50:29,182
SPEAKER_1:  you know, a circle inside a circle.

01:50:29,858 --> 01:50:32,414
SPEAKER_1:  You have like a just insane amount more.

01:50:33,538 --> 01:50:37,246
SPEAKER_1:  surface area to cool with a limited amount of fuel. Don't forget using your fuel.

01:50:37,794 --> 01:50:39,422
SPEAKER_1:  As your as your coolant.

01:50:39,874 --> 01:50:42,590
SPEAKER_1:  So if you all of a sudden now take your throat area and you have

01:50:43,010 --> 01:50:43,326
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:50:44,226 --> 01:50:45,694
SPEAKER_1:  X amount of space that you need to cool.

01:50:46,114 --> 01:50:47,934
SPEAKER_1:  You only have, you have a limited supply.

01:50:48,194 --> 01:50:49,342
SPEAKER_1:  It's like, ugh.

01:50:49,858 --> 01:50:50,983
SPEAKER_1:  Sorry, this is the stuff that just...

01:50:50,983 --> 01:50:52,638
SPEAKER_0:  Are there ideas of for cooling?

01:50:52,930 --> 01:50:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:50:54,050 --> 01:50:56,675
SPEAKER_0:  of cooling out spike engines.

01:50:56,675 --> 01:51:04,094
SPEAKER_1:  the same physics apply for an aerospike as they would. So you just run into a limitation. Like at some point I'm not flowing enough propellant.

01:51:04,418 --> 01:51:08,062
SPEAKER_1:  It scales, it scales kind of poorly. You know what I mean?

01:51:08,290 --> 01:51:11,774
SPEAKER_1:  You can increase the thrust of an aerospec by making it bigger and increase the mass flow.

01:51:12,002 --> 01:51:13,438
SPEAKER_1:  and the fuel going through the throats.

01:51:13,890 --> 01:51:14,750
SPEAKER_1:  or the throat.

01:51:15,426 --> 01:51:18,366
SPEAKER_1:  But at the same time, like it just, it's at the end of the day.

01:51:19,138 --> 01:51:20,062
SPEAKER_1:  It's physically possible.

01:51:20,674 --> 01:51:21,790
SPEAKER_1:  It's a lot more complex.

01:51:22,306 --> 01:51:23,582
SPEAKER_1:  You have a lot of issues with cooling.

01:51:24,226 --> 01:51:26,142
SPEAKER_1:  and it's just you end up kind of right back where you started.

01:51:26,946 --> 01:51:30,238
SPEAKER_1:  So it's like, is it worth it to just keep going down this rabbit hole?

01:51:30,818 --> 01:51:32,606
SPEAKER_1:  You're trying to engineer this thing to work.

01:51:33,058 --> 01:51:37,182
SPEAKER_1:  when you could have probably spent a tenth the amount of time just slightly increasing the performance of your

01:51:37,442 --> 01:51:38,878
SPEAKER_1:  normal engine in the first place, you know?

01:51:39,714 --> 01:51:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  Again, I'm going to anthropomorphize that lesson and apply it to my dating life. Once again, just kidding. Okay, actually just on a small tangent.

01:51:51,266 --> 01:51:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  since you are also a car guy.

01:51:53,506 --> 01:51:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  What's the greatest?

01:51:55,234 --> 01:51:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  combustion engine car ever made.

01:51:57,442 --> 01:51:58,878
SPEAKER_0:  to you if you had to pick.

01:51:59,170 --> 01:52:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  something, what's the coolest?

01:52:01,602 --> 01:52:04,798
SPEAKER_0:  The sexiest, the most powerful, the...

01:52:05,378 --> 01:52:08,753
SPEAKER_0:  Classiest most elegant well-designed. I don't know what

01:52:08,753 --> 01:52:10,718
SPEAKER_1:  are different for me but I'd say... they are guitar

01:52:11,458 --> 01:52:15,550
SPEAKER_1:  I still, it's funny, because now, maybe it's just because it's fresh on mind, but I love.

01:52:16,386 --> 01:52:18,366
SPEAKER_1:  that mid 90s RX-7.

01:52:18,946 --> 01:52:23,646
SPEAKER_1:  which you know especially in Japan they had the the 20b a tri-rotor

01:52:24,610 --> 01:52:26,302
SPEAKER_1:  That is like the coolest engine ever to me.

01:52:28,994 --> 01:52:30,270
SPEAKER_1:  the FD RX-7.

01:52:31,426 --> 01:52:33,086
SPEAKER_1:  It's just too darn cool, honestly.

01:52:35,138 --> 01:52:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  I mean.

01:52:36,002 --> 01:52:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  Ah.

01:52:36,770 --> 01:52:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  There you go.

01:52:37,762 --> 01:52:40,318
SPEAKER_0:  Well, what about the mid-90s that makes it special?

01:52:40,802 --> 01:52:48,702
SPEAKER_1:  just that's the only time everything was it's more that I love the engine and I like the cards attached to him and I'm not actually a big fan of like 90s styling you know personally

01:52:49,282 --> 01:52:51,678
SPEAKER_1:  But just that the 20B is just such a cool.

01:52:52,226 --> 01:52:54,654
SPEAKER_1:  and his twin-turbo sequential turbos?

01:52:55,042 --> 01:52:55,902
SPEAKER_1:  They used um...

01:52:56,514 --> 01:53:02,046
SPEAKER_1:  A bigger turbo takes longer to spool up. It takes more, it's using that same, like a turbine and a compressor.

01:53:02,658 --> 01:53:07,038
SPEAKER_1:  And it just, if it's a large turbine, it takes more exhaust gas to get it spooled up.

01:53:07,458 --> 01:53:11,838
SPEAKER_1:  So if you have an engine that revs to 9,000 RPM and you want to get a lot of pressure out of that turbo,

01:53:12,130 --> 01:53:15,870
SPEAKER_1:  You have a big turbo it's gonna take forever. Like you're gonna have your floor and then like.

01:53:16,386 --> 01:53:18,942
SPEAKER_1:  Right, it's gonna take a long time for that turbo to get spooled up.

01:53:19,394 --> 01:53:20,990
SPEAKER_1:  They actually did a small turbo on it.

01:53:21,282 --> 01:53:26,334
SPEAKER_1:  and a big turbo. So the small turbo would spool up first, get some boost going through the engine, get that engine.

01:53:26,690 --> 01:53:29,630
SPEAKER_1:  Operating get it up to speed get it. You know get some power to the wheels

01:53:29,922 --> 01:53:36,926
SPEAKER_1:  And then once that kind of reaches its limit, you'd flow it into the, divert the exhaust gas into the bigger turbo, this sequential turbo.

01:53:37,538 --> 01:53:43,358
SPEAKER_1:  And then that now can supplement and actually increase the overall performance of the vehicle by a lot. And I just.

01:53:43,906 --> 01:53:46,590
SPEAKER_1:  That's just so cool. It's just like the ultimate like...

01:53:47,042 --> 01:53:49,214
SPEAKER_1:  brute force out of the box thinking.

01:53:49,858 --> 01:53:52,190
SPEAKER_1:  And it actually made it into production. You know what I mean?

01:53:52,610 --> 01:53:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  Can you, what's the sound like? Can you tell an engine by sound?

01:53:56,930 --> 01:54:00,222
SPEAKER_1:  It sounds like a really, really, really angry lot.

01:54:01,890 --> 01:54:05,438
SPEAKER_1:  It sounds horrible. It's actually a terrible sounding car. In my opinion, I like its sound.

01:54:05,858 --> 01:54:07,582
SPEAKER_1:  just raspy and like

01:54:07,938 --> 01:54:17,470
SPEAKER_1:  The opposite of like a big muscle car. You know, like a big muscle car, just deep, guttural, like, it's deep. Oh, it just hits you. This is like, it's just gonna annoy the hell out of you and all your neighbors. you

01:54:17,922 --> 01:54:20,478
SPEAKER_1:  But you love the engineering. I love the engineering of it.

01:54:20,674 --> 01:54:23,006
SPEAKER_0:  So to you, the car is the engine.

01:54:23,298 --> 01:54:24,254
SPEAKER_0:  It's not.

01:54:24,642 --> 01:54:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  All the surface stuff, all the design stuff.

01:54:27,426 --> 01:54:32,286
SPEAKER_0:  All the you know, yeah the the elegance the curves whatever it is

01:54:32,450 --> 01:54:33,246
SPEAKER_1:  Well, those come and go.

01:54:33,794 --> 01:54:37,919
SPEAKER_1:  You know, to me, styles change. It's forever. Yeah. I'm going to play.

01:54:37,919 --> 01:54:40,919
SPEAKER_0:  that to my dating life once again.

01:54:40,919 --> 01:54:46,174
SPEAKER_1:  just keep on coming. Well, if you think about it, my taste has changed throughout the years. When I first saw.

01:54:46,626 --> 01:54:52,638
SPEAKER_1:  A model three Tesla. I thought it was the most hideous car ever and then without the grill. I was like, this is so stupid

01:54:52,962 --> 01:54:56,254
SPEAKER_1:  It took me all but two months to think that it was one of the coolest looking cars.

01:54:56,642 --> 01:55:00,830
SPEAKER_1:  Same with Cybertruck. I mourned Cybertruck. When I first saw that thing, I was at the-

01:55:01,602 --> 01:55:05,822
SPEAKER_1:  thing with and I went with we used to do a podcast called our ludicrous future

01:55:06,370 --> 01:55:08,862
SPEAKER_1:  So we talked a lot about like, you know, cars and EVs and stuff.

01:55:09,282 --> 01:55:16,094
SPEAKER_1:  We went to that unveiling and literally, we had almost a non-alcohol-induced hangover the next morning of like morning.

01:55:16,546 --> 01:55:18,014
SPEAKER_1:  the hideousness of Cybertruck.

01:55:19,010 --> 01:55:21,182
SPEAKER_1:  come six months later, a year later, and I'm like.

01:55:21,730 --> 01:55:23,006
SPEAKER_1:  Damn it, that thing's actually kind of cool.

01:55:23,650 --> 01:55:25,310
SPEAKER_0:  That also teaches you something about...

01:55:25,762 --> 01:55:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  No, again, it's the thing you said.

01:55:28,162 --> 01:55:28,958
SPEAKER_0:  earlier sort of.

01:55:29,506 --> 01:55:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

01:55:31,618 --> 01:55:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  going against.

01:55:33,570 --> 01:55:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  the current of the experts of the police or whatever is making a decision from first principles. Some of that also applies to design and styling and fashion and culture and all that. Peace.

01:55:43,074 --> 01:55:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  Some of that.

01:55:44,482 --> 01:55:44,862
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

01:55:45,250 --> 01:55:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  So in fashion especially, it's so interesting. So subjective. Being rebellious.

01:55:51,074 --> 01:55:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  against the current fads.

01:55:54,722 --> 01:55:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  actually is the way to pave.

01:55:57,474 --> 01:55:58,334
SPEAKER_0:  the new fads.

01:55:58,466 --> 01:56:04,190
SPEAKER_1:  When it didn't take long for others to follow, you look at like currently, like what Hyundai is doing with their.

01:56:04,674 --> 01:56:15,646
SPEAKER_1:  I forget which one, like the Ionic or something like that. It's square, it's like, it's boxy. You know, it's a throwback, it's 80s, it's got these beautiful retro taillights, it's got these square headlights.

01:56:16,066 --> 01:56:22,078
SPEAKER_1:  It's very inspired by Cybertruck in my opinion. I mean, it might not be. It might be coincidental that we're all kind of getting this.

01:56:22,466 --> 01:56:23,710
SPEAKER_1:  Retro future vibe, but.

01:56:23,906 --> 01:56:25,150
SPEAKER_0:  uh... i personally

01:56:25,602 --> 01:56:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  Boxxy.

01:56:26,626 --> 01:56:28,798
SPEAKER_0:  So I never, I still haven't.

01:56:29,378 --> 01:56:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  Understood.

01:56:30,370 --> 01:56:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:56:31,298 --> 01:56:31,870
SPEAKER_0:  Porsche's.

01:56:32,130 --> 01:56:34,238
SPEAKER_0:  bushes. I still can't

01:56:34,530 --> 01:56:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  quite.

01:56:35,554 --> 01:56:39,679
SPEAKER_0:  Understand the small size, the curves. I don't quite-

01:56:39,679 --> 01:56:46,078
SPEAKER_1:  I don't quite get it. Like I said, I don't love the look of the RX 7. I don't love it, but I love it because of

01:56:46,338 --> 01:56:48,446
SPEAKER_1:  the engineering, I guess, that it represents. You know what I mean.

01:56:48,546 --> 01:56:53,246
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it's not the surface stuff, it's the deep down stuff.

01:56:53,826 --> 01:56:56,451
SPEAKER_1:  It's that 50-50 wage distribution that matters.

01:56:56,451 --> 01:56:56,830
SPEAKER_0: .

01:56:57,346 --> 01:57:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  All right, let's let's talk about Starship a little bit. We've been sneaking up to it from a bunch of different directions.

01:57:04,194 --> 01:57:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  Can you just say...

01:57:06,146 --> 01:57:06,622
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:57:08,002 --> 01:57:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  What is Starship and what is the most impressive thing to you about it? I mean, you've talked about the sort of the engines involved. Maybe you haven't really.

01:57:16,706 --> 01:57:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  kind of like dancing around it, but.

01:57:19,074 --> 01:57:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  Because this is such a crucial...

01:57:22,082 --> 01:57:22,558
SPEAKER_0:  thing.

01:57:22,786 --> 01:57:29,054
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of the next few years in terms of your own life personally and also just.

01:57:29,378 --> 01:57:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  human civilization reaching out to the stars. It seems like Starship is a really important vehicle to making that happen. So what is this thing that we're talking about?

01:57:37,954 --> 01:57:39,829
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so Starship is-

01:57:39,829 --> 01:57:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  is.

01:57:40,802 --> 01:57:41,342
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:57:41,954 --> 01:57:45,374
SPEAKER_1:  Currently in development, the world's largest, most powerful.

01:57:45,794 --> 01:57:46,654
SPEAKER_1:  Rocket ever built?

01:57:47,266 --> 01:57:48,414
SPEAKER_1:  Fully reusable rocket.

01:57:48,738 --> 01:57:49,854
SPEAKER_1:  a two-stage rocket.

01:57:50,210 --> 01:57:52,638
SPEAKER_1:  So the booster is landed and...

01:57:52,930 --> 01:57:55,742
SPEAKER_1:  You know, all this is currently aspirational until it's working.

01:57:56,066 --> 01:57:57,982
SPEAKER_1:  So I'll say it's.

01:57:58,306 --> 01:58:01,950
SPEAKER_1:  I'll say what it's aspirationally going to be. And obviously I have faith that that will happen.

01:58:02,338 --> 01:58:06,718
SPEAKER_1:  just factually. So the booster will be reused, re-fueled and reused.

01:58:06,946 --> 01:58:09,822
SPEAKER_1:  The upper stage will be landed, refueled, and reused.

01:58:10,146 --> 01:58:17,726
SPEAKER_1:  And ideally, rapidly, in the sense, not talking about months or weeks of refurbishment, but literally talking about mild inspections.

01:58:18,178 --> 01:58:23,422
SPEAKER_1:  and ideally like under 24 hour reuse, you know, where you literally land it and fly it like an airplane.

01:58:24,162 --> 01:58:27,326
SPEAKER_1:  So it utilizes liquid methane and liquid oxygen.

01:58:27,586 --> 01:58:29,374
SPEAKER_1:  as its propellants.

01:58:29,826 --> 01:58:33,694
SPEAKER_1:  It utilizes, the current iterations of it are 33.

01:58:34,146 --> 01:58:36,830
SPEAKER_1:  Raptor engines on the booster engine, on the booster.

01:58:37,282 --> 01:58:44,830
SPEAKER_1:  and six Raptors on the second stage. So there'll be three that are vacuum optimized and three that are sea level optimized on the upper stage.

01:58:45,154 --> 01:58:48,158
SPEAKER_1:  that are primarily, they'll be used, I think, at stage separation anyway.

01:58:48,546 --> 01:58:54,206
SPEAKER_1:  in space but their main reason that they use them is so they can use them for landing too.

01:58:54,530 --> 01:58:55,358
SPEAKER_1:  See you next time.

01:58:55,874 --> 01:58:58,462
SPEAKER_1:  uh... to be able to possibly land the upper stages well

01:58:59,138 --> 01:59:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  So the three wrapped engines are the ones that generate the thrust.

01:59:03,138 --> 01:59:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  that makes it the most powerful rocket ever built.

01:59:05,666 --> 01:59:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

01:59:06,562 --> 01:59:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  to almost double.

01:59:08,578 --> 01:59:09,703
SPEAKER_0:  compared to the Saturn fight.

01:59:09,703 --> 01:59:14,174
SPEAKER_1:  The N1 had 45 MN of thrust. The Saturn V had, I think...

01:59:14,402 --> 01:59:16,190
SPEAKER_1:  35 or 40 Megan Nunes of Thrust.

01:59:16,674 --> 01:59:19,166
SPEAKER_1:  and this has 75 mega newton so we're talking

01:59:19,554 --> 01:59:20,574
SPEAKER_1:  Almost double.

01:59:22,434 --> 01:59:25,031
SPEAKER_0:  It's a-

01:59:25,031 --> 01:59:26,238
SPEAKER_1:  It's a lot.

01:59:26,338 --> 01:59:27,070
SPEAKER_0:  of power.

01:59:28,162 --> 01:59:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:59:28,802 --> 01:59:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  That could be the sexiest thing I've ever heard. Okay. So what are the different testing that's happening? So like a.

01:59:36,130 --> 01:59:42,174
SPEAKER_0:  What's a static fire with some of these Raptors look like and where do we stand you would you're just talking about offline?

01:59:42,402 --> 01:59:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  like the thing that happened.

01:59:44,066 --> 01:59:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  yesterday. It was impressive.

01:59:46,210 --> 01:59:48,990
SPEAKER_1:  you know, everything in this is kind of iterations. And so.

01:59:49,378 --> 01:59:59,966
SPEAKER_1:  You know, the milestones that we're seeing, we actually have on everydayastronaut.com, we have a milestone checklist of like all the things we're hoping to see that we kind of need to see before the first orbital flight of this rocket.

02:00:00,674 --> 02:00:06,142
SPEAKER_1:  So a big milestone that got checked off yesterday was a wet dress rehearsal. So it's literally like fueling.

02:00:06,562 --> 02:00:07,262
SPEAKER_1:  The Rock It Up.

02:00:07,842 --> 02:00:17,854
SPEAKER_1:  getting ready to do everything but lighting the engines, basically. So we're talking about loading it with propellant all the way. This is the first time. Yep, right there. Where's the milestones? Right there at the top. Click that big.

02:00:18,082 --> 02:00:18,494
SPEAKER_1:  picture.

02:00:19,394 --> 02:00:20,519
SPEAKER_1:  Just anywhere, that big pic.

02:00:20,519 --> 02:00:25,951
SPEAKER_0:  So there's the what dress rehearsal. So what's the what dress rehearsal?

02:00:25,951 --> 02:00:27,070
SPEAKER_1:  So that's where they...

02:00:27,362 --> 02:00:32,382
SPEAKER_1:  For the first time, they filled it completely to the brim with both liquid oxygen and liquid methane.

02:00:32,674 --> 02:00:34,974
SPEAKER_1:  Now they had done component level testing where they fill it.

02:00:35,330 --> 02:00:40,926
SPEAKER_1:  with liquid nitrogen, which is, you know, it's an inert gas. So it's not like, say it leaks out, it's not going to explode.

02:00:41,250 --> 02:00:44,638
SPEAKER_1:  You could just have a big giant pool of liquid nitrogen like flooding.

02:00:44,994 --> 02:00:46,878
SPEAKER_1:  the area, but it's not gonna be an explosion.

02:00:47,106 --> 02:00:50,718
SPEAKER_1:  So they've done that for cryo testing to make sure all the components and stuff can handle.

02:00:51,042 --> 02:00:52,798
SPEAKER_1:  you know, being at cryogenic temperatures.

02:00:53,122 --> 02:00:57,406
SPEAKER_1:  It's kind of a good analog before you start putting your fuel and your oxidizer in there.

02:00:57,666 --> 02:00:59,870
SPEAKER_1:  But now, as of yesterday...

02:01:00,226 --> 02:01:01,502
SPEAKER_1:  They fully fueled the rocket.

02:01:01,762 --> 02:01:06,782
SPEAKER_1:  with propellant, both stages, the first stage and the second stage while fully stacked on the pad.

02:01:07,234 --> 02:01:11,454
SPEAKER_1:  Basically, I mean, it was the first sense we really got off like, this is what it's going to look like right before it takes off.

02:01:12,290 --> 02:01:15,198
SPEAKER_1:  you know, kind of breathing coming to life for the first time.

02:01:15,490 --> 02:01:18,750
SPEAKER_0:  What does the pad look like? So there's a few interesting aspects of this.

02:01:18,978 --> 02:01:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  what's up with the chopsticks and uh... all that

02:01:21,858 --> 02:01:28,318
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so the launch pad is unique. I've never seen anything like it in the.

02:01:28,578 --> 02:01:30,494
SPEAKER_1:  prior history of spaceflight.

02:01:30,978 --> 02:01:38,334
SPEAKER_1:  but it's a really simple launch stand. They basically have like this, it almost looks like a stool, like a milking a cow stool thing.

02:01:38,626 --> 02:01:40,501
SPEAKER_1:  with a hope, a big giant.

02:01:40,501 --> 02:01:43,655
SPEAKER_0:  you're from Iowa.

02:01:43,655 --> 02:01:47,422
SPEAKER_1:  know what that stool looks like. We all been sitting on that stool milking cat.

02:01:47,650 --> 02:01:49,525
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, with the...

02:01:49,525 --> 02:01:55,870
SPEAKER_1:  with a giant hole in the middle. And that hole in the middle of that stool is where the rocket sits. And it sits on these launch clamps.

02:01:56,386 --> 02:02:03,006
SPEAKER_1:  And then next to it is the, so that's the Orbital Launch Mount, and then next to it there are the OLM, some people will say.

02:02:03,266 --> 02:02:05,982
SPEAKER_1:  Next to it is the Orbital Launch Tower, the OLT.

02:02:06,530 --> 02:02:09,022
SPEAKER_1:  And that is not only.

02:02:09,442 --> 02:02:14,206
SPEAKER_1:  Integral to fueling up the upper stage and I had the upper stage has to have propellant lines run to it

02:02:14,530 --> 02:02:17,470
SPEAKER_1:  so that they can fill it with propellant and all that.

02:02:17,858 --> 02:02:18,974
SPEAKER_1:  but it also...

02:02:19,202 --> 02:02:25,438
SPEAKER_1:  they ended up making it so instead of having a big crane on site to stack the two on top of each other they literally just use that tower

02:02:25,794 --> 02:02:26,430
SPEAKER_1:  as a crane.

02:02:26,786 --> 02:02:31,646
SPEAKER_1:  The crane has these giant arms, lovingly called the chopsticks, or the whole system can be called Mechazilla.

02:02:32,514 --> 02:02:34,814
SPEAKER_1:  and that will grab onto first, it'll grab onto the booster.

02:02:35,362 --> 02:02:39,294
SPEAKER_1:  pick it up off of its transporter that transports it from the production site.

02:02:39,842 --> 02:02:42,046
SPEAKER_1:  lifts it up, puts it down onto the launch mount.

02:02:42,466 --> 02:02:45,886
SPEAKER_1:  and then it will pick up the second stage of the upper stage starship

02:02:46,274 --> 02:02:46,590
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:02:47,138 --> 02:02:49,150
SPEAKER_1:  plop it down on top of the booster.

02:02:49,698 --> 02:02:55,422
SPEAKER_1:  And they did that for the first time last year. Actually, I think it was like Valentine's last year, was the first time they used the chopsticks to stack it.

02:02:55,746 --> 02:02:56,478
SPEAKER_1:  And now they're doing it.

02:02:56,706 --> 02:02:57,822
SPEAKER_1:  quite frequently, you know?

02:02:58,338 --> 02:02:59,134
SPEAKER_1:  But ultimately...

02:02:59,458 --> 02:03:02,558
SPEAKER_1:  Those chopsticks have to serve a second purpose. They're actually going to utilize-

02:03:03,170 --> 02:03:10,782
SPEAKER_1:  If you say, it's not so much they're going to catch the booster with these chopsticks, it's not like it's a dad trying to catch a falling child.

02:03:11,298 --> 02:03:15,294
SPEAKER_1:  It's more that the booster and the starship will someday land.

02:03:15,746 --> 02:03:17,118
SPEAKER_1:  on those arms.

02:03:18,274 --> 02:03:19,198
SPEAKER_1:  So.

02:03:19,426 --> 02:03:21,950
SPEAKER_1:  They're more or less stationary. I'm sure there's some bit of-

02:03:22,242 --> 02:03:26,078
SPEAKER_1:  you know, adjustment of the arms will do, but more or less the rocket's going to propulsively land.

02:03:26,626 --> 02:03:29,566
SPEAKER_1:  and get picked up by what's essentially too-

02:03:30,370 --> 02:03:32,222
SPEAKER_1:  like relatively small ball joints.

02:03:32,482 --> 02:03:34,014
SPEAKER_1:  that hold the entire thing.

02:03:34,370 --> 02:03:35,358
SPEAKER_1:  It has to land.

02:03:35,906 --> 02:03:38,334
SPEAKER_1:  very precisely on these these mounts.

02:03:38,722 --> 02:03:44,894
SPEAKER_1:  then onto the launch mount. And that's what's going to just place it back onto the stand and allow it to be refueled. And that's what's going to just place it back onto the stand

02:03:45,634 --> 02:03:46,142
SPEAKER_1:  Fly again.

02:03:46,306 --> 02:03:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  What's the idea of using the arms versus having a launch pad to land?

02:03:50,914 --> 02:03:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  What's the benefit?

02:03:52,514 --> 02:04:02,078
SPEAKER_1:  you are basically removing the mass of what would be heavy landing legs and you're putting kind of that landing infrastructure onto a ground system. So you're not having to carry those landing legs into orbit.

02:04:02,786 --> 02:04:08,286
SPEAKER_0:  But it's also elevated off the ground. Is there some aspect to that where you don't have to balance the thrust and all that?

02:04:08,674 --> 02:04:09,502
SPEAKER_1:  You- you-

02:04:09,762 --> 02:04:16,446
SPEAKER_1:  You can negate some of those like there's like plume plume interactions. There's like, you know, the exhaust hitting concrete and especially with a rocket this big it's gonna

02:04:16,738 --> 02:04:20,734
SPEAKER_1:  You know, use like three Raptor engines firing, if you have them.

02:04:21,026 --> 02:04:27,870
SPEAKER_1:  firing really close to the ground, you're just gonna absolutely destroy and crater the ground, and you're gonna have to refurbish the ground and the landing pad every time.

02:04:28,450 --> 02:04:32,510
SPEAKER_1:  and you know, or have huge landing legs that are super long and tall.

02:04:33,122 --> 02:04:35,774
SPEAKER_1:  you know, to make it so it's elevated enough to not do that.

02:04:36,194 --> 02:04:38,942
SPEAKER_1:  So yeah, you're kind of, you're avoiding that.

02:04:39,202 --> 02:04:42,462
SPEAKER_1:  whole mess by catching it high enough off the ground that you don't think.

02:04:42,722 --> 02:04:45,790
SPEAKER_0:  factor that in. That's how many engines are involved in the landing.

02:04:46,018 --> 02:04:47,143
SPEAKER_0:  part is the three-ruptor.

02:04:47,143 --> 02:04:49,790
SPEAKER_1:  Well, we haven't actually, you know, we haven't to date seen...

02:04:50,018 --> 02:04:51,134
SPEAKER_1:  the exact.

02:04:51,554 --> 02:04:54,750
SPEAKER_1:  landing sequence. So it might be something like at first they might light up.

02:04:55,298 --> 02:04:58,846
SPEAKER_1:  you know, seven or something or nine or something, some number,

02:04:59,074 --> 02:05:01,790
SPEAKER_1:  accelerate quickly or decelerate quickly. Same thing.

02:05:02,178 --> 02:05:02,590
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:05:03,106 --> 02:05:03,486
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:05:03,874 --> 02:05:07,038
SPEAKER_1:  and then shut it down to three or something for a little bit more granular control.

02:05:07,554 --> 02:05:12,734
SPEAKER_1:  Because unlike Falcon 9, Starship has enough engines and variability to actually, if it needed to hover.

02:05:12,994 --> 02:05:15,326
SPEAKER_1:  you know, to maybe more precisely align itself with the pad.

02:05:15,906 --> 02:05:17,150
SPEAKER_1:  it would have that capability.

02:05:17,506 --> 02:05:20,862
SPEAKER_1:  and especially having multiple engines. You know, if you only have a single engine running.

02:05:21,154 --> 02:05:22,846
SPEAKER_1:  You can't really roll.

02:05:23,266 --> 02:05:25,758
SPEAKER_1:  You know your role access you can do pitch and yaw because the

02:05:26,114 --> 02:05:29,886
SPEAKER_1:  The engine is kind of like a rudder. It can move in two axes.

02:05:30,178 --> 02:05:32,190
SPEAKER_1:  so you can easily pitch and yaw the vehicle.

02:05:32,450 --> 02:05:35,134
SPEAKER_1:  but to actually induce roll along its vertical axis.

02:05:35,618 --> 02:05:40,222
SPEAKER_1:  You would either need auxiliary engines to roll it, or you'd need a pair of engines so they can...

02:05:40,450 --> 02:05:41,214
SPEAKER_1:  Be opposed.

02:05:41,762 --> 02:05:44,350
SPEAKER_1:  and induce role. So by having two or three running.

02:05:44,770 --> 02:05:48,798
SPEAKER_1:  they have all three axes of control that they would need, kind of like a broomstick, you know, and

02:05:49,538 --> 02:05:52,734
SPEAKER_1:  balancing a broomstick on your hand. They can just move it over and if they need to...

02:05:53,154 --> 02:05:56,958
SPEAKER_1:  align it to those landing nubs, you know, on the landing arms and stuff like that, then.

02:05:57,474 --> 02:05:58,590
SPEAKER_1:  They can do that.

02:05:59,426 --> 02:06:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  Speaking of pitching yard, the thing.

02:06:02,402 --> 02:06:04,190
SPEAKER_0:  uh... so starship flip says

02:06:04,610 --> 02:06:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  bellyflops.

02:06:05,826 --> 02:06:08,254
SPEAKER_0:  There's a interesting kind of

02:06:08,642 --> 02:06:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  Maneuver.

02:06:10,114 --> 02:06:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  on the way down to land. Can you describe that maneuver? What's involved?

02:06:14,114 --> 02:06:19,646
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so this is definitely a first. I don't think anything's tried landing like this before, but the idea is...

02:06:20,674 --> 02:06:27,262
SPEAKER_1:  When you're falling through the atmosphere, the atmosphere could actually do a lot of work for you. You're moving quickly, something is falling from space.

02:06:27,746 --> 02:06:28,894
SPEAKER_1:  There's a lot of energy involved.

02:06:29,026 --> 02:06:31,678
SPEAKER_0:  You have a really good video on this as well.

02:06:32,258 --> 02:06:34,334
SPEAKER_1:  And thank you.

02:06:34,658 --> 02:06:40,030
SPEAKER_1:  the as it's falling, you know, you can let the, you want to let the atmosphere do as much work as it can.

02:06:40,706 --> 02:06:41,790
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

02:06:42,210 --> 02:06:43,518
SPEAKER_1:  If you have a...

02:06:43,810 --> 02:06:48,158
SPEAKER_1:  Unsymmetric, you know, it's not a ball that's falling. This is some kind of object with with shape

02:06:48,674 --> 02:06:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  some, you know, and.

02:06:50,146 --> 02:06:52,926
SPEAKER_1:  one face of it is going to have more surface area than the other face

02:06:53,218 --> 02:06:55,326
SPEAKER_1:  So, you know, in the shape of like a cylinder.

02:06:55,650 --> 02:06:57,086
SPEAKER_1:  If you're falling, you know.

02:06:57,314 --> 02:06:58,910
SPEAKER_1:  Like a soda can if you're falling.

02:06:59,426 --> 02:07:00,126
SPEAKER_1:  top or bottom.

02:07:00,354 --> 02:07:02,526
SPEAKER_1:  First, it's a certain amount of surface area.

02:07:02,786 --> 02:07:05,214
SPEAKER_1:  If you flip that on its side, you actually have a lot more service area.

02:07:05,858 --> 02:07:07,646
SPEAKER_1:  So with the same exact vehicle.

02:07:07,970 --> 02:07:12,638
SPEAKER_1:  You can actually have a lot more drag. You can actually slow it down a lot more using the exact same like.

02:07:12,994 --> 02:07:14,270
SPEAKER_1:  Same atmosphere, same...

02:07:14,562 --> 02:07:15,198
SPEAKER_1:  Same vehicle.

02:07:15,522 --> 02:07:16,990
SPEAKER_1:  just by turning it 90 degrees.

02:07:17,410 --> 02:07:18,942
SPEAKER_1:  You can slow it down substantially like.

02:07:19,170 --> 02:07:20,766
SPEAKER_1:  three or four times slower.

02:07:21,506 --> 02:07:26,782
SPEAKER_1:  So that's energy that you don't have to use anywhere else. You don't have to use an engine to slow you down. You don't have to do anything else.

02:07:27,170 --> 02:07:29,982
SPEAKER_1:  So SpaceX realized, okay, if we flip this thing on its side and let it fall.

02:07:30,210 --> 02:07:33,598
SPEAKER_1:  Like a skydiver almost, you know, instead of like pencil diving into the pool, you're belly flopping.

02:07:34,786 --> 02:07:37,150
SPEAKER_1:  you're maximizing the amount of surface area.

02:07:37,570 --> 02:07:39,294
SPEAKER_1:  that's in the wind stream that's being slowed down.

02:07:39,970 --> 02:07:40,766
SPEAKER_1:  But obviously like.

02:07:41,378 --> 02:07:43,390
SPEAKER_1:  in order to land, especially if you're...

02:07:43,714 --> 02:07:46,750
SPEAKER_1:  SpaceX and you know, Elon's obsessed with like not having

02:07:47,746 --> 02:07:48,958
SPEAKER_1:  different parts, you know, he wants.

02:07:49,378 --> 02:07:50,430
SPEAKER_1:  The best part is no part.

02:07:50,722 --> 02:07:52,894
SPEAKER_1:  So if you're going to land with the engines...

02:07:53,250 --> 02:07:56,958
SPEAKER_1:  You might as well use engines that you've already have the engines that are.

02:07:57,250 --> 02:07:59,038
SPEAKER_1:  you know, used for the other portions of flight.

02:07:59,458 --> 02:08:04,766
SPEAKER_1:  So you kick those on and you use those engines to actually turn it 90 degrees from belly flopping to feet first.

02:08:05,666 --> 02:08:06,142
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:08:06,626 --> 02:08:11,230
SPEAKER_1:  That way you can use those same engines to land and you don't have to have auxiliary landing engines.

02:08:11,650 --> 02:08:12,510
SPEAKER_1:  You don't have to have.

02:08:12,802 --> 02:08:21,438
SPEAKER_1:  forces, you know, even if you were to land like on its belly with a separate set of engines, not only would those engines weigh a lot, you know, and be extra complexity, etc, etc.

02:08:21,762 --> 02:08:24,126
SPEAKER_1:  but you also don't have to make the ship be able to handle.

02:08:24,610 --> 02:08:28,126
SPEAKER_1:  landing, you know, like on its belly, as opposed to having the forces be vertical through it.

02:08:29,090 --> 02:08:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  It's a giant thing. You have to...

02:08:31,970 --> 02:08:37,662
SPEAKER_0:  Rotate in the air. Huge. As you also highlight, there's liquid fuel.

02:08:38,050 --> 02:08:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  slushing around.

02:08:39,586 --> 02:08:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  in the tank.

02:08:41,186 --> 02:08:42,302
SPEAKER_0:  It's like you can't.

02:08:42,594 --> 02:08:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  uh

02:08:43,330 --> 02:08:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  I guess use that fuel directly after another kind of fuel. Like there's just complexities there. Yeah. They're involved. Uh, plus.

02:08:50,306 --> 02:08:51,806
SPEAKER_0:  the actual maneuver.

02:08:52,418 --> 02:08:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  It's difficult from the like, like what are the thrusters that actually make that?

02:08:57,122 --> 02:08:59,774
SPEAKER_0:  make all that happen. You're adding a lot of-

02:09:00,450 --> 02:09:03,518
SPEAKER_0:  complexity, not a lot, but you're.

02:09:04,066 --> 02:09:05,598
SPEAKER_0:  complexity to the maneuver.

02:09:06,082 --> 02:09:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  and possibility where failure could happen.

02:09:08,546 --> 02:09:10,526
SPEAKER_0:  in order to sort of save.

02:09:10,882 --> 02:09:12,606
SPEAKER_0:  in order for the air to do.

02:09:13,122 --> 02:09:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  some of the work.

02:09:14,338 --> 02:09:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  So what is some of that complexity? Just you can linger on it.

02:09:18,210 --> 02:09:20,798
SPEAKER_1:  You know, if you think about what it's gonna take to go from.

02:09:21,410 --> 02:09:22,398
SPEAKER_1:  horizontal to vertical.

02:09:22,850 --> 02:09:23,198
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:09:23,490 --> 02:09:26,686
SPEAKER_1:  This rocket in particular, Starship has these big flaps.

02:09:27,042 --> 02:09:28,862
SPEAKER_1:  So it has kind of two nose flaps and two.

02:09:29,154 --> 02:09:30,366
SPEAKER_1:  rearward flaps.

02:09:30,818 --> 02:09:37,598
SPEAKER_1:  The river flaps are a lot bigger because the majority of the mass, the engines and stuff are in the back of the vehicle. So in order to kind of be stable.

02:09:37,954 --> 02:09:42,462
SPEAKER_1:  and they just fold themselves inwards, like on their dihedral angle.

02:09:42,754 --> 02:09:44,062
SPEAKER_1:  at a dihedral angle in order to...

02:09:44,482 --> 02:09:47,678
SPEAKER_1:  increase or decrease the drag. So you can control it.

02:09:48,002 --> 02:09:50,270
SPEAKER_1:  All three axes of control while it's falling.

02:09:50,946 --> 02:09:54,718
SPEAKER_1:  you know, on its belly, you can control it that way using these four different fins.

02:09:55,458 --> 02:09:58,078
SPEAKER_1:  So you have these giant moving surfaces that take.

02:09:58,626 --> 02:10:04,766
SPEAKER_1:  Thousands of horsepower is just insane amount of torque in order to move these quickly enough to be a valid control surface

02:10:05,506 --> 02:10:10,942
SPEAKER_1:  So that's a huge complication, moving these fins and developing that landing algorithm and the control.

02:10:11,522 --> 02:10:15,934
SPEAKER_1:  four of a huge vehicle with flaps going like, you know, in and out, in and out, in and out.

02:10:16,258 --> 02:10:16,862
SPEAKER_1:  Stay stable.

02:10:17,474 --> 02:10:19,518
SPEAKER_1:  Then, right as you light the engines...

02:10:19,810 --> 02:10:21,214
SPEAKER_1:  Now all of a sudden you want the top.

02:10:21,826 --> 02:10:25,726
SPEAKER_1:  You know, you want to flip the rock at 90 degrees the rearward flaps, the bottom flaps.

02:10:26,082 --> 02:10:27,998
SPEAKER_1:  They tuck all the way in to minimize drag.

02:10:28,290 --> 02:10:30,238
SPEAKER_1:  That's gonna make it wanna swing down.

02:10:30,498 --> 02:10:33,502
SPEAKER_1:  You extend the upper flaps, that makes it so the nose wants to pitch up.

02:10:34,050 --> 02:10:35,198
SPEAKER_1:  You kick on the engines.

02:10:35,586 --> 02:10:42,686
SPEAKER_1:  They're now lighting all three engines, at least as of the last successful attempts. They light all three of the sea level Raptor engines and they're pitched.

02:10:43,042 --> 02:10:47,614
SPEAKER_1:  all the way like, you know, 10 or 15 degrees or whatever the maximum pitch is on them.

02:10:47,906 --> 02:10:49,310
SPEAKER_1:  and that induces, you know.

02:10:49,794 --> 02:10:53,182
SPEAKER_1:  It does that kick maneuver to kick it over from horizontal to vertical.

02:10:53,922 --> 02:10:56,670
SPEAKER_1:  Now the problem is you lit your engines while you're horizontal.

02:10:57,186 --> 02:10:57,790
SPEAKER_1:  So they.

02:10:58,466 --> 02:11:01,502
SPEAKER_1:  put some horizontal velocity into the rocket. Push the rocket.

02:11:01,986 --> 02:11:05,406
SPEAKER_1:  You know, at the time the nose is at the time of lighting those engines, the nose is.

02:11:05,666 --> 02:11:07,326
SPEAKER_1:  facing the horizon and the engines are facing.

02:11:07,682 --> 02:11:08,766
SPEAKER_1:  The opposite horizon.

02:11:09,090 --> 02:11:11,582
SPEAKER_1:  See now shot it a decent amount in.

02:11:12,258 --> 02:11:14,974
SPEAKER_1:  and often, you know, the direction that you're not falling, you know.

02:11:15,586 --> 02:11:17,246
SPEAKER_1:  So you have to factor that in.

02:11:18,018 --> 02:11:25,502
SPEAKER_1:  to where you're landing, because you're gonna land on this precise, in this case you're gonna land on the inside the arm, the loving arms of the chopsticks, the Creed arms wide open.

02:11:25,858 --> 02:11:26,983
SPEAKER_1:  You're gonna try to land inside the...

02:11:26,983 --> 02:11:35,835
SPEAKER_0:  Exactly the song that you're playing through my head as I watch this now. Thank you. Thank you for forever joining those two. I appreciate this.

02:11:35,835 --> 02:11:42,174
SPEAKER_1:  And you have to very precisely control. So what you have to do is now that it's done that kick, you also have to cancel out that horizontal.

02:11:42,562 --> 02:11:45,662
SPEAKER_1:  So it's actually going to rotate beyond 90 degrees.

02:11:46,722 --> 02:11:48,350
SPEAKER_1:  cancel out that horizontal velocity.

02:11:49,186 --> 02:11:49,726
SPEAKER_1:  And then...

02:11:50,338 --> 02:11:53,566
SPEAKER_1:  modulate the engines to make it so the thrust is perfect.

02:11:54,210 --> 02:11:54,686
SPEAKER_1:  so that it can.

02:11:54,914 --> 02:11:56,766
SPEAKER_1:  control itself into a control landing.

02:11:57,378 --> 02:11:58,526
SPEAKER_1:  And all this is done in like...

02:11:59,074 --> 02:12:00,766
SPEAKER_1:  500 meters, like 1500 feet.

02:12:01,058 --> 02:12:03,070
SPEAKER_1:  You know, you're doing all of those things.

02:12:03,554 --> 02:12:07,870
SPEAKER_1:  stupidly close to the ground. It looks absurd. So far they've done five of these tests.

02:12:08,514 --> 02:12:10,590
SPEAKER_1:  All the first four all.

02:12:10,850 --> 02:12:11,294
SPEAKER_1:  blew up.

02:12:11,586 --> 02:12:12,286
SPEAKER_1:  you know.

02:12:12,578 --> 02:12:15,678
SPEAKER_1:  They're all coming in from about 10 kilometers or 33,000 feet.

02:12:16,226 --> 02:12:16,542
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:12:17,410 --> 02:12:21,630
SPEAKER_1:  falling, flipping, you know, again, this thing is huge. That just the booster or just the upper stage of this.

02:12:22,082 --> 02:12:24,190
SPEAKER_1:  is like 50 meters tall.

02:12:24,450 --> 02:12:29,854
SPEAKER_1:  You know, so it's 150, it's like 45 meters, about 50 meters tall, about 165 feet tall.

02:12:30,210 --> 02:12:33,598
SPEAKER_1:  Nine meters wide, so 30 feet wide. Hit ways, you know, something like.

02:12:34,210 --> 02:12:39,422
SPEAKER_1:  God, I don't remember if it's something like 120 metric tons, so 120,000 kilograms.

02:12:39,842 --> 02:12:41,598
SPEAKER_1:  quarter of a million pounds empty.

02:12:42,082 --> 02:12:43,486
SPEAKER_1:  and it's doing this flip maneuver.

02:12:43,842 --> 02:12:44,862
SPEAKER_1:  and it has to do all this.

02:12:45,154 --> 02:12:47,454
SPEAKER_1:  Perfectly, so the first four attempts of this were...

02:12:47,778 --> 02:12:49,653
SPEAKER_1:  Pretty spectacular failures. So just.

02:12:49,653 --> 02:12:51,153
SPEAKER_0:  to clarify which stage is doing.

02:12:51,153 --> 02:12:53,918
SPEAKER_1:  maneuver. It's the upper stage is doing this belly flop maneuver.

02:12:54,530 --> 02:12:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  So this is the stage.

02:12:57,570 --> 02:12:59,006
SPEAKER_0:  that would presumably

02:12:59,746 --> 02:13:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  Um,

02:13:00,514 --> 02:13:02,389
SPEAKER_0:  have humans on board if we were to use.

02:13:02,389 --> 02:13:03,454
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:13:03,746 --> 02:13:07,966
SPEAKER_1:  if things continue to play. Now here's something I would love to see.

02:13:08,482 --> 02:13:09,566
SPEAKER_1:  Just saying this. Grow nosy and just admit it, stuff's going to climb, yeah.

02:13:09,986 --> 02:13:12,990
SPEAKER_1:  If you already have these big arrow surfaces, the flaps.

02:13:13,474 --> 02:13:17,406
SPEAKER_1:  They also have to move. They're on heavy motors and hinges and flaps and all that stuff.

02:13:18,114 --> 02:13:19,966
SPEAKER_1:  I'm actually surprised that for Earth...

02:13:20,770 --> 02:13:23,710
SPEAKER_1:  They aren't just looking at landing it horizontally on a runway like space shuttle.

02:13:26,050 --> 02:13:28,446
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, that worked. The brawn did it.

02:13:28,738 --> 02:13:30,078
SPEAKER_1:  the Soviet Union's Iran.

02:13:30,626 --> 02:13:35,171
SPEAKER_1:  I rolled my art real hard there, sorry. Wow, wow. Really good.

02:13:35,171 --> 02:13:35,921
SPEAKER_0:  Very impressed.

02:13:35,921 --> 02:13:43,806
SPEAKER_1:  I'm very impressed. The brown did it. We have other space planes like the X-37B. We have the upcoming Sierra Nevada's Dream Chaser.

02:13:44,130 --> 02:13:44,798
SPEAKER_1:  It's...

02:13:45,186 --> 02:13:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, you have some extra mass in the wings, but so does Starship. Starship has the extra mass of those flaps.

02:13:50,594 --> 02:13:51,966
SPEAKER_1:  And you know, the, the.

02:13:52,322 --> 02:13:54,046
SPEAKER_1:  the motors and the hinges and all that stuff. I-

02:13:54,530 --> 02:13:57,918
SPEAKER_1:  I would like to see the trade on like, is it actually lighter weight?

02:13:59,042 --> 02:14:01,758
SPEAKER_1:  to do that versus doing what SpaceX is doing.

02:14:03,330 --> 02:14:07,774
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean that's the funny thing. I think realistically if Elon walks in the door tomorrow and says

02:14:08,162 --> 02:14:10,334
SPEAKER_1:  Guys, we did some simulations and actually it's like...

02:14:10,850 --> 02:14:16,446
SPEAKER_1:  we can get another 5,000 kilograms into space if we just land at horizontal, if we kind of give up on our ego and land horizontally.

02:14:16,802 --> 02:14:17,662
SPEAKER_1:  At least on Earth.

02:14:18,274 --> 02:14:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  then you know...

02:14:19,394 --> 02:14:22,430
SPEAKER_1:  I think they could be doing that pretty quickly. Because that's the thing is-

02:14:22,946 --> 02:14:29,022
SPEAKER_1:  uh... that's all that things been to land on mars and you know other planets and mars doesn't have a runway doesn't have

02:14:29,410 --> 02:14:35,166
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, you know, thick enough atmosphere to utilize aerodynamic flight like that. So you have to do propulsive landing for Mars.

02:14:35,714 --> 02:14:40,958
SPEAKER_1:  You're going to land on an unprepared surface, you know, so it has to be able to do this at some point.

02:14:41,346 --> 02:14:43,422
SPEAKER_1:  The ultimate- it sounds ridiculous.

02:14:43,874 --> 02:14:44,446
SPEAKER_1:  And it is.

02:14:45,026 --> 02:14:47,198
SPEAKER_1:  but the ultimate goal of it is to land on Mars.

02:14:47,362 --> 02:14:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  There's not much of an atmosphere to like.

02:14:49,634 --> 02:14:52,519
SPEAKER_0:  to help you with the belly flop.

02:14:52,519 --> 02:15:01,982
SPEAKER_1:  There's only 1% the atmosphere on Mars as there is on Earth, but you still want to utilize as much of that atmosphere as possible. So in the upper atmosphere it's still going to be...

02:15:02,338 --> 02:15:03,454
SPEAKER_1:  coming in more or less.

02:15:04,578 --> 02:15:07,326
SPEAKER_1:  kind of perpendicular to their stream. I guess it's probably more like.

02:15:07,714 --> 02:15:08,062
SPEAKER_1:  Enough.

02:15:08,578 --> 02:15:12,158
SPEAKER_1:  60 degrees, 70 degrees to the airstream, like where it's belly flopping.

02:15:12,610 --> 02:15:17,086
SPEAKER_1:  And it's going to especially do that on Mars. It's going to need to use up as.

02:15:17,858 --> 02:15:21,534
SPEAKER_1:  the little bit of atmosphere there is, you're coming in at insane velocities.

02:15:21,922 --> 02:15:25,086
SPEAKER_1:  And so even that 1% thin atmosphere is still going to do a lot of work.

02:15:25,570 --> 02:15:26,110
SPEAKER_1:  Now...

02:15:26,338 --> 02:15:28,606
SPEAKER_1:  on mars that there's only thirty eight percent

02:15:28,930 --> 02:15:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  of Earth's gravity on Mars.

02:15:31,170 --> 02:15:35,102
SPEAKER_1:  the belly flop maneuvers a lot, it could be a lot more conservative. You could do that at like.

02:15:35,586 --> 02:15:36,734
SPEAKER_1:  5,000 feet up.

02:15:37,314 --> 02:15:39,934
SPEAKER_1:  And it just wouldn't matter as much because there's not as much.

02:15:40,194 --> 02:15:43,358
SPEAKER_1:  gravity loss or gravity drag. So you can kind of just more slowly, gently.

02:15:43,810 --> 02:15:46,398
SPEAKER_1:  You know, you don't have to do this crazy extravagant like-

02:15:47,042 --> 02:15:48,830
SPEAKER_1:  belly flop, you know, flip maneuver.

02:15:49,378 --> 02:15:56,190
SPEAKER_1:  But it would still something at some point you would transition from more or less perpendicular to the airstream to you know a horizontal to

02:15:56,770 --> 02:15:57,630
SPEAKER_1:  Landing vertically.

02:15:58,050 --> 02:16:04,606
SPEAKER_0:  I like how we're having this old boring conversation about the differences of landing on Earth versus on Mars.

02:16:04,962 --> 02:16:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, this is surreal.

02:16:07,714 --> 02:16:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  that this is actually a real conversation.

02:16:10,818 --> 02:16:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  that this is something that we're discussing.

02:16:13,858 --> 02:16:15,390
SPEAKER_0:  because it has to do both.

02:16:16,578 --> 02:16:21,374
SPEAKER_1:  But in my opinion, I think we'll pretty quickly see an evolution of Starship that's like...

02:16:21,858 --> 02:16:23,998
SPEAKER_1:  dedicated versions for certain tasks.

02:16:24,610 --> 02:16:25,726
SPEAKER_1:  And at the end of the day...

02:16:26,242 --> 02:16:31,006
SPEAKER_1:  Again, if someone runs a simulation and says it's actually more efficient and...

02:16:31,330 --> 02:16:33,854
SPEAKER_1:  It's better just to land horizontally on a runway.

02:16:34,146 --> 02:16:35,550
SPEAKER_1:  then that's what's gonna happen.

02:16:35,810 --> 02:16:36,254
SPEAKER_1:  You know, it.

02:16:36,834 --> 02:16:37,790
SPEAKER_1:  It doesn't matter, but...

02:16:38,242 --> 02:16:42,014
SPEAKER_1:  they still will develop. If the ultimate goal is to land on Mars, then they'll have a dedicated.

02:16:42,498 --> 02:16:43,678
SPEAKER_1:  Mars variant, you know?

02:16:44,066 --> 02:16:45,406
SPEAKER_1:  which will likely look different then.

02:16:45,922 --> 02:16:49,342
SPEAKER_1:  the earth variant, you know, and they'll still probably be launched on the same booster.

02:16:50,114 --> 02:16:52,295
SPEAKER_1:  You know what I mean? Oh, you mean like that?

02:16:52,295 --> 02:16:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  particular vehicle will not be returning back to Earth, it'll need to be modified.

02:16:57,058 --> 02:17:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  Cause the ultimate is to have one starship that goes to Mars, lands on Mars and takes off of Mars.

02:17:02,498 --> 02:17:04,798
SPEAKER_0:  lands back on earth and is reused again.

02:17:04,994 --> 02:17:09,886
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. Over and over and over. And there's a chance that you, you know, you have just a cycler, just a.

02:17:10,498 --> 02:17:10,846
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

02:17:11,106 --> 02:17:14,910
SPEAKER_1:  If you're, at the end of the day, you're just really trying to see what is most feasible, what's the most-

02:17:15,138 --> 02:17:19,390
SPEAKER_1:  Efficient. You literally have a vehicle dedicated to Mars. Mars is easy to do with single-stage orbit.

02:17:19,810 --> 02:17:22,046
SPEAKER_1:  It's a lot lower gravity, a lot thinner atmosphere.

02:17:22,466 --> 02:17:24,638
SPEAKER_1:  You can easily do a single stage orbit. You get into orbit.

02:17:25,410 --> 02:17:32,478
SPEAKER_1:  to a dedicated, you know, transfer vehicle that goes between Earth and Mars. It only stays in space. You don't have heat shields. You don't have landing legs. You don't have...

02:17:33,026 --> 02:17:36,926
SPEAKER_1:  all these things that you need. And ideally it's nuclear powered, so it's super efficient.

02:17:37,538 --> 02:17:42,110
SPEAKER_1:  That gets you back to Earth. Once you're at Earth, you rendezvous again with another landing starship.

02:17:42,530 --> 02:17:44,574
SPEAKER_1:  And that starship might be horizontal.

02:17:44,898 --> 02:17:46,590
SPEAKER_1:  Runway Starship, you know, like, yeah.

02:17:46,914 --> 02:17:49,854
SPEAKER_1:  There's no, I don't see the, and I think ultimately.

02:17:50,114 --> 02:17:53,022
SPEAKER_1:  it'll win out where we don't have a one size fits all. I think that's.

02:17:53,442 --> 02:17:56,510
SPEAKER_1:  That's the flaw of the space shuttle really is that it was trying to do everything.

02:17:56,962 --> 02:17:58,558
SPEAKER_1:  and ended up kind of doing nothing well.

02:17:59,074 --> 02:18:06,366
SPEAKER_1:  But that's, I think with SpaceX has proven, I mean, SpaceX already has variants coming. There's already going to be a dedicated lunar lander for NASA for the Artemis program.

02:18:06,818 --> 02:18:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  There's already going to be.

02:18:08,002 --> 02:18:09,982
SPEAKER_1:  a tanker variant. There's already going to be

02:18:10,242 --> 02:18:16,414
SPEAKER_1:  likely just a pure cargo version. There's likely going to be a human version. We'll likely see evolutions of this thing happen.

02:18:16,674 --> 02:18:18,142
SPEAKER_1:  you know, relatively quickly.

02:18:18,786 --> 02:18:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  And once it's all working, it's only a matter of weeks before.

02:18:22,914 --> 02:18:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  people riding on it will be complaining about the speed of the wifi.

02:18:27,138 --> 02:18:27,838
SPEAKER_0:  Hehehehe

02:18:28,290 --> 02:18:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  as the old like, uh, Lucy K joke with like...

02:18:31,042 --> 02:18:34,686
SPEAKER_0:  where you're flying on a chair through the air.

02:18:35,010 --> 02:18:39,006
SPEAKER_1:  It's incredible. You didn't even know this existed, and now you're complaining about it.

02:18:39,650 --> 02:18:41,054
SPEAKER_1:  That's great. Exactly.

02:18:41,154 --> 02:18:44,222
SPEAKER_0:  So you yeah, you tweeted fun fact about Starship

02:18:44,610 --> 02:18:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  by doing the.

02:18:46,306 --> 02:18:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  Flip around 500 meters versus higher up like two.

02:18:49,218 --> 02:18:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  2000 meters the difference

02:18:51,618 --> 02:18:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  in Delta V is.

02:18:53,346 --> 02:18:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  500 meters per second.

02:18:56,130 --> 02:19:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  That's a 20 ton fuel saving, which means basically 20 tons more you can put into orbit. That's more than Falcon 9 has ever launched.

02:19:04,930 --> 02:19:06,622
SPEAKER_0:  just by flipping later.

02:19:07,106 --> 02:19:11,422
SPEAKER_0:  That's really interesting. So that was the decision too, to flip close to the ground. Yeah...

02:19:12,130 --> 02:19:15,742
SPEAKER_1:  The closer to the ground, the better. The more again, the more the atmosphere is doing work.

02:19:16,258 --> 02:19:22,238
SPEAKER_1:  And, you know, we get into that video really dives into like gravity losses and gravity drag. The more time you're spent.

02:19:22,722 --> 02:19:25,118
SPEAKER_1:  every second that your rocket engine is running.

02:19:25,538 --> 02:19:28,254
SPEAKER_1:  Earth is stealing 9.8 meters per second of acceleration.

02:19:29,154 --> 02:19:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  There's just inherently 9.8 meters per second squared of acceleration.

02:19:32,802 --> 02:19:34,686
SPEAKER_1:  So every second that engine is running.

02:19:35,330 --> 02:19:40,286
SPEAKER_1:  the first big majority of your thrust is actually being just stolen by Earth's gravity.

02:19:41,122 --> 02:19:43,102
SPEAKER_1:  So if you're, the longer you're fighting that.

02:19:43,458 --> 02:19:47,102
SPEAKER_1:  the more inefficient it is. So the best thing would be you flip.

02:19:48,066 --> 02:19:55,582
SPEAKER_1:  you know, 100 meters off the ground, you light all your engines to maximum thrust and you pull 50 Gs, you know, you land on a dime basically.

02:19:55,842 --> 02:19:57,758
SPEAKER_1:  Obviously there's no margin there.

02:19:58,242 --> 02:20:02,206
SPEAKER_1:  And there's diminishing returns on that gravity loss thing in your high thrust weight ratios.

02:20:02,594 --> 02:20:09,438
SPEAKER_1:  So that's a pretty good compromise. Yes, it looks scary, but they could be a lot more aggressive with that yet and squeeze out even a little bit better performance.

02:20:09,858 --> 02:20:13,950
SPEAKER_1:  but there are diminishing returns. So that's kind of the magic number we've seen so far today.

02:20:14,402 --> 02:20:15,294
SPEAKER_1:  but we'll likely see that.

02:20:15,618 --> 02:20:16,350
SPEAKER_1:  you know, be played with.

02:20:17,506 --> 02:20:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  You've attended some of these, what does it feel like to see Starship in person? First of all, when it's just sitting there stacked.

02:20:23,938 --> 02:20:25,182
SPEAKER_0:  And second of all...

02:20:25,698 --> 02:20:28,702
SPEAKER_0:  One is doing some of these tests, some of these maneuvers.

02:20:29,506 --> 02:20:34,686
SPEAKER_1:  Well, first off, if you have the freedom of traveling and happen to live within a reasonable.

02:20:35,362 --> 02:20:36,510
SPEAKER_1:  either by playing or.

02:20:36,898 --> 02:20:44,830
SPEAKER_1:  car, it's worth going down to South Texas. So Starbase is right on the border of Mexico and the United States and very southern tip of Texas.

02:20:45,250 --> 02:20:46,686
SPEAKER_1:  right along the Rio Grande.

02:20:47,170 --> 02:20:48,318
SPEAKER_1:  And it's.

02:20:48,610 --> 02:20:51,422
SPEAKER_1:  It's insane because it's right along a public highway.

02:20:51,810 --> 02:20:56,766
SPEAKER_1:  You can literally anyone can drive down this assuming it's not closed for testing because they do close the highways

02:20:57,314 --> 02:20:59,262
SPEAKER_1:  during the week a decent amount while they're doing tests.

02:20:59,906 --> 02:21:00,286
SPEAKER_1:  but...

02:21:00,930 --> 02:21:02,110
SPEAKER_1:  sans any of those days.

02:21:02,690 --> 02:21:06,974
SPEAKER_1:  anyone can just drive down and see these things up close and personal with their own eyes. Like we're talking-

02:21:07,298 --> 02:21:07,998
SPEAKER_1:  you know, from.

02:21:08,898 --> 02:21:10,270
SPEAKER_1:  100, 200 meters away.

02:21:10,562 --> 02:21:13,822
SPEAKER_1:  You know, so two football fields away from the world's biggest, most powerful rocket.

02:21:14,242 --> 02:21:15,262
SPEAKER_1:  Imagine being able to do that.

02:21:15,650 --> 02:21:18,878
SPEAKER_1:  during the Soviet Union and during the...

02:21:19,330 --> 02:21:23,614
SPEAKER_1:  N1 and Saturn V, you know, I imagine it's been able to drive up right next to the launch pad.

02:21:24,162 --> 02:21:25,182
SPEAKER_1:  There's no way.

02:21:25,762 --> 02:21:26,718
SPEAKER_1:  You know, and so.

02:21:27,554 --> 02:21:30,526
SPEAKER_1:  To have this kind of access to this program is so.

02:21:31,138 --> 02:21:32,574
SPEAKER_1:  Incredible, the craziest thing is when you.

02:21:33,154 --> 02:21:35,582
SPEAKER_1:  When you're driving out on Highway 4, it's...

02:21:36,706 --> 02:21:42,878
SPEAKER_1:  bumpy. It's riddled with potholes now because of all the insane amount of trucks having to go out there and traffic and

02:21:43,266 --> 02:21:48,286
SPEAKER_1:  You're going through this, it's just this weird, you're like, where am I? You occasionally are seeing, like you can kind of see that.

02:21:48,546 --> 02:21:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, you can see Mexico out your right window as you're driving down this highway, you know, you're just sitting there.

02:21:52,802 --> 02:21:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  Where am I? So you kind of turn this corner.

02:21:55,426 --> 02:21:58,398
SPEAKER_1:  and the trees and the brush kind of clear out and all of a sudden you get a sense of

02:21:58,818 --> 02:22:03,102
SPEAKER_1:  everything on the horizon. At that point, you're pretty much five miles on the nose or eight kilometers away.

02:22:03,714 --> 02:22:07,294
SPEAKER_1:  And from there, you can just see through the heat haze.

02:22:07,618 --> 02:22:10,366
SPEAKER_1:  through the atmospheric distortion.

02:22:10,850 --> 02:22:12,030
SPEAKER_1:  You just see this weird like.

02:22:12,770 --> 02:22:15,006
SPEAKER_1:  It looks like a city almost on the horizon, you know?

02:22:16,034 --> 02:22:17,406
SPEAKER_1:  tons of these tall buildings.

02:22:17,698 --> 02:22:20,734
SPEAKER_1:  There's a weird ominous launch tower thing.

02:22:20,994 --> 02:22:22,174
SPEAKER_1:  with arms wide open.

02:22:22,466 --> 02:22:22,878
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:22:23,330 --> 02:22:26,110
SPEAKER_1:  sometimes, and, you know, a giant metal rocket.

02:22:26,754 --> 02:22:28,094
SPEAKER_1:  And it just looks.

02:22:28,770 --> 02:22:29,182
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:22:29,794 --> 02:22:30,206
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:22:30,306 --> 02:22:32,414
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, it's...

02:22:32,738 --> 02:22:35,294
SPEAKER_1:  The word surreal, I think by definition, I think a few.

02:22:35,746 --> 02:22:37,086
SPEAKER_1:  are expecting it, it's not.

02:22:37,442 --> 02:22:40,990
SPEAKER_1:  Surreal, I think surreal kind of means like unexpected surprise or whatever, you know.

02:22:41,602 --> 02:22:46,238
SPEAKER_1:  Even if you're expecting it, even if you've seen pictures, even if everything, it is surreal.

02:22:47,298 --> 02:22:48,606
SPEAKER_1:  You stand there and you just go.

02:22:48,802 --> 02:22:49,150
SPEAKER_0:  Why?

02:22:49,698 --> 02:22:50,494
SPEAKER_0:  is this.

02:22:50,978 --> 02:22:54,270
SPEAKER_0:  And also, I mean, there's a kind of...

02:22:55,362 --> 02:23:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  magical aspect to the this is the place where over the next few years we'll start

02:23:01,058 --> 02:23:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  as a human species reaching out there.

02:23:04,258 --> 02:23:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  at traveling out there.

02:23:05,730 --> 02:23:10,974
SPEAKER_1:  We'll for sure see the development of the rockets that I think will take us further than ever before.

02:23:11,682 --> 02:23:12,670
SPEAKER_1:  be born right there.

02:23:13,314 --> 02:23:18,462
SPEAKER_0:  What's it like to witness the actual testing of Starship?

02:23:19,682 --> 02:23:20,926
SPEAKER_1:  So far it's been...

02:23:21,282 --> 02:23:22,174
SPEAKER_1:  high stakes.

02:23:23,554 --> 02:23:33,278
SPEAKER_1:  It's been insane because the first site I mentioned earlier, there's been S and 8, 9, 10, 11, and 15 that have all done these suborbital hops. The highest one went 12.5 kilometers and then...

02:23:33,538 --> 02:23:34,526
SPEAKER_1:  The rest of the four went.

02:23:34,754 --> 02:23:36,254
SPEAKER_1:  10 kilometers in altitude.

02:23:36,578 --> 02:23:38,334
SPEAKER_1:  and then turned off the engines and just fell.

02:23:39,010 --> 02:23:40,638
SPEAKER_1:  Now the cool thing about that is.

02:23:41,154 --> 02:23:44,958
SPEAKER_1:  The general public could be about five miles away, so again, like eight kilometers away.

02:23:45,698 --> 02:23:47,550
SPEAKER_1:  And the weird thing is this rocket's...

02:23:47,778 --> 02:23:49,470
SPEAKER_1:  slowly accelerating.

02:23:50,146 --> 02:23:57,822
SPEAKER_1:  They didn't want to exceed a certain speed, so they didn't have to worry about the aerodynamics of it. They just slowly climbed, and it probably also appeased the FAA. They're like, here, we'll just...

02:23:58,338 --> 02:24:00,126
SPEAKER_1:  limit the thrust to weight ratio and just.

02:24:00,482 --> 02:24:03,006
SPEAKER_1:  You know, make it so it's slow and controlled, no big deal.

02:24:03,778 --> 02:24:07,230
SPEAKER_1:  So it's basically more or less like slightly above a hover, just climbing.

02:24:07,554 --> 02:24:11,102
SPEAKER_1:  for minutes, for like four or five minutes, to hear.

02:24:11,362 --> 02:24:12,510
SPEAKER_1:  and feel the roar of this thing.

02:24:12,866 --> 02:24:13,854
SPEAKER_1:  Normal rockets like

02:24:14,306 --> 02:24:15,934
SPEAKER_1:  After the first 30 seconds or minute.

02:24:16,354 --> 02:24:17,886
SPEAKER_1:  You know, they're so far away.

02:24:18,338 --> 02:24:26,814
SPEAKER_1:  that you're just diminishing, you know, it's just fading, fading, fading, fading. You still get that rumble, that sense, but those first five flights, the suborbital hops were.

02:24:27,586 --> 02:24:30,974
SPEAKER_1:  Just I'll cherish them forever because you just you're watching this thing.

02:24:31,458 --> 02:24:32,766
SPEAKER_1:  that you've driven up next to.

02:24:33,250 --> 02:24:37,662
SPEAKER_1:  You've seen it with your own eyes. That's bigger than most buildings in a, you know.

02:24:38,082 --> 02:24:39,806
SPEAKER_1:  fairly dense urban area.

02:24:40,066 --> 02:24:41,598
SPEAKER_1:  You know, it's this massive thing.

02:24:41,922 --> 02:24:47,326
SPEAKER_1:  You stand there, you stood there, you look at it, you're like, wow, that's crazy. You've seen people working on it, they're little ants compared to it.

02:24:47,842 --> 02:24:52,318
SPEAKER_1:  Then you drive away and you see it on the horizon and all of a sudden that thing leaves. It starts moving.

02:24:52,482 --> 02:24:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  hovering.

02:24:53,186 --> 02:24:54,334
SPEAKER_0:  hovering essentially

02:24:54,434 --> 02:24:56,318
SPEAKER_1:  And the first time, I mean...

02:24:57,090 --> 02:25:05,278
SPEAKER_1:  You know, you put for me at least I put my hands on my head when I just I can't help it. I'm not it's not so I don't know. It's surreal. Like you said.

02:25:05,986 --> 02:25:11,390
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know what in human nature decides this is what to do when you can't believe something but that's what happens.

02:25:11,810 --> 02:25:14,110
SPEAKER_1:  And when that thing first took off, it was just like.

02:25:14,466 --> 02:25:16,766
SPEAKER_1:  My brain couldn't process.

02:25:17,538 --> 02:25:18,814
SPEAKER_1:  seeing, you know, because I had spent.

02:25:19,298 --> 02:25:23,134
SPEAKER_1:  so much time driving around and seeing it and all of a sudden you're watching it just take off and you're like

02:25:23,810 --> 02:25:29,246
SPEAKER_1:  moving and all these you know most complicated rocket engines ever made are all firing simultaneously

02:25:29,538 --> 02:25:32,606
SPEAKER_1:  and it didn't blow up on the launch pad slowly increasing

02:25:33,186 --> 02:25:35,678
SPEAKER_1:  And it's just crazy and the sound that.

02:25:36,450 --> 02:25:38,174
SPEAKER_1:  everything about it. And so by the time

02:25:38,402 --> 02:25:41,470
SPEAKER_1:  The first one specifically is December.

02:25:42,050 --> 02:25:42,494
SPEAKER_1:

02:25:42,722 --> 02:25:43,198
SPEAKER_1:  20.

02:25:43,490 --> 02:25:44,254
SPEAKER_1:  was the first.

02:25:44,738 --> 02:25:45,598
SPEAKER_1:  uh, SN8.

02:25:46,434 --> 02:25:46,942
SPEAKER_1:  It

02:25:47,170 --> 02:25:50,782
SPEAKER_1:  went up and I actually, we all lost it in the sky. We couldn't.

02:25:51,042 --> 02:25:53,694
SPEAKER_1:  quite see it but our we had telescopes and

02:25:53,954 --> 02:25:56,094
SPEAKER_1:  you know, high telephoto lenses tracking it.

02:25:56,770 --> 02:26:00,190
SPEAKER_1:  And what's funny is there's a pretty strong wind up there at altitude.

02:26:01,058 --> 02:26:03,134
SPEAKER_1:  And it was moving, there's a lot of.

02:26:03,682 --> 02:26:06,270
SPEAKER_1:  gaseous oxygen being vented out of the rocket.

02:26:06,530 --> 02:26:08,222
SPEAKER_1:  and it's being blown by this air.

02:26:08,578 --> 02:26:11,454
SPEAKER_1:  So it looks like it's moving actually quite quickly.

02:26:12,098 --> 02:26:14,494
SPEAKER_1:  Away from us like a strafing to one side.

02:26:15,042 --> 02:26:18,142
SPEAKER_1:  So I'm watching the monitor, I'm going, Oh my God, they're moving it like.

02:26:18,722 --> 02:26:28,830
SPEAKER_1:  over Brownsville and we're all, all of us, everyone on this, this hotel balcony is looking out down like way out over, you know, and we can't find it. We're like.

02:26:29,634 --> 02:26:33,662
SPEAKER_1:  they lose it like we're thinking like, oh my God, this is going to crash down in Brownsville.

02:26:34,626 --> 02:26:35,038
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:26:35,618 --> 02:26:40,094
SPEAKER_1:  And finally they shut the engines off and we're watching it fall. And again, we're tracking it. No, it's falling.

02:26:40,642 --> 02:26:44,382
SPEAKER_1:  and it's falling, falling, falling, it's falling, super controlled and we're like, Oh my God, this is perfect.

02:26:44,994 --> 02:26:46,878
SPEAKER_1:  and all of a sudden it clicked and I see it.

02:26:47,138 --> 02:26:50,558
SPEAKER_1:  with my eyes, I finally like tracking it. It's straight out.

02:26:51,010 --> 02:26:52,350
SPEAKER_1:  like straight in front of us and it.

02:26:52,642 --> 02:26:55,806
SPEAKER_1:  It looks like it was a blimp, just barely moving.

02:26:56,130 --> 02:26:58,366
SPEAKER_1:  No, because it is falling slowly thanks to.

02:26:58,626 --> 02:26:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  all of its drag.

02:27:00,098 --> 02:27:00,446
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:27:00,802 --> 02:27:02,110
SPEAKER_1:  Again, that's one of those moments I'm like.

02:27:02,722 --> 02:27:07,678
SPEAKER_1:  It's falling so slow, you know, because it's so big, it's so massive, it's falling sideways.

02:27:08,130 --> 02:27:13,566
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I've seen Falcon 9 boosters and Falcon heavy boosters and they scream. And they come in so fast.

02:27:14,050 --> 02:27:19,902
SPEAKER_1:  And you can barely even see them. You can just barely track them and all of a sudden they light their engines and they decelerate so quickly. This was like the opposite. There's like.

02:27:20,930 --> 02:27:26,782
SPEAKER_1:  Is that thing ever coming down? It was just falling so slowly and so right there. It just felt like it was so close.

02:27:27,202 --> 02:27:33,982
SPEAKER_1:  And so when it finally lit its engine and it flipped, I was losing my mind because I'm like, it's working. You know, this crazy plan, this.

02:27:34,530 --> 02:27:37,758
SPEAKER_1:  The huge massive thing is doing this absurd feat.

02:27:38,146 --> 02:27:41,534
SPEAKER_1:  And the first one, well, the first four again, didn't work out as planned, but.

02:27:42,114 --> 02:27:47,742
SPEAKER_1:  Getting to that point already, getting to that flip maneuver was a huge milestone and it was so exciting just going through those

02:27:48,290 --> 02:27:50,302
SPEAKER_1:  Those firsts were amazing and I think.

02:27:50,786 --> 02:27:54,974
SPEAKER_1:  You know, we're coming up now on them doing the full stacks of the booster and the upper stage.

02:27:55,970 --> 02:27:58,046
SPEAKER_1:  I think when we see that fly, when that leaves...

02:27:58,562 --> 02:27:59,582
SPEAKER_1:  Earth for the first time.

02:28:00,290 --> 02:28:04,126
SPEAKER_1:  It'll be like I said, almost twice the amount of thrust as anything else. It'll be the biggest, heaviest.

02:28:04,354 --> 02:28:05,534
SPEAKER_1:  Largest thing to ever fly.

02:28:05,954 --> 02:28:07,454
SPEAKER_1:  It's going to shake.

02:28:07,970 --> 02:28:08,670
SPEAKER_1:  Everything.

02:28:08,994 --> 02:28:09,438
SPEAKER_1:  Bye.

02:28:09,890 --> 02:28:10,334
SPEAKER_1:  can't.

02:28:10,594 --> 02:28:10,974
SPEAKER_1:  Wait.

02:28:11,170 --> 02:28:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  have all 33 Raptor engines.

02:28:13,922 --> 02:28:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  I've been active at once. Have they tested that?

02:28:16,546 --> 02:28:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  No, that's coming up. That's kind of the next milestone. I don't know when this will come out, but we're...

02:28:21,506 --> 02:28:22,046
SPEAKER_1:  That's like-

02:28:22,242 --> 02:28:25,150
SPEAKER_0:  the next. Just a few days very quickly here. Then.

02:28:25,250 --> 02:28:31,326
SPEAKER_1:  But if people listening to this, if they're listening to it early on, they'll likely be able to catch, you know, I think at this point, it seems like next week.

02:28:31,586 --> 02:28:32,711
SPEAKER_1:  So step one would be step.

02:28:32,711 --> 02:28:33,342
SPEAKER_0:  Click fire!

02:28:34,562 --> 02:28:35,646
SPEAKER_1:  holding onto the rocket.

02:28:35,906 --> 02:28:37,246
SPEAKER_1:  and lighting up the engines.

02:28:37,570 --> 02:28:40,510
SPEAKER_1:  And so, so far they've lit at most. They kind of, they went for like a...

02:28:41,154 --> 02:28:44,094
SPEAKER_1:  More than 14 engines static fired. I don't recall if it was like.

02:28:44,386 --> 02:28:47,134
SPEAKER_1:  you know, 16 or something engines lit at once and they...

02:28:47,874 --> 02:28:49,822
SPEAKER_1:  ended up going down to 14 engines.

02:28:50,146 --> 02:28:50,750
SPEAKER_1:  That's the most.

02:28:51,330 --> 02:28:52,318
SPEAKER_1:  engines they've ever lit.

02:28:52,866 --> 02:28:53,214
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:28:53,442 --> 02:28:59,230
SPEAKER_1:  So the next step and the final kind of step before they fly this thing is they're actually gonna light all 33 engines simultaneously.

02:28:59,842 --> 02:29:06,846
SPEAKER_1:  And although that sounds scary, let's not forget the Falcon Heavy that's now flown five times completely flawlessly.

02:29:07,330 --> 02:29:10,558
SPEAKER_1:  has has 27 engines running simultaneously.

02:29:10,978 --> 02:29:14,846
SPEAKER_1:  So they definitely have, you know, SpaceX has experience with high number of engines running.

02:29:15,522 --> 02:29:18,942
SPEAKER_1:  at the same time, but it is still like, this is going to be.

02:29:19,170 --> 02:29:24,222
SPEAKER_1:  a lot of moving parts and a lot of potential and a lot just a lot of everything.

02:29:24,674 --> 02:29:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  What are the upcoming?

02:29:27,010 --> 02:29:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  milestones, expected milestones.

02:29:30,434 --> 02:29:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  And I think there's one in particular I'd like to talk to you more about, but leading up to that.

02:29:35,362 --> 02:29:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  of course, is like, what are some of the tests here on the way?

02:29:38,370 --> 02:29:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  So is this the static fire?

02:29:40,514 --> 02:29:40,862
SPEAKER_0:  Wow.

02:29:41,282 --> 02:29:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  the fully stack with the two stages.

02:29:44,610 --> 02:29:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  I'll-

02:29:45,602 --> 02:29:46,494
SPEAKER_0:  Will there be?

02:29:46,786 --> 02:29:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  uh

02:29:47,522 --> 02:29:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  and then all that leading to an orbital.

02:29:50,242 --> 02:29:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  Launch.

02:29:51,202 --> 02:29:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  test.

02:29:52,418 --> 02:29:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  What so what are the things which nobody and what do you think?

02:29:55,874 --> 02:29:59,454
SPEAKER_0:  Like what do you think the timeline will be after you take the orbital test?

02:29:59,842 --> 02:30:00,926
SPEAKER_1:  Timeline.

02:30:01,282 --> 02:30:09,630
SPEAKER_1:  The reason we have this website, The Expected Milestones, is because I always tell people to ignore any time you ever hear for any of this stuff. Just pay attention to milestones because...

02:30:10,210 --> 02:30:13,749
SPEAKER_1:  When you're doing stuff for the first time, you know, you just have no idea.

02:30:13,749 --> 02:30:17,982
SPEAKER_0:  Just to understand the expected milestones here, the first column is the event.

02:30:18,210 --> 02:30:23,079
SPEAKER_0:  the second column is the date and status TBD complete. green mean

02:30:23,079 --> 02:30:23,742
SPEAKER_1:  What?

02:30:24,002 --> 02:30:26,869
SPEAKER_1:  Green means it's been completed and it shows the completion date.

02:30:26,869 --> 02:30:29,438
SPEAKER_0:  and the completion date and then the others.

02:30:30,146 --> 02:30:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe.

02:30:31,234 --> 02:30:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe more, maybe not for the full stack testing, the D stack and the 33 engine.

02:30:37,442 --> 02:30:43,166
SPEAKER_1:  So, so realistically we're expecting them to destack and SpaceX, I think just tweeted that actually they're going to be destacking.

02:30:43,618 --> 02:30:49,214
SPEAKER_1:  Um, the second stage from the first stage, kind of get the ship safe while they test because they don't want to.

02:30:49,506 --> 02:30:51,902
SPEAKER_1:  You know, 33 engines is pretty high risk if they...

02:30:52,578 --> 02:30:53,694
SPEAKER_1:  blow up the rocket.

02:30:54,114 --> 02:30:59,198
SPEAKER_1:  When they test it for the first time, it's not going to be fully fueled. I don't think at least, but there is a limit to how-

02:30:59,778 --> 02:31:04,190
SPEAKER_1:  They do have to have it weighed down enough that the launch clamps can hold onto it. Because if you think about it like...

02:31:04,642 --> 02:31:08,382
SPEAKER_1:  Normally the launch clamps are holding onto an entire rocket Wayne.

02:31:08,898 --> 02:31:09,790
SPEAKER_1:  Five million.

02:31:10,338 --> 02:31:10,942
SPEAKER_1:  kilograms?

02:31:11,522 --> 02:31:16,062
SPEAKER_1:  Five million, you know, it's weighing an insane amount. So those clamps don't actually have to hold.

02:31:16,482 --> 02:31:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  75 mega Newtons of thrust, they really want to have to hold on 25 mega Newtons of thrust.

02:31:21,506 --> 02:31:22,238
SPEAKER_1:  You know what I mean, they're not.

02:31:22,754 --> 02:31:24,574
SPEAKER_1:  designed to hold down all 75.

02:31:24,834 --> 02:31:29,854
SPEAKER_1:  They do have to have enough weight on the rocket. So even when they do the testing of the 33 engines...

02:31:30,178 --> 02:31:34,878
SPEAKER_1:  have to have enough propellant in there that they don't exceed the clamping and the holding force of the stand otherwise it'll

02:31:35,554 --> 02:31:38,590
SPEAKER_1:  break free from the launch stand and that booster will go flying off uncontrolled.

02:31:39,298 --> 02:31:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  It's a difficult thing to figure out in the test.

02:31:41,762 --> 02:31:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  Come Eve.

02:31:42,754 --> 02:31:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  simultaneous things you test.

02:31:45,058 --> 02:31:45,438
SPEAKER_0:  Right.

02:31:45,538 --> 02:31:54,718
SPEAKER_1:  So they're kind of mitigating risks, which is why like they're destacking, they don't wanna have, although the ship could be on top of it to help weigh it down and simulate the launch environment better.

02:31:55,202 --> 02:32:02,590
SPEAKER_1:  At some point that's a risk they're just going to take when they go for launch. And so for now they're taking the ship off in case something goes wrong during the 33 engine test.

02:32:03,202 --> 02:32:08,510
SPEAKER_1:  And then once we see if the 33 engine test goes well, hopefully we see the second stage get stacked back on it.

02:32:09,218 --> 02:32:14,558
SPEAKER_1:  We'll see them get closer, like closing out all the items and hope the big one too is the FAA launch license.

02:32:15,074 --> 02:32:17,534
SPEAKER_1:  There that's a little be publicly filed will see that.

02:32:17,794 --> 02:32:18,814
SPEAKER_1:  you know, in the system.

02:32:19,298 --> 02:32:20,766
SPEAKER_1:  having a launch license and

02:32:21,314 --> 02:32:23,518
SPEAKER_1:  I have no sense of that type of thing.

02:32:23,938 --> 02:32:28,030
SPEAKER_1:  outside of, but that is a big milestone, and it might be something that could potentially hinder.

02:32:28,578 --> 02:32:31,454
SPEAKER_1:  hold up the launch date, we'll just be waiting for a launch license.

02:32:32,354 --> 02:32:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I'm sure there's a lot of fascinating bureaucracy in politics and, uh...

02:32:37,954 --> 02:32:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  legal stuff and all that kind of beautiful magical thing when you live in reality. Because it is, I mean it is a big...

02:32:45,346 --> 02:32:45,918
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhhhhh

02:32:46,274 --> 02:32:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  Rocket.

02:32:46,946 --> 02:32:48,254
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

02:32:48,546 --> 02:32:53,310
SPEAKER_1:  Well, and the biggest thing is not so much the F.A. doesn't necessarily care about the success of the rocket.

02:32:53,634 --> 02:32:57,342
SPEAKER_1:  They didn't really just care about the safety of public and public property.

02:32:58,306 --> 02:33:03,230
SPEAKER_1:  So it's a matter of being convinced and having the data to prove, okay.

02:33:03,682 --> 02:33:04,414
SPEAKER_1:  If this thing.

02:33:04,674 --> 02:33:08,606
SPEAKER_1:  blows up, we have a control of how and when it blows up, we have control of.

02:33:09,090 --> 02:33:12,350
SPEAKER_1:  You know, X, Y, and Z, here's the potential damage, here's the blast radius.

02:33:12,802 --> 02:33:14,206
SPEAKER_1:  You know, this again is.

02:33:14,562 --> 02:33:15,550
SPEAKER_1:  over twice as

02:33:15,970 --> 02:33:17,982
SPEAKER_1:  powerful and twice as much potential.

02:33:18,242 --> 02:33:20,062
SPEAKER_1:  Actually, it's a lot more potential.

02:33:20,290 --> 02:33:22,014
SPEAKER_1:  for an explosive energy.

02:33:22,242 --> 02:33:23,678
SPEAKER_1:  if it, you know, if it happened to.

02:33:24,194 --> 02:33:30,782
SPEAKER_1:  Well, let me walk back a little bit because in order to have a real detonation, you have to have a perfect mixture ratio of your fuel and oxidizer.

02:33:31,170 --> 02:33:42,078
SPEAKER_1:  If when a rocket blows up, typically, you know, it kind of unzips and some of the fuel will mix into some of the oxidizer and you could have some explosive energy, but a lot of it's actually just a deflagration. It's just, you know.

02:33:42,306 --> 02:33:43,102
SPEAKER_1:  flames and

02:33:43,810 --> 02:33:49,662
SPEAKER_1:  There will, there would be explosive energy, but it's not like you're lighting all of it simultaneously because it's a giant bomb.

02:33:50,242 --> 02:33:51,518
SPEAKER_1:  It's just really not so.

02:33:51,842 --> 02:33:55,166
SPEAKER_1:  That's good, but at the same time, even in those circumstances.

02:33:55,522 --> 02:33:59,742
SPEAKER_1:  The amount of energy is still absurd, enough to likely blow out windows, you know, for-

02:34:00,354 --> 02:34:01,118
SPEAKER_1:  miles and miles and miles.

02:34:01,890 --> 02:34:03,166
SPEAKER_1:  including my studio space.

02:34:04,930 --> 02:34:06,142
SPEAKER_1:  Ah, well...

02:34:06,626 --> 02:34:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  If the cameras hold up...

02:34:08,674 --> 02:34:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  that that will be one heck of a show

02:34:11,042 --> 02:34:16,798
SPEAKER_0:  uh... hopefully of course would not uh... would not happen so how does that take us to an uh... orbital launch when do you think that would happen?

02:34:17,634 --> 02:34:18,814
SPEAKER_1:  In my opinion.

02:34:19,266 --> 02:34:22,641
SPEAKER_1:  This is a very fluid and this will change literally by the hour.

02:34:22,641 --> 02:34:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  really think that it's very difficult to really say like even even for something that could very well happen this year even just a few months away

02:34:30,562 --> 02:34:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  uh... you can make a prediction

02:34:33,186 --> 02:34:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  By the way, are you superstitious on this kind of stuff a little bit? Like you don't you're worried about jinxing it and that kind of stuff?

02:34:40,034 --> 02:34:41,159
SPEAKER_1:  I wouldn't

02:34:41,159 --> 02:34:42,910
SPEAKER_0:  you would be like waiting.

02:34:43,170 --> 02:34:48,795
SPEAKER_0:  for all of these launches that keep getting delayed where you start thinking that there's certain things you do will postponed.

02:34:48,795 --> 02:34:50,462
SPEAKER_1:  control the weather. My socks.

02:34:50,690 --> 02:34:54,407
SPEAKER_1:  Why am I wearing these socks just scrubbed again? You know, like, yeah. You're lucky you have

02:34:54,407 --> 02:34:59,070
SPEAKER_0:  You don't have to wear the same lucky socks, otherwise there's going to be bad weather. Get yourself a

02:34:59,202 --> 02:35:05,630
SPEAKER_1:  So the reason that I say this and why it's so difficult is they did a first full stack test in July of 2021.

02:35:05,986 --> 02:35:07,902
SPEAKER_1:  And the expectation was we're a month or two away.

02:35:08,322 --> 02:35:08,798
SPEAKER_1:  launch.

02:35:09,602 --> 02:35:15,550
SPEAKER_1:  So like realistically for 18 months have been in a purgatory thinking that we're a month or two away of an orbital launch.

02:35:15,842 --> 02:35:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  Now I did say for the record.

02:35:18,242 --> 02:35:21,342
SPEAKER_1:  when that thing stacked and when a lot of speculation was saying, you know.

02:35:21,602 --> 02:35:23,934
SPEAKER_1:  a month or two I was saying I don't expect it to fly in 2021.

02:35:24,834 --> 02:35:25,534
SPEAKER_1:  You know, and I've been.

02:35:26,114 --> 02:35:33,470
SPEAKER_1:  Just say, I just saw the amount of work that still needed to be done. Like on the ground systems, the tanks, the launch mount, all the stuff. So they're like, they're still.

02:35:33,858 --> 02:35:36,350
SPEAKER_1:  They're going to have to validate it. They're going to have to test everything.

02:35:36,674 --> 02:35:38,238
SPEAKER_1:  every component and you know, people were like.

02:35:38,850 --> 02:35:43,774
SPEAKER_1:  How dare you say that even Gwen Shotwell, the president of SpaceX, is saying Q3 of 2021.

02:35:44,386 --> 02:35:45,502
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, but like...

02:35:46,018 --> 02:35:48,830
SPEAKER_1:  I'm just, I'm not gonna be surprised if it slips into 2022.

02:35:49,218 --> 02:35:51,550
SPEAKER_1:  And here we are at the beginning of 2023. And I-

02:35:52,162 --> 02:35:54,238
SPEAKER_1:  I think we're finally within like two months.

02:35:55,138 --> 02:35:58,750
SPEAKER_1:  I'm expecting, like I'm trying to keep my March and April as free as I can.

02:35:59,938 --> 02:36:00,638
SPEAKER_1:  We'll put it that way.

02:36:01,858 --> 02:36:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  I love it. Actually just in a small tangent on going shower, like what do you, uh,

02:36:09,346 --> 02:36:17,854
SPEAKER_0:  from everything I know she's an instrumental a really crucial person to the success of SpaceX and running the show she's the president the COO

02:36:18,402 --> 02:36:18,878
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

02:36:19,266 --> 02:36:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  What do you know about her that...

02:36:23,042 --> 02:36:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  sort of

02:36:23,874 --> 02:36:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  the genius of Gwen Shotwell.

02:36:26,306 --> 02:36:28,222
SPEAKER_1:  Man, my understanding is she's really the glue.

02:36:29,090 --> 02:36:33,054
SPEAKER_1:  You know, she's the glue to the tornado. Tornado comes in.

02:36:33,570 --> 02:36:37,950
SPEAKER_1:  And then she comes around and just really executes on, and helps.

02:36:38,850 --> 02:36:41,214
SPEAKER_1:  You know, a famous story is that.

02:36:41,442 --> 02:36:47,774
SPEAKER_1:  At some point, Elan walked in, or she sprinted into a meeting because Elan was actively trying to cancel Falcon Heavy.

02:36:48,258 --> 02:36:49,758
SPEAKER_1:  saying it's too far, like it's.

02:36:50,178 --> 02:36:52,350
SPEAKER_1:  much development is still too far away and this is like

02:36:53,282 --> 02:36:59,806
SPEAKER_1:  this might have been like end of 2017 or something and it flew for the first time in 2018. So we're talking like it's close to the end of development.

02:37:00,162 --> 02:37:02,782
SPEAKER_1:  You know, there's hardware being built, all this stuff, and Elon's Lego looked like slot cr Messiah. Pretty good, man.

02:37:03,074 --> 02:37:06,366
SPEAKER_1:  literally in a meeting telling people they're going to cancel it and we're going to move on to BFR.

02:37:06,914 --> 02:37:07,550
SPEAKER_1:  We're now Starship.

02:37:08,354 --> 02:37:09,790
SPEAKER_1:  and just go full steam ahead on that.

02:37:10,274 --> 02:37:14,398
SPEAKER_1:  And she runs into the meeting and reminds Elon, we have X amount of customers.

02:37:14,978 --> 02:37:17,086
SPEAKER_1:  have already purchased a ride on Falcon Heavy.

02:37:17,442 --> 02:37:18,494
SPEAKER_1:  We can't delay that.

02:37:18,978 --> 02:37:19,966
SPEAKER_1:  You know, so it's that.

02:37:20,802 --> 02:37:29,854
SPEAKER_1:  business sense of like, yes, it's great to innovate, but we also have to pay our dues and make the money to continue our operations. And I think she's just a lot better at.

02:37:30,658 --> 02:37:32,638
SPEAKER_1:  She has, I think she has such a great.

02:37:32,898 --> 02:37:35,774
SPEAKER_1:  perspective on everything. It really seems like everything.

02:37:36,130 --> 02:37:38,782
SPEAKER_1:  She doesn't, I wish she did more interviews because I would love to hear more from her.

02:37:40,162 --> 02:37:40,478
SPEAKER_1:  but

02:37:40,738 --> 02:37:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  Man, like it just seems. Hear that Gwen? For both of us. Yeah, she hasn't actually done them in the interviews, right?

02:37:47,074 --> 02:37:52,158
SPEAKER_1:  Not really, no, she's done like a TED talk, a couple of little things here and there, but not really.

02:37:52,994 --> 02:37:59,262
SPEAKER_1:  Many interviews and I would just love to hear like what, you know, what on a daily basis, like what is she doing that to keep.

02:38:00,002 --> 02:38:03,070
SPEAKER_1:  her head on and keep everything so organized. You know it's-

02:38:04,002 --> 02:38:05,406
SPEAKER_1:  You know, yeah.

02:38:06,018 --> 02:38:11,614
SPEAKER_1:  My understanding is that she is absolutely integral and does just an insane amount of work at SpaceX.

02:38:11,746 --> 02:38:15,326
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I mean, so it's the project planning, but also the

02:38:15,938 --> 02:38:18,110
SPEAKER_0:  how the teams integrate together and the...

02:38:18,978 --> 02:38:20,853
SPEAKER_0:  and the hiring and this is the man.

02:38:20,853 --> 02:38:24,478
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's a lot of it is honestly even just the business making sure the money's flowing

02:38:25,122 --> 02:38:27,198
SPEAKER_1:  in a positive trend, more or less.

02:38:27,490 --> 02:38:29,630
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, Elon's obviously a money guy, but he thinks...

02:38:29,986 --> 02:38:34,174
SPEAKER_1:  He's so, I think Elon is so risky. He just loves to throw it all in.

02:38:35,362 --> 02:38:37,918
SPEAKER_1:  he leaves little margin for error, you know, he's...

02:38:38,498 --> 02:38:41,118
SPEAKER_1:  Been really lucky with rolling his dice, especially like when he-

02:38:41,410 --> 02:38:42,814
SPEAKER_1:  started SpaceX and Tesla.

02:38:43,362 --> 02:38:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  That was the ultimate roll of the dice, but...

02:38:45,666 --> 02:38:49,118
SPEAKER_1:  I think she's a healthy balance to be like, well, here's our-

02:38:50,274 --> 02:38:55,742
SPEAKER_1:  Operations and how we can continue to do this without risking everything, you know and Starships clothes. Let me

02:38:55,970 --> 02:38:56,478
SPEAKER_1:  Be clear.

02:38:57,058 --> 02:38:58,238
SPEAKER_1:  Starship is close to-

02:38:58,626 --> 02:39:00,830
SPEAKER_1:  risking everything already. It's just such a big.

02:39:01,282 --> 02:39:01,982
SPEAKER_1:  Fast moving.

02:39:02,242 --> 02:39:04,094
SPEAKER_1:  high-risk developmental program that like.

02:39:05,250 --> 02:39:14,142
SPEAKER_1:  I personally think SpaceX would probably be fine if they shut the doors on Starship and just flew Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy for the next 10 years, they would still be commercially valid. They could not.

02:39:14,370 --> 02:39:24,766
SPEAKER_1:  spend another dollar on research and development. They could fire, I don't want them to, fire everyone involved in anything research and development and just ran operations on Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy and they would still be dominant for 10 years.

02:39:25,122 --> 02:39:27,390
SPEAKER_1:  and they would still have a business case and they'd still be fine.

02:39:28,002 --> 02:39:28,382
SPEAKER_1:  But.

02:39:28,962 --> 02:39:29,374
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:39:30,146 --> 02:39:34,046
SPEAKER_1:  They're all in, like all chips are pretty much, as many chips as possible are in.

02:39:34,850 --> 02:39:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know.

02:39:38,274 --> 02:39:38,942
SPEAKER_0:  What else?

02:39:39,586 --> 02:39:42,494
SPEAKER_0:  I could say is there's not, I've talked to a lot of.

02:39:43,042 --> 02:39:44,190
SPEAKER_0:  great leaders.

02:39:44,930 --> 02:39:48,030
SPEAKER_0:  There's just not many people like Elon that would push for Starship.

02:39:48,962 --> 02:39:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  When they're already.

02:39:50,562 --> 02:39:53,246
SPEAKER_0:  We're already a very successful company.

02:39:53,538 --> 02:39:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  uh... sort of

02:39:54,978 --> 02:39:59,870
SPEAKER_0:  Everyone doubted that it could be a successful company. It was so close to bankruptcy and failing.

02:40:00,354 --> 02:40:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  and then to take it into a financially viable, successful company.

02:40:04,482 --> 02:40:05,918
SPEAKER_0:  And just when you do.

02:40:07,010 --> 02:40:10,046
SPEAKER_0:  You take on a project that again risks everything.

02:40:11,074 --> 02:40:16,190
SPEAKER_1:  when he already did this with Falcon 1 to Falcon 9. Like literally people were like, what are you doing?

02:40:16,482 --> 02:40:20,126
SPEAKER_1:  They basically signed over and were fully ramping up Falcon 9.

02:40:20,482 --> 02:40:22,622
SPEAKER_1:  by the time they finally had their first Falcon 1.

02:40:22,850 --> 02:40:25,150
SPEAKER_1:  success they had one more flight they only flew

02:40:25,474 --> 02:40:29,438
SPEAKER_1:  Fucking one successfully twice, they flew five times all together, the fourth one was successful, and they flew one more time.

02:40:30,050 --> 02:40:30,398
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:40:31,266 --> 02:40:36,446
SPEAKER_1:  Anyone else out there would have been like, let's keep flying the Falcon one. We have a working rocket.

02:40:36,770 --> 02:40:37,310
SPEAKER_1:  We can start.

02:40:37,762 --> 02:40:39,230
SPEAKER_1:  you know, making money and profiting.

02:40:39,682 --> 02:40:40,606
SPEAKER_1:  And already.

02:40:41,026 --> 02:40:42,878
SPEAKER_1:  He was risking it all and saying, nope, we're going.

02:40:43,202 --> 02:40:44,798
SPEAKER_1:  From Falcon 1 to Falcon 9 it was A.

02:40:45,282 --> 02:40:46,014
SPEAKER_1:  Huge.

02:40:46,306 --> 02:40:46,878
SPEAKER_1:  Huge leap.

02:40:47,554 --> 02:40:53,246
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I think it's at least as big as a leap from Falcon 1 to 9 as it is from Falcon 9 to Starship or one

02:40:53,474 --> 02:40:54,910
SPEAKER_1:  relatively similarly.

02:40:55,554 --> 02:40:59,134
SPEAKER_1:  So it's just that same thing again. People are going, why are you leaping into this?

02:40:59,554 --> 02:41:01,790
SPEAKER_1:  insane program and system.

02:41:02,178 --> 02:41:02,814
SPEAKER_1:  and risk.

02:41:03,234 --> 02:41:05,406
SPEAKER_1:  when you have such a, you know, you finally have this.

02:41:05,634 --> 02:41:08,382
SPEAKER_1:  workhorse of a rocket that's so dominant in the industry.

02:41:09,218 --> 02:41:10,046
SPEAKER_1:  Yet they're going.

02:41:11,106 --> 02:41:11,806
SPEAKER_1:  10x, you know?

02:41:12,706 --> 02:41:13,918
SPEAKER_0:  It so happens.

02:41:14,690 --> 02:41:18,750
SPEAKER_0:  You've been selected for the Dear Moon mission that will fly Starship.

02:41:19,266 --> 02:41:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  Once around the moon with nine people on board.

02:41:22,882 --> 02:41:25,278
SPEAKER_0:  You are one of those people.

02:41:27,970 --> 02:41:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  Just pause to take that in.

02:41:30,722 --> 02:41:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  Everything that we've been talking about.

02:41:34,210 --> 02:41:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  you will not just be reporting on, you will be a

02:41:36,866 --> 02:41:37,374
SPEAKER_0:  part of it.

02:41:38,882 --> 02:41:41,086
SPEAKER_0:  So tell me about the objective of this mission.

02:41:41,538 --> 02:41:43,614
SPEAKER_0:  and how does it feel to be a part of it?

02:41:45,570 --> 02:41:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  Well...

02:41:48,354 --> 02:41:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  Thanks for watching. Thanks for watching.

02:41:49,858 --> 02:41:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  Man.

02:41:51,938 --> 02:41:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it's.

02:41:53,922 --> 02:41:54,846
SPEAKER_1:  Basically...

02:41:55,618 --> 02:41:58,718
SPEAKER_1:  It's the Willy Wonka of space.

02:41:58,946 --> 02:42:02,014
SPEAKER_1:  A generous individual.

02:42:03,266 --> 02:42:05,790
SPEAKER_1:  purchased a ride from SpaceX as early as-

02:42:06,210 --> 02:42:11,966
SPEAKER_1:  At least as far as I know, the earliest I knew about it was February 27th, 2017. I was the individual.

02:42:12,354 --> 02:42:21,694
SPEAKER_1:  Yusaku Maezawa, but at the time, I'm telling a story, at the time we didn't know. Okay, great. So February 27th, 2017, a press release comes out from SpaceX saying...

02:42:21,922 --> 02:42:22,462
SPEAKER_1:  Someone.

02:42:22,882 --> 02:42:23,774
SPEAKER_1:  purchased a ride.

02:42:24,482 --> 02:42:25,854
SPEAKER_1:  through us around the moon.

02:42:26,722 --> 02:42:30,078
SPEAKER_1:  We're gonna fly someone around the moon and at the time it was on a Crew Dragon capsule and a Falcon Heavy.

02:42:31,298 --> 02:42:32,638
SPEAKER_1:  Wow, and that was enough.

02:42:32,866 --> 02:42:34,590
SPEAKER_1:  That little moment right there, that press release.

02:42:35,042 --> 02:42:38,974
SPEAKER_1:  The first time I'm like, I'm going to make a YouTube video about this. I stood up.

02:42:39,426 --> 02:42:44,606
SPEAKER_1:  turn on my camera, put on my, at the time, spacesuit, and I basically yelled at the camera for.

02:42:44,898 --> 02:42:47,646
SPEAKER_1:  three minutes about someone's going around the moon, you know.

02:42:48,514 --> 02:42:49,950
SPEAKER_1:  Fast forward to 2018.

02:42:50,434 --> 02:42:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  end of 2018 and near the end they

02:42:52,802 --> 02:42:55,294
SPEAKER_1:  Introduced there's a SpaceX press conference. Hi, I'm way back in Augsburg right now.

02:42:55,682 --> 02:42:57,214
SPEAKER_1:  I'm there as a member of the press.

02:42:57,762 --> 02:43:01,534
SPEAKER_1:  I'm reporting on we're going to meet this person that's going around the moon.

02:43:01,762 --> 02:43:06,558
SPEAKER_1:  and come to find out, boom, they're going to be riding on Starship now. They change from Falcon, Heavy, and Dragon.

02:43:06,786 --> 02:43:11,550
SPEAKER_1:  SpaceX is no longer going to do that. They're going to upgrade them basically to Starship. So instead of being in like a.

02:43:12,002 --> 02:43:14,334
SPEAKER_1:  Small tin can there in this giant luxurious.

02:43:14,690 --> 02:43:15,486
SPEAKER_1:  You know, Mega Rocket.

02:43:16,098 --> 02:43:16,638
SPEAKER_1:  around the moon.

02:43:17,538 --> 02:43:22,014
SPEAKER_1:  And it comes out that this individual named Yusaku Maezawa, who is a Japanese billionaire.

02:44:02,050 --> 02:44:08,222
SPEAKER_1:  I can't believe this is gonna happen. And you know, he had this vision of, we're gonna find people from all around the world. I'm going to invite people from all around the world.

02:44:39,074 --> 02:44:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  It's...

02:44:40,066 --> 02:44:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  I'd like, uh, I think.

02:44:42,338 --> 02:44:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  It's...

02:44:44,354 --> 02:44:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  You often don't realize the importance of individuals.

02:44:47,298 --> 02:44:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  in human history, like they define it because this could be, we talked about the importance of Elon and

02:44:53,122 --> 02:45:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  You know, most of the work is done by large groups of people that are collective intelligence that we band together But like these individuals can...

02:45:02,690 --> 02:45:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  be the spark.

02:45:04,514 --> 02:45:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  of.

02:45:05,506 --> 02:45:09,278
SPEAKER_0:  the catalyst of that progress. And I mean, just this idea.

02:45:09,570 --> 02:45:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  of getting.

02:45:11,266 --> 02:45:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  not just civilians, which is already incredible, but civilians with a sort of an artistic flame that burns inside them, they're able to communicate.

02:45:19,522 --> 02:45:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  whatever they do, are able to communicate something about that experience.

02:45:23,362 --> 02:45:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  It's just a genius idea.

02:45:25,346 --> 02:45:28,542
SPEAKER_0:  did spend quite probably a very large amount of money.

02:45:29,346 --> 02:45:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  Look at that.

02:45:30,370 --> 02:45:35,646
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's, and that will be part of history. Yeah.

02:45:35,906 --> 02:45:40,190
SPEAKER_1:  And it's easy these days for people to be cynical, you know, especially about like

02:45:40,770 --> 02:45:41,822
SPEAKER_1:  spaceflight and

02:45:42,178 --> 02:45:43,262
SPEAKER_1:  wealthy individuals.

02:45:43,650 --> 02:45:47,230
SPEAKER_1:  But really, in my opinion, and maybe just the time.

02:45:47,458 --> 02:45:50,142
SPEAKER_1:  I just so couldn't believe this idea.

02:45:51,138 --> 02:45:53,758
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I'm someone that has studied a lot about.

02:45:54,082 --> 02:45:56,542
SPEAKER_1:  You know, the Apollo program, the people that have been to the moon and they're

02:45:56,770 --> 02:46:00,862
SPEAKER_1:  Incredible individuals, incredible individuals, but they're so saturated with tasks.

02:46:01,410 --> 02:46:03,806
SPEAKER_1:  and they're military trained and often.

02:46:04,258 --> 02:46:08,798
SPEAKER_1:  that they didn't really have the luxury of just being able to soak in the experience.

02:46:09,154 --> 02:46:09,470
SPEAKER_1:  of.

02:46:09,730 --> 02:46:12,062
SPEAKER_1:  going around or to the moon.

02:46:12,706 --> 02:46:14,910
SPEAKER_1:  and seeing the moon up close with your own eyes.

02:46:16,002 --> 02:46:17,598
SPEAKER_1:  just psychologically has to be.

02:46:17,826 --> 02:46:18,334
SPEAKER_1:  Insane.

02:46:19,170 --> 02:46:21,182
SPEAKER_1:  And so to have this opportunity.

02:46:21,762 --> 02:46:22,782
SPEAKER_1:  be able to observe.

02:46:23,042 --> 02:46:24,734
SPEAKER_1:  our closest celestial neighbor.

02:46:25,122 --> 02:46:30,590
SPEAKER_1:  with your own eyes and your sole purpose is to soak it in and share it and communicate and create.

02:46:31,266 --> 02:46:33,758
SPEAKER_1:  with the rest of our planet, like that to me is just.

02:46:34,018 --> 02:46:34,622
SPEAKER_1:  beautiful.

02:46:37,538 --> 02:46:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  So that is the objective of the mission.

02:46:39,682 --> 02:46:41,557
SPEAKER_1:  That right there is the objective of the mission.

02:46:41,557 --> 02:46:45,246
SPEAKER_0:  And how does it feel to be selected?

02:46:45,666 --> 02:46:47,742
SPEAKER_0:  as one of the nine to do it.

02:46:48,066 --> 02:46:51,550
SPEAKER_1:  It's a gradient. It's slowly.

02:46:51,778 --> 02:46:53,246
SPEAKER_1:  It's doing a few things.

02:46:53,634 --> 02:46:55,198
SPEAKER_1:  since I've known it's become.

02:46:56,194 --> 02:46:56,638
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:46:56,898 --> 02:47:00,030
SPEAKER_1:  I think the closer it gets, the more excited and the more nervous I get.

02:47:01,090 --> 02:47:08,158
SPEAKER_1:  You know, it's a more real it becomes the more real it becomes. You know, the announcement was a big, uh, it just got announced at the end of 2022 publicly.

02:47:08,642 --> 02:47:10,238
SPEAKER_1:  who's involved and so

02:47:11,074 --> 02:47:12,510
SPEAKER_1:  Prior to that, like, I had, you know.

02:47:13,058 --> 02:47:16,190
SPEAKER_1:  Each step of the selection process, you know, there's a pretty comprehensive.

02:47:16,642 --> 02:47:19,422
SPEAKER_1:  selection process with interviews and stuff. Each step I'd-

02:47:19,810 --> 02:47:21,982
SPEAKER_1:  Try not to get my hopes up and frankly like this.

02:47:22,274 --> 02:47:24,990
SPEAKER_1:  Let me be clear, this was not something that I've always wanted to do.

02:47:25,442 --> 02:47:30,366
SPEAKER_1:  You know, it's not like I'm out there. I didn't start doing YouTube videos because I wanted to even go to space. I did none of that.

02:47:30,978 --> 02:47:33,022
SPEAKER_1:  And I've said, hilariously, I've probably said.

02:47:33,602 --> 02:47:35,454
SPEAKER_1:  dozens or hundreds of times on air.

02:47:35,714 --> 02:47:41,054
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I don't ever want to go to space because it's not like my, it's not a driving force. It's not really a thing I even really truly pictured.

02:47:41,314 --> 02:47:43,166
SPEAKER_1:  or let myself fantasize about, frankly.

02:47:44,034 --> 02:47:44,446
SPEAKER_1:  So.

02:47:44,898 --> 02:47:48,030
SPEAKER_1:  Each step of the selection process, I didn't really let myself.

02:47:48,290 --> 02:47:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  dream about it too much or you know.

02:47:50,402 --> 02:47:53,662
SPEAKER_1:  but it would kind of chip away, like, oh my God, this is actually becoming more real.

02:47:54,082 --> 02:47:55,742
SPEAKER_1:  It's actually more and more of an opportunity and I'm.

02:47:56,226 --> 02:47:59,326
SPEAKER_1:  equally more nervous too. Like, you know, frankly, it is.

02:47:59,714 --> 02:48:02,142
SPEAKER_1:  It's, I've seen space flight.

02:48:02,626 --> 02:48:04,414
SPEAKER_1:  stuff, go wrong, I've, you know.

02:48:04,674 --> 02:48:06,430
SPEAKER_1:  I think about this stuff a lot, so like.

02:48:06,882 --> 02:48:11,678
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I get more nervous, but I also get more excited about that opportunity. Like it's an opportunity that how can you pass.

02:48:12,066 --> 02:48:15,326
SPEAKER_1:  And it's still, I still have to actually stop pause think.

02:48:16,098 --> 02:48:16,702
SPEAKER_1:  And actually.

02:48:16,930 --> 02:48:18,558
SPEAKER_1:  realize the reality that.

02:48:19,362 --> 02:48:22,878
SPEAKER_1:  that I am going to the moon. I'm going to see the moon up close.

02:48:23,362 --> 02:48:27,934
SPEAKER_1:  Flying around the moon, I'm sorry, some people get mad when I say going to the moon since I'm not landing on it.

02:48:28,802 --> 02:48:32,126
SPEAKER_1:  but flying around the moon seeing the far side of the moon with my own eyes.

02:48:32,418 --> 02:48:33,310
SPEAKER_1:  and seeing earth.

02:48:34,018 --> 02:48:35,582
SPEAKER_1:  and seeing the Earth rise behind it.

02:48:36,418 --> 02:48:36,894
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

02:48:37,314 --> 02:48:48,190
SPEAKER_1:  I can't tell you what it's going to be like and feel like. So epic. But it's insane to me that we're having this conversation that that is my reality.

02:48:48,418 --> 02:48:50,238
SPEAKER_1:  and that someone was generous enough to...

02:48:50,498 --> 02:48:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  consider the option of sharing this with.

02:48:53,410 --> 02:48:54,334
SPEAKER_1:  frankly strangers.

02:48:55,170 --> 02:48:59,006
SPEAKER_1:  And the process that they had for selecting like how.

02:48:59,650 --> 02:49:00,062
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:49:00,514 --> 02:49:03,326
SPEAKER_1:  how much thought and time went into the selection process which was incredible

02:49:03,778 --> 02:49:06,142
SPEAKER_1:  You know, they did a public call at the beginning of 2020.

02:49:07,298 --> 02:49:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  And so the teams involved in.

02:49:09,634 --> 02:49:17,182

SPEAKER_1:  and has become a fine art collector and just kind of a philanthropist.

02:52:19,061 --> 02:52:19,811
SPEAKER_0:  and he's been out

02:52:19,811 --> 02:52:23,934
SPEAKER_1:  He's already not only been to space, like, you know, he's been...

02:52:24,162 --> 02:52:27,646
SPEAKER_1:  to the International Space Station. He's been on orbit and on the ISS.

02:52:28,098 --> 02:52:29,534
SPEAKER_1:  So he, what's cool is like.

02:52:29,826 --> 02:52:31,038
SPEAKER_1:  You know, there's talks of.

02:52:31,426 --> 02:52:36,158
SPEAKER_1:  when there's frankly to be to be honest, like we still don't, I still don't know all of the details about this. You know, we're.

02:52:36,514 --> 02:52:37,598
SPEAKER_1:  Not yet into training.

02:52:38,050 --> 02:52:45,246
SPEAKER_1:  I kind of always assumed prior that there'd be some professional astronaut, you know, when they talked about in 2018, there's talks of we'll have a professional astronaut on board.

02:52:46,434 --> 02:52:48,286
SPEAKER_1:  Realistically now, like, MZ is.

02:52:48,674 --> 02:52:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  a trained astronaut, you know.

02:52:50,434 --> 02:52:54,526
SPEAKER_1:  He has trained a lot, like six months, you know, plus.

02:52:54,946 --> 02:52:56,350
SPEAKER_1:  to be able to fly on Soyuz.

02:52:56,770 --> 02:53:00,254
SPEAKER_1:  So as far as like, it's good to know for me that I have someone.

02:53:00,962 --> 02:53:03,294
SPEAKER_1:  on the crew that has experience with space flight.

02:53:03,746 --> 02:53:08,766
SPEAKER_1:  has trained and has some knowledge on spaceflight as well. That is an important aspect for sure.

02:53:09,058 --> 02:53:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  So you made an excellent video about flying in a fighter jet.

02:53:12,482 --> 02:53:15,006
SPEAKER_0:  uh... that i think you mentioned maybe relevant

02:53:15,522 --> 02:53:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  to the training.

02:53:16,770 --> 02:53:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  Is there some high level aspects to training that you anticipate that you may be able to speak to?

02:53:22,402 --> 02:53:25,246
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so, you know, so far I think we can really lean on.

02:53:25,602 --> 02:53:27,422
SPEAKER_1:  what has happened with the other.

02:53:27,970 --> 02:53:33,214
SPEAKER_1:  you know, commercial crew missions and in private missions like the inspiration for mission or axiom.

02:53:33,698 --> 02:53:36,670
SPEAKER_1:  where SpaceX flew individually. They trained for about six months.

02:53:37,186 --> 02:53:40,702
SPEAKER_1:  a lot of like reading manuals and learning the spacecraft.

02:53:40,962 --> 02:53:43,710
SPEAKER_0:  Are you gonna do like a Rocky 4 montage or?

02:53:44,738 --> 02:53:49,447
SPEAKER_1:  I hope it just gets shredded. I hope it's physical, a lot of physical training. And they're like, we didn't tell you.

02:53:49,447 --> 02:53:55,423
SPEAKER_0:  He just seems to want to fill himself shirtless in the snow.

02:53:55,423 --> 02:53:57,854
SPEAKER_1:  How is this relevant? Why is he always doing this?

02:53:58,242 --> 02:53:59,678
SPEAKER_1:  can't get him to stop punching meat.

02:54:00,130 --> 02:54:00,766
SPEAKER_1:  Um

02:54:01,346 --> 02:54:02,718
SPEAKER_1:  So yeah, hopefully.

02:54:03,522 --> 02:54:04,414
SPEAKER_1:  Realistically.

02:54:05,282 --> 02:54:08,615
SPEAKER_1:  That's a manual. I like it.

02:54:08,615 --> 02:54:15,934
SPEAKER_0:  But there's a physical component to all of this and that's really, I mean, that's fascinating. It's also inspiring to sort of civilians.

02:54:16,802 --> 02:54:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  can do this. That's really interesting.

02:54:18,946 --> 02:54:19,806
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean this is...

02:54:20,354 --> 02:54:22,078
SPEAKER_1:  And to me, this represents.

02:54:22,434 --> 02:54:24,382
SPEAKER_1:  this and the other commercial space ain't on.

02:54:24,674 --> 02:54:31,198
SPEAKER_1:  private spaceflight missions like this represent really a turning point like truly an inflection and again, it's easy for people to be cynical that

02:54:32,066 --> 02:54:33,566
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, you know, why are people wasting?

02:54:34,178 --> 02:54:36,062
SPEAKER_1:  all this money doing space flight stuff. It's like.

02:54:36,610 --> 02:54:38,782
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I'm sure some people were saying that same thing about-

02:54:39,074 --> 02:54:40,734
SPEAKER_1:  you know, airplanes and, and.

02:54:40,994 --> 02:54:43,166
SPEAKER_1:  early aviation going like, why are we?

02:54:43,618 --> 02:54:46,558
SPEAKER_1:  I can't believe those people are wasting the government's, you know, funding these

02:54:46,786 --> 02:54:52,030
SPEAKER_1:  stupid planes and stuff. How's this ever gonna benefit me? And nowadays, imagine if all the planes just stopped working.

02:54:52,642 --> 02:54:54,910
SPEAKER_1:  would freak out, our economy would collapse.

02:54:55,490 --> 02:55:01,470
SPEAKER_1:  It would suck, you know? And it might be a long time before we get to that reality with space flight. No, if-

02:55:01,826 --> 02:55:03,358
SPEAKER_1:  If spaceflight halted today...

02:55:03,842 --> 02:55:08,446
SPEAKER_1:  you know, space assets, all of our, you know, on orbit assets, our life would be.

02:55:08,770 --> 02:55:10,494
SPEAKER_1:  And I don't think people realize that.

02:55:11,234 --> 02:55:14,558
SPEAKER_1:  So it's already, we're already reliant on it, but now we're getting to the point where it's-

02:55:14,786 --> 02:55:17,694
SPEAKER_1:  We're really turning that corner It's the average person.

02:55:18,338 --> 02:55:20,062
SPEAKER_1:  alive today. You know, if you're born.

02:55:20,322 --> 02:55:24,734
SPEAKER_1:  You know, from now on, I think there's a real decent chance that by the time...

02:55:25,186 --> 02:55:27,838
SPEAKER_1:  you pass, there's an opportunity to have flown in space.

02:55:28,866 --> 02:55:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. I mean, I, if I'm being honest.

02:55:31,362 --> 02:55:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  I still haven't lost the feeling of magic of flying in an airplane.

02:55:35,682 --> 02:55:37,470
SPEAKER_0:  I often catch myself thinking like...

02:55:37,698 --> 02:55:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  How's this real?

02:55:39,970 --> 02:55:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  How is, and like.

02:55:42,594 --> 02:55:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  The contrast of this incredible thing that's incredibly safe.

02:55:47,554 --> 02:55:49,758
SPEAKER_0:  flying through the air, taking off and landing.

02:55:50,210 --> 02:55:52,894
SPEAKER_0:  while everyone else just looks bored.

02:55:53,826 --> 02:55:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  watching like, I don't know, some romantic comedy.

02:55:58,274 --> 02:56:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  on their phone with wifi. Yeah

02:56:02,082 --> 02:56:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  So it's just, it's like.

02:56:04,866 --> 02:56:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  The contrast of that is like.

02:56:06,850 --> 02:56:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  Wow, we're...

02:56:08,418 --> 02:56:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  We're incredible. We're incredible as a society. And it's like we develop some.

02:56:14,210 --> 02:56:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  amazing technology that improves.

02:56:17,570 --> 02:56:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  almost immeasurably our quality of life and then we take it for granted and now still reach for the next thing. And the next thing in life becomes more beautiful and complex and interesting. Yeah, it's just...

02:56:29,314 --> 02:56:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  and the same stuff will be happening.

02:56:32,354 --> 02:56:34,270
SPEAKER_0:  Oh yeah, with space travel.

02:56:34,562 --> 02:56:36,126
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, it'll become mundane and boring.

02:56:36,674 --> 02:56:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  At some point. Tough thing about space travel, of course.

02:56:41,122 --> 02:56:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I don't even know if it's such a giant leap over airplanes because airplanes are already

02:56:46,178 --> 02:56:50,366
SPEAKER_0:  incredible, but the tough thing with space travel is the destination.

02:56:50,626 --> 02:56:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  right, is the landing on a whole other world.

02:56:54,914 --> 02:57:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  whether it's docking with different transport vehicles or the space station or it's landing elsewhere. It really is incredible. I think you mentioned since there's a...

02:57:06,562 --> 02:57:08,862
SPEAKER_0:  There's artists, there's filmmakers and so on.

02:57:09,858 --> 02:57:11,198
SPEAKER_0:  And you're all of those.

02:57:12,514 --> 02:57:14,366
SPEAKER_0:  on top of being a great athlete.

02:57:14,754 --> 02:57:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, I'll just stop the running joke at this point.

02:57:18,562 --> 02:57:20,702
SPEAKER_0:  Is there, have you thought about?

02:57:21,314 --> 02:57:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  Just in general, we've offline talked about microphones and like...

02:57:25,826 --> 02:57:30,654
SPEAKER_0:  all the different ways to film space launch, rocket launches.

02:57:31,106 --> 02:57:34,558
SPEAKER_0:  Have you thought about the different options of like how to capture?

02:57:35,394 --> 02:57:43,422
SPEAKER_0:  how to capture this. Have you, have the team have been like brainstorming and thinking about this? Do you anticipate it being super challenging?

02:57:43,650 --> 02:57:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  There's so many opportunities to sort of...

02:57:45,634 --> 02:57:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  think of how to do this.

02:57:47,650 --> 02:57:51,070
SPEAKER_1:  So one of the fun things to remember is that Starship is.

02:57:51,330 --> 02:57:53,950
SPEAKER_1:  huge. Like its internal volume is.

02:57:54,370 --> 02:57:58,430
SPEAKER_1:  The pressurized volume on Starship is bigger than a 747's pressurized volume.

02:57:59,042 --> 02:58:01,214
SPEAKER_1:  and it can take 100 metric tons.

02:58:01,570 --> 02:58:01,982
SPEAKER_1:  anywhere.

02:58:02,338 --> 02:58:03,262
SPEAKER_1:  with enough refueling.

02:58:03,746 --> 02:58:04,446
SPEAKER_1:  100 minutes, so.

02:58:04,674 --> 02:58:05,118
SPEAKER_1:  We have.

02:58:05,442 --> 02:58:13,950
SPEAKER_1:  In theory, very little mass and volume constraints. Unlike prior, all other space flight missions ever, you're counting, you know.

02:58:14,242 --> 02:58:16,094
SPEAKER_1:  grams down to, you know,

02:58:16,674 --> 02:58:19,582
SPEAKER_1:  just really can't risk, you know, you have very.

02:58:20,130 --> 02:58:20,798
SPEAKER_1:  defined.

02:58:21,026 --> 02:58:22,718
SPEAKER_1:  parameters on what you cannot do.

02:58:23,586 --> 02:58:30,174
SPEAKER_1:  We're going to likely have the luxury of being able to film and capture this in a way that's just never been done before. You know, we won't be.

02:58:30,594 --> 02:58:33,534
SPEAKER_1:  inhibited by mass and volume constraints.

02:58:33,762 --> 02:58:34,110
SPEAKER_1:  prior.

02:58:34,530 --> 02:58:35,294
SPEAKER_1:  So

02:58:36,130 --> 02:58:39,422
SPEAKER_1:  All that said and done, I'm hoping that we'll be able to just.

02:58:39,778 --> 02:58:43,262
SPEAKER_1:  arm ourselves to the teeth with the absolute best cameras.

02:58:43,554 --> 02:58:45,982
SPEAKER_1:  equipment possible backups on backups and.

02:58:46,690 --> 02:58:49,438
SPEAKER_1:  you know, and pre-wire, you know, like pre-rig things.

02:58:49,826 --> 02:58:51,806
SPEAKER_1:  Starship is going to be a...

02:58:52,034 --> 02:58:53,150
SPEAKER_1:  transportation system and it...

02:58:53,474 --> 02:58:54,014
SPEAKER_1:  has

02:58:54,242 --> 02:58:57,502
SPEAKER_1:  You know, it's being built from the ground up. There's no reason why they can't.

02:58:58,466 --> 02:59:02,494
SPEAKER_1:  put infrastructure in for cameras that are just housed in the vehicle, you know.

02:59:02,850 --> 02:59:04,510
SPEAKER_1:  These are talks that I'm excited to have.

02:59:04,738 --> 02:59:07,390
SPEAKER_1:  because I really, ideally, one of the things I'd love to do.

02:59:07,970 --> 02:59:10,654
SPEAKER_1:  I'm gonna be pushing really hard to actually try live streaming.

02:59:11,554 --> 02:59:12,446
SPEAKER_1:  from inside.

02:59:12,994 --> 02:59:13,726
SPEAKER_1:  during the launch.

02:59:14,914 --> 02:59:16,670
SPEAKER_0:  during the launch livestream.

02:59:16,898 --> 02:59:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  Inside that would be incredible. Wouldn't that be?

02:59:20,994 --> 02:59:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  It's possible to pull off. That's really, really incredible. There is the magic to the live stream because like that's real. That's right there. That was.

02:59:28,802 --> 02:59:31,678
SPEAKER_0:  The world would tune in. That would be truly inspiring, yes.

02:59:32,034 --> 02:59:41,694
SPEAKER_1:  To me, that's one of those things a lot of people ask why they aren't doing it. Of course, NASA and other individuals will have their reasons of why not. There's obviously some technical hurdles, but...

02:59:42,242 --> 02:59:44,894
SPEAKER_1:  Now with Starlink and other capabilities, there's...

02:59:45,666 --> 02:59:53,118
SPEAKER_1:  less hurdles, there's obviously some transparency reasons, why, you know, and safety reasons, why it might not be a great idea to live stream.

02:59:53,666 --> 02:59:56,446
SPEAKER_1:  Risky rocket launch, you know, the Challenger, I think put a pretty bad.

02:59:57,186 --> 03:00:03,166
SPEAKER_1:  taste in our mouth as far as publicizing an event and having every student in the United States tune in to

03:00:03,746 --> 03:00:05,342
SPEAKER_1:  you know, a tragedy.

03:00:05,954 --> 03:00:06,814
SPEAKER_1:  But, um...

03:00:07,074 --> 03:00:12,862
SPEAKER_1:  That's something I'm pushing for really hard just because I think it could be magical. I think it could really connect with people in a way that hasn't.

03:00:13,410 --> 03:00:14,110
SPEAKER_1:  been done before.

03:00:14,786 --> 03:00:16,030
SPEAKER_0:  Speaking of Challenger...

03:00:18,146 --> 03:00:19,230
SPEAKER_0:  Have you thought about?

03:00:19,714 --> 03:00:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  the fact that you're riding.

03:00:22,114 --> 03:00:24,158
SPEAKER_0:  a thing as we've been talking about.

03:00:24,930 --> 03:00:26,334
SPEAKER_0:  That's, um...

03:00:27,554 --> 03:00:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  That's a giant explosive.

03:00:30,594 --> 03:00:31,806
SPEAKER_0:  Powerful Rocket.

03:00:32,834 --> 03:00:33,854
SPEAKER_0:  Have you, uh...

03:00:34,754 --> 03:00:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  Have you thought about the risk of that, the danger of that?

03:00:37,890 --> 03:00:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  Have you contemplated your own mortality?

03:00:41,154 --> 03:00:41,790
SPEAKER_1:  How could I not?

03:00:42,306 --> 03:00:43,166
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I've seen...

03:00:43,522 --> 03:00:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  with my I've seen and felt.

03:00:45,986 --> 03:00:47,838
SPEAKER_1:  four of these prototype vehicles blow up.

03:00:49,026 --> 03:00:49,726
SPEAKER_1:  with my own eyes.

03:00:50,466 --> 03:00:50,846
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:00:51,650 --> 03:00:53,214
SPEAKER_1:  Don't know if there's anyone else.

03:00:53,922 --> 03:00:55,102
SPEAKER_1:  you know, early days.

03:00:55,522 --> 03:00:56,414
SPEAKER_1:  some of the, you know.

03:00:57,826 --> 03:01:01,630
SPEAKER_1:  Mercury and Gemini astronauts watched failures of rockets and then got on them.

03:01:02,626 --> 03:01:06,526
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know of too many people that are dumb enough to do that though, this day and age.

03:01:07,266 --> 03:01:07,710
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

03:01:08,354 --> 03:01:10,814
SPEAKER_1:  It's obviously I will have to see.

03:01:11,266 --> 03:01:14,078
SPEAKER_1:  a lot of successful launches and have to have a lot of.

03:01:14,818 --> 03:01:17,342
SPEAKER_1:  confidence in the engineering, the data.

03:01:18,050 --> 03:01:18,366
SPEAKER_1:  that.

03:01:19,042 --> 03:01:20,446
SPEAKER_1:  they have developed a safe system.

03:01:20,994 --> 03:01:24,094
SPEAKER_1:  Currently, the current iteration of Starship has no abort system.

03:01:24,514 --> 03:01:25,086
SPEAKER_1:  has no.

03:01:25,890 --> 03:01:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  escape tower. So, you know, dragon capsule.

03:01:28,610 --> 03:01:30,238
SPEAKER_1:  which is currently flying people has.

03:01:30,530 --> 03:01:32,734
SPEAKER_1:  a launch abort system has super Draco engines that.

03:01:33,634 --> 03:01:36,862
SPEAKER_1:  either by the push of a button or by the automatic triggering of the flight computer.

03:01:37,090 --> 03:01:41,214
SPEAKER_1:  can shoot the capsule off of the rocket in milliseconds.

03:01:41,698 --> 03:01:45,854
SPEAKER_1:  pull it safely away, get it far enough away so that it can pull the parachutes and safely splash down.

03:01:46,530 --> 03:01:46,878
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:01:47,298 --> 03:01:47,934
SPEAKER_1:  Starship C-

03:01:48,450 --> 03:01:51,134
SPEAKER_1:  by all iterations I've ever seen does not have.

03:01:51,522 --> 03:01:51,934
SPEAKER_1:  that.

03:01:52,226 --> 03:01:54,686
SPEAKER_1:  The space shuttle also did not have that. So it's not absurd.

03:01:55,202 --> 03:01:56,990
SPEAKER_1:  to not have an abort system. Like it is.

03:01:57,570 --> 03:01:58,238
SPEAKER_1:  There is.

03:01:58,690 --> 03:01:59,070
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

03:01:59,810 --> 03:02:01,342
SPEAKER_1:  certain engineering principles that.

03:02:01,922 --> 03:02:06,846
SPEAKER_1:  prove that that could be a completely valid thing. The space shuttle flew 133 times.

03:02:07,426 --> 03:02:11,230
SPEAKER_1:  Fully successfully, it did have two failures, resulting in the loss of 14 lives.

03:02:12,098 --> 03:02:16,286
SPEAKER_1:  um, 85 or what, sorry, 98.5% success rate.

03:02:17,954 --> 03:02:18,622
SPEAKER_1:  Pretty, I mean...

03:02:19,298 --> 03:02:30,046
SPEAKER_1:  You there's other, I've probably done things that are a lot riskier. I have race motorcycles, drag race motorcycles, and you know, written like an absolute jerk on the streets on a motorcycle, I'm sure I've had a higher than a 98.5.

03:02:30,594 --> 03:02:33,662
SPEAKER_1:  percent survival rate or lower than that. I mean, at some point.

03:02:34,146 --> 03:02:34,494
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:02:35,842 --> 03:02:38,974
SPEAKER_1:  So it's, you know, yes, it's risky, it's scary.

03:02:39,906 --> 03:02:40,798
SPEAKER_1:  And, um...

03:02:41,730 --> 03:02:45,342
SPEAKER_1:  I think about it a lot, a lot. It definitely is one of those things that I-

03:02:45,698 --> 03:02:46,014
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

03:02:46,402 --> 03:02:53,182
SPEAKER_1:  I will have to see and I'm in no hurry for this to happen either. Personally, I'm in no hurry because it's like I would.

03:02:53,634 --> 03:02:56,574
SPEAKER_1:  rather see this thing be developed and iterated and see.

03:02:56,898 --> 03:02:57,694
SPEAKER_1:  10, you know.

03:02:58,658 --> 03:03:01,246
SPEAKER_1:  I was gonna say ten dozen, but I'd be happy with a dozen.

03:03:01,538 --> 03:03:04,414
SPEAKER_1:  fully successful like oh we've got this thing totally nailed down.

03:03:05,090 --> 03:03:06,942
SPEAKER_1:  uh, you know, before I get on it.

03:03:07,746 --> 03:03:08,094
SPEAKER_1:  but.

03:03:08,610 --> 03:03:14,878
SPEAKER_1:  And that likely is the reality. There will likely be a dozen or two or three launches because just even to get to the moon on Starship, they have to-

03:03:15,106 --> 03:03:16,126
SPEAKER_1:  refuel it in orbit.

03:03:16,706 --> 03:03:17,086
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:03:17,410 --> 03:03:22,782
SPEAKER_1:  So it will get to Earth orbit, basically empty and out of fuel. So I'll have to dock with a fuel depot.

03:03:23,746 --> 03:03:24,190
SPEAKER_1:  Fill up.

03:03:24,418 --> 03:03:25,118
SPEAKER_1:  and then go to the moon.

03:03:25,858 --> 03:03:26,334
SPEAKER_1:  So.

03:03:27,202 --> 03:03:29,310
SPEAKER_1:  just to even get that full, you know, already talking about.

03:03:29,794 --> 03:03:34,206
SPEAKER_1:  you know, a handful of launches. So there will be a lot of launches before we fly.

03:03:34,946 --> 03:03:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  Would they do a test?

03:03:36,450 --> 03:03:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  flight without humans on board that goes to the moon or no?

03:03:40,962 --> 03:03:45,406
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not sure. I'm not sure if they'll do that exact flight profile, but by then they will have already flown.

03:03:45,794 --> 03:03:48,638
SPEAKER_1:  most likely the Artemis 3 program will have.

03:03:49,346 --> 03:03:52,862
SPEAKER_1:  a Starship variant to the moon that lands on the moon.

03:03:53,474 --> 03:03:54,014
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:03:55,042 --> 03:04:00,862
SPEAKER_1:  So doing at that point, you're pretty much, I would like them to test the heat shield at that entry velocity, though, because it is.

03:04:01,346 --> 03:04:02,494
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, you know, it takes.

03:04:02,914 --> 03:04:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  another.

03:04:04,034 --> 03:04:09,982
SPEAKER_1:  it's about 30% faster to get, like it could go 30% faster than the lower orbit to get out to a translunar injection.

03:04:10,434 --> 03:04:12,510
SPEAKER_1:  And although that only sounds like, oh, 30% faster.

03:04:12,930 --> 03:04:13,310
SPEAKER_1:  It's-

03:04:13,634 --> 03:04:19,006
SPEAKER_1:  You know, the reentry heating experienced by a vehicle goes up by velocity cubed.

03:04:19,490 --> 03:04:20,222
SPEAKER_1:  Not squared?

03:04:20,482 --> 03:04:23,102
SPEAKER_1:  So, and not even, not linear. So it's not like we go twice as fast to get.

03:04:23,362 --> 03:04:26,206
SPEAKER_1:  you see twice as much heat, you know, 30% faster, 30% more heat.

03:04:26,626 --> 03:04:31,358
SPEAKER_1:  It's not squared, it's not go twice as fast to get four times as much heat. Let's go twice as fast.

03:04:31,586 --> 03:04:33,022
SPEAKER_1:  get eight times as much.

03:04:33,858 --> 03:04:34,462
SPEAKER_1:  on reentry.

03:04:34,914 --> 03:04:38,526
SPEAKER_1:  So 30% faster on reentry is actually a really, really big deal.

03:04:40,226 --> 03:04:45,566
SPEAKER_1:  So I would love to see that because, you know, there's certain things that I would love to see milestones that I would love to see tested out and proven.

03:04:46,146 --> 03:04:47,390
SPEAKER_1:  before I get on board but

03:04:48,354 --> 03:04:49,950
SPEAKER_1:  At the end of the day, I really do believe.

03:04:50,562 --> 03:04:53,726
SPEAKER_1:  that just like Falcon 9 and the success of that, that they're going to.

03:04:54,210 --> 03:04:54,654
SPEAKER_1:  Push it.

03:04:55,394 --> 03:05:00,094
SPEAKER_1:  and get all the kinks out well before anyone's on top of it. Nowadays Falcon, Iron, and Dragon is-

03:05:00,450 --> 03:05:01,470
SPEAKER_1:  You know, arguably the.

03:05:02,306 --> 03:05:03,806
SPEAKER_1:  one of the safest, most reliable.

03:05:04,482 --> 03:05:06,942
SPEAKER_1:  and best rides he could take to space.

03:05:07,906 --> 03:05:08,990
SPEAKER_0:  Are you afraid of dying?

03:05:10,466 --> 03:05:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

03:05:11,586 --> 03:05:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  Is this one of the first times you get to year young?

03:05:14,306 --> 03:05:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  Have you gotten a chance to think about?

03:05:16,738 --> 03:05:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  Death is one of the...

03:05:18,818 --> 03:05:19,742
SPEAKER_0:  First time you've...

03:05:20,514 --> 03:05:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  Really contemplated it?

03:05:22,818 --> 03:05:24,190
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, yeah, I mean...

03:05:25,538 --> 03:05:26,430
SPEAKER_1:  Like I said, I've had...

03:05:26,978 --> 03:05:29,566
SPEAKER_1:  I've had dumb moments on motorcycles where I kind of saw.

03:05:29,954 --> 03:05:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  You know, like.

03:05:30,882 --> 03:05:33,886
SPEAKER_1:  I'm going to smash into this thing at 120 mile an hour.

03:05:34,466 --> 03:05:37,630
SPEAKER_0:  So you've had moments when you realized it could end just like this.

03:05:38,210 --> 03:05:40,286
SPEAKER_1:  where you literally, and I have.

03:05:40,706 --> 03:05:43,038
SPEAKER_1:  for most of my adult life had dreams of.

03:05:44,258 --> 03:05:44,958
SPEAKER_1:  falling.

03:05:45,474 --> 03:05:50,846
SPEAKER_1:  and hitting the ground and it just all, you get a ring in your ears, it all goes black, and in my head I go, oh shit, that was it.

03:05:51,522 --> 03:05:53,246
SPEAKER_0:  Have you seen a therapist about this?

03:05:53,506 --> 03:05:53,982
SPEAKER_0:  Uh-uh.

03:05:54,242 --> 03:05:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  I wonder what it means.

03:05:55,810 --> 03:05:56,734
SPEAKER_1:  So I'm...

03:05:56,962 --> 03:05:57,726
SPEAKER_1:  and

03:05:57,986 --> 03:06:00,702
SPEAKER_0:  I'm sure there's a Freudian interpretation somewhere in there.

03:06:01,154 --> 03:06:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  that I'm going to also apply to my dating life. no.

03:06:04,706 --> 03:06:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  The joke is the running joke continues. Okay, so uh...

03:06:08,834 --> 03:06:12,190
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's fascinating in general.

03:06:12,418 --> 03:06:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  as I hope we'll talk about in the early days of spaceflight that there is a...

03:06:18,146 --> 03:06:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  The task of reaching out to the stars is a fundamentally risky one.

03:06:22,306 --> 03:06:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  You have to take risks and of course there's really rigorous safety precautions and so on, but it's still a risk.

03:06:28,322 --> 03:06:30,014
SPEAKER_1:  And I think like most people that.

03:06:30,338 --> 03:06:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  the for me the idea of.

03:06:32,130 --> 03:06:35,934
SPEAKER_1:  dying isn't so much about myself, it's about those affected by it, you know.

03:06:36,194 --> 03:06:36,606
SPEAKER_1:  Bye.

03:06:36,994 --> 03:06:39,294
SPEAKER_1:  My loved ones, my family, my girlfriend, my...

03:06:39,650 --> 03:06:41,950
SPEAKER_1:  my friends, you know, obviously I don't want to.

03:06:42,722 --> 03:06:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  have this be a traumatic experience for anybody, you know?

03:06:45,474 --> 03:06:47,102
SPEAKER_1:  It's already going to be hard. Like it's already.

03:06:47,490 --> 03:06:51,934
SPEAKER_1:  I know my parents and family and friends are very supportive.

03:06:52,514 --> 03:06:52,926
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:06:53,378 --> 03:06:54,494
SPEAKER_1:  that my parents are.

03:06:55,074 --> 03:06:56,862
SPEAKER_1:  You know, all about it of course, but.

03:06:57,314 --> 03:06:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  My mom is also very emotional too, so.

03:06:59,938 --> 03:07:00,990
SPEAKER_1:  You know, she's, so my.

03:07:01,314 --> 03:07:05,022
SPEAKER_1:  Speaking of athletes, my brother-in-law's actually been on American Ninja Warrior two seasons.

03:07:05,506 --> 03:07:05,886
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:07:06,146 --> 03:07:11,966
SPEAKER_1:  phenomenal athlete and even just when he competes, my mom gets so emotional. You can't even hold it together seeing that.

03:07:12,450 --> 03:07:16,350
SPEAKER_1:  So what's it gonna be like when she sees her son get on top of a skyscraper and and

03:07:16,994 --> 03:07:20,126
SPEAKER_1:  ascend on a column of flames into the heavens. Like that's going to be.

03:07:21,026 --> 03:07:22,878
SPEAKER_1:  very difficult, you know.

03:07:23,842 --> 03:07:24,158
SPEAKER_1:  and

03:07:24,450 --> 03:07:29,639
SPEAKER_1:  I've taken them out, they've seen Star Race and they've seen Starship, they've seen a couple launches.

03:07:29,639 --> 03:07:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know if that's gonna make him feel better.

03:07:33,218 --> 03:07:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  Exposure therapy, I guess. Exposure therapy, okay. Have you had that conversation with them?

03:07:39,522 --> 03:07:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  about this like before agreeing.

03:07:42,434 --> 03:07:42,910
SPEAKER_0:  of.

03:07:43,330 --> 03:07:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  to join, I mean, was that what the...

03:07:45,826 --> 03:07:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  Was that, or is it one of those things like...

03:07:49,762 --> 03:07:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  uh

03:07:51,586 --> 03:07:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  You just, you don't have that conversation.

03:07:54,786 --> 03:07:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't have that conversation. There's a love, there's a passion here.

03:07:58,466 --> 03:08:00,542
SPEAKER_1:  And realistically, I'm not.

03:08:01,762 --> 03:08:03,166
SPEAKER_1:  I'm going to be...

03:08:04,162 --> 03:08:06,558
SPEAKER_1:  convinced and statistically convinced that this is

03:08:06,978 --> 03:08:07,774
SPEAKER_1:  relatively safe.

03:08:08,226 --> 03:08:08,798
SPEAKER_1:  You know, like.

03:08:09,250 --> 03:08:11,582
SPEAKER_1:  again in the 99% safe.

03:08:12,770 --> 03:08:13,342
SPEAKER_1:  Again.

03:08:13,666 --> 03:08:15,582
SPEAKER_1:  There's things that people do every day that are.

03:08:16,386 --> 03:08:18,558
SPEAKER_1:  Less safe than this, you know, like you ride in the motorcycle.

03:08:19,202 --> 03:08:22,577
SPEAKER_1:  Again, yeah, riding a motorcycle, doing wheelies at over 100 mile an hour. You're not felli-

03:08:22,577 --> 03:08:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  Wheelies over hun-

03:08:25,250 --> 03:08:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  What?

03:08:26,242 --> 03:08:26,686
SPEAKER_0:  Ha!

03:08:27,618 --> 03:08:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  All right.

03:08:28,130 --> 03:08:29,854
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not a smart guy always, okay?

03:08:31,778 --> 03:08:35,006
SPEAKER_1:  Formation flying in the fighter jets was likely a more dangerous thing.

03:08:35,426 --> 03:08:36,222
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, then.

03:08:36,866 --> 03:08:37,406
SPEAKER_1:  What I'll beat.

03:08:37,826 --> 03:08:38,174
SPEAKER_1:  doing.

03:08:38,434 --> 03:08:39,038
SPEAKER_1:  in spaceflight.

03:08:42,498 --> 03:08:45,918
SPEAKER_0:  So as surreal as it is, we're talking about you.

03:08:47,138 --> 03:08:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  um, flying around the moon.

03:08:49,378 --> 03:08:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  Let's rewind.

03:08:51,522 --> 03:08:53,246
SPEAKER_0:  and talk about the origin story.

03:08:53,698 --> 03:08:56,030
SPEAKER_0:  What's the origin story of Everyday Astronaut?

03:08:57,058 --> 03:09:00,734
SPEAKER_1:  I used to be a professional photographer. So from 2008 till-

03:09:01,122 --> 03:09:03,550
SPEAKER_1:  the end of 2016, that was my income.

03:09:03,874 --> 03:09:04,830
SPEAKER_1:  full-time.

03:09:05,282 --> 03:09:08,657
SPEAKER_0:  Like you were an Instagram model and took butt pictures of yourself.

03:09:08,657 --> 03:09:10,157
SPEAKER_1:  fitness model.

03:09:10,157 --> 03:09:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  to

03:09:11,522 --> 03:09:18,023
SPEAKER_1:  I did a lot of weddings. I shot 150 weddings all around the world.

03:09:18,023 --> 03:09:20,638
SPEAKER_0:  all kinds of material like like dude

03:09:20,802 --> 03:09:24,286
SPEAKER_1:  portrait also a lot of portrait work and then just you know random like commercial things like

03:09:24,610 --> 03:09:27,166
SPEAKER_1:  you know, food and beverages for businesses or like, you know.

03:09:28,578 --> 03:09:31,710
SPEAKER_1:  wheelchair ramp company I shot their product like, you know, it's random.

03:09:32,034 --> 03:09:32,574
SPEAKER_1:  Whatever.

03:09:32,930 --> 03:09:35,879
SPEAKER_1:  professional photographer does in Cedar Falls, Iowa. When did you

03:09:35,879 --> 03:09:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  you are a fan love it.

03:09:37,218 --> 03:09:38,590
SPEAKER_0:  photography with a visual medium.

03:09:39,138 --> 03:09:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  Do you remember?

03:09:39,682 --> 03:09:45,630
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I do actually remember. I so I drew up. I grew up drawing constantly. I

03:09:46,114 --> 03:09:48,222
SPEAKER_1:  I was the weird kid that might, I would bring a.

03:09:48,514 --> 03:09:51,102
SPEAKER_1:  sketch pad to the restaurants, like every restaurant.

03:09:51,330 --> 03:09:57,054
SPEAKER_1:  When I was growing up, until I was like 18, 19, I literally would just sit there and draw or waiting for food. And my parents fostered that, they-

03:09:58,338 --> 03:10:02,046
SPEAKER_1:  you know, and I'd be the weird kid, but I'd be engaging and talking but I'd be sitting there drawing.

03:10:02,754 --> 03:10:03,166
SPEAKER_1:  and

03:10:03,394 --> 03:10:08,062
SPEAKER_1:  I was always obsessed with realism and recreating and visualizing things.

03:10:08,706 --> 03:10:09,470
SPEAKER_1:  And so...

03:10:09,762 --> 03:10:12,670
SPEAKER_1:  When I got my hands on the cameras, I was actually my dad's old Pentax that I...

03:10:13,250 --> 03:10:19,326
SPEAKER_1:  first shot on a film camera and developing the film. I didn't personally develop it, like getting the film back back in those days.

03:10:19,842 --> 03:10:20,254
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:10:20,866 --> 03:10:21,886
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I just was like.

03:10:22,178 --> 03:10:25,086
SPEAKER_1:  so excited about the idea that I had this visual.

03:10:25,666 --> 03:10:27,230
SPEAKER_1:  that I saw with my own eyes.

03:10:27,746 --> 03:10:28,446
SPEAKER_1:  And now I can.

03:10:28,898 --> 03:10:31,582
SPEAKER_1:  stop time and capture it and show it to other people.

03:10:32,098 --> 03:10:35,390
SPEAKER_1:  Just kind of like, to me, that was like the ultimate form of realism was like.

03:10:35,842 --> 03:10:37,950
SPEAKER_1:  Literally showing you the photons basically.

03:10:38,402 --> 03:10:39,870
SPEAKER_1:  that affected this film.

03:10:40,514 --> 03:10:46,878
SPEAKER_1:  Um, and so I, I mean, I was, I was 19 when I got my first digital SLR at Canon 20 D.

03:10:47,522 --> 03:10:49,054
SPEAKER_1:  and started shooting.

03:10:50,274 --> 03:10:54,238
SPEAKER_1:  And yeah, I just, I fell in love with it. It became like, I got a job at a camera store and-

03:10:54,786 --> 03:10:56,574
SPEAKER_1:  You know, basically all my extra money went into.

03:10:57,250 --> 03:10:58,942
SPEAKER_1:  buying everything that I could at the time.

03:10:59,458 --> 03:11:01,854
SPEAKER_1:  I only worked there for about exactly a year before I went into.

03:11:02,082 --> 03:11:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  pursuing photography full time and.

03:11:04,386 --> 03:11:06,270
SPEAKER_1:  I basically was shooting weddings that I could.

03:11:06,594 --> 03:11:08,766
SPEAKER_1:  travel and pay like, you know, for it to be able to.

03:11:09,538 --> 03:11:12,926
SPEAKER_1:  do some big trips every year and develop some kind of.

03:11:13,570 --> 03:11:14,878
SPEAKER_1:  portfolio of traveling and

03:11:15,714 --> 03:11:16,926
SPEAKER_1:  Not necessarily like it, not-

03:11:17,282 --> 03:11:20,894
SPEAKER_1:  for, you know, I guess Instagram wasn't much of a thing at the time. It's really just, I like

03:11:21,218 --> 03:11:22,270
SPEAKER_1:  making big prints and...

03:11:23,042 --> 03:11:24,318
SPEAKER_1:  having them displayed and...

03:11:25,218 --> 03:11:26,110
SPEAKER_1:  that kind of stuff and.

03:11:26,434 --> 03:11:26,910
SPEAKER_1:  Pretty su-

03:11:27,074 --> 03:11:31,011
SPEAKER_0:  Are you still a canon guy? You still a canon elitist? NOOO.

03:11:31,011 --> 03:11:34,014
SPEAKER_1:  Oh no, I moved around, I did Sony for a bit.

03:11:34,306 --> 03:11:42,097
SPEAKER_1:  I still kind of shoot mostly Canon glass, but adapted to either Sony, like lenses, sorry, like Canon lenses. Look at you.

03:11:42,097 --> 03:11:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  Thank you.

03:11:43,490 --> 03:11:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  What do you think about the...

03:11:45,282 --> 03:11:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  these things that I'm using Sony a seven four.

03:11:48,578 --> 03:11:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  Great.

03:11:49,890 --> 03:11:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  Great, see you.

03:11:52,642 --> 03:11:59,102
SPEAKER_0:  I've been, you know, I Googled around just trying to find a camera that can do video and photography pretty well.

03:11:59,682 --> 03:12:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  And obviously going was just like...

03:12:02,018 --> 03:12:05,694
SPEAKER_0:  generic lens, primelens, I resisted everything.

03:12:06,082 --> 03:12:08,766
SPEAKER_0:  My whole journey with these camera things, I'm trying to figure stuff out.

03:12:09,218 --> 03:12:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  is like, prime lens, it seems so stupid. So prime lens is like a fixed zoom thing. It's like, why?

03:12:16,418 --> 03:12:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  I remember I was going to like Ukraine.

03:12:19,714 --> 03:12:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  In thinking it's similar like yeah, very similar to spaceflight, but you're very constrained because you're going into an unknown environment. You're going to a war zone, you're going to a front.

03:12:30,658 --> 03:12:36,958
SPEAKER_0:  You don't know what, like you don't know anything. And there's like a little suitcase you have to like see, figure out like, how do you film this was.

03:12:37,250 --> 03:12:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  What's robust?

03:12:38,562 --> 03:12:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  uh... what gives you like a good image versus the flexibility versus the way

03:12:43,522 --> 03:12:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  is as important there you have to think about like.

03:12:46,082 --> 03:12:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  Can you really bring like a bunch of zoom lenses and all that kind of stuff? I had to learn really quickly, but yeah.

03:12:52,962 --> 03:12:57,182
SPEAKER_0:  It's a whole journey that you've already been on, but it's nice to have a beginner like me.

03:12:57,666 --> 03:13:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  to explore that. I think there is a...

03:13:02,114 --> 03:13:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  There's nice things just like as we've been talking about with a beginner's mind.

03:13:06,178 --> 03:13:06,846
SPEAKER_0:  to um.

03:13:07,970 --> 03:13:09,502
SPEAKER_0:  Not let equipment.

03:13:10,562 --> 03:13:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  Get in the way of what your vision is of what a thing should look like. Sometimes like...

03:13:16,034 --> 03:13:22,398
SPEAKER_0:  especially if you're a professional videographer, photographer, cinematographer, whatever you call it.

03:13:22,882 --> 03:13:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  You can like

03:13:24,162 --> 03:13:32,350
SPEAKER_0:  Fetishize equipment too much you could get so much equipment And I've interacted that because I've been trying to learn from other people that have so much more experience than me

03:13:33,122 --> 03:13:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  I think their advice is often like...

03:13:36,226 --> 03:13:36,606
SPEAKER_0:

03:13:36,994 --> 03:13:38,814
SPEAKER_0:  very pushing a lot of equipment.

03:13:39,138 --> 03:13:40,158
SPEAKER_0:  versus like...

03:13:41,122 --> 03:13:44,542
SPEAKER_0:  the final thing, like how do you create the art of it?

03:13:45,378 --> 03:13:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  like

03:13:46,082 --> 03:13:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  Because to me, even photography is just like storytelling.

03:13:49,442 --> 03:13:49,918
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

03:13:50,338 --> 03:13:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  like a lot of the discussion to me.

03:13:53,218 --> 03:14:02,494
SPEAKER_0:  that I enjoy, especially talking to creative people, is like the final story. Like how, and I've learned, you know, like light, light.

03:14:02,978 --> 03:14:04,318
SPEAKER_0:  Light is a weird thing.

03:14:05,698 --> 03:14:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  It's so interesting. It's so interesting how you can create a motion with light.

03:14:10,402 --> 03:14:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  Like with a little you could take a

03:14:13,506 --> 03:14:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  like a phone.

03:14:14,978 --> 03:14:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  and like you light your face in different ways.

03:14:17,378 --> 03:14:20,967
SPEAKER_0:  And like it changes the emotion. Oh yeah. It's so weird.

03:14:20,967 --> 03:14:22,270
SPEAKER_1:

03:14:22,370 --> 03:14:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  I'm like, holy shit.

03:14:24,546 --> 03:14:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  Cause like that's the conversation I want to have. People give me advice how to light a scene and all that kind of stuff is great. But the reality is...

03:14:31,970 --> 03:14:36,830
SPEAKER_0:  that a little bit of light in a different direction you have to understand how that changes

03:14:37,378 --> 03:14:39,253
SPEAKER_1:  contour on your face.

03:14:39,253 --> 03:14:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  and the expression that your face can.

03:14:42,530 --> 03:14:43,038
SPEAKER_0:  The...

03:14:43,362 --> 03:14:44,190
SPEAKER_0:  the expression

03:14:45,922 --> 03:14:48,926
SPEAKER_0:  effective to communicate under different lighting conditions.

03:14:49,378 --> 03:14:51,134
SPEAKER_0:  And then like the mystery of like.

03:14:51,362 --> 03:14:52,990
SPEAKER_0:  having some of your face.

03:14:53,378 --> 03:14:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  uh... in darkness and some not

03:14:55,682 --> 03:14:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  when you can only see the eyes and not the face.

03:14:58,946 --> 03:15:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  when the background is visible or not. I mean, yeah, it's all just like this interesting art form.

03:15:06,114 --> 03:15:08,739
SPEAKER_0:  that can be so powerful when you're telling a story.

03:15:08,739 --> 03:15:14,590
SPEAKER_1:  Well, and what's fun for with me with photography and rockets, they're both like the ultimate story of compromise

03:15:14,914 --> 03:15:22,334
SPEAKER_1:  When you start learning about photography, learn about how the aperture affects both your exposure but also your depth of field, higher shutter speed affects both your exposure.

03:15:22,562 --> 03:15:23,582
SPEAKER_1:  Redepth of Field, how the...

03:15:24,098 --> 03:15:30,974
SPEAKER_1:  you know, a medium format camera versus a crop camera effects, you know, everything is a compromise and price versus performance.

03:15:31,714 --> 03:15:35,646
SPEAKER_1:  There's always a compromise. You're always literally doing like a trade study of what can I afford.

03:15:36,034 --> 03:15:37,886
SPEAKER_1:  What's my outcome? Like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

03:15:38,210 --> 03:15:39,870
SPEAKER_1:  how fast is he out of focus or whatever.

03:15:40,802 --> 03:15:43,038
SPEAKER_1:  Same with rockets, like there's a million.

03:15:43,298 --> 03:15:49,118
SPEAKER_1:  choices and every single one of them affects every single thing. So there's always all these trades and it's so cool that you can see.

03:15:49,730 --> 03:15:55,230
SPEAKER_1:  uh, the same, totally different outcomes based on the same like requirements, you know, like do X.

03:15:55,778 --> 03:15:57,182
SPEAKER_1:  then here's how we're gonna do it.

03:15:57,666 --> 03:15:58,814
SPEAKER_1:  you know, two teams of people will come.

03:15:59,266 --> 03:16:00,254
SPEAKER_1:  wildly different things.

03:16:00,802 --> 03:16:02,014
SPEAKER_0:  When did you fall in love?

03:16:02,946 --> 03:16:03,742
SPEAKER_0:  with Rockets.

03:16:04,098 --> 03:16:10,398
SPEAKER_1:  So yeah, so the story kind of keeps going for me. So I was doing. Yeah. Mottaud genius

03:16:10,626 --> 03:16:13,726
SPEAKER_1:  Can't talk photography, man. We'll go on a deep rabbit hole there.

03:16:14,050 --> 03:16:15,134
SPEAKER_1:  So

03:16:15,714 --> 03:16:21,150
SPEAKER_1:  So it ended, you know, through all this, doing a lot of weddings, I was already getting saturated and feeling.

03:16:21,410 --> 03:16:21,982
SPEAKER_1:  Like I'm not.

03:16:22,402 --> 03:16:30,078
SPEAKER_1:  being as creative, you know, you can only shoot them so many weddings before you're like, well, now we do this pose, this pose, this pose, you know, even if like they're amazing places like, you know,

03:16:30,562 --> 03:16:33,918
SPEAKER_1:  front of a castle in Germany or something. I'm still like, well, I need to be the day I'm.

03:16:35,170 --> 03:16:36,638
SPEAKER_1:  not being very creative, you know?

03:16:37,218 --> 03:16:37,534
SPEAKER_1:  So.

03:16:38,466 --> 03:16:40,574
SPEAKER_1:  I remember craving like some, some.

03:16:40,898 --> 03:16:42,046
SPEAKER_1:  projects and so

03:16:42,594 --> 03:16:44,702
SPEAKER_1:  I was sitting at my friend's coffee shop.

03:16:45,570 --> 03:16:47,198
SPEAKER_1:  in my hometown in Cedar Falls.

03:16:47,554 --> 03:16:48,414
SPEAKER_1:  Sidecar Coffee.

03:16:48,770 --> 03:16:51,422
SPEAKER_1:  and I'm sitting on this red couch and I see this article.

03:16:51,906 --> 03:16:53,534
SPEAKER_1:  from I think Gizmodo and it said.

03:16:53,858 --> 03:16:54,878
SPEAKER_1:  you could own.

03:16:55,554 --> 03:16:57,886
SPEAKER_1:  the flight stick of an Apollo command module.

03:16:59,042 --> 03:17:02,814
SPEAKER_1:  And I knew enough to know what that meant, but that's really about the end of my space knowledge.

03:17:03,330 --> 03:17:13,502
SPEAKER_1:  And so I clicked on it, the clickbait got me. Like I'm like, oh yeah, I'm gonna see if, you know, and see that the minimum bid was like $250,000. I'm like, okay, no, I can't own the Apollo joystick, you know.

03:17:13,858 --> 03:17:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  but it got me on this website called RR Auction. And so I started scrolling through that, looking for things that hadn't been bid on.

03:17:19,522 --> 03:17:22,174
SPEAKER_1:  And they had that, you know, at the time they're doing a huge space auction.

03:17:22,786 --> 03:17:29,598
SPEAKER_1:  And so I'm looking for things just out of curiosity, fun, these are cool, like it's starting to really, you know, like I said, I like space, but I wasn't like.

03:17:29,826 --> 03:17:31,358
SPEAKER_1:  in love with it or anything but I'm

03:17:31,906 --> 03:17:32,798
SPEAKER_1:  very v-

03:17:33,154 --> 03:17:34,791
SPEAKER_0:  just seeing all the stuff like this.

03:17:34,791 --> 03:17:36,766
SPEAKER_1:  So cool, look at all this old history stuff.

03:17:37,538 --> 03:17:38,974
SPEAKER_1:  and ended up seeing a...

03:17:39,426 --> 03:17:40,894
SPEAKER_1:  There's an article for a.

03:17:41,218 --> 03:17:41,534
SPEAKER_1:  uh

03:17:42,114 --> 03:17:43,518
SPEAKER_1:  VMS TK

03:17:44,002 --> 03:17:48,254
SPEAKER_1:  44 flight suit high-altitude flight suit that came from the Soviet Union

03:17:48,930 --> 03:17:49,598
SPEAKER_1:  and looks

03:17:49,858 --> 03:17:50,878
SPEAKER_1:  You know, it's like a MIG.

03:17:51,138 --> 03:17:51,934
SPEAKER_1:  Fighter jet.

03:17:52,194 --> 03:17:56,094
SPEAKER_1:  fighter pilot suit very similar to like the SR-71 like kind of pumpkin suit.

03:17:56,610 --> 03:17:59,198
SPEAKER_1:  Um, pre semi pressure suit with a full

03:17:59,554 --> 03:18:03,326
SPEAKER_1:  helmet. I mean, it looks like a spacesuit, you know, for all intents and purposes, it's

03:18:03,810 --> 03:18:04,638
SPEAKER_1:  Kind of like a spacesuit.

03:18:05,538 --> 03:18:06,398
SPEAKER_1:  And I just.

03:18:06,722 --> 03:18:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  I've been like, I think $325.

03:18:09,826 --> 03:18:12,318
SPEAKER_1:  And next thing you know, like, it arrives at my door.

03:18:12,962 --> 03:18:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

03:18:13,730 --> 03:18:16,670
SPEAKER_1:  And from that point on, like literally I got it out.

03:18:17,538 --> 03:18:21,822
SPEAKER_1:  immediately try to put it on and the first thing that I do is almost die in it because I

03:18:22,498 --> 03:18:24,830
SPEAKER_1:  closed the helmet down on myself and locked it.

03:18:25,218 --> 03:18:26,750
SPEAKER_1:  and didn't know how to unlock it.

03:18:27,042 --> 03:18:31,262
SPEAKER_1:  So I'm literally and so as soon as I seal it up, I'm.

03:18:31,554 --> 03:18:32,670
SPEAKER_1:  realizing I can't breathe.

03:18:32,898 --> 03:18:38,398
SPEAKER_1:  I'm going to run out of air. So luckily like there's a hose, you know, kind of that long hose thing that would normally plug into an air supply.

03:18:38,626 --> 03:18:41,022
SPEAKER_1:  had a little plug on the end of it, so I just unplugged it and was able to...

03:18:41,314 --> 03:18:44,190
SPEAKER_1:  Temporarily breathe through the hose until I figured out the locking mechanism

03:18:45,122 --> 03:18:49,182
SPEAKER_1:  So there was my almost, that was my mortality rate thing right there, so that was probably.

03:18:49,474 --> 03:18:50,622
SPEAKER_1:  above a 98.

03:18:50,914 --> 03:18:52,039
SPEAKER_1:  below that you're there for

03:18:52,039 --> 03:18:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  panicking.

03:18:52,930 --> 03:18:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  inside.

03:18:53,890 --> 03:19:02,046
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. For a few seconds. Already reading like my premature obituary, like idiot dies alone in spacesuit in his living room. You know, like just imagine. Yeah.

03:19:02,338 --> 03:19:04,478
SPEAKER_1:  That would be like Darwin Award for sure.

03:19:05,026 --> 03:19:05,630
SPEAKER_1:  For sure.

03:19:06,242 --> 03:19:06,686
SPEAKER_0:  Oh.

03:19:06,850 --> 03:19:09,438
SPEAKER_1:  So I get the spacesuit.

03:19:09,666 --> 03:19:10,206
SPEAKER_1:  and

03:19:10,370 --> 03:19:11,646
SPEAKER_0:  They kind of. Impji by you.

03:19:11,970 --> 03:19:13,278
SPEAKER_0:  Take my breath away.

03:19:13,506 --> 03:19:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  Also, don't forget your rights to the organizations you livestream on social travelling........

03:19:14,626 --> 03:19:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  Mmm.

03:19:16,066 --> 03:19:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  You should feel bad for that one.

03:19:17,378 --> 03:19:20,003
SPEAKER_1:  You introduced Creed to me, so...

03:19:20,003 --> 03:19:24,117
SPEAKER_0:  You should feel bad about that one. Stars wide open.

03:19:24,117 --> 03:19:24,670
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah

03:19:25,058 --> 03:19:25,822
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so.

03:19:26,242 --> 03:19:26,814
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:19:27,298 --> 03:19:33,950
SPEAKER_1:  So I ended up like the space suit kind of like more or less haunted me because it kind of just it's sat in like my living room for a long time and I didn't know what to do with it.

03:19:34,690 --> 03:19:45,342
SPEAKER_1:  and actually had a friend who is also a photographer wanted to do like a photo. He was just kind of taking pictures randomly. He's like, hey, bring your space suit over. We'll do a picture. It's like, all right, you know, I walk across the street, literally lived across the street.

03:19:45,666 --> 03:19:46,686
SPEAKER_1:  Taylor and I.

03:19:47,010 --> 03:19:55,390
SPEAKER_1:  put the spacesuit on, I took this funny picture, and I'm like, this is awesome. And I got a lot of like fun out of like creating a character, you know, of everyday astronaut, or at the time, I guess I didn't know, an astronaut.

03:19:56,290 --> 03:19:58,206
SPEAKER_1:  And then that kind of just continued. I was like.

03:19:58,498 --> 03:20:02,078
SPEAKER_1:  thinking of more and more funny situations where I could have this astronaut on Earth.

03:20:02,594 --> 03:20:04,414
SPEAKER_1:  doing mundane everyday things.

03:20:04,994 --> 03:20:06,558
SPEAKER_1:  and came up with the name Everyday Astronaut.

03:20:06,850 --> 03:20:09,470
SPEAKER_1:  And originally it was just literally a photo project.

03:20:09,698 --> 03:20:11,038
SPEAKER_1:  this whole art series of.

03:20:11,682 --> 03:20:13,662
SPEAKER_1:  an astronaut doing these things.

03:20:13,954 --> 03:20:14,846
SPEAKER_1:  Funny Whimsical.

03:20:15,106 --> 03:20:15,422
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

03:20:15,714 --> 03:20:18,078
SPEAKER_1:  silly mundane things, but I was researching a lot about like.

03:20:18,562 --> 03:20:21,246
SPEAKER_1:  I was trying to hide Easter eggs. I was going to hide in the...

03:20:21,602 --> 03:20:23,774
SPEAKER_1:  you know, the echocardiogram of.

03:20:24,034 --> 03:20:29,854
SPEAKER_1:  of Alan Shepard, you know, like his first flight into space and photoshopping that into pictures and like.

03:20:30,274 --> 03:20:34,558
SPEAKER_1:  You know, doing all these little like facts about space flight, but there's just hidden little elements in these photos.

03:20:35,042 --> 03:20:37,022
SPEAKER_1:  And man doing that, I just fell in love with it.

03:20:37,250 --> 03:20:42,110
SPEAKER_1:  I just was going over every little detail that I could learn. I just couldn't stop learning.

03:20:42,466 --> 03:20:45,822
SPEAKER_1:  And I was getting excited because I was like, I could be teaching people about-

03:20:46,050 --> 03:20:50,654
SPEAKER_1:  all this exciting stuff and all the cool things people figured out you know 40 years ago 50 years ago

03:20:51,266 --> 03:20:57,054
SPEAKER_1:  and was trying to portray that through images on Instagram. And it took me a little while, but eventually I realized.

03:20:57,506 --> 03:20:59,870
SPEAKER_1:  You know, on Instagram, your retention rate, you're lucky if you get like.

03:21:00,482 --> 03:21:06,526
SPEAKER_1:  two seconds of someone looking at an image, or maybe nowadays 60 seconds of a quick little Instagram short or something.

03:21:07,554 --> 03:21:07,934
SPEAKER_1:  but.

03:21:08,194 --> 03:21:08,670
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:21:09,858 --> 03:21:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it doesn't give you a chance to really

03:21:12,194 --> 03:21:19,319
SPEAKER_0:  teach you to explore a little topic that you felt, like you felt the curiosity about the thing. There's so much to learn here. This is so beautiful. I wish.

03:21:19,319 --> 03:21:22,846
SPEAKER_1:  There's so many opportunities to have a light bulb go off for someone to be like, this is awesome.

03:21:23,682 --> 03:21:25,118
SPEAKER_1:  And so, yeah, I think.

03:21:25,346 --> 03:21:29,086
SPEAKER_1:  I started, so by the end of 2016, like throughout 2016, I realized.

03:21:29,474 --> 03:21:37,150
SPEAKER_1:  I want to be done doing photography as a profession, and I want to pursue everyday astronaut. But I didn't know what it meant yet. I just knew I had this thing.

03:21:37,378 --> 03:21:40,510
SPEAKER_1:  And at that time I'd been doing it for roughly two years and had...

03:21:41,026 --> 03:21:47,358
SPEAKER_1:  you know, seeing, I don't know, like 50,000 Instagram followers or something. I thought like, I could just be a full-time influencer now, you know, like just.

03:21:47,810 --> 03:21:50,782
SPEAKER_1:  Go around taking pictures of myself in a space suit and...

03:21:51,202 --> 03:21:55,038
SPEAKER_1:  doing public appearances and write a children's book or something, I don't know. I don't know what this thing is.

03:21:55,554 --> 03:21:56,670
SPEAKER_1:  I'll figure it out, you know.

03:21:57,186 --> 03:21:58,270
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

03:21:58,690 --> 03:22:04,926
SPEAKER_1:  It basically, I gave myself like a runway of one year of 2017 of like, I'm going to throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks.

03:22:05,474 --> 03:22:09,054
SPEAKER_1:  Um, so I was doing like Twitch streams. I was playing Kerbal space program.

03:22:09,474 --> 03:22:11,102
SPEAKER_1:  which is like a video game.

03:22:11,330 --> 03:22:16,734
SPEAKER_1:  like a physics based rocket building simulation game, but it's also like, it's fun and silly. because –

03:22:17,090 --> 03:22:18,750
SPEAKER_1:  Not playing with like humans, you're playing with these little...

03:22:19,330 --> 03:22:19,966
SPEAKER_1:  like

03:22:20,258 --> 03:22:22,590
SPEAKER_1:  little alien guys and it's fun and silly.

03:22:22,978 --> 03:22:26,046
SPEAKER_1:  streaming that on Twitch and doing things and...

03:22:26,562 --> 03:22:30,366
SPEAKER_1:  doing, posting some of those things onto YouTube. But finally, like I said, it actually happened to be.

03:22:30,914 --> 03:22:35,742
SPEAKER_1:  February 27th, 2017, when SpaceX had that announcement that they're flying somewhere around the moon that I'm-

03:22:36,962 --> 03:22:38,398
SPEAKER_1:  I gotta tell people about this and...

03:22:38,690 --> 03:22:39,422
SPEAKER_1:  stood there and...

03:22:39,874 --> 03:22:41,918
SPEAKER_1:  Made my first produced YouTube video.

03:22:42,434 --> 03:22:44,190
SPEAKER_1:  and I didn't want it to be over three minutes.

03:22:44,962 --> 03:22:46,750
SPEAKER_1:  I was afraid that'd be way too long for YouTube.

03:22:47,490 --> 03:22:50,686
SPEAKER_1:  And I got it down to like, I don't know, two minutes and 40 seconds or something.

03:22:51,170 --> 03:23:01,406
SPEAKER_1:  And that video wearing the I was wearing the spacesuit. Yeah. And very horrible audio. It looks like it was color graded by a seven year old with a tan.

03:23:01,634 --> 03:23:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  marker or something like it just looks terrible. Sounds horrible. I'm yelling.

03:23:05,762 --> 03:23:06,846
SPEAKER_1:  No one's happy.

03:23:07,234 --> 03:23:07,966
SPEAKER_1:  Bye.

03:23:08,322 --> 03:23:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  But the video.

03:23:09,602 --> 03:23:13,886
SPEAKER_1:  You know, did relatively well. Like I had no followers on YouTube. Like I had maybe 100.

03:23:14,338 --> 03:23:15,038
SPEAKER_1:  or something.

03:23:15,266 --> 03:23:16,158
SPEAKER_0: <|fr|><|transcribe|> Is the video still up?

03:23:16,386 --> 03:23:19,459
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, that's great. it's still watched.

03:23:19,459 --> 03:23:20,158
SPEAKER_1:  cringy.

03:23:20,706 --> 03:23:25,790
SPEAKER_1:  And as it should be, you know, your first video should be terrible. If it's not terrible, then you spent too long trying to make it.

03:23:26,434 --> 03:23:26,942
SPEAKER_1:  So.

03:23:27,554 --> 03:23:28,062
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:23:28,354 --> 03:23:30,878
SPEAKER_1:  The thing that clicked for me is I had...

03:23:31,138 --> 03:23:33,886
SPEAKER_1:  very little audience, and all of a sudden that video kind of took off.

03:23:34,306 --> 03:23:38,430
SPEAKER_1:  You know, relatively, I think it got like 10,000 or 12,000 views. And I was like, holy crap, that's.

03:23:38,850 --> 03:23:45,521
SPEAKER_1:  Way more engagement than I have. I'm famous. I'm famous now. 10,000 people? It's almost my whole town.

03:23:45,521 --> 03:23:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  It is kind of crazy. Like 10,000 people is crazy. It's crazy. If you

03:23:49,858 --> 03:23:57,091
SPEAKER_0:  If you had 500 people attend a thing that you do, that would be like, you're like a rock star. That's crazy.

03:23:57,091 --> 03:23:57,841
SPEAKER_1:  We lose

03:23:57,841 --> 03:24:00,841
SPEAKER_0:  perspective. Yeah, we were really loose perspective very quickly.

03:24:00,841 --> 03:24:01,534
SPEAKER_1:  So...

03:24:01,890 --> 03:24:05,566
SPEAKER_1:  I'd made another video, this one I spent more time on. and I I

03:24:06,306 --> 03:24:10,078
SPEAKER_1:  Before photography, actually, I used to do like wedding videography too, so I did.

03:24:10,370 --> 03:24:15,550
SPEAKER_1:  done my woes with videography and weddings and stuff. I hated video like I thought video was the worst.

03:24:15,842 --> 03:24:16,894
SPEAKER_1:  Took so long to edit.

03:24:17,186 --> 03:24:21,342
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I love Darvius. It's like, boom, you snap it, boom, post, you're done in an hour, you know.

03:24:21,602 --> 03:24:25,022
SPEAKER_1:  And video is like this whole cumbersome thing. So I thought I'll never do video.

03:24:25,570 --> 03:24:31,710
SPEAKER_1:  And here I was making this long, what it's, the time seemed like a long, seven minute long YouTube video about how the Falcon 9 lands.

03:24:32,450 --> 03:24:36,638
SPEAKER_1:  And again, like that one I posted and actually it did really bad. And I was really upset. disturbed me, especially, if you like it.

03:24:37,314 --> 03:24:38,942
SPEAKER_1:  on the stupid video.

03:24:39,458 --> 03:24:40,030
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

03:24:40,258 --> 03:24:45,854
SPEAKER_1:  worked really hard scripting and blah blah blah and then it had like a thousand views or something. It did much worse in the first video.

03:24:46,466 --> 03:24:47,358
SPEAKER_1:  and I was so upset.

03:24:47,842 --> 03:24:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  And I kind of like was ready to keep throwing more spaghetti at the wall to see what's going to stick for everyday astronaut.

03:24:52,738 --> 03:24:57,726
SPEAKER_1:  I think it was like a month or two later, I happened to like, you know, check the analytics on YouTube and all of a sudden, hmm.

03:24:58,370 --> 03:24:59,326
SPEAKER_1:  That video, I kinda...

03:24:59,682 --> 03:25:03,198
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. Took off and I got like 40 or 50 or 60,000 views or something. I was like.

03:25:04,450 --> 03:25:07,198
SPEAKER_1:  And it just kept, you know, that just honed it in more like, okay.

03:25:07,490 --> 03:25:10,590
SPEAKER_1:  YouTube will bring a bigger, like, bring an audience to me.

03:25:10,882 --> 03:25:13,406
SPEAKER_1:  as opposed to like Instagram, I had to find and...

03:25:13,634 --> 03:25:13,950
SPEAKER_1:  Young.

03:25:14,242 --> 03:25:17,438
SPEAKER_1:  try to get the audience to come to me. And this was like, they were going to do the leg work.

03:25:17,794 --> 03:25:19,486
SPEAKER_1:  So if I make decent videos...

03:25:19,938 --> 03:25:23,038
SPEAKER_1:  And I realized like really the fun thing for me was explaining.

03:25:23,586 --> 03:25:27,294
SPEAKER_1:  a topic that was scary and intimidating and try to make it fun and engaging.

03:25:28,034 --> 03:25:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  What were some of the struggles of building up a YouTube channel? So for people who don't know, once again, you have a YouTube channel called Everyday Astronaut and there's some incredible videos on it. So what was the-

03:25:40,770 --> 03:25:44,145
SPEAKER_0:  What was some of the challenges and struggles in the early days?

03:25:44,145 --> 03:25:49,246
SPEAKER_1:  Definitely like at first you're not gonna find your own voice and I know like even you know, Jimmy talked

03:25:49,538 --> 03:25:54,046
SPEAKER_1:  to you about that, like how your first video is gonna suck. You're not gonna be yourself. You're gonna be nervous, you're gonna be...

03:25:54,498 --> 03:25:57,342
SPEAKER_1:  not getting on the tone, the pace, the things that are interesting.

03:25:57,858 --> 03:26:05,950
SPEAKER_1:  And actually, originally, I had constraints. I was really worried about making a short video because I thought there's no way anyone's gonna watch a three-minute video and then a seven-minute video.

03:26:06,626 --> 03:26:09,950
SPEAKER_1:  And pretty quickly I realized like YouTube as a whole was kind of changing.

03:26:10,370 --> 03:26:11,550
SPEAKER_1:  But also there's always that.

03:26:12,002 --> 03:26:14,526
SPEAKER_1:  historic backbone of like 20.

03:26:14,978 --> 03:26:18,334
SPEAKER_1:  two minutes of programming for a 30 minute spot on TV.

03:26:18,562 --> 03:26:23,390
SPEAKER_1:  Like no one goes over 22 or 44 minutes, you know, if you have the full hour special or whatever. Like that is.

03:26:23,746 --> 03:26:26,718
SPEAKER_1:  the absolute limit of what a human being can watch.

03:26:27,202 --> 03:26:27,550
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

03:26:28,002 --> 03:26:35,038
SPEAKER_1:  basically was what I thought. And slowly I just kept playing and getting longer and actually more and more in depth into the topics.

03:26:35,426 --> 03:26:38,302
SPEAKER_1:  And instead of getting like pushback, you know, be like, this is so boring.

03:26:38,690 --> 03:26:44,382
SPEAKER_1:  I realized as long as I was walking people through the whole step, giving them all the context they need.

03:26:44,642 --> 03:26:47,262
SPEAKER_1:  They're happy to get as deep into the weeds as I can get them.

03:26:47,906 --> 03:26:50,974
SPEAKER_1:  And so that just kind of fed the snowball that's kept rolling and I'm like.

03:26:51,394 --> 03:26:55,966
SPEAKER_1:  All right, and you know, before you know it, I'm making hour long videos like an hour long is.

03:26:56,290 --> 03:26:58,046
SPEAKER_1:  more or less a normal length on my channel.

03:26:58,690 --> 03:27:02,750
SPEAKER_1:  for a produced video and they're really, really in depth.

03:27:03,170 --> 03:27:08,254
SPEAKER_1:  but I love that process of trying to preemptively kind of guess what the questions might be.

03:27:08,706 --> 03:27:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  and end.

03:27:09,506 --> 03:27:13,086
SPEAKER_1:  Part of that is we do script read-throughs with our supporters.

03:27:13,666 --> 03:27:18,270
SPEAKER_1:  and do like cuts of videos and people, a decent amount of people see it before it goes public.

03:27:18,722 --> 03:27:21,438
SPEAKER_1:  And we get those questions out of the way. And we get those people asking.

03:27:21,730 --> 03:27:24,542
SPEAKER_1:  the questions and then I love nothing more than trying to.

03:27:25,442 --> 03:27:27,774
SPEAKER_1:  you know, get all those questions answered by the end of the video.

03:27:28,610 --> 03:27:30,046
SPEAKER_0:  question about being a

03:27:30,434 --> 03:27:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  A creator on YouTube.

03:27:32,514 --> 03:27:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  that could be.

03:27:33,666 --> 03:27:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  a challenging psychological aspect to it, which is like, you might invest a huge amount of-

03:27:37,858 --> 03:27:38,494
SPEAKER_0:  Your effort.

03:27:39,266 --> 03:27:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  into a thing in it.

03:27:42,146 --> 03:27:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  doesn't receive much attention at all.

03:27:45,378 --> 03:27:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  You know, there's something about YouTube and in general social media.

03:27:49,090 --> 03:27:51,070
SPEAKER_0:  that makes you feel really crappy about that.

03:27:51,330 --> 03:27:51,998
SPEAKER_0:  if you let it.

03:27:52,514 --> 03:27:54,366
SPEAKER_0:  if you really look at the numbers.

03:27:54,978 --> 03:27:57,406
SPEAKER_0:  It's very, very difficult not to pay attention to that.

03:27:57,634 --> 03:28:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, that's the reason why I turn off numbers on my.

03:28:00,578 --> 03:28:00,926
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:28:01,506 --> 03:28:03,934
SPEAKER_0:  my interface for stuff that I've created.

03:28:04,226 --> 03:28:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  Because I just see it having a negative effect on your mind.

03:28:07,170 --> 03:28:09,310
SPEAKER_0:  But even then, it still has an effect.

03:28:09,666 --> 03:28:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, your epic video on...

03:28:14,530 --> 03:28:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  the history of

03:28:16,610 --> 03:28:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  Soviet rockets comes to mind. And we'll talk about that in a second, but it's called People Should Check It Out.

03:28:22,626 --> 03:28:25,246
SPEAKER_0:  the entire Soviet rocket engine family tree.

03:28:25,602 --> 03:28:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  So that's something you've researched for two years. Yeah.

03:28:29,186 --> 03:28:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  You put your heart and soul into it. There's a lot of passion, there's a long journey. I think about like an hour and a half video.

03:28:37,730 --> 03:28:41,982
SPEAKER_0:  Um, is there like, uh, is there challenges? Is there like.

03:28:43,298 --> 03:28:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  How difficult is that to put so much of yourself into a video?

03:28:46,786 --> 03:28:48,542
SPEAKER_0:  and it may be not due so well.

03:28:49,154 --> 03:28:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

03:28:49,826 --> 03:28:51,166
SPEAKER_1:  That's the...

03:28:51,874 --> 03:28:56,478
SPEAKER_1:  That's the struggle for sure, honestly, especially as like as we grow, I try.

03:28:56,770 --> 03:28:58,782
SPEAKER_1:  to make better and better videos, which means.

03:28:59,266 --> 03:29:04,094
SPEAKER_1:  hiring more and more people to do higher end animations and spend more time editing and shooting and

03:29:04,642 --> 03:29:05,310
SPEAKER_1:  scripting and just...

03:29:06,114 --> 03:29:09,534
SPEAKER_1:  But at the end of the day, like, it still can't be just losing money.

03:29:09,634 --> 03:29:09,982
SPEAKER_0:  Mm-hmm.

03:29:10,178 --> 03:29:14,494
SPEAKER_1:  And I have videos that definitely lose a lot of money because I hire.

03:29:15,042 --> 03:29:16,382
SPEAKER_1:  3D artists and stuff and...

03:29:16,898 --> 03:29:17,374
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:29:17,922 --> 03:29:23,742
SPEAKER_1:  And I was so certain. The Soviet rocket engine video I thought was just purely going to be a passion project.

03:29:24,098 --> 03:29:27,710
SPEAKER_1:  I honestly was like, if it ever crosses a million, it's a home run.

03:29:28,226 --> 03:29:31,601
SPEAKER_0:  And is it, I had to see it cross like a couple million now? I think it's a little.

03:29:31,601 --> 03:29:32,158
SPEAKER_1:  to a

03:29:32,610 --> 03:29:35,742
SPEAKER_1:  which is insane to me. Like I just really thought this was-

03:29:36,226 --> 03:29:43,870
SPEAKER_1:  more something just to put on the shelf as a resource, almost for myself, you know, like, just to kind of have that knowledge bank and something I've always wanted to straighten out in my own head.

03:29:44,386 --> 03:29:46,462
SPEAKER_1:  and kind of know the history a little bit better.

03:29:46,978 --> 03:29:49,991
SPEAKER_1:  But come to find out, like it took a while. You know, it was a slow turn.

03:29:49,991 --> 03:29:53,822
SPEAKER_0:  But I remember when you first released it and that's when I watched it.

03:29:54,978 --> 03:29:57,758
SPEAKER_0:  I remember like this has so few views

03:29:58,050 --> 03:29:59,934
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I remember being just sad.

03:30:01,026 --> 03:30:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  Like I was like sad about the state of the world because I know how much love you put into it. How like how much.

03:30:07,522 --> 03:30:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, to me, for some reason, that somehow would directly connect to.

03:30:12,578 --> 03:30:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  huge views.

03:30:13,922 --> 03:30:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  But see, you know what made me sad is like.

03:30:16,642 --> 03:30:19,870
SPEAKER_0:  If you use a different thumbnail or a different title that could affect

03:30:20,098 --> 03:30:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  the popularity and then I just could imagine the torment you're going through.

03:30:24,866 --> 03:30:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  What if I used a different thumbnail?

03:30:27,042 --> 03:30:30,942
SPEAKER_0:  It's that Jimmy, the Mr. Beast torment.

03:30:31,458 --> 03:30:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  Just a slightly different title.

03:30:33,730 --> 03:30:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  or slightly different.

03:30:36,066 --> 03:30:39,742
SPEAKER_1:  And I have videos, ironically, the last like.

03:30:40,258 --> 03:30:42,142
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know, five videos I've produced are-

03:30:42,818 --> 03:30:45,470
SPEAKER_1:  horribly flopping like some of my worst videos I've ever made.

03:30:45,698 --> 03:30:47,998
SPEAKER_0:  statistically. The interesting one is like...

03:30:48,450 --> 03:30:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  the use some rice group incredible video you summarizing

03:30:52,482 --> 03:30:53,470
SPEAKER_0:  that people should go watch.

03:30:53,698 --> 03:30:59,038
SPEAKER_0:  about all the awards video for 2022, like all the cool stuff that happened between 2022.

03:30:59,426 --> 03:31:02,801
SPEAKER_0:  I remember that not being that popular. There's a few ones recently that are not that popular.

03:31:02,801 --> 03:31:08,190
SPEAKER_1:  Like riding in a fighter jet. I thought that was gonna be easy like one or two million

03:31:08,418 --> 03:31:10,398
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if I've paid the flights off.

03:31:10,722 --> 03:31:14,654
SPEAKER_1:  to go there, you know what I mean? Like in that video. It makes no sense.

03:31:14,882 --> 03:31:17,886
SPEAKER_1:  And frankly, here's at the end of the day.

03:31:18,242 --> 03:31:19,902
SPEAKER_1:  I realized like I have

03:31:20,290 --> 03:31:27,262
SPEAKER_1:  Lately, especially the last year or two, kind of disconnected from that aspect of it. I'm super fortunate. I have very generous Patreon support.

03:31:27,490 --> 03:31:29,406
SPEAKER_1:  and people that can help me sustain to produce.

03:31:29,506 --> 03:31:32,094
SPEAKER_0:  People go support, support Tim on Patreon.

03:31:32,802 --> 03:31:33,438
SPEAKER_1:  Well, it's...

03:31:33,698 --> 03:31:36,350
SPEAKER_1:  But as you know, as a creator, that is what...

03:31:36,578 --> 03:31:41,886
SPEAKER_1:  keeps the lights on it and makes it so it's, you know, I can go this deep. Like if I didn't have that, if I had to rely solely on.

03:31:42,210 --> 03:31:43,422
SPEAKER_1:  like YouTube ad revenue.

03:31:43,970 --> 03:31:44,510
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I would just.

03:31:44,866 --> 03:31:53,886
SPEAKER_1:  They'd be super different videos. I wouldn't spend as much time researching because I just, you know, they just be more glossed over. It's like a hurry to turn them out so I can keep the machine going.

03:31:54,498 --> 03:31:56,542
SPEAKER_1:  and I have this incredible freedom.

03:31:57,474 --> 03:32:02,942
SPEAKER_1:  to really dive into a topic like a video that I've been working on now for almost three months is how to start a rocket engine.

03:32:03,618 --> 03:32:05,758
SPEAKER_1:  And let me tell you, it's not as easy as...

03:32:06,082 --> 03:32:07,550
SPEAKER_1:  as one might think or I guess.

03:32:08,002 --> 03:32:11,358
SPEAKER_1:  as it is as difficult as you might think. I mean, it's an insane topic.

03:32:11,874 --> 03:32:12,999
SPEAKER_1:  And I would even by starting.

03:32:12,999 --> 03:32:13,749
SPEAKER_0:  I mean like the ignition.

03:32:13,749 --> 03:32:20,222
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, like how do you physically get them running? You know, like there's all these, you know, the valves and the turbine

03:32:20,546 --> 03:32:25,342
SPEAKER_1:  The turbine, you know that we were talking about earlier, like that has to run on the pumps, but itself is powering the pumps.

03:32:25,922 --> 03:32:28,478
SPEAKER_1:  So how do you get that, like chicken and egg, how do you get that thing started?

03:32:29,314 --> 03:32:32,638
SPEAKER_1:  You know, there's tons of, it's so cool. There's so many ways.

03:32:33,026 --> 03:32:36,894
SPEAKER_1:  And so for me, you know, that required reading a lot and talking to.

03:32:37,154 --> 03:32:38,494
SPEAKER_1:  people that know a lot more than me.

03:32:39,074 --> 03:32:46,782
SPEAKER_1:  Um, and just really trying to make sure I understand enough of it to explain it and try to weave a narrative, you know? So that video is three months in the making.

03:32:47,234 --> 03:32:49,438
SPEAKER_1:  We're still probably another two or three weeks out.

03:32:50,114 --> 03:32:55,934
SPEAKER_1:  And it's, I don't expect, I mean, I think this one will do relatively well, you know, but in the grand scheme of YouTube, like still.

03:32:56,706 --> 03:32:58,206
SPEAKER_1:  child's play, you know it.

03:32:59,522 --> 03:33:05,374
SPEAKER_1:  I'm okay, and I'm okay with that. I'm at that point, actually, where I am okay with that. It still stings.

03:33:05,858 --> 03:33:10,750
SPEAKER_1:  And I'm more worried about just like, can I continue to do it at this quality and at this level?

03:33:11,362 --> 03:33:13,790
SPEAKER_1:  if it's losing money. You know what I mean? Given.

03:33:14,082 --> 03:33:16,926
SPEAKER_1:  There is a trade off and I am kind of having to navigate that.

03:33:17,410 --> 03:33:19,646
SPEAKER_0:  But you have sort of the depth.

03:33:20,802 --> 03:33:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  of the impact you have.

03:33:23,490 --> 03:33:30,334
SPEAKER_0:  is a thing that YouTube can't give you numbers on, but it's a really important thing to sort of remember.

03:33:30,658 --> 03:33:33,470
SPEAKER_0:  that it's really not just about the YouTube numbers.

03:33:33,826 --> 03:33:36,094
SPEAKER_0:  For people like you, they're...

03:33:36,482 --> 03:33:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  basically.

03:33:38,018 --> 03:33:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  Educating.

03:33:39,298 --> 03:33:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  and revealing the brilliance in a.

03:33:42,530 --> 03:33:44,862
SPEAKER_0:  technology that.

03:33:45,602 --> 03:33:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  will make humans a multiplanetary species and give hope.

03:33:49,282 --> 03:33:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  to millions of young minds that will build that future.

03:33:53,250 --> 03:33:54,302
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, that's immeasurable.

03:33:54,722 --> 03:33:59,166
SPEAKER_0:  That's not just the views. That's, uh, but you know, it's, um.

03:33:59,746 --> 03:34:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  That's really important to sort of remember.

03:34:02,562 --> 03:34:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  as you're creating it. That's something I try to think about as well. So like views.

03:34:09,122 --> 03:34:10,910
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. And that becomes more.

03:34:11,234 --> 03:34:15,518
SPEAKER_1:  Don't matter. I realize that more and more like every day, you know, the more

03:34:15,874 --> 03:34:21,118
SPEAKER_1:  the channel matures, the more I realize the importance of it as an overall mission as opposed to like...

03:34:21,506 --> 03:34:24,286
SPEAKER_1:  You know, in the first year or two, it's a rat race of growth and...

03:34:24,802 --> 03:34:30,046
SPEAKER_1:  of popularity and all that kind of stuff. And you feel that, you feel that it's a driving force. These days.

03:34:30,306 --> 03:34:32,414
SPEAKER_1:  Not so much, just because that will wear you out.

03:34:32,674 --> 03:34:33,278
SPEAKER_1:  very quickly.

03:34:33,890 --> 03:34:40,606
SPEAKER_0:  So back to the Soviet rocket video, the epic video, probably the most epically researched video you've done.

03:34:40,930 --> 03:34:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's like, it's truly an epic video.

03:34:44,674 --> 03:34:46,878
SPEAKER_0:  uh... so what uh...

03:34:47,138 --> 03:34:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  again called the entire Soviet rocket engine family tree.

03:34:51,234 --> 03:34:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  Took you two years to research.

03:34:53,410 --> 03:34:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  What are some fascinating things you've learned?

03:34:55,874 --> 03:34:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  about the history of rocket engines.

03:34:59,138 --> 03:35:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  in the Soviet Union and in general through the process of making that video.

03:35:05,250 --> 03:35:05,694
SPEAKER_0:  The- the-

03:35:06,050 --> 03:35:07,710
SPEAKER_1:  Coolest thing to me is...

03:35:08,578 --> 03:35:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  How?

03:35:09,538 --> 03:35:12,222
SPEAKER_1:  It's this weird blend for the Soviet Union went.

03:35:12,578 --> 03:35:13,086
SPEAKER_1:  through a.

03:35:13,890 --> 03:35:18,974
SPEAKER_1:  an insane iteration process and made so many engines. Like I didn't even touch.

03:35:19,490 --> 03:35:19,870
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

03:35:20,322 --> 03:35:26,462
SPEAKER_1:  any like maneuvering thrusters or missile engines. Like I only really dealt with main propulsion engines on orbital rockets and they're still.

03:35:26,786 --> 03:35:29,758
SPEAKER_1:  way too many to talk about. I mean, it's still dozens and dozens of engines.

03:35:30,498 --> 03:35:33,182
SPEAKER_1:  And I could have gone deeper into this, which is hilarious.

03:35:33,730 --> 03:35:34,142
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:35:34,786 --> 03:35:37,054
SPEAKER_1:  They iterated so much, made a new engine for-

03:35:37,282 --> 03:35:37,822
SPEAKER_1:  Just at the-

03:35:38,146 --> 03:35:38,846
SPEAKER_1:  Drop of a hat.

03:35:40,066 --> 03:35:54,174
SPEAKER_1:  yet they still also like did super primitive things. You know, they physically are still today lighting the main combustion chambers of the Soyuz engines of the RD-107 and RD-108 with essentially matchsticks. Like they literally stick a T-shaped.

03:35:54,690 --> 03:35:55,934
SPEAKER_1:  thing up into the chamber.

03:35:56,226 --> 03:35:57,886
SPEAKER_1:  and have a pyrotechnic in the...

03:35:58,114 --> 03:35:59,294
SPEAKER_1:  in it that.

03:35:59,586 --> 03:36:01,854
SPEAKER_1:  ignites the actual propellants in the combustion chamber.

03:36:02,274 --> 03:36:03,742
SPEAKER_1:  is not the most elegant solution.

03:36:04,258 --> 03:36:06,494
SPEAKER_1:  They're still using that. So they went from like-

03:36:07,234 --> 03:36:08,190
SPEAKER_1:  the whole spectrum.

03:36:08,418 --> 03:36:11,998
SPEAKER_1:  of like, it's a mixture of like, make it better, faster, harder, stronger.

03:36:12,290 --> 03:36:12,638
SPEAKER_1:  Gooder.

03:36:12,898 --> 03:36:13,566
SPEAKER_1:  all the way around.

03:36:13,922 --> 03:36:15,454
SPEAKER_1:  to also if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

03:36:15,874 --> 03:36:16,990
SPEAKER_1:  It's like it employs.

03:36:17,602 --> 03:36:18,526
SPEAKER_1:  all of the above.

03:36:18,754 --> 03:36:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  So it's like, it's a lot of innovation, but also they use duct tape.

03:36:23,042 --> 03:36:24,775
SPEAKER_0:  It's like all of it together.

03:36:24,775 --> 03:36:26,878
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, aha, that's exactly like

03:36:27,138 --> 03:36:31,294
SPEAKER_1:  That's exactly the way to put it. And they did things that are insane. They developed...

03:36:31,682 --> 03:36:35,294
SPEAKER_1:  or full flow stage combustion cycle engine. This engine had it been used.

03:36:35,522 --> 03:36:36,894
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, it would have put the F, it was.

03:36:37,186 --> 03:36:44,062
SPEAKER_1:  same relative size as the F1 engine on the Saturn V, in that same category, way up there of like, you know, 6.7.

03:36:44,610 --> 03:36:48,926
SPEAKER_1:  like meganeutons of thrust or something around and then the f1 is like seven or something it's it's

03:36:49,378 --> 03:36:50,014
SPEAKER_1:  Huge.

03:36:50,882 --> 03:36:51,486
SPEAKER_1:  Yet.

03:36:51,746 --> 03:36:54,142
SPEAKER_1:  Way more complicated, way more efficient, way...

03:36:54,818 --> 03:36:56,414
SPEAKER_1:  just better engine in that sense.

03:36:56,770 --> 03:36:58,174
SPEAKER_1:  as far as performance goes.

03:36:58,530 --> 03:36:59,358
SPEAKER_1:  yet it never flew.

03:36:59,618 --> 03:37:03,230
SPEAKER_1:  It never left the stand, you know, they never built the rocket around it.

03:37:03,714 --> 03:37:06,782
SPEAKER_1:  The N1, which is the most powerful rocket.

03:37:07,170 --> 03:37:08,638
SPEAKER_1:  to have flown so far to date.

03:37:09,090 --> 03:37:09,438
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:37:10,114 --> 03:37:12,734
SPEAKER_1:  like it never made it through its first stage burn.

03:37:13,122 --> 03:37:16,286
SPEAKER_1:  All four attempts failed spectacularly and yet...

03:37:16,514 --> 03:37:18,494
SPEAKER_1:  It had so much technology on it that it was...

03:37:18,850 --> 03:37:22,366
SPEAKER_1:  still unrivaled today almost. like finally now we're beating it.

03:37:22,690 --> 03:37:26,270
SPEAKER_1:  the NK-33s that they developed for that rocket. Like, finally today.

03:37:26,818 --> 03:37:30,270
SPEAKER_1:  were to the point of having better engines than they built in the 60s.

03:37:30,722 --> 03:37:33,470
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, what stands out to you from the N1?

03:37:33,698 --> 03:37:34,974
SPEAKER_0:  family of rocket engines.

03:37:35,778 --> 03:37:37,662
SPEAKER_1:  Well, it's interesting because the N1...

03:37:37,890 --> 03:37:44,702
SPEAKER_1:  was the Kudsnetsov Design Bureau, and he was actually an aircraft manufacturer. So he's one of the first people outside of kind of the-

03:37:45,282 --> 03:37:48,062
SPEAKER_1:  the missile and rocket program, you know, you had all these other

03:37:48,290 --> 03:37:49,822
SPEAKER_1:  big wigs kind of in the

03:37:50,146 --> 03:37:55,326
SPEAKER_1:  other OKBs that were developing missiles and rockets. And then all of a sudden here comes Nikolai Kutsnetsov who

03:37:56,002 --> 03:37:56,350
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:37:56,802 --> 03:37:57,214
SPEAKER_1:  never

03:37:57,442 --> 03:38:03,166
SPEAKER_1:  developed a rocket engine. And so his first attempt at a rocket engine was the NK series, the NK-15, NK-33.

03:38:03,426 --> 03:38:04,318
SPEAKER_1:  And they're amazing.

03:38:04,610 --> 03:38:05,790
SPEAKER_1:  They were brilliant.

03:38:06,210 --> 03:38:08,606
SPEAKER_1:  these wonderful closed cycle oxygen rich engines.

03:38:09,058 --> 03:38:09,470
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:38:09,698 --> 03:38:13,054
SPEAKER_1:  that were awesome. There were awesome engines and that were.

03:38:13,730 --> 03:38:14,878
SPEAKER_1:  You know, because...

03:38:15,650 --> 03:38:17,534
SPEAKER_1:  I love that because he has direct

03:38:17,922 --> 03:38:18,270
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:38:18,530 --> 03:38:22,558
SPEAKER_1:  boss he eats since he wasn't necessarily in the in the aerospace, you know, or in the

03:38:23,106 --> 03:38:24,734
SPEAKER_1:  I guess the rocket missile defense world.

03:38:25,250 --> 03:38:26,302
SPEAKER_1:  He didn't have to.

03:38:26,978 --> 03:38:27,486
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

03:38:27,842 --> 03:38:33,022
SPEAKER_1:  at the fall of the Soviet Union, he didn't have to give away all of his things to the same people as the other people.

03:38:33,474 --> 03:38:36,190
SPEAKER_1:  So he hid, you know, like 80 of his engines.

03:38:36,578 --> 03:38:37,150
SPEAKER_1:  In a hanger?

03:38:38,178 --> 03:38:39,326
SPEAKER_1:  And then.

03:38:39,618 --> 03:38:41,118
SPEAKER_1:  We still literally use them.

03:38:41,602 --> 03:38:44,766
SPEAKER_1:  In the United States we used altogether, I think it was like eight or 10 of them.

03:38:46,306 --> 03:38:51,550
SPEAKER_1:  repurpose them as they're called AJ-26s in the United States, but like we still were flying Soviet rocket engines.

03:38:52,002 --> 03:38:53,310
SPEAKER_1:  in the 2000s.

03:38:53,890 --> 03:38:56,894
SPEAKER_1:  because they were better than engines we are building today.

03:38:57,538 --> 03:38:58,238
SPEAKER_1:  Like that's.

03:38:58,658 --> 03:39:02,782
SPEAKER_1:  To me, that's my favorite fact about the N1. How can inse, is that there?..

03:39:03,074 --> 03:39:04,318
SPEAKER_1:  Still that good.

03:39:04,898 --> 03:39:07,294
SPEAKER_1:  They were the best choice for at the time.

03:39:07,810 --> 03:39:08,935
SPEAKER_1:  orbital science.

03:39:08,935 --> 03:39:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  of the culture that engineering has led to these things that still work. It's incredible. You said that the RD171 is one of the coolest engines ever made.

03:39:19,746 --> 03:39:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  Why's that?

03:39:20,706 --> 03:39:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, also...

03:39:22,178 --> 03:39:23,198
SPEAKER_1:  One of the fun things about.

03:39:23,682 --> 03:39:31,038
SPEAKER_1:  the Soviet engines is it'll look like a lot of their engines look like multiple engines because you see multiple nozzles, you see multiple combustion chambers and you'd think

03:39:31,682 --> 03:39:32,958
SPEAKER_1:  Obviously, you know the

03:39:33,282 --> 03:39:34,910
SPEAKER_1:  Nozzle is the engine, right?

03:39:35,394 --> 03:39:35,838
SPEAKER_1:  But...

03:39:36,322 --> 03:39:39,198
SPEAKER_1:  what they actually would do. The real the real heart.

03:39:39,618 --> 03:39:40,286
SPEAKER_1:  and the real...

03:39:40,930 --> 03:39:44,798
SPEAKER_1:  of the rocket engine actually comes from the turbo pumps, comes from the pumps themselves.

03:39:45,442 --> 03:39:49,246
SPEAKER_1:  And as we talked about earlier, that includes the turbine and the actual...

03:39:49,538 --> 03:39:50,846
SPEAKER_1:  pumps that

03:39:51,074 --> 03:39:52,798
SPEAKER_1:  the propellant into the chambers.

03:39:53,378 --> 03:39:53,982
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

03:39:54,626 --> 03:39:56,030
SPEAKER_1:  The Soviet Union was

03:39:56,290 --> 03:40:00,062
SPEAKER_1:  incredible at developing these closed cycle high powered turbo pumps.

03:40:00,610 --> 03:40:03,294
SPEAKER_1:  But if you try to scale the combustion chamber too big...

03:40:03,778 --> 03:40:05,534
SPEAKER_1:  you end up with what's called...

03:40:06,050 --> 03:40:10,622
SPEAKER_1:  combustion instability. You're having such a large surface area.

03:40:11,106 --> 03:40:11,582
SPEAKER_1:  of

03:40:12,034 --> 03:40:17,982
SPEAKER_1:  crazy flames and combustion happening, they can get these weird pockets and oscillations and frequencies and

03:40:18,466 --> 03:40:24,126
SPEAKER_1:  and they just couldn't make big combustion chambers. They never figured it out. They never quite, well, they did actually kind of figure it out, but they.

03:40:24,386 --> 03:40:26,558
SPEAKER_1:  They didn't like it. So they ended up just.

03:40:26,882 --> 03:40:27,454
SPEAKER_1:  Shrinking.

03:40:27,714 --> 03:40:32,606
SPEAKER_1:  down and having small combustion chambers and just sending splitting the pipes basically instead of

03:40:32,898 --> 03:40:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  one fuel pump going into one pipe going into one.

03:40:36,322 --> 03:40:39,934
SPEAKER_1:  combustion chamber and one oxidizer pipe going into one combustion chamber.

03:40:40,226 --> 03:40:44,350
SPEAKER_1:  they'd split it off into two or four combustion chambers.

03:40:44,738 --> 03:40:49,246
SPEAKER_1:  and kind of spread that work around so they didn't experience this combustion instability.

03:40:49,762 --> 03:40:51,294
SPEAKER_1:  So the RD-171 is like.

03:40:51,746 --> 03:40:54,814
SPEAKER_1:  still to date the most powerful rocket engine ever built.

03:40:55,170 --> 03:40:57,694
SPEAKER_1:  The turbo pump is insane. I don't even remember how many.

03:40:58,146 --> 03:41:01,182
SPEAKER_1:  you know, like 200,000 horsepower or something comes out of that turbo pump.

03:41:01,922 --> 03:41:07,838
SPEAKER_1:  in order to flow the amount of propellant necessary at those rates and at those pressures into the combustion chamber. It has four chambers.

03:41:08,546 --> 03:41:12,030
SPEAKER_1:  And it's just, it's just an absolute marvel of engineering.

03:41:13,090 --> 03:41:17,342
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, and then the cool thing too is specifically the RD 171, its engine.

03:41:17,602 --> 03:41:19,582
SPEAKER_1:  And all four of those nozzles can actually...

03:41:19,938 --> 03:41:22,910
SPEAKER_1:  pivot and rotate. I just –

03:41:23,170 --> 03:41:24,990
SPEAKER_1:  Now, as I'm explaining this realized.

03:41:25,698 --> 03:41:27,294
SPEAKER_1:  that has to mean that they have...

03:41:28,642 --> 03:41:31,550
SPEAKER_1:  joints, like flexible joints in the...

03:41:31,906 --> 03:41:33,502
SPEAKER_1:  high pressure pump lines.

03:41:33,986 --> 03:41:34,590
SPEAKER_1:  In order to-

03:41:35,010 --> 03:41:39,262
SPEAKER_1:  I never, this is the realization I'm having right now, because normally you put the gimbal.

03:41:39,586 --> 03:41:43,230
SPEAKER_1:  above the turbo pump, like the mount where the engine swivels.

03:41:43,522 --> 03:41:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  so that you have low pressure coming from the tanks into the pumps

03:41:47,202 --> 03:41:49,566
SPEAKER_1:  And then you just have a straight, you know, fixed pipe.

03:41:50,210 --> 03:41:53,182
SPEAKER_1:  flowing into the engine so you don't have to bend that pipe and have it be dynamic.

03:41:53,762 --> 03:41:55,518
SPEAKER_1:  If they had the four chambers moving...

03:41:56,098 --> 03:41:57,438
SPEAKER_1:  independently from each other.

03:41:57,890 --> 03:41:59,710
SPEAKER_1:  That means those four chambers all had to have...

03:42:00,066 --> 03:42:01,374
SPEAKER_1:  a flexible high pressure.

03:42:01,890 --> 03:42:03,198
SPEAKER_1:  pipe going, which I don't even.

03:42:03,490 --> 03:42:06,613
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if that's, why am I just now realizing this? Yeah.

03:42:06,613 --> 03:42:09,694
SPEAKER_0:  So there's engineering challenges with that

03:42:09,986 --> 03:42:16,483
SPEAKER_1:  I never even thought that was a thing you would ever could do, honestly. I gotta look into why and how and what-

03:42:16,483 --> 03:42:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  I wonder why that design decision was made.

03:42:19,330 --> 03:42:31,134
SPEAKER_1:  So the easier thing to do normally is you would keep those nozzles fixed, and then a fixed like say the Soyuz engine, the RD-107 and 108, they have a fixed main combustion chambers and they use these little vernier.

03:42:31,458 --> 03:42:33,950
SPEAKER_1:  Some people got mad at me for saying Vernier and Werner.

03:42:34,306 --> 03:42:38,078
SPEAKER_1:  engines that swivel themselves and those provide your control authority.

03:42:38,498 --> 03:42:43,678
SPEAKER_1:  so that the main chambers stay fixed and then you get your roll and your pitch and you're yaw out of auxiliary thrusters.

03:42:44,258 --> 03:42:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  By the way, did you get anything wrong in that video?

03:42:47,170 --> 03:42:48,766
SPEAKER_0:  that people told you about. Well, yeah.

03:42:48,898 --> 03:42:50,110
SPEAKER_1:  I have a few things, yep.

03:42:50,562 --> 03:42:51,070
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:42:51,362 --> 03:42:56,542
SPEAKER_1:  First off, we had a graphic error where we actually, we copied and pasted a lot of our After Effects projects.

03:42:56,770 --> 03:43:02,654
SPEAKER_1:  So our nuclear engines, one of them on screen says that it runs on RP-1, it does not. It has basically all the wrong stats.

03:43:03,074 --> 03:43:06,238
SPEAKER_1:  We just didn't catch it in the edit, that we literally copy and paste it in.

03:43:06,626 --> 03:43:08,318
SPEAKER_1:  I say it right on screen, but the-

03:43:08,962 --> 03:43:10,782
SPEAKER_1:  and the voiceover, but on screen it's wrong.

03:43:11,330 --> 03:43:13,182
SPEAKER_1:  The other thing, and I'm excited to ask you about this.

03:43:13,570 --> 03:43:20,222
SPEAKER_1:  Uh oh. I watched and I spoke with a lot of Russian speaking individuals, we had a lot of research assistants that were reading and blah blah blah.

03:43:20,674 --> 03:43:22,878
SPEAKER_1:  I tried really hard to learn how to pronounce.

03:43:23,202 --> 03:43:23,838
SPEAKER_1:  Sergey.

03:43:24,514 --> 03:43:25,950
SPEAKER_1:  Karel- Karelios name.

03:43:26,306 --> 03:43:31,134
SPEAKER_1:  And I'm still gonna say it wrong no matter what, but my understanding. Yes.

03:43:31,394 --> 03:43:31,902
SPEAKER_1:  And from-

03:43:32,258 --> 03:43:33,950
SPEAKER_1:  listening to native speakers is closer to.

03:43:34,178 --> 03:43:34,814
SPEAKER_1:

03:43:35,426 --> 03:43:36,542
SPEAKER_1:  than it is Corlew.

03:43:37,186 --> 03:43:39,934
SPEAKER_0:  Jau, visada, Sergei Pavlovich Koralev.

03:43:40,770 --> 03:43:44,734
SPEAKER_1:  See, I will never say it that perfectly, but I know it's not just Corlew. I mean...

03:43:44,994 --> 03:43:46,526
SPEAKER_1:  Again, the English.

03:43:47,074 --> 03:43:48,574
SPEAKER_1:  translation of it likely I should have just said

03:43:48,994 --> 03:43:50,238
SPEAKER_1:  Core 11 said, I'm saying it.

03:43:50,818 --> 03:43:52,382
SPEAKER_1:  the dumb America way, but.

03:43:53,378 --> 03:43:56,030
SPEAKER_0:  But you rolled your R. Hehehehe! Comrade!

03:43:56,258 --> 03:43:59,454
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, excellent. So.

03:44:00,578 --> 03:44:04,798
SPEAKER_0:  Well, let me just ask you the difference in culture because you've researched so many rockers and

03:44:05,154 --> 03:44:08,894
SPEAKER_0:  so many different eras, the set of five, just everything you're seeing now.

03:44:09,442 --> 03:44:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  Are there some interesting differences, especially when you look at the space rays?

03:44:13,634 --> 03:44:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  between um...

03:44:15,010 --> 03:44:16,030
SPEAKER_0:  The Soviet.

03:44:16,962 --> 03:44:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  rocket engineers and efforts versus the American.

03:44:23,906 --> 03:44:24,926
SPEAKER_1:  There's, I mean there's...

03:44:25,154 --> 03:44:26,430
SPEAKER_1:  Definitely huge, huge.

03:44:26,690 --> 03:44:30,110
SPEAKER_1:  cultural changes. And the fun thing is that they kind of spawned.

03:44:30,402 --> 03:44:34,142
SPEAKER_1:  from the same, they have the same starting place. Both, you know, Soviet.

03:44:34,402 --> 03:44:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  rocket engines, and Americans.

03:44:36,226 --> 03:44:39,774
SPEAKER_1:  all came from the Nazi V2 rocket and the A4 engine.

03:44:40,226 --> 03:44:44,638
SPEAKER_1:  literally physically spawned from that because at the fall of, you know, at the end of World War II.

03:44:45,090 --> 03:44:48,926
SPEAKER_1:  We took a handful of German scientists and the Soviets took a handful of German scientists.

03:44:49,218 --> 03:44:49,822
SPEAKER_1:  And they both.

03:44:50,338 --> 03:44:57,278
SPEAKER_1:  got their own a little bit, some blueprints here and there, and the others got some blue. So we literally have the same, it's a weird thing where we're starting from the same like.

03:44:57,826 --> 03:45:01,566
SPEAKER_1:  and letting two divergent paths go.

03:45:02,082 --> 03:45:05,374
SPEAKER_1:  crazy on their own development. So it's really fun to see the cultural differences.

03:45:05,762 --> 03:45:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  One of the things the United States did is they really would kind of take an engine.

03:45:10,146 --> 03:45:10,558
SPEAKER_1:  and

03:45:10,882 --> 03:45:11,422
SPEAKER_1:  and just.

03:45:11,938 --> 03:45:13,502
SPEAKER_1:  perfect it more or less and then.

03:45:14,146 --> 03:45:15,966
SPEAKER_1:  and not really evolve that much.

03:45:16,706 --> 03:45:22,526
SPEAKER_1:  They I don't know and I don't know why I actually need to do a history lesson on all of the US entrance, but it's literally like.

03:45:23,106 --> 03:45:26,014
SPEAKER_1:  as far as orbital class engines before now.

03:45:26,754 --> 03:45:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  It's like.

03:45:27,586 --> 03:45:28,414
SPEAKER_1:  a dozen or two.

03:45:28,706 --> 03:45:31,614
SPEAKER_1:  You know, it's a tenth the amount of...

03:45:31,842 --> 03:45:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  the Soviets.

03:45:32,898 --> 03:45:35,230
SPEAKER_1:  and the Soviets just literally made up a new engine.

03:45:35,618 --> 03:45:37,182
SPEAKER_1:  every time they had a new like s-

03:45:37,506 --> 03:45:38,270
SPEAKER_1:  They wouldn't uh-

03:45:38,882 --> 03:45:42,567
SPEAKER_1:  And it was like a completely different engine. Yeah.

03:45:42,567 --> 03:45:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  I wonder if there's some aspect to the culture. I don't want to overstate it, but uh...

03:45:47,586 --> 03:45:50,782
SPEAKER_0:  There is more of a safety culture, I think, in the United States.

03:45:51,202 --> 03:45:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  And I think if you care about safety.

03:45:53,442 --> 03:45:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  or rather like.

03:45:55,074 --> 03:45:55,998
SPEAKER_0:  You have.

03:45:57,090 --> 03:46:02,814
SPEAKER_0:  You're more risk averse. Yeah, so you care about safety more about the value of human life. There is taken there

03:46:03,074 --> 03:46:03,550
SPEAKER_0:  So just wealth a bit.

03:46:04,066 --> 03:46:11,582
SPEAKER_0:  you will iterate less. So I think that's so yes, especially in the early aspects of the program. I don't want to overstate this is.

03:46:11,810 --> 03:46:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  Some of it is just...

03:46:14,018 --> 03:46:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  through stories, you just hear anecdotes.

03:46:16,674 --> 03:46:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  There are more.

03:46:17,826 --> 03:46:21,987
SPEAKER_0:  willing to take risks. Yeah. Human life risks with space.

03:46:21,987 --> 03:46:23,998
SPEAKER_1:  For example, the first.

03:46:24,578 --> 03:46:26,974
SPEAKER_1:  orbital space flights from the Soviet Union.

03:46:27,458 --> 03:46:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  The cosmonaut had to

03:46:28,514 --> 03:46:33,342
SPEAKER_1:  eject out of the capsule and parachute to a landing. Yes. Not very well known.

03:46:33,762 --> 03:46:38,302
SPEAKER_1:  And it wasn't, they hid that even from history as best they could at first because they were

03:46:38,626 --> 03:46:41,630
SPEAKER_1:  slightly ashamed that they couldn't have a full recovery system with their spacecraft.

03:46:41,954 --> 03:46:51,230
SPEAKER_1:  They could physically recover it, but they wouldn't have been able to recover the cosmonaut in one piece. So instead they had them just eject out of the thing and parachute to safety. Like...

03:46:51,586 --> 03:46:56,030
SPEAKER_1:  That's insane. And so there definitely was some, some extra risks and

03:46:56,674 --> 03:46:58,014
SPEAKER_1:  but also a freedom to just like.

03:46:58,242 --> 03:47:02,718
SPEAKER_1:  push things to the limits and try everything. I threw all the spaghetti on.

03:47:03,426 --> 03:47:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  It's funny that most people probably don't even know the first person in the space in America and obviously everybody knows that in

03:47:10,722 --> 03:47:11,902
SPEAKER_0:  It's like, um...

03:47:13,250 --> 03:47:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  It's kind of interesting.

03:47:15,458 --> 03:47:16,798
SPEAKER_0:  How the Space Race

03:47:17,474 --> 03:47:19,006
SPEAKER_0:  and even World War II.

03:47:20,066 --> 03:47:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  even like the history books.

03:47:22,242 --> 03:47:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  You ask most Americans.

03:47:24,802 --> 03:47:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  They think.

03:47:26,050 --> 03:47:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  that America won World War II.

03:47:29,314 --> 03:47:33,918
SPEAKER_0:  without America, like the real heroes of World War II.

03:47:34,306 --> 03:47:35,294
SPEAKER_0:  is America-esque.

03:47:35,618 --> 03:47:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  uh... british people

03:47:37,282 --> 03:47:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  They say, and everybody has a pretty good justification. like...without!

03:47:41,698 --> 03:47:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  Britain.

03:47:42,498 --> 03:47:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  without Churchill.

03:47:44,386 --> 03:47:46,526
SPEAKER_0:  Hitler would have taken over the world.

03:47:46,946 --> 03:47:47,422
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

03:47:47,970 --> 03:47:53,150
SPEAKER_0:  Probably the strongest case is the Soviet Union case that they're the ones that won the war.

03:47:53,410 --> 03:48:04,158
SPEAKER_0:  The reason it's the strongest case is where most of the fighting happened. Most of the death happened. Most of like most of the destruction, but everyone has their perspective. And certainly in the space race.

03:48:04,898 --> 03:48:07,550
SPEAKER_0:  you know the great accomplishment is the first man moon

03:48:08,290 --> 03:48:09,415
SPEAKER_0:  consent

03:48:09,415 --> 03:48:10,165
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah

03:48:10,165 --> 03:48:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  And then Yuri Gagarin from the Russian perspective, first man in space. And that I think still persists in some of that.

03:48:18,370 --> 03:48:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  in healthy forms is probably constructive to a little bit of competition pushes all the all the great scientists on each side

03:48:26,018 --> 03:48:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  uh... bring you know what do you think about

03:48:28,962 --> 03:48:32,062
SPEAKER_0:  this Yorga Gagarin mission of the first human in space.

03:48:33,058 --> 03:48:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  and the Vostok mission in 1961. Just in general, when you look back at that time, leading to the...

03:48:39,842 --> 03:48:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  the first man on the moon.

03:48:42,946 --> 03:48:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, April 12th, 1961.

03:48:45,282 --> 03:48:46,494
SPEAKER_1:  Yuri's night baby, that's a-

03:48:47,298 --> 03:48:50,398
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's insane. What's insane to me is...

03:48:50,754 --> 03:48:51,582
SPEAKER_1:  the first.

03:48:52,642 --> 03:48:57,502
SPEAKER_1:  in space didn't just go to space, he went into orbit. Hmm.

03:48:57,922 --> 03:49:00,606
SPEAKER_1:  flew around the Earth in orbit and reentered.

03:49:00,962 --> 03:49:04,030
SPEAKER_1:  That's a monumental task compared to suborbital.

03:49:04,610 --> 03:49:09,502
SPEAKER_1:  So the United States did two suborbital flights in that same year, I believe in that same year at least.

03:49:09,762 --> 03:49:11,934
SPEAKER_1:  I'm pretty sure in 1961 they flew.

03:49:12,258 --> 03:49:19,070
SPEAKER_1:  for the first time orbitally in 1962. So they weren't terribly far behind to get a human into orbit, like in the grand scheme of things, 10 months difference.

03:49:19,778 --> 03:49:24,286
SPEAKER_1:  But at the same time, like the fact that the Soviet Union just went straight to flying someone into orbit is-

03:49:24,546 --> 03:49:25,278
SPEAKER_1:  Monumental.

03:49:25,570 --> 03:49:27,742
SPEAKER_0:  and I'm sure they did not do excessive.

03:49:28,450 --> 03:49:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  rigorous testing here.

03:49:30,690 --> 03:49:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  Because there is a space race and you have the first

03:49:33,794 --> 03:49:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  is important.

03:49:34,818 --> 03:49:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  Just imagine being Yuri.

03:49:38,114 --> 03:49:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  What do you say when they're like launching them like, let's go or something like a.

03:49:42,402 --> 03:49:48,222
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, you're taking, we're talking about you being on Starship. You're taking a pretty big risk.

03:49:48,930 --> 03:49:50,238
SPEAKER_0:  being launched out.

03:49:50,370 --> 03:49:51,710
SPEAKER_1:  into orbit.

03:49:52,098 --> 03:50:03,774
SPEAKER_1:  hopefully a lot less risk than what Yuri went through. So Yuri, the crazy thing, remember those matchsticks we talked about? Yeah. There's 20 main combustion chambers on Soyuz and there's

03:50:04,226 --> 03:50:04,830
SPEAKER_1:  for

03:50:05,634 --> 03:50:08,894
SPEAKER_1:  hit 12 more vernier engines that all need to be lit.

03:50:09,538 --> 03:50:11,710
SPEAKER_1:  So you're sitting on top of this booster.

03:50:12,034 --> 03:50:14,750
SPEAKER_1:  and they light all of those 32 combustion chambers.

03:50:15,042 --> 03:50:15,742
SPEAKER_1:  On the ground.

03:50:16,258 --> 03:50:16,798
SPEAKER_1:  And then.

03:50:17,154 --> 03:50:19,678
SPEAKER_1:  It has this insane separation process between.

03:50:19,938 --> 03:50:24,318
SPEAKER_1:  but the Soviet Union would call it the first stage and the second stages, but we would call it like the core stage and the boosters.

03:50:24,802 --> 03:50:25,950
SPEAKER_1:  They all...

03:50:26,466 --> 03:50:29,406
SPEAKER_1:  Four of these boosters have to peel away perfectly from the core stage.

03:50:29,890 --> 03:50:32,638
SPEAKER_1:  simultaneously. You know, if one of them sticks on.

03:50:32,930 --> 03:50:34,110
SPEAKER_1:  mission failed if one of them

03:50:34,690 --> 03:50:38,846
SPEAKER_1:  doesn't inject properly and drags into the other tank, you know, you're, it's, it's, it's a goner.

03:50:39,458 --> 03:50:41,502
SPEAKER_1:  So the staging process of...

03:50:41,762 --> 03:50:45,822
SPEAKER_1:  of the Soyuz is insane to me that that ended up working out.

03:50:46,850 --> 03:50:47,710
SPEAKER_1:  I-I was just-

03:50:49,058 --> 03:50:54,558
SPEAKER_1:  technology in stories and I mean more or less that same rocket is what's still flying.

03:50:55,010 --> 03:50:55,582
SPEAKER_1:  humans.

03:50:56,674 --> 03:50:59,486
SPEAKER_1:  that are cosmonauts from the universe cosmos.

03:50:59,938 --> 03:51:03,678
SPEAKER_1:  going to the International Space Station, are flying on a variant of that Soyuz rocket still today.

03:51:04,066 --> 03:51:04,894
SPEAKER_1:  It's still.

03:51:05,666 --> 03:51:07,198
SPEAKER_1:  like that big of a workhorse.

03:51:07,874 --> 03:51:11,070
SPEAKER_0:  What do you think about Russ Cosmos as he stands today?

03:51:11,586 --> 03:51:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  its history and its future.

03:51:14,786 --> 03:51:16,830
SPEAKER_0:  in comparison to...

03:51:17,058 --> 03:51:19,038
SPEAKER_0:  NASA and other national efforts.

03:51:19,490 --> 03:51:22,110
SPEAKER_0:  and in comparison to commercial space flight.

03:51:23,074 --> 03:51:31,198
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, utmost respect for the engineers involved and everything that's happened. I think Enurgemosh is like still some of the, one of the greatest engine manufacturers.

03:51:31,650 --> 03:51:35,134
SPEAKER_1:  when they have the funding to do so, but man, it seems like they're, they're.

03:51:35,810 --> 03:51:40,158
SPEAKER_1:  falling from grace as far as space prowess, you know, that Rosh Kosmos went from.

03:51:41,282 --> 03:51:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  I think they got very comfortable at the top of, you know, from 2011 until 2020, they were the only ride to the International Space Station.

03:51:50,946 --> 03:51:54,366
SPEAKER_1:  since then, like it started, I feel like in 2018.

03:51:54,626 --> 03:51:58,590
SPEAKER_1:  Honestly, I think that's kind of when things, that's the first time I specifically remember a.

03:51:58,914 --> 03:52:03,102
SPEAKER_1:  pretty nasty thing happened in 2018. I think it was a Soyuz mission.

03:52:03,618 --> 03:52:06,270
SPEAKER_1:  to the International Space Station had one of the boosters not detached.

03:52:06,690 --> 03:52:07,646
SPEAKER_1:  and had to have an abort.

03:52:08,226 --> 03:52:08,574
SPEAKER_1:  but.

03:52:08,962 --> 03:52:17,854
SPEAKER_1:  You know that that happened then all of a sudden next thing you know, there's a progress being docked to the ISS a couple of years ago that spun the ISS cartwheeled the ISS out of control.

03:52:18,274 --> 03:52:27,102
SPEAKER_1:  followed a few months later the Pirs module, docks to the International Space Station, spirals the International Space Station out of control again with like a thruster getting fixed on.

03:52:27,362 --> 03:52:28,542
SPEAKER_1:  There's a hole in-

03:52:28,802 --> 03:52:30,366
SPEAKER_1:  in Russian.

03:52:30,786 --> 03:52:36,990
SPEAKER_1:  segment. There's, well, I think the most recent one right now, there's a Soyuz dock to the ISS that has a puncture in it.

03:52:37,218 --> 03:52:38,046
SPEAKER_1:  leaking coolant.

03:52:38,562 --> 03:52:40,286
SPEAKER_1:  and will not be returning humans.

03:52:40,578 --> 03:52:43,006
SPEAKER_1:  on it so they're actually having to fly up and uncrewed soyus.

03:52:43,522 --> 03:52:48,350
SPEAKER_1:  And that one likely wasn't a manufacturing error. It probably was like a micrometeorite puncture.

03:52:48,706 --> 03:52:51,134
SPEAKER_1:  rendering spacecraft unusable? We don't know for sure yet.

03:52:51,682 --> 03:52:52,094
SPEAKER_1:  um...

03:52:52,578 --> 03:52:52,926
SPEAKER_1:  but...

03:52:53,186 --> 03:52:55,486
SPEAKER_1:  It's just really been like this fall from grace where...

03:52:56,290 --> 03:53:00,158
SPEAKER_1:  They have all the potential, they have some of the best engines, some of the...

03:53:00,674 --> 03:53:03,518
SPEAKER_1:  the best rockets and especially like right before.

03:53:04,066 --> 03:53:06,238
SPEAKER_1:  The collapse of the Soviet Union, the, the Braun.

03:53:06,658 --> 03:53:08,382
SPEAKER_1:  shuttle and the Energia rocket.

03:53:08,962 --> 03:53:15,262
SPEAKER_1:  were incredible. Had they been able to evolve that into Brontu and the reusable Energia? They had a fully reusable.

03:53:15,618 --> 03:53:17,374
SPEAKER_1:  Energia on the drawing board and like

03:53:18,690 --> 03:53:20,414
SPEAKER_1:  honestly fully think they could have done it.

03:53:20,930 --> 03:53:26,046
SPEAKER_0:  Is it possible to return to a place where there is friendly competition between nations that ultimately benefit us?

03:53:26,466 --> 03:53:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:53:28,098 --> 03:53:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  unites and inspires the peoples of these different worlds, these very different worlds.

03:53:33,602 --> 03:53:39,646
SPEAKER_0:  have especially recently come to conflict over the war in Ukraine. eBay, yes,

03:53:40,162 --> 03:53:40,638
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

03:53:40,930 --> 03:53:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  The war, the conflict, the suffering.

03:53:43,234 --> 03:53:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  is actually creating more and more division, creating more and more hate.

03:53:47,330 --> 03:53:50,238
SPEAKER_0:  I think as we've talked about, I think science and engineering.

03:53:50,466 --> 03:53:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  and especially the most epic version of engineering, which is...

03:53:53,634 --> 03:53:56,382
SPEAKER_0:  Rocketry and space travel unites people.

03:53:57,314 --> 03:53:59,646
SPEAKER_0:  the United States.

03:54:00,002 --> 03:54:01,086
SPEAKER_0:  conflict and war.

03:54:02,018 --> 03:54:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  Do you have a hope that...

03:54:03,906 --> 03:54:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  we can return to that place.

03:54:06,306 --> 03:54:07,550
SPEAKER_1:  I think historically.

03:54:07,810 --> 03:54:08,478
SPEAKER_1:  Space Flight.

03:54:08,898 --> 03:54:10,718
SPEAKER_1:  has been one of the most bonding.

03:54:11,202 --> 03:54:12,222
SPEAKER_1:  things..

03:54:12,578 --> 03:54:14,238
SPEAKER_1:  We have countless examples of.

03:54:14,562 --> 03:54:16,510
SPEAKER_1:  you know, Cold War enemies coming together and...

03:54:16,738 --> 03:54:18,366
SPEAKER_1:  working together, lending a hand.

03:54:19,042 --> 03:54:22,878
SPEAKER_1:  Apollo 13, for example, of course, there is the potential that...

03:54:23,394 --> 03:54:28,062
SPEAKER_1:  Who knew where it was gonna reenter since it was not in the plane trajectory at all for reentry?

03:54:28,418 --> 03:54:30,430
SPEAKER_1:  And the Soviet Union said, hey, wherever...

03:54:31,362 --> 03:54:36,446
SPEAKER_1:  wherever they land, like we'll help you guys out basically. You know, and that was a pretty big thing at the time, obviously.

03:54:36,898 --> 03:54:40,030
SPEAKER_1:  We also in 1975 saw the Apollo Soyuz.

03:54:40,290 --> 03:54:43,262
SPEAKER_1:  mission which was Apollo spacecraft docking with Soyuz.

03:54:43,810 --> 03:54:44,350
SPEAKER_1:  spacecraft.

03:54:44,642 --> 03:54:48,254
SPEAKER_1:  first time there's international collaboration. And again, 1975 still-

03:54:48,930 --> 03:54:50,750
SPEAKER_1:  very admits the Cold War.

03:54:51,458 --> 03:54:53,278
SPEAKER_1:  yet we have this collaboration.

03:54:54,210 --> 03:54:55,806
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know what else could have done that.

03:54:56,034 --> 03:54:59,422
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I mean, and think about what it actually takes to do that. You have to come up with a-

03:54:59,938 --> 03:55:02,558
SPEAKER_1:  a docking module that is, you know, like.

03:55:03,170 --> 03:55:06,590
SPEAKER_1:  takes the two different air environments and the two different docking systems.

03:55:07,010 --> 03:55:11,422
SPEAKER_1:  talk to the engineers and mission planners figure out you know train together

03:55:11,650 --> 03:55:16,030
SPEAKER_1:  Cosmonauts and the astronauts trained together and got to know each other. Crossing boundaries and borders.

03:55:16,482 --> 03:55:21,758
SPEAKER_1:  and coming together for this mission. And even if it was totally a fluff piece, like even if it was totally this like-

03:55:22,402 --> 03:55:22,814
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

03:55:23,170 --> 03:55:23,902
SPEAKER_1:  cynical

03:55:24,130 --> 03:55:24,830
SPEAKER_1:  You know, just...

03:55:25,666 --> 03:55:29,214
SPEAKER_1:  trying to make a pretty face for everybody, for the cameras or something.

03:55:29,794 --> 03:55:31,070
SPEAKER_1:  Obviously it still had an impact.

03:55:31,810 --> 03:55:33,182
SPEAKER_0:  The symbolic impact.

03:55:33,602 --> 03:55:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  But there's also the practical impact. I mean, a lot of people have to work together. Yes. And that has a ripple effect on the culture of the different engineers.

03:55:42,402 --> 03:55:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

03:55:43,618 --> 03:55:47,262
SPEAKER_1:  100%. And even just the astronauts and cosmonauts involved.

03:55:47,746 --> 03:55:54,302
SPEAKER_1:  Think about what probably went through their heads during this process of like going from, oh my God, I'm gonna have to work with them to.

03:55:54,786 --> 03:55:58,686
SPEAKER_1:  getting to know them and then sharing meals in space. Like, that's-

03:55:59,202 --> 03:56:02,014
SPEAKER_1:  a crazy transformation of timelines and.

03:56:02,402 --> 03:56:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  I would love to, I-

03:56:03,682 --> 03:56:07,806
SPEAKER_1:  I do think that space flight has the ability to bond us and unite us because it is

03:56:08,674 --> 03:56:09,630
SPEAKER_1:  Ultimately, you know this little.

03:56:09,986 --> 03:56:12,094
SPEAKER_1:  tiny little planet we're floating around on.

03:56:12,578 --> 03:56:15,134
SPEAKER_1:  You know, it is the boundary that we all share.

03:56:15,394 --> 03:56:16,926
SPEAKER_1:  You know, you only can.

03:56:17,250 --> 03:56:19,902
SPEAKER_1:  It only takes you getting off this planet to realize, Oh my God.

03:56:20,162 --> 03:56:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  We're all neighbors.

03:56:21,410 --> 03:56:23,070
SPEAKER_1:  We're all living in the same house together.

03:56:23,682 --> 03:56:24,222
SPEAKER_1:  and

03:56:25,218 --> 03:56:31,038
SPEAKER_1:  I do think ultimately, you know, as we continue to expand our horizons and expand our exploration that it

03:56:31,490 --> 03:56:33,950
SPEAKER_1:  has the potential to unite us more than.

03:56:34,306 --> 03:56:35,678
SPEAKER_1:  then it has the potential to divide us.

03:56:36,034 --> 03:56:39,646
SPEAKER_0:  So one of the potential conflicts of the 21st century.

03:56:40,290 --> 03:56:40,894
SPEAKER_0:  that

03:56:41,442 --> 03:56:41,982
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

03:56:42,402 --> 03:56:48,766
SPEAKER_0:  Everyone wants to avoid both in the cyberspace and in the hot war space cold war hot war all kinds of war

03:56:48,994 --> 03:56:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  all kinds of economic

03:56:50,882 --> 03:56:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  conflict between the United States and China.

03:56:54,754 --> 03:56:56,254
SPEAKER_0:  So China is...

03:56:57,314 --> 03:57:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  going full steam ahead in developing a space program, doing a lot of incredible work.

03:57:02,786 --> 03:57:05,982
SPEAKER_0:  Like you mentioned, 64 launches in 2022.

03:57:06,562 --> 03:57:07,838
SPEAKER_0:  with two failures.

03:57:09,314 --> 03:57:11,939
SPEAKER_0:  but moving straight ahead.

03:57:11,939 --> 03:57:17,406
SPEAKER_1:  And by the way, we had a lot of startups, like a lot of the launches were from brand new companies.

03:57:17,794 --> 03:57:20,350
SPEAKER_1:  to have two failures out of 64, I mean that's still.

03:57:20,610 --> 03:57:23,038
SPEAKER_1:  If you look at operational launches, it was.

03:57:23,170 --> 03:57:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  Follow us.

03:57:24,802 --> 03:57:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  Do you see a pathway?

03:57:27,202 --> 03:57:30,654
SPEAKER_0:  where there's again in that same way collaboration.

03:57:31,426 --> 03:57:33,598
SPEAKER_0:  or friendly competition between...

03:57:34,210 --> 03:57:38,686
SPEAKER_0:  all the different companies and nations in the united states and china

03:57:39,106 --> 03:57:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  in the next.

03:57:40,514 --> 03:57:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  as we push towards the moon.

03:57:43,394 --> 03:57:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  Mars

03:57:44,674 --> 03:57:45,246
SPEAKER_0:  and beyond.

03:57:45,762 --> 03:57:47,838
SPEAKER_1:  I held a dumb hope that-

03:57:48,130 --> 03:57:50,846
SPEAKER_1:  China would actually be allowed to sign on to the Artemis Accord.

03:57:51,330 --> 03:57:54,878
SPEAKER_1:  to be able to take part in this next step towards the moon.

03:57:55,202 --> 03:57:56,734
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, just imagine if, like, if they...

03:57:57,538 --> 03:58:02,398
SPEAKER_1:  provided a propulsion module or a land or something and we actually came together to land on the Moon.

03:58:02,754 --> 03:58:05,342
SPEAKER_1:  instead of having another space race, you know, it's like.

03:58:05,858 --> 03:58:07,326
SPEAKER_1:  It would have been so cool and.

03:58:08,866 --> 03:58:10,590
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I still am hopeful that.

03:58:11,490 --> 03:58:12,350
SPEAKER_1:  similar to...

03:58:12,578 --> 03:58:13,598
SPEAKER_1:  to back in the...

03:58:13,826 --> 03:58:14,654
SPEAKER_1:  Cold War that

03:58:15,330 --> 03:58:17,662
SPEAKER_1:  We might have something like that someday where we actually are.

03:58:18,114 --> 03:58:21,822
SPEAKER_1:  collaborating and it feels like sometimes we're really close to that and then other times it feels like we're

03:58:22,498 --> 03:58:27,326
SPEAKER_1:  really far from that and it just sucks because I know, and you know, I try really hard on my channel to.

03:58:27,810 --> 03:58:32,126
SPEAKER_1:  to always separate and celebrate the work being done. Because at the end of the day, there's someone.

03:58:32,642 --> 03:58:34,558
SPEAKER_1:  that's just going home to their family.

03:58:34,850 --> 03:58:36,958
SPEAKER_1:  clocking in hours, working really hard on.

03:58:37,378 --> 03:58:38,526
SPEAKER_1:  pushing their program and...

03:58:38,818 --> 03:58:40,574
SPEAKER_1:  and doing engineering work, you know, and it's.

03:58:41,346 --> 03:58:44,350
SPEAKER_1:  We don't get to choose where we're born and what we're born into

03:58:44,802 --> 03:58:46,622
SPEAKER_1:  So I really like to avoid

03:58:47,490 --> 03:58:51,838
SPEAKER_1:  you know, the political aspects of things and the geopolitical aspects and just appreciate the science.

03:58:52,226 --> 03:58:53,982
SPEAKER_1:  and the science we're seeing and the.

03:58:54,690 --> 03:58:59,038
SPEAKER_1:  The progress that China's doing in the last 10 years is very akin to that.

03:58:59,490 --> 03:59:05,470
SPEAKER_1:  early spaceflight programs and with the runway of like just going keep on going. Like I see no reason for them to be slowing down.

03:59:06,242 --> 03:59:08,350
SPEAKER_1:  So it's definitely something to watch and.

03:59:08,834 --> 03:59:10,174
SPEAKER_1:  and be interested in and.

03:59:10,434 --> 03:59:12,862
SPEAKER_1:  Who knows? There really genuinely might be-

03:59:13,282 --> 03:59:16,542
SPEAKER_1:  erased to the moon again, and there really genuinely might be a race to Mars.

03:59:18,498 --> 03:59:19,998
SPEAKER_1:  The part of me is excited.

03:59:20,194 --> 03:59:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  about that cause

03:59:21,506 --> 03:59:22,631
SPEAKER_0:  a racist is.

03:59:22,631 --> 03:59:23,381
SPEAKER_1:  Pretty cool.

03:59:23,381 --> 03:59:24,702
SPEAKER_0:

03:59:25,058 --> 03:59:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  but hopefully it's friendly competition and some collaboration. It is true that maybe I'm being a bit cynical.

03:59:34,562 --> 03:59:35,966
SPEAKER_0:  but nations.

03:59:36,226 --> 03:59:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  sometimes the governments and leaders of those governments sometimes ruin things.

03:59:40,898 --> 03:59:42,206
SPEAKER_0:  Like you don't often have...

03:59:42,818 --> 03:59:46,494
SPEAKER_0:  Statistically speaking, it's harder to have a leader of a nation.

03:59:47,074 --> 03:59:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  that.

03:59:47,874 --> 03:59:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  looks beyond the political, the particular political bickering of that nation.

03:59:53,282 --> 03:59:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  And you have like a JFK type character that really steps up and aspires.

03:59:56,834 --> 04:00:02,686
SPEAKER_0:  I think statistically speaking it's better to have someone like Elon who's the leader of a company, like a commercial effort.

04:00:03,138 --> 04:00:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  that is able to look beyond the borders of nations.

04:00:05,954 --> 04:00:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  and certainly inspiring educators like yourself.

04:00:11,074 --> 04:00:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  to look beyond.

04:00:12,354 --> 04:00:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  the borders.

04:00:13,506 --> 04:00:16,190
SPEAKER_0:  of those nations and the geopolitical conflicts and so on.

04:00:16,546 --> 04:00:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  to inspire the...

04:00:18,562 --> 04:00:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  and to inspire people. I think that's just made so much easier.

04:00:22,946 --> 04:00:24,478
SPEAKER_0:  you can have more reach.

04:00:25,282 --> 04:00:25,950
SPEAKER_0:  Tim.

04:00:26,370 --> 04:00:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  Tim Dodd can have more reach than NASA.

04:00:28,834 --> 04:00:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  Right.

04:00:29,858 --> 04:00:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of inspiring the world and that's fascinating.

04:00:33,954 --> 04:00:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  that gives power to the individuals that see past.

04:00:36,930 --> 04:00:40,638
SPEAKER_0:  the silly short-term geopolitical conflicts.

04:00:41,506 --> 04:00:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  That's the whole police.

04:00:44,610 --> 04:00:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  Do you worry that there might be a war?

04:00:47,266 --> 04:00:47,966
SPEAKER_0:  in space.

04:00:48,738 --> 04:00:51,518
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, let's let's let's look out into the future. So forget

04:00:52,130 --> 04:00:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  So the interesting thing about these rockets, right? Let's not forget.

04:00:56,258 --> 04:00:58,974
SPEAKER_0:  Rockets do what Rockets do.

04:00:59,490 --> 04:01:03,262
SPEAKER_0:  that they can carry payloads that can be weapons.

04:01:04,386 --> 04:01:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

04:01:05,794 --> 04:01:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  Do you worry about this?

04:01:07,906 --> 04:01:09,758
SPEAKER_1:  I worry most about.

04:01:10,466 --> 04:01:14,910
SPEAKER_1:  space wars as leading to the Kessler syndrome of having.

04:01:15,106 --> 04:01:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

04:01:15,714 --> 04:01:18,782
SPEAKER_1:  cascading effect of like a spacecraft blowing up and then

04:01:19,138 --> 04:01:22,078
SPEAKER_1:  infecting another spacecraft and that blows up and then all of a sudden you're trapped.

04:01:22,498 --> 04:01:23,998
SPEAKER_1:  and have this debris cloud that we can't.

04:01:24,770 --> 04:01:31,134
SPEAKER_1:  you know, go, we can't go into space anymore. Like that's my biggest, because frankly, at this point, we could annihilate ourselves with terrestrial.

04:01:31,458 --> 04:01:34,526
SPEAKER_1:  stuff anyway, you know what I mean? We don't need space to

04:01:34,882 --> 04:01:37,982
SPEAKER_1:  To end society as we know it, you know what I mean?

04:01:38,402 --> 04:01:38,878
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

04:01:39,170 --> 04:01:39,614
SPEAKER_1:  But.

04:01:40,162 --> 04:01:40,958
SPEAKER_1:  We do.

04:01:41,250 --> 04:01:45,502
SPEAKER_1:  We could really and the good thing is I think everyone, well, mostly everyone.

04:01:45,890 --> 04:01:47,806
SPEAKER_1:  seems to understand this for the most part that like.

04:01:48,994 --> 04:01:50,494
SPEAKER_1:  really can't be risking.

04:01:50,850 --> 04:01:53,758
SPEAKER_1:  blowing up stuff in space in low Earth orbit because

04:01:54,274 --> 04:01:58,334
SPEAKER_1:  it could easily, like we could strain ourselves from space assets for 50 years.

04:01:59,074 --> 04:02:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, can you elaborate on that? So like, what is the danger of the debris there that could-

04:02:04,290 --> 04:02:05,182
SPEAKER_0:  But jeopardize.

04:02:05,506 --> 04:02:06,631
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, so.

04:02:06,631 --> 04:02:07,134
SPEAKER_1:  So.

04:02:07,458 --> 04:02:11,614
SPEAKER_1:  For instance, and it was only a couple of years ago, Russia did an anti-satellite test on a-

04:02:12,002 --> 04:02:12,830
SPEAKER_1:  on an orbital.

04:02:13,282 --> 04:02:16,190
SPEAKER_1:  There is a, we've done this, the US has done this. Like I'm not.

04:02:16,898 --> 04:02:17,918
SPEAKER_1:  pinning it on them, but.

04:02:18,242 --> 04:02:24,158
SPEAKER_1:  We kind of know nowadays, like, don't do anti-satellite tests on orbital things because those things stay in orbit.

04:02:24,546 --> 04:02:27,070
SPEAKER_1:  You know, when you blow something up in space, it's not like...

04:02:27,778 --> 04:02:33,662
SPEAKER_1:  You know, people think, you know, in space, like, oh, you throw something, it's just gonna keep going forever and ever and ever. It's way good.

04:02:34,050 --> 04:02:43,230
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, that's in the sense that it's not going to be slowed down due to air resistance, it's going to continue to do that, but it's staying in orbit around the earth.

04:02:43,618 --> 04:02:46,750
SPEAKER_1:  You just slightly change the orbit of it around Earth when you throw a ball.

04:02:47,170 --> 04:02:47,870
SPEAKER_1:  or something, you know.

04:02:48,770 --> 04:02:49,150
SPEAKER_1:  So.

04:02:49,858 --> 04:02:52,350
SPEAKER_1:  The scary thing is, when you blow up a satellite...

04:02:53,122 --> 04:02:55,294
SPEAKER_1:  all those pieces of that satellite are now...

04:02:56,770 --> 04:02:58,046
SPEAKER_1:  millions of bullets.

04:02:58,626 --> 04:02:59,902
SPEAKER_1:  in a halo around the Earth.

04:03:00,930 --> 04:03:02,014
SPEAKER_1:  in a very specific.

04:03:02,306 --> 04:03:03,230
SPEAKER_1:  Halo, you know, so.

04:03:03,554 --> 04:03:10,046
SPEAKER_1:  Some things get blown up faster, according to its orbit, so they'll go a little bit higher elliptically.

04:03:10,306 --> 04:03:10,878
SPEAKER_1:  Something's good.

04:03:11,138 --> 04:03:13,278
SPEAKER_1:  slowed down in that explosion and actually re-entered.

04:03:13,506 --> 04:03:17,598
SPEAKER_1:  Some things would go sideways and change its inclination of that orbit. You have this debris field.

04:03:18,050 --> 04:03:19,262
SPEAKER_1:  but it more or less becomes.

04:03:19,874 --> 04:03:21,150
SPEAKER_1:  a band of like...

04:03:21,794 --> 04:03:23,870
SPEAKER_1:  No, no, like a big scary.

04:03:25,026 --> 04:03:26,686
SPEAKER_1:  sharp scary bullets.

04:03:27,074 --> 04:03:28,574
SPEAKER_1:  that can destroy another spacecraft.

04:03:28,930 --> 04:03:33,790
SPEAKER_1:  And so all of a sudden, especially now Starlink, and we're talking about thousands and thousands and thousands of satellites in space,

04:03:34,562 --> 04:03:35,358
SPEAKER_1:  If all of a sudden...

04:03:35,746 --> 04:03:38,142
SPEAKER_1:  one you know a couple of them crash and

04:03:38,754 --> 04:03:46,302
SPEAKER_1:  blow up and obviously have all the shrapnel going everywhere and then that hits another satellite that creates shrapnel. You can literally blanket our entire low Earth orbit.

04:03:47,010 --> 04:03:47,390
SPEAKER_1:  et nul.

04:03:47,650 --> 04:03:49,630
SPEAKER_1:  17,500 mile an hour.

04:03:50,018 --> 04:03:50,526
SPEAKER_1:  bullets.

04:03:52,162 --> 04:03:55,774
SPEAKER_1:  We're talking the kinetic energy in this.

04:03:56,130 --> 04:03:58,174
SPEAKER_1:  is so hard for people to fathom, because that's...

04:03:58,434 --> 04:04:00,062
SPEAKER_1:  Over 10 times faster than most.

04:04:00,322 --> 04:04:02,974
SPEAKER_1:  like rifle bullets, and even like a big 50 cal.

04:04:03,618 --> 04:04:06,974
SPEAKER_1:  is not going to be, you know, we're still talking about about 10%.

04:04:07,906 --> 04:04:09,758
SPEAKER_1:  that so you think about the kinetic energy.

04:04:10,146 --> 04:04:10,942
SPEAKER_1:  It's insane, so.

04:04:11,490 --> 04:04:12,766
SPEAKER_1:  uh, fleck of paint.

04:04:13,186 --> 04:04:14,654
SPEAKER_1:  can go through panes of glass.

04:04:15,522 --> 04:04:16,446
SPEAKER_1:  at that velocity.

04:04:17,090 --> 04:04:19,166
SPEAKER_1:  you know, a little piece of metal can puncture.

04:04:20,002 --> 04:04:20,862
SPEAKER_1:  straight through.

04:04:22,018 --> 04:04:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  So, like...

04:04:23,970 --> 04:04:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  So our actions that seem.

04:04:26,178 --> 04:04:28,926
SPEAKER_0:  small-scale military actions.

04:04:29,826 --> 04:04:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  can have a...

04:04:32,066 --> 04:04:33,630
SPEAKER_0:  can have dire detrimental.

04:04:33,986 --> 04:04:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  effects to the whole space program, like global space program. Oh yeah.

04:04:37,890 --> 04:04:38,558
SPEAKER_1:  It can affect.

04:04:38,882 --> 04:04:39,934
SPEAKER_1:  Everything and everyone.

04:04:40,194 --> 04:04:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  Including the like including satellites. Oh, yeah

04:04:43,458 --> 04:04:45,182
SPEAKER_1:  Especially satellites like that's

04:04:45,858 --> 04:04:48,286
SPEAKER_1:  The good and the bad thing is...

04:04:48,834 --> 04:04:51,006
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of satellites don't operate in low-earth orbit.

04:04:51,298 --> 04:04:54,878
SPEAKER_1:  Like a lot of the ones that we use day to day, a lot of them are.

04:04:55,714 --> 04:04:59,102
SPEAKER_1:  in medium Earth orbit like the GPS or their geostationary.

04:04:59,426 --> 04:05:01,022
SPEAKER_1:  which are way, way, way out there.

04:05:01,538 --> 04:05:03,454
SPEAKER_1:  And because of that, they...

04:05:03,746 --> 04:05:12,830
SPEAKER_1:  won't really ever de-orbit, or like it'll take millennia to de-orbit because just because something's in space doesn't mean it's there forever, especially like in low-earth orbit.

04:05:13,154 --> 04:05:15,646
SPEAKER_1:  The atmosphere doesn't just suddenly stop. It's not like you hit.

04:05:16,002 --> 04:05:22,814
SPEAKER_1:  the Carmen line, 100 kilometers, and all of a sudden there's zero atmosphere. The atmosphere just slowly tapers. You can experience that yourself as you climb a mountain.

04:05:23,106 --> 04:05:25,662
SPEAKER_1:  slowly realize there's less and less air. just keep going.

04:05:26,146 --> 04:05:29,310
SPEAKER_1:  And just because you're in space 200, 300 kilometers up.

04:05:29,602 --> 04:05:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  There's still trace.

04:05:31,010 --> 04:05:32,702
SPEAKER_1:  Molecules, you know, there's the occasional

04:05:33,378 --> 04:05:35,454
SPEAKER_1:  There's the occasional nitrogen molecule.

04:05:35,938 --> 04:05:39,198
SPEAKER_1:  And so that is actually drag. So as a spacecraft in lower orbit.

04:05:39,842 --> 04:05:41,086
SPEAKER_1:  depending on its altitude, will...

04:05:41,410 --> 04:05:42,366
SPEAKER_1:  Take anywhere from.

04:05:43,138 --> 04:05:43,870
SPEAKER_1:  Five years to-

04:05:44,482 --> 04:05:46,238
SPEAKER_1:  months to de orbit you know or

04:05:46,530 --> 04:05:49,630
SPEAKER_1:  months or one month, depending on its orbit or its altitude.

04:05:49,954 --> 04:05:52,702
SPEAKER_1:  we'll have some parasitic drag still and slowly.

04:05:53,058 --> 04:05:55,646
SPEAKER_1:  throughout time slowdown, which lowers its orbit, which...

04:05:56,194 --> 04:05:59,678
SPEAKER_1:  drags it down more, lowers its orbit, and etc. etc. until it re-enters.

04:06:00,290 --> 04:06:00,702
SPEAKER_1:  So.

04:06:00,994 --> 04:06:02,046
SPEAKER_1:  If we end up with.

04:06:02,722 --> 04:06:08,670
SPEAKER_1:  some kind of catastrophic event where the entire low-earth orbit has been inundated and blown up.

04:06:09,154 --> 04:06:12,350
SPEAKER_1:  It'll take months for the first band to clear up.

04:06:12,834 --> 04:06:17,310
SPEAKER_1:  It'll take years for something like, there's charts, people have all this stuff available.

04:06:17,730 --> 04:06:18,855
SPEAKER_1:  you shouldn't look at us there

04:06:18,855 --> 04:06:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  terrifying by the way.

04:06:20,706 --> 04:06:22,206
SPEAKER_0:  But this is really... THE<|sk|><|translate|>ёт

04:06:22,530 --> 04:06:24,350
SPEAKER_1:  But again, the caveat is...

04:06:24,706 --> 04:06:26,910
SPEAKER_1:  For the most part, the low Earth orbit stuff would clear up.

04:06:27,266 --> 04:06:28,222
SPEAKER_1:  within years.

04:06:28,706 --> 04:06:32,862
SPEAKER_1:  so we could get back to doing some more with it. Starlink stuff would probably be able to be re-

04:06:33,250 --> 04:06:34,014
SPEAKER_1:  And you know, we could.

04:06:34,242 --> 04:06:36,894
SPEAKER_1:  kind of redo it and build up from the ground up again.

04:06:37,250 --> 04:06:42,110
SPEAKER_1:  GPS wouldn't be wiped out and our geostationary satellites wouldn't be wiped out. The scary thing is we wouldn't be able to relaunch.

04:06:42,626 --> 04:06:44,478
SPEAKER_1:  and replace new things because we're stuck.

04:06:45,090 --> 04:06:47,102
SPEAKER_1:  We're not going to fly through that debris field, you know?

04:06:48,962 --> 04:06:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  And we avoid that by avoiding military actions in space.

04:06:52,674 --> 04:06:55,070
SPEAKER_1:  And these days, there's more and more.

04:06:55,330 --> 04:06:55,838
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

04:06:56,226 --> 04:07:02,718
SPEAKER_1:  requirements and legislation and especially trying to get international collaboration on having end of life plans for satellites.

04:07:03,138 --> 04:07:05,374
SPEAKER_1:  that satellites, especially those in low Earth orbit.

04:07:05,634 --> 04:07:10,238
SPEAKER_1:  have like drag devices to increase them. Once they're done, they literally pull like, even just a ribbon, like a-

04:07:10,882 --> 04:07:12,094
SPEAKER_1:  silly little like, you know.

04:07:12,418 --> 04:07:16,254
SPEAKER_1:  40 foot long ribbon, we'll sit there and it'll slowly, or it can.

04:07:16,994 --> 04:07:19,870
SPEAKER_1:  speed up its reentry process by months or years or whatever.

04:07:20,610 --> 04:07:26,078
SPEAKER_1:  So we're starting to see that this is now an importance. There's a really cool company called Stoke Aerospace out in.

04:07:26,530 --> 04:07:32,478
SPEAKER_1:  Washington is one of these launch providers that's really looking not into just trying to be the next SpaceX launch company.

04:07:32,738 --> 04:07:34,270
SPEAKER_1:  They're really seeing satellite.

04:07:34,594 --> 04:07:36,606
SPEAKER_1:  Bringing stuff down from space.

04:07:37,154 --> 04:07:40,318
SPEAKER_1:  is actually being, especially right now, we have all of these.

04:07:40,738 --> 04:07:43,166
SPEAKER_1:  hundreds and thousands of satellites being launched every year.

04:07:43,586 --> 04:07:45,790
SPEAKER_1:  someone at some point is probably gonna have to do some cleanup.

04:07:47,074 --> 04:07:49,566
SPEAKER_1:  And so they're looking at being one of those companies to do that.

04:07:50,114 --> 04:07:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  uh... what do you think of a starling

04:07:52,642 --> 04:07:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  and the efforts of Starlink.

04:07:54,594 --> 04:07:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  to put a very large number of...

04:07:57,378 --> 04:07:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  satellites.

04:07:59,682 --> 04:08:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  out there and provide internet access to.

04:08:04,354 --> 04:08:05,022
SPEAKER_0:  to anyone.

04:08:05,442 --> 04:08:05,886
SPEAKER_0:  а, ни anyways.

04:08:06,306 --> 04:08:08,382
SPEAKER_1:  Generally, I think Starlink is.

04:08:08,674 --> 04:08:09,086
SPEAKER_1:  Phenomenal.

04:08:09,634 --> 04:08:16,759
SPEAKER_1:  And I would be saying this if it was any company I wanna make that clear that people think I'm just some, you know, SpaceX fan boy or something and anything they do is perfect.

04:08:16,759 --> 04:08:20,062
SPEAKER_0:  I think as your fan, I could say you're basically a fan.

04:08:20,290 --> 04:08:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  a fanboy or just a fan of.

04:08:22,850 --> 04:08:34,558
SPEAKER_0:  everybody that's doing space stuff. And even in this whole conversation, there's no way we cover like 10% of what I wanted to talk to you about, so we're jumping around. I mean, there's, we could talk probably for another.

04:08:34,818 --> 04:08:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  an hour about Artemis.

04:08:36,578 --> 04:08:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, we could talk about anything with ULA, obviously the all the other.

04:08:41,826 --> 04:08:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  all the other commercial efforts. We could talk about the NASA efforts that, you know, the.

04:08:46,722 --> 04:08:55,550
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, and sat in five, like, are we gonna really go with this conversation? I thought most of it, and we might, okay? So like, anyway, you're a fan of everything.

04:08:55,938 --> 04:08:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  Starling.

04:08:57,442 --> 04:08:59,317
SPEAKER_0:  is in general exciting.

04:08:59,317 --> 04:09:06,558
SPEAKER_1:  to you and not for the space assets, but just the potential for humanity. I really think even as a consumer of the internet.

04:09:06,850 --> 04:09:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  personally, our studio space down in Texas.

04:09:09,602 --> 04:09:10,334
SPEAKER_1:  We're stuck with

04:09:10,594 --> 04:09:11,454
SPEAKER_1:  with MediaCom.

04:09:11,810 --> 04:09:12,382
SPEAKER_1:  which has like

04:09:12,610 --> 04:09:14,366
SPEAKER_1:  the least reliable internet service.

04:09:14,914 --> 04:09:18,334
SPEAKER_1:  Period, that's the only option. Either that or they're trying to charge me like $20,000.

04:09:18,690 --> 04:09:19,646
SPEAKER_1:  to run a fiber optic.

04:09:20,034 --> 04:09:21,822
SPEAKER_1:  cable like a thousand meters or something like it's.

04:09:22,082 --> 04:09:22,910
SPEAKER_1:  It's insane.

04:09:23,362 --> 04:09:24,286
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not going to do that.

04:09:24,802 --> 04:09:25,726
SPEAKER_1:  I bought Starlink.

04:09:26,786 --> 04:09:27,358
SPEAKER_1:  helps.

04:09:27,586 --> 04:09:31,998
SPEAKER_1:  but it's still not amazing, but you can see where this is going in a year, two, three, five years.

04:09:32,322 --> 04:09:35,870
SPEAKER_1:  They're like, oh, I can totally screw this other internet provider and this is now.

04:09:36,130 --> 04:09:37,310
SPEAKER_1:  By far the best option.

04:09:37,858 --> 04:09:40,574
SPEAKER_1:  and it's available literally anywhere. You don't have to be.

04:09:41,122 --> 04:09:43,518
SPEAKER_1:  limited to your local internet service provider.

04:09:44,034 --> 04:09:47,582
SPEAKER_1:  And on the global scale, of course you have, you know, people.

04:09:48,066 --> 04:09:51,134
SPEAKER_1:  be able to learn and learn about rockets, learn about.

04:09:51,362 --> 04:09:54,366
SPEAKER_1:  water management and architecture and...

04:09:54,658 --> 04:09:57,278
SPEAKER_1:  city planning and fitness and health.

04:09:57,762 --> 04:10:02,494
SPEAKER_1:  all of the modern conveniences that we Google every single day, there's people that don't have access to that.

04:10:03,458 --> 04:10:05,758
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I'm a self-taught rocket nerd.

04:10:06,306 --> 04:10:11,230
SPEAKER_1:  I would not be who I am if it wasn't for the internet in the last seven years, you know? I would have been my own friend if I haven't for nine seven years.

04:10:11,362 --> 04:10:18,174
SPEAKER_0:  So unlocking the intellectual potential of places like Africa, of rural areas that don't currently have internet access.

04:10:18,882 --> 04:10:19,294
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

04:10:19,778 --> 04:10:21,822
SPEAKER_1:  That's a genuine, that's a huge...

04:10:22,626 --> 04:10:23,134
SPEAKER_1:  That's like.

04:10:23,682 --> 04:10:28,542
SPEAKER_1:  Humanitarian 101 is give people access to information.

04:10:28,802 --> 04:10:30,430
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I think we have this.

04:10:30,754 --> 04:10:34,878
SPEAKER_1:  potential to try to step in and fix other people's problems. The reality is people are smart.

04:10:35,106 --> 04:10:38,878
SPEAKER_1:  No matter where you are, you give them the resources to learn, they're going to solve problems.

04:10:39,202 --> 04:10:41,310
SPEAKER_1:  They're gonna problem solve, they're gonna engineer, they're going to.

04:10:42,050 --> 04:10:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  If you don't give them access to that information, they're going to be stuck in there.

04:10:45,922 --> 04:10:47,166
SPEAKER_1:  And there are cycles, you know, and.

04:10:47,522 --> 04:10:53,438
SPEAKER_1:  So I think the potential for Starlink is incredible. I think it's already impactful. It's already affecting.

04:10:54,466 --> 04:10:59,038
SPEAKER_1:  people in rural and indigenous areas, and it's already affecting.

04:10:59,426 --> 04:11:01,502
SPEAKER_1:  businesses and all that stuff, I think it's great.

04:11:02,082 --> 04:11:02,686
SPEAKER_1:  I think it.

04:11:03,490 --> 04:11:03,966
SPEAKER_1:  is.

04:11:04,770 --> 04:11:06,974
SPEAKER_1:  You know, there's some downsides with astronomy.

04:11:07,394 --> 04:11:10,206
SPEAKER_1:  with ground-based astronomy that it can hinder.

04:11:10,690 --> 04:11:12,222
SPEAKER_1:  observations from the ground.

04:11:12,770 --> 04:11:16,798
SPEAKER_1:  There's already a lot of communications between SpaceX and

04:11:17,506 --> 04:11:19,262
SPEAKER_1:  astronomical societies and

04:11:19,682 --> 04:11:24,606
SPEAKER_1:  things like that because it is a real concern. It can ruin observations, it can ruin data.

04:11:24,994 --> 04:11:27,966
SPEAKER_1:  But like one of the big ones, for instance, recently, I think a new

04:11:28,354 --> 04:11:33,054
SPEAKER_1:  they're going to be working into is that currently if a Starlink is flying over

04:11:33,570 --> 04:11:33,918
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

04:11:34,338 --> 04:11:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  over a ground-based asset.

04:11:36,322 --> 04:11:38,782
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of ground telescopes actually have a laser.

04:11:39,842 --> 04:11:43,902
SPEAKER_1:  goes up and it measures the atmospheric distortion. And the telescopes literally sit there and-

04:11:44,770 --> 04:11:46,782
SPEAKER_1:  by the millisecond fixes.

04:11:47,106 --> 04:11:48,638
SPEAKER_1:  like changes the focus and

04:11:48,898 --> 04:11:51,102
SPEAKER_1:  fixes those atmospheric distortions.

04:11:51,586 --> 04:11:54,430
SPEAKER_1:  and that laser can interfere with satellites.

04:11:54,690 --> 04:11:58,046
SPEAKER_1:  So previously, I'm pretty sure that SpaceX actually had to.

04:11:58,402 --> 04:11:59,326
SPEAKER_1:  You know, request that.

04:11:59,810 --> 04:12:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  As they're flying over these satellites, there are these telescopes that turn off the laser.

04:12:04,258 --> 04:12:04,702
SPEAKER_1:  and

04:12:05,058 --> 04:12:05,662
SPEAKER_1:  when you have...

04:12:06,786 --> 04:12:13,694
SPEAKER_1:  tens of thousands of these things flying, you're going to be turning off the laser more than it's on, you know, and just being this insanely inconvenient thing.

04:12:14,178 --> 04:12:16,158
SPEAKER_1:  because you're gonna have these junctions happen often.

04:12:16,610 --> 04:12:21,438
SPEAKER_1:  And I think one of the things that SpaceX is like, okay, no, no, no, you guys keep the laser on, we'll deal with your laser.

04:12:21,922 --> 04:12:22,270
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

04:12:22,722 --> 04:12:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  Good, good stuff, you know, things like that, mitigating the brightness of them so they're not visible.

04:12:27,618 --> 04:12:31,550
SPEAKER_1:  Under most conditions, of course, like there's still always going to be visible in some.

04:12:32,098 --> 04:12:32,478
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

04:12:32,834 --> 04:12:35,774
SPEAKER_1:  But then ultimately for me, it's like this, you have this weird-

04:12:36,322 --> 04:12:39,358
SPEAKER_1:  like almost like a puberty of space flight and.

04:12:39,586 --> 04:12:40,510
SPEAKER_1:  and astronomy.

04:12:40,898 --> 04:12:43,646
SPEAKER_1:  where currently it's not cheap enough to really do a ton of.

04:12:43,906 --> 04:12:47,966
SPEAKER_1:  incredible science or space based telescopes. We have web, we have.

04:12:48,322 --> 04:12:50,622
SPEAKER_1:  Hubble, we have all these other.

04:12:51,490 --> 04:12:52,382
SPEAKER_1:  you know, awesome.

04:12:52,962 --> 04:12:55,134
SPEAKER_1:  Space-based telescopes, Chandra, you know.

04:12:55,938 --> 04:12:57,502
SPEAKER_1:  Etc, etc, whatever.

04:12:58,562 --> 04:12:59,166
SPEAKER_1:  You are.

04:12:59,842 --> 04:13:01,790
SPEAKER_1:  but it's still so expensive to launch them.

04:13:02,434 --> 04:13:05,726
SPEAKER_1:  that were still so reliant on our ground telescopes. But in the future...

04:13:06,146 --> 04:13:07,198
SPEAKER_1:  You can see a world where...

04:13:07,650 --> 04:13:08,446
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, this is so-

04:13:08,674 --> 04:13:10,878
SPEAKER_1:  We'll just launch like we can launch 50

04:13:11,170 --> 04:13:14,046
SPEAKER_1:  James Webb Space Telescope size telescopes this year for

04:13:14,530 --> 04:13:17,598
SPEAKER_1:  half the price of doing it on Earth, you know, and get way better data.

04:13:17,986 --> 04:13:22,558
SPEAKER_1:  So in the future, I think in 20, 30 years, we'll look at it and be like, Oh man, that was an awkward time where.

04:13:22,978 --> 04:13:25,630
SPEAKER_1:  space assets were interfering with astronomy.

04:13:26,178 --> 04:13:30,590
SPEAKER_1:  But I think in the future, it's like, can you imagine doing space astronomy from the ground?

04:13:31,362 --> 04:13:32,487
SPEAKER_1:  That's insane, you know.

04:13:32,487 --> 04:13:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  There could be complexities to just having that many, just another topic. So complexities associated with having so many satellites.

04:13:40,514 --> 04:13:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  especially with competing companies and competing nations.

04:13:43,874 --> 04:13:47,582
SPEAKER_0:  Do you see that as an issue having tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of satellites?

04:13:47,842 --> 04:13:51,006
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. It becomes a very interesting robotics.

04:13:51,330 --> 04:13:52,478
SPEAKER_0:  collision avoidance problem.

04:13:52,770 --> 04:13:54,206
SPEAKER_1:  The one thing to keep in mind...

04:13:54,434 --> 04:13:58,526
SPEAKER_1:  is perspective, like I know 10,000 satellites and 20,000 and 100,000 satellites.

04:13:59,010 --> 04:14:01,118
SPEAKER_1:  Sounds insane and it sounds really scary.

04:14:02,530 --> 04:14:05,214
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, just even look at how many planes are in the air at any given time.

04:14:06,434 --> 04:14:12,126
SPEAKER_1:  Planes are bigger, they're flying slower, which actually means there's a greater chance of collision. If you think about two objects...

04:14:13,122 --> 04:14:16,222
SPEAKER_1:  occupying space if they're ones moving really fast like imagine trying to

04:14:17,058 --> 04:14:19,166
SPEAKER_1:  throw two basketballs at each other relatively easy.

04:14:19,458 --> 04:14:21,054
SPEAKER_1:  Now try shooting two bullets at each other.

04:14:21,570 --> 04:14:23,742
SPEAKER_1:  and having like, you know, at 90 degrees from each other.

04:14:24,194 --> 04:14:25,758
SPEAKER_1:  You have to have your timing down like.

04:14:26,146 --> 04:14:27,678
SPEAKER_1:  Really perfect to do that.

04:14:28,194 --> 04:14:31,326
SPEAKER_1:  Now take that times 10, you know, and these objects are taking up.

04:14:31,874 --> 04:14:32,926
SPEAKER_1:  physical space.

04:14:33,154 --> 04:14:36,862
SPEAKER_1:  very small amount of time. They're relatively small, like most satellites are not very big.

04:14:37,090 --> 04:14:40,542
SPEAKER_1:  and they have limitless altitudes to deal with. So-

04:14:40,930 --> 04:14:49,598
SPEAKER_1:  even though you can have what look like convergences, they can be 10, 20, 50, 100 kilometers difference often. And they're dealing with this, all the...

04:14:49,826 --> 04:14:51,390
SPEAKER_1:  All space assets know.

04:14:51,778 --> 04:14:57,758
SPEAKER_1:  Hey, I'm at this orbital plane and this blah blah blah blah, and they know their altitudes and know their safe distances and have these margins built in.

04:14:58,274 --> 04:15:01,630
SPEAKER_1:  and it's space, so there's like an insane amount of room.

04:15:01,890 --> 04:15:04,670
SPEAKER_1:  So there's a lot of margin. There's a lot of margin.

04:15:04,994 --> 04:15:06,174
SPEAKER_1:  But of course you can't.

04:15:06,434 --> 04:15:08,638
SPEAKER_1:  excuse that all the way, like you have to still.

04:15:08,994 --> 04:15:10,174
SPEAKER_1:  have plans and.

04:15:10,658 --> 04:15:13,406
SPEAKER_1:  be considering that and considering collisions and considering.

04:15:13,762 --> 04:15:14,526
SPEAKER_1:  all of the above.

04:15:18,050 --> 04:15:20,414
SPEAKER_0:  When do you think the first human being will step foot on?

04:15:22,850 --> 04:15:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  You don't like timelines?

04:15:24,802 --> 04:15:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  But is this something, and you're very much focused on...

04:15:28,642 --> 04:15:29,886
SPEAKER_0:  kind of the short term.

04:15:30,690 --> 04:15:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  of incredible progress that's happening, and that makes total sense.

04:15:34,978 --> 04:15:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  But there is the Mars plan.

04:15:36,706 --> 04:15:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  that.

04:15:37,410 --> 04:15:38,302
SPEAKER_0:  Was it the?

04:15:38,562 --> 04:15:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  origin of the commercial spaceflight efforts.

04:15:41,538 --> 04:15:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  Um, do you still see and dream about that day?

04:15:45,730 --> 04:15:49,438
SPEAKER_1:  Let me be clear that I don't want to go to Mars. But I do think-

04:15:49,826 --> 04:15:54,814
SPEAKER_1:  If you're making me guess a timeline for when humans will walk on Mars.

04:15:55,554 --> 04:15:59,390
SPEAKER_1:  I even a year ago, I still would have said by the end of 2020, like.

04:15:59,618 --> 04:16:00,926
SPEAKER_1:  2020th decade, you know?

04:16:01,410 --> 04:16:02,814
SPEAKER_1:  Um, so by December.

04:16:03,138 --> 04:16:04,734
SPEAKER_1:  31st, 2029.

04:16:05,250 --> 04:16:07,326
SPEAKER_1:  Thought humans would have walked on Mars. I'm starting to think.

04:16:08,994 --> 04:16:10,686
SPEAKER_1:  That's still too optimistic.

04:16:10,978 --> 04:16:11,902
SPEAKER_1:  But I do, I...

04:16:12,514 --> 04:16:14,206
SPEAKER_1:  Definitely think by 2040.

04:16:14,562 --> 04:16:16,478
SPEAKER_1:  I for sure think that. I really think.

04:16:17,538 --> 04:16:25,223
SPEAKER_1:  It's just hard to predict that curve, you know, that project out that curve. We're gonna go from feeling like it's impossible to like it's feeling like it's inevitable. You know, it's.

04:16:25,223 --> 04:16:30,590
SPEAKER_0:  It could be another by the end of this decade JFK type moment, especially if China steps up with the space race.

04:16:30,882 --> 04:16:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  It could be like, all right.

04:16:33,730 --> 04:16:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  NASA, NASA kind of says, all right, this Elon fella.

04:16:37,730 --> 04:16:39,605
SPEAKER_0:  Like really make this a gigantic

04:16:39,605 --> 04:16:40,318
SPEAKER_1:  effort.

04:16:40,546 --> 04:16:47,774
SPEAKER_1:  Well, and if Starship works out as planned and as NASA has invested in human landing system, they're relying on SpaceX to land on the moon.

04:16:48,162 --> 04:16:49,822
SPEAKER_1:  SpaceX can land on the moon, they can land on-

04:16:51,234 --> 04:16:57,598
SPEAKER_1:  Now whether or not the life support and the human considerations of long-term spaceflight missions and high radiation and

04:16:57,922 --> 04:17:01,022
SPEAKER_1:  Blah blah blah blah, refueling on Mars is a huge huge huge deal.

04:17:01,890 --> 04:17:03,710
SPEAKER_1:  they definitely could send a starship to Mars.

04:17:04,194 --> 04:17:07,390
SPEAKER_1:  and land, ideally land in one piece on Mars.

04:17:09,474 --> 04:17:14,462
SPEAKER_1:  as soon as they can land on the moon they can land on mars basically i mean those two things are very in some ways mars is

04:17:14,754 --> 04:17:15,550
SPEAKER_1:  Almost easier.

04:17:16,194 --> 04:17:20,286
SPEAKER_1:  If you can use because you can use the atmosphere to slow down it actually doesn't take that much more

04:17:20,834 --> 04:17:25,022
SPEAKER_1:  Delta V to actually land on Mars than it does. Because on the moon you don't have any...

04:17:25,538 --> 04:17:29,918
SPEAKER_1:  First get out to the moon, then orbit the moon. You know, you have to slow down. Every one of those is a maneuver change.

04:17:30,370 --> 04:17:30,782
SPEAKER_1:  Then you have to.

04:17:31,202 --> 04:17:32,510
SPEAKER_1:  Lower your orbit until it-

04:17:33,026 --> 04:17:33,886
SPEAKER_1:  coincides you know.

04:17:34,562 --> 04:17:35,678
SPEAKER_1:  hits the moon.

04:17:35,938 --> 04:17:37,374
SPEAKER_1:  And then if it's slowed down enough to not.

04:17:37,858 --> 04:17:39,134
SPEAKER_1:  when he hit the moon.

04:17:39,394 --> 04:17:41,726
SPEAKER_1:  So there's a lot of delta V there, a lot of change in velocity.

04:17:42,210 --> 04:17:46,622
SPEAKER_1:  Mars is actually, by the time we kind of crunch the numbers, it's relatively similar.

04:17:47,010 --> 04:17:49,214
SPEAKER_1:  just a lot more difficult like timeline wise and.

04:17:49,666 --> 04:17:54,526
SPEAKER_1:  You know, accuracy and all of these other communication. You know, there's a lot of other things obviously involved.

04:17:54,978 --> 04:17:56,734
SPEAKER_1:  I'm glossing over it making it sound easy.

04:17:57,090 --> 04:17:57,438
SPEAKER_1:  It's not.

04:17:58,018 --> 04:17:58,974
SPEAKER_1:  But.

04:17:59,970 --> 04:18:04,638
SPEAKER_1:  But you know, I think there's a real decent chance we could see a starship vehicle land on Mars.

04:18:04,994 --> 04:18:06,119
SPEAKER_1:  uncrewed by the end of the day.

04:18:06,119 --> 04:18:06,686
SPEAKER_0:  decade though.

04:18:06,914 --> 04:18:07,710
SPEAKER_0:  End of the decade.

04:18:08,162 --> 04:18:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, there's also a sociological element, maybe a political one where...

04:18:13,218 --> 04:18:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  I think you're allowed to take more risks with Mars than you are with the...

04:18:17,122 --> 04:18:18,110
SPEAKER_0:  Cause we've done the moon.

04:18:18,370 --> 04:18:20,862
SPEAKER_0:  1969. Yeah, it's been a while.

04:18:21,762 --> 04:18:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  PR wise.

04:18:23,042 --> 04:18:30,558
SPEAKER_0:  you have to be much safer. With Mars, everyone's like, it's super dangerous. So you could take a little more...

04:18:31,202 --> 04:18:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  risk hundred special without with man mission the

04:18:36,450 --> 04:18:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  Go back.

04:18:37,730 --> 04:18:39,614
SPEAKER_0:  to the moon landing Apollo 11 mission.

04:18:40,226 --> 04:18:41,278
SPEAKER_0:  I haven't talked about this.

04:18:42,146 --> 04:18:48,414
SPEAKER_0:  What's the amazing engine there? But again, the romantic question and you look back at that moon landing.

04:18:49,090 --> 04:18:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

04:18:50,850 --> 04:18:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  One small step for man, one giant step for mankind.

04:18:54,338 --> 04:18:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  What do you think about that moment?

04:18:56,386 --> 04:18:57,342
SPEAKER_0:  in human history.

04:18:57,922 --> 04:19:02,797
SPEAKER_0:  Do you go back to that often? Or are you focused just like with the cars and the engines?

04:19:02,797 --> 04:19:04,126
SPEAKER_1:  No, no, no.

04:19:04,578 --> 04:19:11,390
SPEAKER_1:  I still, when I need inspiration, I rewatch this documentary called When We Left Earth. I think it was like a, I think it was Discovery Channel did it.

04:19:11,810 --> 04:19:13,182
SPEAKER_1:  Six part episode.

04:19:13,282 --> 04:19:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  it.

04:19:13,730 --> 04:19:14,494
SPEAKER_1:  It was.

04:19:15,042 --> 04:19:16,350
SPEAKER_1:  narrated by Gary Sinise.

04:19:16,962 --> 04:19:19,614
SPEAKER_1:  phenomenal overview of the space race.

04:19:20,098 --> 04:19:22,974
SPEAKER_1:  and that will get my juices flowing every time.

04:19:23,266 --> 04:19:24,094
SPEAKER_1:  Every time, just.

04:19:24,482 --> 04:19:28,574
SPEAKER_1:  It's so well done and it really just summarizes that program so well.

04:19:29,058 --> 04:19:32,190
SPEAKER_1:  And when I and beyond it goes all the way to the space shuttle. But.

04:19:32,674 --> 04:19:33,150
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

04:19:33,698 --> 04:19:37,950
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, when I, when I watch footage of humans walking on the moon, it's just.

04:19:38,402 --> 04:19:38,910
SPEAKER_1:  I...

04:19:40,034 --> 04:19:43,038
SPEAKER_1:  I can't believe we're dumb enough to do it with the technology we had.

04:19:43,394 --> 04:19:44,126
SPEAKER_1:  and the risks.

04:19:44,482 --> 04:19:45,886
SPEAKER_1:  they took to do it and.

04:19:46,594 --> 04:19:46,910
SPEAKER_1:  The-

04:19:47,170 --> 04:19:49,406
SPEAKER_1:  Insane engineering that it took to do that.

04:19:50,050 --> 04:19:50,590
SPEAKER_1:  is just.

04:19:51,170 --> 04:19:52,382
SPEAKER_1:  Absolutely astonishing.

04:19:53,186 --> 04:19:54,046
SPEAKER_1:  The amount of-

04:19:54,306 --> 04:19:55,070
SPEAKER_1:  This year like

04:19:55,586 --> 04:19:56,702
SPEAKER_1:  Logistics of what it.

04:19:57,154 --> 04:19:58,142
SPEAKER_1:  took to do it with it.

04:19:58,498 --> 04:19:59,678
SPEAKER_1:  technology we had back then.

04:20:00,290 --> 04:20:00,830
SPEAKER_1:  It's like.

04:20:01,154 --> 04:20:09,054
SPEAKER_1:  oh, did we have so much money and effort and energy and time and resources, human resources to do this? like it's just

04:20:09,954 --> 04:20:12,414
SPEAKER_0:  Just the weakness of the computers they had back then.

04:20:12,962 --> 04:20:15,134
SPEAKER_0:  You have to do so much. I mean, yeah, it's.

04:20:15,778 --> 04:20:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  So much was so little.

04:20:17,314 --> 04:20:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  That's insane.

04:20:18,242 --> 04:20:18,686
SPEAKER_1:  and

04:20:19,298 --> 04:20:20,318
SPEAKER_1:  But at the same time, like...

04:20:21,090 --> 04:20:23,454
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if we want to talk about conspiracy theories or anything, but like...

04:20:23,810 --> 04:20:26,270
SPEAKER_1:  It is all of, we have the proof in the pudding of like.

04:20:26,786 --> 04:20:27,358
SPEAKER_1:  The...

04:20:27,682 --> 04:20:29,598
SPEAKER_1:  400,000 people on payroll.

04:20:30,082 --> 04:20:31,957
SPEAKER_1:  all of the paperwork, all of the...

04:20:31,957 --> 04:20:35,707
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, you mean the question the conspiracy if we land on the moon? Yeah.

04:20:35,707 --> 04:20:38,707
SPEAKER_1:  Like, I mean, I think the receipts are there, like literally.

04:20:38,707 --> 04:20:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  We did.

04:20:39,522 --> 04:20:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  But it's like a lot of.

04:20:41,346 --> 04:20:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  things like that.

04:20:43,362 --> 04:20:49,950
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, we actually generally live in a pretty cynical time where people distrust institutions. Part of the thing was the space program.

04:20:50,594 --> 04:20:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  is one of the things that can help.

04:20:52,770 --> 04:20:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  reinvigorate the trust in institutions by institutions.

04:20:56,834 --> 04:20:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  Even that word is a bad word now.

04:20:59,202 --> 04:21:01,822
SPEAKER_0:  But institutions means a bunch of humans get together.

04:21:02,050 --> 04:21:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  and do a big thing together.

04:21:04,162 --> 04:21:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

04:21:04,962 --> 04:21:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

04:21:06,114 --> 04:21:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, but-

04:21:07,202 --> 04:21:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  You know like

04:21:08,674 --> 04:21:11,582
SPEAKER_0:  If I was conspiratorially minded, it's like.

04:21:12,322 --> 04:21:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  out.

04:21:12,898 --> 04:21:14,334
SPEAKER_0:  How did humans do that?

04:21:15,810 --> 04:21:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  So I think that's a very cynical take, unfortunately, but it's still an incredible one.

04:21:21,506 --> 04:21:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  And also, you know, there's, there's a.

04:21:24,802 --> 04:21:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  until you look at the receipts.

04:21:26,690 --> 04:21:27,582
SPEAKER_0:  There's a kind of...

04:21:28,738 --> 04:21:29,118
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

04:21:31,490 --> 04:21:34,270
SPEAKER_0:  a rationale to that kind of conspiracy theory because

04:21:34,754 --> 04:21:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  So much pressure was put on the space race that the PR of it to be the winner so it makes sense that you might want to

04:21:43,170 --> 04:21:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  try to take shortcuts and fake things and propaganda.

04:21:47,906 --> 04:21:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  you know, different kinds of messaging. And I'm sure stuff like that was happening. Some kind of like.

04:21:52,930 --> 04:21:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  Little

04:21:53,986 --> 04:21:59,870
SPEAKER_0:  You know adjustment here and there to present things better and so on, but ultimately the actual engineering project.

04:22:00,258 --> 04:22:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  of landing on the moon.

04:22:01,954 --> 04:22:03,518
SPEAKER_0:  The fact that humans did that.

04:22:03,842 --> 04:22:07,070
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it is sad that we didn't have better, like...

04:22:07,426 --> 04:22:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  Waste to record it.

04:22:08,898 --> 04:22:12,446
SPEAKER_0:  And as I watch like SpaceX efforts and Blue Origin and these efforts.

04:22:13,282 --> 04:22:16,190
SPEAKER_0:  is still not trivial to record the uh...

04:22:17,538 --> 04:22:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  how just amazing, awe-inspiring space is. Is it like,

04:22:22,754 --> 04:22:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it's like Elon jokes about it, like his base does look fake. Yeah. Like I think there is some element of it where you have to be there to experience it really. And I don't.

04:22:33,282 --> 04:22:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  Like I think it's currently is still.

04:22:36,930 --> 04:22:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  An unsolved problem of how do you capture all of that?

04:22:39,810 --> 04:22:43,070
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, you're one of the early people that are.

04:22:43,714 --> 04:22:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  Part of the crew that is exploring that very question. I'm sure you won't find all the answers, but you'll start to say like how

04:22:51,106 --> 04:22:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  Do we convert this into a visual format, some kind of format that captures the magic of it?

04:22:56,674 --> 04:23:01,086
SPEAKER_1:  And that's a perspective thing that I think about all the time.

04:23:01,506 --> 04:23:10,974
SPEAKER_1:  I'll do a lot of thinking about like, what is the thing that's reacting to people? Is it the sound? Is it the perspective? Is it like seeing a little tiny human next to a landing leg that makes people go?

04:23:11,362 --> 04:23:13,086
SPEAKER_1:  Oh my God, this thing is huge.

04:23:13,602 --> 04:23:15,998
SPEAKER_1:  reading, you know, and digesting that and trying to...

04:23:16,322 --> 04:23:16,638
SPEAKER_1:  Hope.

04:23:17,538 --> 04:23:20,574
SPEAKER_1:  to convey that as best as possible because the stuff that.

04:23:20,802 --> 04:23:22,526
SPEAKER_1:  we are and have worked on is.

04:23:23,106 --> 04:23:25,822
SPEAKER_1:  is so cool. It's so exciting.

04:23:26,402 --> 04:23:29,374
SPEAKER_1:  And it's so important and like actually, you know.

04:23:30,178 --> 04:23:31,902
SPEAKER_1:  so much bigger than any one of us.

04:23:32,418 --> 04:23:34,302
SPEAKER_1:  Physically and metaphorically.

04:23:34,594 --> 04:23:38,974
SPEAKER_1:  It's just so, it's just, I wish everyone had that experience and had that light bulb go off.

04:23:39,106 --> 04:23:40,862
SPEAKER_0:  And that's the cool thing that you're like...

04:23:41,122 --> 04:23:42,302
SPEAKER_0:  smack in the middle of

04:23:42,850 --> 04:23:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  solving that really difficult.

04:23:44,578 --> 04:23:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  in Fascinating Problem.

04:23:46,338 --> 04:23:46,814
SPEAKER_0:  Have a good one.

04:23:47,458 --> 04:23:48,510
SPEAKER_0:  How do you capture the magic?

04:23:48,770 --> 04:23:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  How do you inspire?

04:23:50,306 --> 04:23:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  That's not just an engineer problem. That's an communication problem

04:23:54,690 --> 04:23:56,062
SPEAKER_1:  Education. Be of a new

04:23:56,450 --> 04:23:59,934
SPEAKER_1:  specifically for myself, that I get most excited about something when I learn a lot.

04:24:00,418 --> 04:24:03,902
SPEAKER_1:  when I learn the ins and the outs and I learn all the little problem solving in the

04:24:04,322 --> 04:24:08,958
SPEAKER_1:  You know, the cool, like, oh my God, they had to do what to make it work? Wow. That's amazing.

04:24:09,570 --> 04:24:11,326
SPEAKER_1:  And that's, I try to just always.

04:24:11,778 --> 04:24:17,918
SPEAKER_1:  go back to that root thing of like, what can I teach myself? Like if I'm every video, I expect that I learned something.

04:24:18,146 --> 04:24:20,158
SPEAKER_1:  making it no matter what, like no matter how.

04:24:20,802 --> 04:24:25,598
SPEAKER_1:  Much I think I know about something at the end of the day if I'm not learning something. It's not a good video, you know

04:24:26,146 --> 04:24:26,686
SPEAKER_1:  and

04:24:27,426 --> 04:24:29,278
SPEAKER_1:  I always think that people get excited when they learn.

04:24:29,762 --> 04:24:30,526
SPEAKER_1:  and when they have.

04:24:30,786 --> 04:24:32,318
SPEAKER_1:  some questions answered for them.

04:24:34,562 --> 04:24:38,750
SPEAKER_0:  Let me ask you a couple of quick out there futuristic questions I have to.

04:24:39,042 --> 04:24:41,182
SPEAKER_0:  I'd hate myself if I don't ask you.

04:24:41,410 --> 04:24:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  So first let's talk about nuclear propulsion. So out there, interesting propulsion ideas. So what do you think?

04:24:48,578 --> 04:24:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  Beyond.

04:24:49,634 --> 04:24:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  the chemical engines that we talked about.

04:24:52,642 --> 04:24:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  What do you think about using nuclear?

04:24:55,298 --> 04:24:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  Fish in and maybe.

04:24:58,146 --> 04:25:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  for uh... for propulsion

04:25:00,642 --> 04:25:01,790
SPEAKER_1:  We already have.

04:25:02,210 --> 04:25:05,310
SPEAKER_1:  thermal nuclear reactors, they're nuclear engines that...

04:25:05,538 --> 04:25:08,382
SPEAKER_1:  have been tested both by the United States and Soviet Union that were

04:25:08,802 --> 04:25:09,886
SPEAKER_1:  100% valid.

04:25:10,178 --> 04:25:11,550
SPEAKER_1:  like totally ready to go.

04:25:12,002 --> 04:25:14,366
SPEAKER_1:  Efficient, super awesome.

04:25:14,786 --> 04:25:16,478
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, yes, yes, hardcore yes.

04:25:16,930 --> 04:25:20,798
SPEAKER_1:  And what they're using is basically a fusion reactor.

04:25:21,314 --> 04:25:22,974
SPEAKER_1:  You're flowing hydrogen through it.

04:25:23,202 --> 04:25:25,822
SPEAKER_1:  and heating up the hydrogen, taking it from liquid to gas.

04:25:26,306 --> 04:25:26,814
SPEAKER_1:  You know, and.

04:25:27,138 --> 04:25:29,662
SPEAKER_1:  by heating it up, you're adding energy to the propellant.

04:25:30,146 --> 04:25:33,086
SPEAKER_1:  And then you're literally just using that now steam hot.

04:25:33,314 --> 04:25:33,886
SPEAKER_1:  Hydrogen.

04:25:34,178 --> 04:25:35,742
SPEAKER_1:  and flung it through a D-Lavelle nozzle.

04:25:36,290 --> 04:25:39,358
SPEAKER_1:  And you also have to use that energy to spin the pumps to still...

04:25:39,938 --> 04:25:44,862
SPEAKER_1:  pump the things you're still kind of using like a lot of the tricks you're using but instead of a chemical reaction

04:25:45,090 --> 04:25:46,462
SPEAKER_1:  You're literally just using.

04:25:47,394 --> 04:25:48,382
SPEAKER_1:  nuclear fission.

04:25:48,994 --> 04:25:49,630
SPEAKER_1:  to heat up.

04:25:49,986 --> 04:25:50,302
SPEAKER_1:  propellant.

04:25:51,010 --> 04:25:55,294
SPEAKER_1:  and do the same thing. And at the end of the day, you end up with like eight to 900 seconds of specific impulse, which is.

04:25:55,714 --> 04:25:57,246
SPEAKER_1:  double that of chemical propulsion.

04:25:57,698 --> 04:26:01,886
SPEAKER_1:  Most of that comes just because hydrogen is so light. You're only emitting, you're only ejecting.

04:26:02,274 --> 04:26:03,294
SPEAKER_1:  hydrogen out of the nozzle.

04:26:03,906 --> 04:26:05,086
SPEAKER_1:  The lighter molecule is.

04:26:05,410 --> 04:26:07,966
SPEAKER_1:  the faster it, you know, just like if you had a.

04:26:09,506 --> 04:26:11,614
SPEAKER_1:  you know, it's a golf ball versus like a.

04:26:11,874 --> 04:26:17,214
SPEAKER_1:  bowling ball. You can only physically throw one so fast and the other one as a human you're not going to do very well with.

04:26:17,794 --> 04:26:18,974
SPEAKER_1:  So you can just, you get.

04:26:19,202 --> 04:26:20,894
SPEAKER_1:  you have the more potential for a higher.

04:26:21,634 --> 04:26:22,718
SPEAKER_1:  exit velocity.

04:26:23,362 --> 04:26:30,366
SPEAKER_1:  Nuclear thermal, amazing. You can just shoot these little hydrogen molecules out crazy fast, crazy efficiently. We already have it.

04:26:30,786 --> 04:26:31,358
SPEAKER_1:  We can do it.

04:26:31,650 --> 04:26:33,758
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, yes, yes. And actually we're already re.

04:26:34,018 --> 04:26:36,158
SPEAKER_1:  investing in that again as the United States is.

04:26:36,610 --> 04:26:37,854
SPEAKER_1:  is looking at a.

04:26:38,306 --> 04:26:40,318
SPEAKER_1:  basically ramping back up our nuclear propulsion.

04:26:40,642 --> 04:26:42,494
SPEAKER_0:  Why haven't we done it yet?

04:26:42,850 --> 04:26:49,918
SPEAKER_0:  And what do you think the challenges that there? And do you think that's an obvious future? Like would you see in 50 years or not using?

04:26:50,498 --> 04:26:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  um...

04:26:52,610 --> 04:26:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  Like we're not, for major projects, like a Starship type of project, we're not using chemical propulsion anymore.

04:26:58,210 --> 04:27:08,126
SPEAKER_1:  For getting off earth, you'll always want to use chemical propulsion because the gas will come irradiated. Like you told me, you don't want to, and actually the thrust to weight ratio of these engines are relatively poor.

04:27:08,642 --> 04:27:11,326
SPEAKER_1:  They're very heavy. They have a nuclear reactor. Like they're not.

04:27:11,842 --> 04:27:12,574
SPEAKER_1:  They're really.

04:27:12,898 --> 04:27:16,862
SPEAKER_1:  The reason we kind of give up on them is they're really most useful for interplanetary.

04:27:17,346 --> 04:27:19,294
SPEAKER_1:  If you're trying to get a big, like if you're trying to send.

04:27:19,810 --> 04:27:22,814
SPEAKER_1:  A huge payload off to Mars, nuclear thermal is amazing.

04:27:23,618 --> 04:27:24,062
SPEAKER_1:  It's.

04:27:24,354 --> 04:27:30,270
SPEAKER_1:  still could be beneficial even going to the moon, you know, like in an earth moon system, you could use nuclear thermal.

04:27:30,690 --> 04:27:33,054
SPEAKER_1:  very effectively and it could be a great choice.

04:27:33,570 --> 04:27:39,198
SPEAKER_1:  But it also, that starts to get into that trade of like, eh, we can just kind of use a little bit bigger rocket and.

04:27:39,938 --> 04:27:43,294
SPEAKER_1:  and fly a normal, you know, it's that whole trade thing, but.

04:27:43,874 --> 04:27:46,366
SPEAKER_1:  Another reason why we kind of stopped using them.

04:27:46,626 --> 04:27:49,502
SPEAKER_1:  The one that the United States developed, Nerva, was so heavy.

04:27:49,922 --> 04:27:55,390
SPEAKER_1:  only a Saturn V could actually lift the stage of it, like the upper stage, so replace the S4B.

04:27:55,810 --> 04:27:57,950
SPEAKER_1:  with a nuclear thermal with the Nerva engine.

04:27:58,274 --> 04:28:01,918
SPEAKER_1:  The Soviet Union developed one about one-tenth the size and thrust.

04:28:02,146 --> 04:28:04,574
SPEAKER_1:  that was small enough to fly on a proton rocket.

04:28:05,122 --> 04:28:07,006
SPEAKER_1:  Um, but neither of them ever flew.

04:28:07,330 --> 04:28:08,766
SPEAKER_1:  Both of them have been tested and-

04:28:09,602 --> 04:28:10,654
SPEAKER_1:  thumbs up, ready to go.

04:28:11,170 --> 04:28:11,710
SPEAKER_1:  Was it just?

04:28:12,162 --> 04:28:15,294
SPEAKER_1:  a huge shame to me because they could unlock a lot of

04:28:15,842 --> 04:28:17,534
SPEAKER_1:  interplanetary potential and

04:28:18,082 --> 04:28:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  just all around us. Which potentially interstellar as well.

04:28:21,858 --> 04:28:23,582
SPEAKER_1:  Not quite, I don't think nuclear thermal.

04:28:23,842 --> 04:28:28,702
SPEAKER_1:  not, we're not quite getting there, but then you get into like nuclear pulse drives and things where you're literally like

04:28:29,442 --> 04:28:31,806
SPEAKER_1:  basically ejecting a bomb out the back of your

04:28:32,034 --> 04:28:37,022
SPEAKER_1:  rocket and exploding and having like a shock absorber and Pogo sticking your way out of the solar system.

04:28:38,082 --> 04:28:38,622
SPEAKER_1:  That

04:28:39,426 --> 04:28:39,934
SPEAKER_1:  That's.

04:28:40,354 --> 04:28:45,214
SPEAKER_1:  I mean by all physics sure, you know, there's not nothing wrong with that. It's not breaking any laws of physics and-

04:28:46,114 --> 04:28:51,070
SPEAKER_1:  You know, but I just don't see us getting to that need anytime soon. I don't think we're gonna be. Speed of travel.

04:28:51,426 --> 04:28:55,294
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean, that's that's I think we're going to want a better understanding of.

04:28:55,554 --> 04:28:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  physics and.

04:28:56,386 --> 04:29:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  physics itself, yeah, do you have a hope that maybe theoretical physics will open the door to some exciting propulsion systems?

04:29:04,770 --> 04:29:07,486
SPEAKER_1:  I do. We're still at the very infancy of our-

04:29:07,746 --> 04:29:10,014
SPEAKER_1:  understanding of everything and how things work.

04:29:10,626 --> 04:29:11,006
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

04:29:11,234 --> 04:29:14,590
SPEAKER_1:  A hundred years ago, it would be stupid to try to predict the things we know today and

04:29:15,138 --> 04:29:17,982
SPEAKER_1:  Who knows? Even things like James Webb.

04:29:18,562 --> 04:29:25,182
SPEAKER_1:  looking deeper into our solar system than ever before and physically being able to see objects that we just have not even been able to physically see before.

04:29:25,890 --> 04:29:28,414
SPEAKER_0:  on being able to study black holes for example.

04:29:28,994 --> 04:29:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  better better the stuff that's happening outside of black holes

04:29:32,194 --> 04:29:35,134
SPEAKER_0:  at the edges of black holes and how the information is stored.

04:29:35,586 --> 04:29:36,830
SPEAKER_0:  other

04:29:37,090 --> 04:29:37,630
SPEAKER_0:  100%

04:29:37,986 --> 04:29:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  Holographic principles is there's so much weirdness around black holes. Yes around where

04:29:44,258 --> 04:29:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  Gravity starts bending light.

04:29:48,098 --> 04:29:49,278
SPEAKER_0:  It's like, all right.

04:29:49,506 --> 04:29:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  We get to look at that now and start to wonder like what is going on?

04:29:54,434 --> 04:29:55,102
SPEAKER_0:  and hug.

04:29:55,426 --> 04:29:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  How can we like use that somehow?

04:29:57,890 --> 04:30:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  For propulsion, I mean, it seems like awfully crazy and futuristic at this moment, but I think that's because we know almost nothing about.

04:30:06,274 --> 04:30:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

04:30:07,106 --> 04:30:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  You know, that those kinds of objects were.

04:30:09,794 --> 04:30:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  Again, where the general relativity and quantum mechanics start to...

04:30:14,946 --> 04:30:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  statue.

04:30:15,938 --> 04:30:16,510
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

04:30:16,834 --> 04:30:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  have to be both considered to describe those kinds of objects. And as we study those objects, we might figure out some kind of unification thing that will allow us to.

04:30:24,866 --> 04:30:27,838
SPEAKER_0:  understand maybe how to use black holes to

04:30:28,482 --> 04:30:33,983
SPEAKER_0:  for propulsion, like, I could say a lot of crazy things, but like basically...

04:30:33,983 --> 04:30:36,094
SPEAKER_1:  But the point is it'd be stupid for us to even...

04:30:36,834 --> 04:30:39,614
SPEAKER_1:  guess about things we don't even know about yet. You know what I mean? Like and...

04:30:40,226 --> 04:30:44,286
SPEAKER_1:  So therefore I'm not going to say that the best option for interstellar travel is.

04:30:44,962 --> 04:30:50,846
SPEAKER_1:  nuclear drives like that could be like someone saying, you know, in 1600, the only way to fly is

04:30:51,202 --> 04:30:53,470
SPEAKER_1:  by strapping a thousand birds to your head, you know, like.

04:30:54,338 --> 04:30:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  But that said...

04:30:55,938 --> 04:30:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  I mean.

04:30:56,802 --> 04:30:59,422
SPEAKER_0:  Everything he's saying is right, but human history...

04:30:59,682 --> 04:31:01,886
SPEAKER_0:  is such that the beginning of the twentieth century.

04:31:02,178 --> 04:31:07,262
SPEAKER_0:  Physicists rutherford they everybody this this brilliant people that said we've basically solved all

04:31:07,938 --> 04:31:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  If you talk to most physicists, I think they're going to say like,

04:31:11,938 --> 04:31:12,990
SPEAKER_0:  pretty much.

04:31:13,698 --> 04:31:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  solved.

04:31:15,106 --> 04:31:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  The standard model describes physics extremely accurately.

04:31:19,010 --> 04:31:20,734
SPEAKER_0:  uh, general relativity.

04:31:21,154 --> 04:31:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  explains the cosmos as we observe them.

04:31:23,522 --> 04:31:24,990
SPEAKER_0:  extremely accurately.

04:31:25,218 --> 04:31:32,094
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, there's a whole dark matter, dark energy thing. Whatever. But outside of that, so like we basically solved like.

04:31:32,898 --> 04:31:33,438
SPEAKER_0:  Dude...

04:31:33,762 --> 04:31:36,094
SPEAKER_0:  Like where are you going to find?

04:31:36,674 --> 04:31:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  gaps in knowledge that are going to somehow create.

04:31:39,522 --> 04:31:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  Warp drives or something like that. Warp drives or something like that.

04:31:42,402 --> 04:31:42,846
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

04:31:43,394 --> 04:31:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  But that's...

04:31:45,346 --> 04:31:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  It seems like throughout history, we prove ourselves wrong time and time again. Yes.

04:31:49,602 --> 04:31:56,446
SPEAKER_1:  No, and this is well outside of any of my knowledge base, so I wanna make sure that if I say anything stupid, it's because I'm-

04:31:57,186 --> 04:32:00,561
SPEAKER_1:  I just did a peasant here in physics land, but yes.

04:32:00,561 --> 04:32:00,958
SPEAKER_0:

04:32:01,218 --> 04:32:03,093
SPEAKER_0:  We're all peasants in physics land.

04:32:03,093 --> 04:32:04,766
SPEAKER_1:  But I really just think like...

04:32:05,122 --> 04:32:07,582
SPEAKER_1:  It's very humbling that we're still using chemical.

04:32:07,874 --> 04:32:12,318
SPEAKER_1:  propulsion and variance of like injecting mass to propel ourselves.

04:32:12,802 --> 04:32:15,582
SPEAKER_1:  no matter how you get at it. And I think someday.

04:32:15,810 --> 04:32:19,486
SPEAKER_1:  I would expect that our species has figured out a way to...

04:32:19,970 --> 04:32:20,478
SPEAKER_1:  Get beyond that.

04:32:21,666 --> 04:32:24,222
SPEAKER_0:  Gotta ask you another wild question.

04:32:25,570 --> 04:32:27,390
SPEAKER_0:  What do you think of Bob Lazar?

04:32:28,642 --> 04:32:34,654
SPEAKER_0:  who claimed that he worked at and saw in Area 51 the propulsion system.

04:32:35,170 --> 04:32:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  fueled by

04:32:36,930 --> 04:32:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  I'm quoting here, maybe from Wikipedia. I don't know where I got this from.

04:32:40,322 --> 04:32:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  fueled by an anti-matter reactor which used as fuel the chemical element with atomic number 115.

04:32:48,258 --> 04:32:53,214
SPEAKER_0:  At the time it wasn't synthesized, it was later in 2003 synthesized.

04:32:53,698 --> 04:32:55,230
SPEAKER_0:  named Muscoviem.

04:32:56,770 --> 04:33:01,022
SPEAKER_0:  He said that the propulsion system relied on a stable isotope of element 115.

04:33:01,378 --> 04:33:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  which allegedly generates a gravity wave that allowed the vehicle to fly and to evade visual detection by bending light around it.

04:33:08,834 --> 04:33:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  No stabilizer dose.

04:33:10,946 --> 04:33:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  of muscovium have yet been synthesized.

04:33:13,442 --> 04:33:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  all have proven extremely radioactive, decaying in a few.

04:33:16,994 --> 04:33:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  100 milliseconds.

04:33:19,746 --> 04:33:21,950
SPEAKER_0:  One, do you believe him?

04:33:22,242 --> 04:33:28,414
SPEAKER_0:  I find him fascinating because I find the human mind even more fascinating.

04:33:29,154 --> 04:33:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  Then, um...

04:33:31,362 --> 04:33:31,806
SPEAKER_0:  then.

04:33:32,098 --> 04:33:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  Then something like an anti-matter drive because I think it's such a giant mystery that we haven't even begun to explore deeply anyway In that sense whether he's lying or not are both interesting things to explore from a psychology perspective

04:33:47,170 --> 04:33:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  but

04:33:47,842 --> 04:33:48,734
SPEAKER_0:  To

04:33:49,538 --> 04:33:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, he's basically saying that I guess it's an alien.

04:33:53,538 --> 04:33:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

04:33:54,658 --> 04:33:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  extraterrestrial.

04:33:56,258 --> 04:33:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  engine.

04:33:56,994 --> 04:33:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  thing.

04:33:58,370 --> 04:33:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

04:33:59,938 --> 04:34:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  What do you think?

04:34:01,026 --> 04:34:01,534
SPEAKER_1:  I mean...

04:34:01,762 --> 04:34:05,278
SPEAKER_1:  I'm happy to change my opinion based on new evidence at any point.

04:34:06,306 --> 04:34:07,070
SPEAKER_1:  I have like.

04:34:08,514 --> 04:34:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  The biggest part of me wants to just be like, this is obviously just stupid and a hoax and just total.

04:34:14,050 --> 04:34:14,526
SPEAKER_1:  Quack.

04:34:15,714 --> 04:34:16,254
SPEAKER_1:  And then...

04:34:16,514 --> 04:34:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  Another part of me still is like, this is exciting and fun to think that this is all real.

04:34:21,346 --> 04:34:22,878
SPEAKER_1:  And then another part of me goes, why?

04:34:23,618 --> 04:34:27,262
SPEAKER_1:  How good is this guy at lying and making stuff up? Because it's ALL!

04:34:28,098 --> 04:34:28,766
SPEAKER_1:  Really good.

04:34:29,058 --> 04:34:30,718
SPEAKER_1:  Like good storytelling, good like...

04:34:31,138 --> 04:34:33,150
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know what to think honestly. I don't know.

04:34:33,442 --> 04:34:40,702
SPEAKER_1:  I'm really very skeptical about anyone explaining anything like this. I mean, my radar is like screaming at me like.

04:34:41,122 --> 04:34:41,982
SPEAKER_1:  This is all app.

04:34:42,530 --> 04:34:43,646
SPEAKER_1:  full crap, you know.

04:34:44,482 --> 04:34:46,718
SPEAKER_1:  But I'd say like there's still a part of me that's just like...

04:34:47,138 --> 04:34:49,763
SPEAKER_0:  Man, that is kinda cool. How did he know that?

04:34:49,763 --> 04:34:52,763
SPEAKER_1:  like, you know what I mean? I'm conflicted.

04:34:52,763 --> 04:34:55,966
SPEAKER_0:  I think you're actually in the best kind of place because it's

04:34:57,090 --> 04:35:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  I'm afraid of being the kind of person that hears something like that.

04:35:00,514 --> 04:35:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  and says it's definitely.

04:35:02,594 --> 04:35:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

04:35:03,522 --> 04:35:06,814
SPEAKER_0:  He's definitely full of crap and basically closed my mind off to all that stuff.

04:35:07,298 --> 04:35:11,262
SPEAKER_0:  I'm afraid of being somebody who closes my mind off to a thing that's actually

04:35:11,778 --> 04:35:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  a early thread to a brilliant.

04:35:15,586 --> 04:35:17,854
SPEAKER_0:  to a future, to a fascinating.

04:35:18,370 --> 04:35:20,094
SPEAKER_0:  solution to a mystery so

04:35:20,674 --> 04:35:25,246
SPEAKER_0:  But in this case, I mean, I have so many red flags from a psychological perspective

04:35:25,602 --> 04:35:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  that um...

04:35:27,618 --> 04:35:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  that, but again.

04:35:29,698 --> 04:35:31,646
SPEAKER_0:  outside of this particular individual.

04:35:31,906 --> 04:35:33,950
SPEAKER_0:  I do wonder if aliens have visited us.

04:35:35,458 --> 04:35:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  I think aliens are everywhere.

04:35:37,250 --> 04:35:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

04:35:38,274 --> 04:35:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  The universe is teeming with

04:35:39,906 --> 04:35:40,638
SPEAKER_0:  Alien Life.

04:35:41,058 --> 04:35:41,726
SPEAKER_0:  I mean there's...

04:35:43,458 --> 04:35:46,014
SPEAKER_0:  It's very difficult for me to statistically understand.

04:35:46,594 --> 04:35:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  given.

04:35:48,226 --> 04:35:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  How?

04:35:50,050 --> 04:35:53,310
SPEAKER_0:  life finds a way here on Earth just everywhere.

04:35:53,666 --> 04:35:55,486
SPEAKER_0:  is the entire history of life on earth.

04:35:55,778 --> 04:35:57,694
SPEAKER_0:  from the very origin of life.

04:35:58,018 --> 04:36:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  It seems to be damn good at doing its thing, evolving.

04:36:02,242 --> 04:36:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  to get better and better and better at doing its thing.

04:36:04,610 --> 04:36:08,190
SPEAKER_0:  Now there could be some special aspects to the origin of life itself.

04:36:08,418 --> 04:36:09,982
SPEAKER_0:  which is completely not understood.

04:36:10,274 --> 04:36:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  So maybe the true magic is in the origin of life.

04:36:13,826 --> 04:36:16,446
SPEAKER_0:  Or it could be that there's some magical leaps.

04:36:16,834 --> 04:36:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  to eukaryotic cells for example.

04:36:19,810 --> 04:36:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  that.

04:36:20,898 --> 04:36:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  the universe, our galaxies, teeming with alien life, but it's all bacteria.

04:36:24,770 --> 04:36:25,822
SPEAKER_0:  They're all boring bacteria.

04:36:26,562 --> 04:36:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  exciting bacteria no offense to bacteria

04:36:28,930 --> 04:36:32,350
SPEAKER_0:  the but the no intelligence spacefaring civilizations.

04:36:32,834 --> 04:36:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know.

04:36:34,562 --> 04:36:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  I just, if I were to guess, I'd have to bet all my money.

04:36:37,858 --> 04:36:40,190
SPEAKER_0:  There is space-faring civilizations.

04:36:40,962 --> 04:36:42,238
SPEAKER_0:  everywhere in the universe.

04:36:42,978 --> 04:36:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  and the fact that they're

04:36:44,258 --> 04:36:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  not that they have not been

04:36:46,754 --> 04:36:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  directly definitively observed.

04:36:50,178 --> 04:36:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  confuses me.

04:36:51,746 --> 04:36:57,182
SPEAKER_0:  And I think it's a mystery. And if I were to suggest what the solution to that mystery is.

04:36:57,474 --> 04:37:00,030
SPEAKER_0:  is they might look extremely different from us.

04:37:00,770 --> 04:37:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  then we might be too dumb to detect them.

04:37:04,162 --> 04:37:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  and then

04:37:04,866 --> 04:37:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  And so there, I think you have to be extremely open-minded.

04:37:09,122 --> 04:37:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  What would we be looking?

04:37:13,218 --> 04:37:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  And that's a very practical thing to be open-minded about.

04:37:16,610 --> 04:37:16,926
SPEAKER_0:  and

04:37:17,666 --> 04:37:18,814
SPEAKER_0:  Practically speaking...

04:37:19,394 --> 04:37:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  if we were to be able to even detect them from a distance.

04:37:23,330 --> 04:37:25,182
SPEAKER_0:  get a tech uh... technical signature

04:37:25,474 --> 04:37:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  of a distant planet.

04:37:26,946 --> 04:37:28,414
SPEAKER_0:  of a distant star system.

04:37:28,834 --> 04:37:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  that has alien life.

04:37:31,394 --> 04:37:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  Honest seat.

04:37:32,514 --> 04:37:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  Number one thing I kinda wanna know.

04:37:34,722 --> 04:37:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  It's like.

04:37:36,002 --> 04:37:39,189
SPEAKER_0:  What's your propulsion system?

04:37:39,189 --> 04:37:39,939
SPEAKER_1:

04:37:39,939 --> 04:37:42,939
SPEAKER_0:  travel faster right like there's a bunch of details probably but

04:37:42,939 --> 04:37:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  first let's get together

04:37:45,378 --> 04:37:49,950
SPEAKER_1:  and teach me how to go fast. Go fast. I like motorcycles, I like rockets. Exactly.

04:37:50,114 --> 04:37:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, like how like I'll show you mine if you show me yours kind of thing at the at the inter interstellar intergalactic level

04:37:58,178 --> 04:38:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  Um, yeah, anyway, I just wonder.

04:38:01,346 --> 04:38:04,318
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe it's a cheat code in this video game we call life.

04:38:04,866 --> 04:38:09,406
SPEAKER_0:  But I wanna use the cheat code to figure out what kind of propulsion systems are possible.

04:38:09,794 --> 04:38:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  and it feels like other alien civilizations.

04:38:12,546 --> 04:38:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  might help us.

04:38:14,178 --> 04:38:14,814
SPEAKER_0:  Give us.

04:38:15,778 --> 04:38:16,222
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

04:38:18,050 --> 04:38:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  Give us a guidance on that. Of course, I think even just-

04:38:22,754 --> 04:38:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  Discovering.

04:38:24,802 --> 04:38:28,286
SPEAKER_0:  Boy, one of the things with the space program, like everything we're doing with Mars...

04:38:29,218 --> 04:38:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  Like

04:38:29,762 --> 04:38:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  The secret thing I'm really excited about, the romantic thing is humans are more.

04:38:33,378 --> 04:38:34,398
SPEAKER_0:  the secret thing.

04:38:34,818 --> 04:38:39,550
SPEAKER_0:  is building giant stations on Mars that allow us to definitively.

04:38:40,706 --> 04:38:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  hopefully fine.

04:38:42,626 --> 04:38:43,422
SPEAKER_0:  Traces.

04:38:43,874 --> 04:38:44,798
SPEAKER_0:  Life.

04:38:45,346 --> 04:38:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  Either currently doesn't live

04:38:47,586 --> 04:38:52,725
SPEAKER_0:  or has once lived on Mars, because if that's the case, that means for sure life is ever-

04:38:52,725 --> 04:38:53,694
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, 100%.

04:38:53,954 --> 04:38:55,079
SPEAKER_1:  And then you're like.

04:38:55,079 --> 04:38:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  And once you know that, sorry to keep interrupting, I'm not shedding a hell of a-

04:38:58,722 --> 04:39:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  This is supposed to be an interview, god damn it. Alright, that-

04:39:02,210 --> 04:39:02,558
SPEAKER_0:  Alright.

04:39:03,842 --> 04:39:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  That just the knowledge of that just the knowledge that a form minute mile can be run

04:39:08,898 --> 04:39:11,326
SPEAKER_0:  I think we'll open our minds completely.

04:39:11,586 --> 04:39:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  to really, really hardcore push.

04:39:14,306 --> 04:39:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  to interstellar travel or colonizing Mars, becoming a multi-planetary species, it'd be truly inspiring.

04:39:20,930 --> 04:39:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  You think that.

04:39:22,754 --> 04:39:23,166
SPEAKER_0:  You

04:39:23,362 --> 04:39:28,062
SPEAKER_1:  Do you get nervous though? I'm the interviewer now.

04:39:28,322 --> 04:39:30,174
SPEAKER_1:  Don't you get nervous that we could make.

04:39:30,402 --> 04:39:32,222
SPEAKER_1:  spectacular discovery on Mars that.

04:39:32,610 --> 04:39:35,582
SPEAKER_1:  Not only has there been life, there's actually like pretty advanced-

04:39:35,970 --> 04:39:37,310
SPEAKER_1:  micro you know or

04:39:37,634 --> 04:39:38,846
SPEAKER_1:  A multicellular life.

04:39:39,458 --> 04:39:43,902
SPEAKER_1:  totally thriving in certain regions, we just hadn't visited them yet on Mars, and we make this big discovery.

04:39:45,730 --> 04:39:48,094
SPEAKER_1:  relatively large percentage of people.

04:39:48,354 --> 04:39:49,278
SPEAKER_1:  simply wouldn't believe it.

04:39:49,922 --> 04:39:52,190
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think it's all 100% fake?

04:39:52,962 --> 04:39:54,718
SPEAKER_1:  and that they're just doing this to control us.

04:39:55,138 --> 04:39:56,158
SPEAKER_1:  and that blah blah blah, like.

04:39:56,514 --> 04:39:58,750
SPEAKER_1:  We could make the most important discovery.

04:39:59,554 --> 04:39:59,902
SPEAKER_1:  in

04:40:00,482 --> 04:40:01,534
SPEAKER_1:  human life

04:40:01,890 --> 04:40:03,614
SPEAKER_1:  Like in all of human existence that.

04:40:04,098 --> 04:40:05,726
SPEAKER_1:  that we're not alone in this universe.

04:40:06,402 --> 04:40:08,638
SPEAKER_1:  What, you know, cellularly at least.

04:40:09,282 --> 04:40:11,646
SPEAKER_1:  and a good percentage of people, I'm thinking.

04:40:11,906 --> 04:40:12,830
SPEAKER_1:  2030.

04:40:13,218 --> 04:40:16,286
SPEAKER_1:  in today's world 40 plus percent of people.

04:40:16,866 --> 04:40:18,526
SPEAKER_1:  wouldn't even believe it existed.

04:40:18,946 --> 04:40:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  Interesting. I, I, I'd be, it's just a very important thing to think about, especially as an educator like yourself.

04:40:26,306 --> 04:40:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  I think the current cynicism towards institutions and science is temporary.

04:40:31,618 --> 04:40:34,462
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's they're basically the internet woke up.

04:40:35,266 --> 04:40:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  The internet smells bullshit?

04:40:37,250 --> 04:40:38,846
SPEAKER_0:  and it looked at...

04:40:39,554 --> 04:40:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  I'm sorry, I'm not being ageist, but saying older scientists and they looked at them.

04:40:43,618 --> 04:40:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  And they kind of said, you're kind of full of shit. You got a lot of ego.

04:40:47,554 --> 04:40:51,646
SPEAKER_0:  uh... your you speak down to everybody you're not very good at communicating

04:40:52,194 --> 04:40:59,198
SPEAKER_0:  I think there's a lot of truth to what they're saying. And I think the young scientists that are coming up will be much better at not being full of shit.

04:40:59,458 --> 04:41:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  being authentic, being real.

04:41:01,474 --> 04:41:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  treating people like they're children that can't possibly understand, taking it very seriously.

04:41:06,978 --> 04:41:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  that there's a lot of intelligent people out there that are curious that are

04:41:10,722 --> 04:41:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  full of desire for knowledge.

04:41:13,026 --> 04:41:16,030
SPEAKER_0:  like being transparent about all the uncertainties.

04:41:16,578 --> 04:41:22,878
SPEAKER_0:  of the scientific process, all the tensions, the conflicts, all of that. And I think...

04:41:23,714 --> 04:41:26,814
SPEAKER_0:  I think once we fix the science communication.

04:41:27,106 --> 04:41:27,582
SPEAKER_0:  system.

04:41:28,002 --> 04:41:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  adapted to the internet.

04:41:29,666 --> 04:41:30,654
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

04:41:31,202 --> 04:41:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  That won't be an issue, I hope.

04:41:33,154 --> 04:41:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  I hope.

04:41:33,730 --> 04:41:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, that's why people like you are really important, is like communicate with authenticity.

04:41:39,010 --> 04:41:39,422
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

04:41:40,610 --> 04:41:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  But yeah, that's definitely something to think about. Yes, the early-

04:41:44,610 --> 04:41:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  uh... mean listen scientists to like the phosphine discovered on on the news

04:41:49,282 --> 04:41:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  is like they're extremely skeptical always.

04:41:52,546 --> 04:41:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  So definitely there will.

04:41:53,858 --> 04:41:55,230
SPEAKER_0:  There'll be a lot of skepticism.

04:41:55,906 --> 04:41:59,070
SPEAKER_0:  It depends what it looks like if it kind of looks like

04:41:59,490 --> 04:42:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  This thing kinda looks like bacteria back on Earth.

04:42:02,210 --> 04:42:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, so it means contamination is very difficult to avoid in general.

04:42:06,786 --> 04:42:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  But if the thing looks like fundamentally different......well yeah.

04:42:10,274 --> 04:42:11,742
SPEAKER_1:  then you're like, all right.

04:42:13,666 --> 04:42:18,590
SPEAKER_1:  totally different DNA, RNA, like this is not, we've never observed this ever.

04:42:18,754 --> 04:42:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  then you're like, all right.

04:42:21,506 --> 04:42:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  Ha!

04:42:22,082 --> 04:42:22,974
SPEAKER_0:  Of course.

04:42:23,234 --> 04:42:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, so that I do what another promising thing that.

04:42:26,946 --> 04:42:28,670
SPEAKER_0:  difficult to be definitive about but

04:42:29,186 --> 04:42:32,254
SPEAKER_0:  Let's get better and better direct imaging systems.

04:42:32,546 --> 04:42:33,630
SPEAKER_0:  There's now a...

04:42:33,858 --> 04:42:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know how many, but thousands of.

04:42:36,706 --> 04:42:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  planets are being discovered outside of our solar system. There's moons being discovered. Now, Earth-like planets being discovered. So like all of that, if we could do direct imaging of those planets.

04:42:47,042 --> 04:42:48,062
SPEAKER_0:  More more more?

04:42:48,482 --> 04:42:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  There could be some gigantic

04:42:52,130 --> 04:42:55,582
SPEAKER_0:  If there is like a Cardishev like type two civilization.

04:42:55,842 --> 04:42:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  We're gonna see the damn thing. It's gonna be producing a lot of, uh...

04:42:59,970 --> 04:43:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  it's going to be radiating a lot of energy.

04:43:02,562 --> 04:43:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  So the possibility of detecting some of that, that's also.

04:43:06,082 --> 04:43:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  a real possibility with something like James Webb telescopes, like those kinds of efforts.

04:43:10,466 --> 04:43:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  that starts becoming a reality.

04:43:11,970 --> 04:43:15,646
SPEAKER_1:  Have you read Andy Weir's project Hail Mary? I have not, no.

04:43:15,906 --> 04:43:17,086
SPEAKER_1:  You're going to.

04:43:17,314 --> 04:43:18,046
SPEAKER_1:  Love it.

04:43:18,274 --> 04:43:19,006
SPEAKER_1:  Like it is.

04:43:19,458 --> 04:43:20,574
SPEAKER_1:  Basically,

04:43:21,378 --> 04:43:22,718
SPEAKER_1:  Almost answering that like.

04:43:23,266 --> 04:43:26,078
SPEAKER_1:  how could they not see us type of thing almost where.

04:43:26,690 --> 04:43:29,502
SPEAKER_1:  He creates this incredible, I don't want to spoil anything, but.

04:43:29,794 --> 04:43:30,526
SPEAKER_1:  you know.

04:43:31,234 --> 04:43:32,926
SPEAKER_1:  It's just the sense of like.

04:43:33,890 --> 04:43:38,014
SPEAKER_1:  We could have totally different perspectives with an alien race and not even like...

04:43:38,242 --> 04:43:46,519
SPEAKER_1:  consider that, you know, the two of us are coexisting almost. I don't want to spoil anything. It's really, really, really worth the read. Oh, you mean a different.

04:43:46,519 --> 04:43:49,342
SPEAKER_0:  perspective, like the aliens have a different perspective than humans.

04:43:49,634 --> 04:43:55,454
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, like, we just like, we see with this visual light. Someone could see in x-ray, et cetera, you know, like.

04:43:55,970 --> 04:43:57,182
SPEAKER_1:  And just the way we even...

04:43:57,602 --> 04:43:58,718
SPEAKER_1:  come to the same.

04:43:59,202 --> 04:44:02,974
SPEAKER_1:  perspective and like looking and observing is just so different fundamentally.

04:44:03,746 --> 04:44:09,982
SPEAKER_1:  that like we could, I mean, it's not quite like that. It's not like it's like, oh, they were actually on the moon and we're, you know, it's nothing like that, but.

04:44:10,434 --> 04:44:10,846
SPEAKER_1:  Uh

04:44:11,074 --> 04:44:15,582
SPEAKER_1:  but it's such a unique and incredible story. I think Andy Weir is one of the...

04:44:16,226 --> 04:44:17,822
SPEAKER_1:  best science fiction writers at home.

04:44:18,082 --> 04:44:25,443
SPEAKER_1:  I can't say that with much authority because I don't listen to much science fiction. So zero authority. I really like Andy Weir's books and that book is noted.

04:44:25,443 --> 04:44:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  But that sounds like I'm really worried about that. It sounds like

04:44:28,194 --> 04:44:29,886
SPEAKER_0:  I would really love it.

04:44:30,210 --> 04:44:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  I've definitely been very.

04:44:33,666 --> 04:44:40,478
SPEAKER_0:  I've done a lot of reading in my life, but like the science fiction is one of the things I've been really, really weak on. I haven't really read much and I just...

04:44:40,866 --> 04:44:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  made more and more friends over the years recently.

04:44:43,906 --> 04:44:45,438
SPEAKER_0:  Um, that say.

04:44:46,146 --> 04:44:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  that I absolutely must read some of these things. Do you have a comment?

04:44:49,218 --> 04:44:51,783
SPEAKER_1:  Do you physically read or do you do audio books or do you read or do audio books?

04:44:51,783 --> 04:44:55,486
SPEAKER_0:  A boat. I do both, yeah. Well, physically I sadly don't.

04:44:55,778 --> 04:44:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  It's a kindle, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:44:58,850 --> 04:45:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  But while I run, I also do...

04:45:02,082 --> 04:45:03,230
SPEAKER_0: 再做爆 再做爆

04:45:04,418 --> 04:45:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  uh, on a normal day.

04:45:06,402 --> 04:45:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  especially now that I've been really focused on reading.

04:45:09,826 --> 04:45:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  It's about.

04:45:10,594 --> 04:45:12,382
SPEAKER_0:  60 minutes of.

04:45:13,538 --> 04:45:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  Reading out of Kindle.

04:45:14,978 --> 04:45:19,454
SPEAKER_0:  and one to two hours, because I run about two hours.

04:45:19,938 --> 04:45:22,942
SPEAKER_0:  or when I don't have like other stuff like today I won't run.

04:45:23,394 --> 04:45:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  uh... says about three hours so on average i would say it's like two two and a half hours a day

04:45:27,938 --> 04:45:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  Let her read.

04:45:28,802 --> 04:45:30,942
SPEAKER_0:  and audiobooks are just the same, they're a little slower.

04:45:31,426 --> 04:45:35,998
SPEAKER_0:  there they can, especially for the classics, they can capture some of the magic with a deep voice.

04:45:36,290 --> 04:45:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  Usually with a British accent.

04:45:37,762 --> 04:45:41,182
SPEAKER_0:  I love it. I also read that, uh, listen to, sorry.

04:45:42,178 --> 04:45:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  uh... what a book on proportionate two years ago i remember

04:45:46,722 --> 04:45:51,134
SPEAKER_0:  but I remember that was extremely difficult. Ignition by? Yeah, it was ignition. By Don D. Clark. Yeah.

04:45:51,842 --> 04:45:52,967
SPEAKER_0:  It was very difficult to listen.

04:45:52,967 --> 04:45:57,470
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, yeah, I see, I don't read, I listen while I'm on road trips or running or stuff that too, so.

04:45:57,922 --> 04:45:58,942
SPEAKER_1:  I swear there's probably.

04:45:59,522 --> 04:46:01,886
SPEAKER_1:  40 or like not 40, but there's like eight minutes of.

04:46:02,370 --> 04:46:02,910
SPEAKER_1:  We tried.

04:46:03,554 --> 04:46:05,086
SPEAKER_1:  PMZ 15.

04:46:05,314 --> 04:46:05,950
SPEAKER_1:  13.

04:46:06,306 --> 04:46:10,814
SPEAKER_1:  BM 412 RMNL mitromyclhydrigeny for like.

04:46:11,330 --> 04:46:16,478
SPEAKER_1:  I swear it's multiple minutes of explaining one trial on something because there's just so many

04:46:16,770 --> 04:46:18,814
SPEAKER_1:  different chemicals they try, I don't know, it's...

04:46:19,138 --> 04:46:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  It's almost a joke. I literally, audibly laughed out loud listening to it because I'm like, this is so ridiculous. I'm sure it makes sense reading it, but listening to it is just hilarious.

04:46:27,906 --> 04:46:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  But it's great though.

04:46:30,114 --> 04:46:33,438
SPEAKER_0:  What do you think of some of the challenges for long-term space travel?

04:46:33,698 --> 04:46:35,742
SPEAKER_0:  Do you think about this kind of stuff, the biological stuff?

04:46:36,354 --> 04:46:37,054
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

04:46:37,602 --> 04:46:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  Do you worry? Do you think about radiation on Mars?

04:46:41,730 --> 04:46:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, and out in space over periods of, uh, actually the effects on the human body.

04:46:47,554 --> 04:46:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  get even the radiation.

04:46:49,154 --> 04:46:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  over periods of months and years.

04:46:53,506 --> 04:46:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  I think...

04:46:54,210 --> 04:46:56,414
SPEAKER_1:  Realistically, we have a really good handle.

04:46:56,674 --> 04:46:57,054
SPEAKER_1:  on.

04:46:57,698 --> 04:46:58,782
SPEAKER_1:  what the effects are.

04:46:59,682 --> 04:47:02,942
SPEAKER_1:  And we actually have the solution to like everything. It's just.

04:47:03,618 --> 04:47:04,350
SPEAKER_1:  whether or not.

04:47:04,610 --> 04:47:12,158
SPEAKER_1:  we can like, you know, for instance, one of the, you know, low-earth orbit, one of the biggest challenges eventually after your long-term space travel.

04:47:12,546 --> 04:47:14,046
SPEAKER_1:  Is bone density loss a not?

04:47:14,338 --> 04:47:16,702
SPEAKER_1:  having gravity, you know, you actually have issues with.

04:47:17,250 --> 04:47:18,430
SPEAKER_1:  a handful of things and-

04:47:18,914 --> 04:47:19,934
SPEAKER_1:  artificial gravities.

04:47:20,194 --> 04:47:21,662
SPEAKER_1:  Easy in terms of.

04:47:22,178 --> 04:47:25,246
SPEAKER_1:  relatively easy as in terms of space flight, you know, you can

04:47:25,826 --> 04:47:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  You'd have two vehicles just tethered together and...

04:47:28,578 --> 04:47:29,086
SPEAKER_1:  You know, just.

04:47:29,346 --> 04:47:29,822
SPEAKER_1:  spinning.

04:47:30,338 --> 04:47:41,150
SPEAKER_1:  as given enough distance and a decent enough spin velocity. And you can get one gene like relatively easy. We're talking again, relatively easy, especially after talking about theoretical physics. Like this is.

04:47:41,410 --> 04:47:42,814
SPEAKER_1:  That's easy stuff.

04:47:43,074 --> 04:47:43,454
SPEAKER_1:  We haven't.

04:47:43,714 --> 04:47:45,054
SPEAKER_1:  done that yet, but like.

04:47:45,506 --> 04:47:49,822
SPEAKER_1:  There's no reason why we can't produce artificial gravity. If we say that that's-

04:47:50,338 --> 04:47:53,822
SPEAKER_1:  you know, a big enough hurdle that we absolutely have to overcome this.

04:47:54,146 --> 04:47:57,630
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, cool. We'll just spin up two vehicles that are going to Mars and...

04:47:58,178 --> 04:48:01,982
SPEAKER_1:  people will have, but you know, that's the thing is Mars is only about, we'll say six months.

04:48:02,274 --> 04:48:02,910
SPEAKER_1:  There

04:48:03,234 --> 04:48:07,550
SPEAKER_1:  Then you're hanging out on Mars, you have 38% of gravity, and then six months-ish back.

04:48:08,130 --> 04:48:08,798
SPEAKER_1:  People live.

04:48:09,026 --> 04:48:14,718
SPEAKER_1:  on the International Space Station at six months' stints. We've had people for basically a year up on the International Space Station.

04:48:15,106 --> 04:48:15,838
SPEAKER_1:  It's not like it's.

04:48:16,258 --> 04:48:19,102
SPEAKER_1:  It's not life altering. Yeah, you have a couple days of...

04:48:19,586 --> 04:48:23,614
SPEAKER_1:  not being able to walk very well, and you do have some bone density loss and some other concerns.

04:48:24,322 --> 04:48:25,246
SPEAKER_1:  But like again, that's.

04:48:26,146 --> 04:48:29,406
SPEAKER_1:  It's solvable. I think the first mission is to Mars.

04:48:30,082 --> 04:48:30,686
SPEAKER_1:  I think.

04:48:31,266 --> 04:48:34,558
SPEAKER_1:  It might, we might, we'll probably do the trade. Is it worth it to like-

04:48:34,786 --> 04:48:36,414
SPEAKER_1:  land on Mars and have a crippled.

04:48:36,706 --> 04:48:38,526
SPEAKER_1:  that can't even physically stand yet.

04:48:39,170 --> 04:48:40,702
SPEAKER_1:  you know, for a day or two.

04:48:41,122 --> 04:48:44,126
SPEAKER_1:  before they get their feet from underneath them? or is it?

04:48:44,610 --> 04:48:45,566
SPEAKER_1:  Do we need to spin up?

04:48:46,242 --> 04:48:48,702
SPEAKER_1:  to spacecraft, you know, a tether and have.

04:48:48,994 --> 04:48:54,590
SPEAKER_1:  Like you can't do it like Starship, you know, even though it's 30 feet wide or nine meters wide, if you spin it on that one axis,

04:48:55,042 --> 04:48:56,734
SPEAKER_1:  That's not enough space to.

04:48:57,954 --> 04:49:01,054
SPEAKER_1:  one G without your feet and your head being it too different.

04:49:01,474 --> 04:49:04,990
SPEAKER_1:  velocity so you get really sick. You always feel like you're falling.

04:49:05,442 --> 04:49:07,486
SPEAKER_1:  Your brain will tell you that you're falling constantly.

04:49:07,842 --> 04:49:10,814
SPEAKER_1:  But then again, okay, so this is the whole thing is.

04:49:11,490 --> 04:49:13,118
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if there's...

04:49:13,346 --> 04:49:15,038
SPEAKER_1:  We don't really have the data yet on like.

04:49:15,490 --> 04:49:17,438
SPEAKER_1:  Going from zero G, we know the effects of that.

04:49:17,762 --> 04:49:21,822
SPEAKER_1:  We know the effects of 1G really well. That's our majority of our data set.

04:49:22,210 --> 04:49:24,990
SPEAKER_1:  but we don't really have much data on the long-term effects of.

04:49:25,762 --> 04:49:27,870
SPEAKER_1:  uh, you know, one sixth gravity, like on the moon.

04:49:28,098 --> 04:49:29,694
SPEAKER_1:  or 38% gravity, is it?

04:49:30,210 --> 04:49:35,582
SPEAKER_1:  Is 1-6 gravity actually enough to counteract 95% of the effects of low gravity?

04:49:36,034 --> 04:49:36,606
SPEAKER_1:  Or is it?

04:49:36,898 --> 04:49:41,502
SPEAKER_1:  15, you know, is it 160? Is it like a linear thing? Is 38% gravity?

04:49:42,242 --> 04:49:47,966
SPEAKER_1:  totally 38% as bad as one or whatever, is it a slight like where is it out on the scale?

04:49:48,610 --> 04:49:54,622
SPEAKER_1:  So there's a chance that we don't need anywhere near one g of gravity to counteract the bulk majority of these problems. We could have.

04:49:55,458 --> 04:49:59,006
SPEAKER_1:  point one year whatever is that you have the right compromise of.

04:49:59,458 --> 04:50:03,902
SPEAKER_1:  of vehicle complexity and human biology and.

04:50:04,354 --> 04:50:07,518
SPEAKER_1:  All of these other effects like we this is absolutely a solvable thing.

04:50:07,650 --> 04:50:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  That is and and we figure some of this out through just experimentation 100% along the way

04:50:13,698 --> 04:50:16,926
SPEAKER_0:  uh... one of this is back to my dating life i think one of the essential

04:50:17,186 --> 04:50:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  fundamental research questions I'm wondering about.

04:50:20,258 --> 04:50:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  is the dynamics.

04:50:23,074 --> 04:50:24,158
SPEAKER_0:  And...

04:50:25,154 --> 04:50:27,678
SPEAKER_0:  So the details of how you have sex in space.

04:50:28,642 --> 04:50:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  Um, asking for a friend, of course. I mean, that's, there literally is sort of work on this, right? Cause like-

04:50:34,402 --> 04:50:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  if you think about long term space travel.

04:50:37,186 --> 04:50:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  I mean...

04:50:39,074 --> 04:50:40,542
SPEAKER_0:  sexist is uh

04:50:41,570 --> 04:50:46,014
SPEAKER_0:  So like there's the recreational aspect of sex, but the most important aspect of sex.

04:50:46,242 --> 04:50:48,126
SPEAKER_0:  for long-term space travel is...

04:50:49,058 --> 04:50:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  procreation

04:50:51,394 --> 04:50:59,486
SPEAKER_0:  and also the full biological cycle of that. So from the embryo, the development of the baby, the giving the birth and all that kind of stuff. It's like.

04:51:00,482 --> 04:51:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  You know, there's a lot of really difficult...

04:51:04,226 --> 04:51:06,686
SPEAKER_0:  problems of biology there to understand.

04:51:06,946 --> 04:51:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  and perhaps that's all. Some of that, again, just like you said brilliantly.

04:51:11,074 --> 04:51:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  Some of that can be just solved with engineering outside of the human body by creating a gravitational field like

04:51:17,634 --> 04:51:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  that.

04:51:18,306 --> 04:51:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  but maybe along the way you can figure out how to do that without doing it.

04:51:21,922 --> 04:51:23,047
SPEAKER_0:  We're balancing the costs.

04:51:23,047 --> 04:51:27,646
SPEAKER_1:  And radiation is the other thing. I know we have a really good-

04:51:27,938 --> 04:51:31,358
SPEAKER_1:  data set on what radiation and doses do to humans.

04:51:31,618 --> 04:51:31,998
SPEAKER_1:  We know.

04:51:32,258 --> 04:51:33,822
SPEAKER_1:  We can measure radiation, we know.

04:51:34,178 --> 04:51:39,678
SPEAKER_1:  We can approximate and kind of give edge cases for the Mars transient and getting to Mars and being on Mars.

04:51:40,130 --> 04:51:41,726
SPEAKER_1:  And the simple answer to that is like.

04:51:42,402 --> 04:51:43,774
SPEAKER_1:  At the end of the day, if we have to.

04:51:44,450 --> 04:51:47,422
SPEAKER_1:  dig into Mars or find a tunnel to...

04:51:47,842 --> 04:51:50,462
SPEAKER_1:  live in so you get some extra mass in between you and.

04:51:50,946 --> 04:51:54,878
SPEAKER_1:  cosmic radiation, so be it. Like that's the answer then. Again, none of these are like.

04:51:55,266 --> 04:51:56,990
SPEAKER_1:  insolvable problems are just.

04:51:57,346 --> 04:51:59,838
SPEAKER_1:  things, hurdles you would have to overcome based on.

04:52:01,250 --> 04:52:03,486
SPEAKER_1:  the risk exposure and the posture there.

04:52:04,098 --> 04:52:04,830
SPEAKER_0:  Magic Bing

04:52:05,858 --> 04:52:06,686
SPEAKER_0:  the first.

04:52:07,810 --> 04:52:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  Child, the first baby born.

04:52:10,978 --> 04:52:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  Outside of Earth.

04:52:12,994 --> 04:52:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  That'd be pretty cool. Yeah, that'll be pretty cool. I'd love-

04:52:15,842 --> 04:52:17,118
SPEAKER_0:  alive to see that.

04:52:17,506 --> 04:52:18,366
SPEAKER_0:  That'll be a big one.

04:52:18,722 --> 04:52:19,870
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know if he'll, um...

04:52:22,082 --> 04:52:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, because it's such a dangerous thing.

04:52:24,866 --> 04:52:27,230
SPEAKER_0:  It's so risky. I think that could be in our lifetime.

04:52:27,842 --> 04:52:28,862
SPEAKER_1:  You think so? Yeah

04:52:29,602 --> 04:52:32,798
SPEAKER_1:  I would like to think in a perfect world of overthinking futurism that-

04:52:33,858 --> 04:52:37,246
SPEAKER_1:  30 to 50 years, I definitely think we could have a full time.

04:52:37,698 --> 04:52:38,238
SPEAKER_1:  permanent.

04:52:38,946 --> 04:52:40,766
SPEAKER_1:  major civilizations, you know, like

04:52:41,218 --> 04:52:41,758
SPEAKER_1:  Like, um.

04:52:42,498 --> 04:52:45,342
SPEAKER_1:  like what Blue Origin wants to develop where they have a

04:52:45,826 --> 04:52:48,350
SPEAKER_1:  a huge like sphere, you know, and you're doing a lot of.

04:52:48,578 --> 04:52:48,958
SPEAKER_1:  Bye.

04:52:49,570 --> 04:52:55,038
SPEAKER_1:  heavy industry off of Earth so you're not polluting Earth. That makes so much sense to me.

04:52:55,490 --> 04:52:57,374
SPEAKER_1:  Um, yeah, I think, I think we.

04:52:59,202 --> 04:53:05,726
SPEAKER_1:  we could live in a lifetime where, you know, we thought that since the 50s and 60s that people are gonna be living and working in space, like crazy.

04:53:06,018 --> 04:53:09,054
SPEAKER_1:  And at any given point, we're lucky to have 12 people in space today.

04:53:09,474 --> 04:53:09,950
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

04:53:10,882 --> 04:53:13,822
SPEAKER_1:  But I really think in our lifetime, we're finally getting to that point of

04:53:15,362 --> 04:53:15,678
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

04:53:15,810 --> 04:53:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  that that's a reality.

04:53:17,314 --> 04:53:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  Let me, cause you mentioned Blue Origin.

04:53:19,618 --> 04:53:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  Can we just lay out some of the competitors to SpaceX?

04:53:23,458 --> 04:53:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  So much of what we talked about is SpaceX.

04:53:27,202 --> 04:53:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  specifically because they're sort of pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the commercial space flight, but there's a lot of like you said incredible

04:53:34,562 --> 04:53:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  work being done for large companies, small companies, startups and so on.

04:53:38,274 --> 04:53:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  So who are the competitors to SpaceX?

04:53:41,026 --> 04:53:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  ULA, you know, Launch Alliance, Blue Origin.

04:53:44,130 --> 04:53:45,054
SPEAKER_0:  as a virgin.

04:53:45,602 --> 04:53:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

04:53:46,370 --> 04:53:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  Is it galactic orbit? Orbit would be the competitor. Virgin orbit, there's rocket labs, electron rocket that you mentioned.

04:53:54,946 --> 04:53:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

04:53:55,970 --> 04:53:57,726
SPEAKER_0:  There's the folks you covered, Firefly.

04:53:58,658 --> 04:53:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  And, uh,

04:54:00,226 --> 04:54:02,206
SPEAKER_0:  What am I missing? There's the epic.

04:54:02,562 --> 04:54:03,518
SPEAKER_0:  bass launch system.

04:54:04,482 --> 04:54:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  Komm!

04:54:05,250 --> 04:54:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  NASA, I guess that is.

04:54:06,594 --> 04:54:12,638
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, thankfully NASA, but prime contractor Boeing and Northrop. Lockheed? Northrop is the boosters, yep.

04:54:13,378 --> 04:54:18,398
SPEAKER_0:  Nice, so like what's interesting to say to lay out the land here that you're excited about?

04:54:18,562 --> 04:54:20,670
SPEAKER_1:  Just in general, I think if you aren't-

04:54:20,930 --> 04:54:22,334
SPEAKER_1:  working on a reusable.

04:54:22,658 --> 04:54:24,286
SPEAKER_1:  some form of a reasonable vehicle like.

04:54:24,834 --> 04:54:25,950
SPEAKER_1:  physically working on it.

04:54:26,210 --> 04:54:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  pen to paper, or not beyond pen to paper, like.

04:54:28,770 --> 04:54:31,678
SPEAKER_1:  Bending metal for a reusable vehicle, you're gone. You're toast.

04:54:32,674 --> 04:54:34,878
SPEAKER_1:  I think we're well into that being.

04:54:35,202 --> 04:54:35,934
SPEAKER_1:  The only.

04:54:36,706 --> 04:54:37,310
SPEAKER_1:  provable.

04:54:37,794 --> 04:54:42,878
SPEAKER_1:  you know, way forward. The only way you're gonna compete and survive is a reusable rocket.

04:54:43,266 --> 04:54:46,750
SPEAKER_1:  Fully reusable would be great, but that's obviously massively aspirational still.

04:54:47,330 --> 04:54:48,478
SPEAKER_1:  But it will come.

04:54:49,250 --> 04:54:50,334
SPEAKER_1:  But to me...

04:54:51,138 --> 04:54:53,022
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, the list, you pretty much had it.

04:54:53,250 --> 04:54:55,966
SPEAKER_1:  right on the head. There's Astra was another.

04:54:56,258 --> 04:54:57,566
SPEAKER_1:  Orbital Rockets Company.

04:54:57,794 --> 04:54:58,206
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

04:54:58,594 --> 04:55:01,822
SPEAKER_1:  They there's a lot of companies. I think right now the

04:55:02,594 --> 04:55:05,662
SPEAKER_1:  The ones that I personally really believe in.

04:55:06,050 --> 04:55:09,822
SPEAKER_1:  You know, Rocket Lab is awesome. I really think that they are.

04:55:10,594 --> 04:55:13,502
SPEAKER_1:  One of the few that I believe can actually build a Falcon 9 class rocket.

04:55:13,986 --> 04:55:15,006
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, like.

04:55:15,330 --> 04:55:18,302
SPEAKER_1:  today with their technology, with their knowledge, with their

04:55:18,882 --> 04:55:24,798
SPEAKER_1:  investments with their funding, you know, and they've proven themselves. There's very few, they have actually made it look.

04:55:25,122 --> 04:55:29,694
SPEAKER_1:  Easy. I think there's a lot of startups and a lot of new rocket. There's too many launch providers.

04:55:30,018 --> 04:55:31,198
SPEAKER_1:  popping out of the woodwork right now.

04:55:31,490 --> 04:55:33,086
SPEAKER_1:  They won't all survive, of course.

04:55:33,570 --> 04:55:36,542
SPEAKER_1:  I think realistically, if you look at like airplanes, how many...

04:55:37,026 --> 04:55:42,526
SPEAKER_1:  Airplane, you know, there's a handful of airplane manufacturers. There's not hundreds and thousands of airplane manufacturers.

04:55:43,170 --> 04:55:45,886
SPEAKER_1:  I think it'll be a similar thing for space flight. I think we'll see.

04:55:46,306 --> 04:55:46,942
SPEAKER_1:  We'll see.

04:55:47,746 --> 04:55:51,806
SPEAKER_1:  You know, realistically in the terms of jubbo-jest and passengers, there's basically two.

04:55:52,034 --> 04:55:53,758
SPEAKER_1:  You know, there's Airbus and there's Boeing.

04:55:54,338 --> 04:55:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

04:55:55,522 --> 04:55:56,190
SPEAKER_1:  So I.

04:55:57,026 --> 04:55:57,566
SPEAKER_1:  I think.

04:55:57,922 --> 04:56:00,926
SPEAKER_1:  In the long run, there'll be two or three major players.

04:56:01,730 --> 04:56:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  I think there'll be, you know, 10.

04:56:05,058 --> 04:56:10,206
SPEAKER_1:  minor like as far as launch providers as far as the ones actually leaving earth and getting into orbit

04:56:10,434 --> 04:56:12,286
SPEAKER_1:  I just don't think there's a ton of room for...

04:56:13,154 --> 04:56:15,687
SPEAKER_1:  individuality really, you know? yeah I-I would-

04:56:15,687 --> 04:56:18,462
SPEAKER_0:  I'm supposed to see it like a really serious competitor.

04:56:18,690 --> 04:56:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  to SpaceX in the way that SpaceX does things. I don't know if you'll like is quite.

04:56:24,034 --> 04:56:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  What I-

04:56:25,282 --> 04:56:27,157
SPEAKER_0:  It's quite the rage kind of co-

04:56:27,157 --> 04:56:29,310
SPEAKER_1:  Let me let me say this you will a

04:56:29,570 --> 04:56:33,214
SPEAKER_1:  Has all of the potential, but just operationally there, you know, either power will be there.

04:56:33,538 --> 04:56:37,310
SPEAKER_1:  either Lockheed Martin and Boeing's like love child. Yeah, but they're.

04:56:38,210 --> 04:56:44,382
SPEAKER_1:  of set up in a far too traditional manner where they just really aren't given the opportunity to

04:56:44,674 --> 04:56:46,549
SPEAKER_1:  innovate like a lot of these startups.

04:56:46,549 --> 04:56:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  Sorry. So Rocket Lab is a little bit more of that nature. What do you think about?

04:56:51,106 --> 04:56:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  sort of just blue origin in general.

04:56:53,186 --> 04:56:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  The virgins childhood

04:56:54,018 --> 04:56:55,550
SPEAKER_1:  I man I

04:56:56,642 --> 04:56:59,934
SPEAKER_1:  What Blue Origin has done with New Shepard is amazing and people...

04:57:00,450 --> 04:57:04,478
SPEAKER_1:  just lot it because it's suborbital and it looks very phallic

04:57:05,154 --> 04:57:05,694
SPEAKER_1:  It's the...

04:57:06,786 --> 04:57:07,911
SPEAKER_1:  It's so I guess the meme.

04:57:07,911 --> 04:57:09,411
SPEAKER_0:  matters also.

04:57:09,411 --> 04:57:13,790
SPEAKER_1:  But it's sad because people don't see what they are also working on, which is New Glenn.

04:57:14,082 --> 04:57:16,414
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I see comments almost every day still of like.

04:57:16,802 --> 04:57:18,270
SPEAKER_1:  It doesn't matter because you know, they're.

04:57:18,658 --> 04:57:23,326
SPEAKER_1:  they're working on Tiny, it's like no, New Glenn is more powerful and more capable than Falcon Heavy.

04:57:23,746 --> 04:57:25,790
SPEAKER_1:  New Glenn is almost more of a competitor too.

04:57:26,274 --> 04:57:29,150
SPEAKER_1:  Not quite as to Starship, but it's almost in that class. It's a-

04:57:29,634 --> 04:57:31,934
SPEAKER_1:  It's a heavy lift launch vehicle. It's huge.

04:57:32,258 --> 04:57:33,502
SPEAKER_1:  It'll be nuts.

04:57:33,794 --> 04:57:36,414
SPEAKER_1:  They're very actively working on it. You know, I still think we're.

04:57:36,994 --> 04:57:38,302
SPEAKER_1:  three years away from it launching.

04:57:38,754 --> 04:57:41,022
SPEAKER_1:  but that's a very strong competitor.

04:57:41,730 --> 04:57:43,934
SPEAKER_1:  class of rockets that SpaceX is currently making.

04:57:44,098 --> 04:57:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  So SpaceX is currently leading the way but...

04:57:46,818 --> 04:57:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  that it could become a close race.

04:57:50,114 --> 04:57:51,262
SPEAKER_1:  I'm, it's just, I-

04:57:51,618 --> 04:58:05,470
SPEAKER_1:  We'll just, for now, we'll ignore SpaceX. We'll just kind of talk about like, I think who's kind of coming around the corner here. Who's here? So let me just do a quick overview. I'm gonna shoot myself in the foot for getting some cool people here and some exciting companies, but Relativity's one that.

04:58:05,922 --> 04:58:09,182
SPEAKER_1:  If you, you should definitely get Tim Ellis on the show, who is the重要 person on the show

04:58:09,634 --> 04:58:12,478
SPEAKER_1:  CEO of Relativity, they're doing 3D printed rockets.

04:58:13,122 --> 04:58:15,358
SPEAKER_1:  The ones that have the world's largest 3D printer.

04:58:16,066 --> 04:58:17,982
SPEAKER_1:  getting really close to their first orbital launch.

04:58:18,402 --> 04:58:21,278
SPEAKER_1:  The cool thing about them, the reason that I think they're exciting.

04:58:21,570 --> 04:58:22,686
SPEAKER_1:  The reason that I...

04:58:23,330 --> 04:58:24,894
SPEAKER_1:  I think they have the potential is.

04:58:25,154 --> 04:58:26,782
SPEAKER_1:  just how quickly they can iterate.

04:58:27,042 --> 04:58:28,894
SPEAKER_1:  I think 3D printing a rocket is really dumb.

04:58:30,178 --> 04:58:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  I think.

04:58:30,882 --> 04:58:33,054
SPEAKER_1:  Iterating with 3D printing on a rock is brilliant.

04:58:33,410 --> 04:58:36,286
SPEAKER_1:  because you can literally change software and have like.

04:58:36,706 --> 04:58:37,758
SPEAKER_1:  very little, you know.

04:58:38,082 --> 04:58:39,646
SPEAKER_1:  upload a file and have a new rocket.

04:58:40,194 --> 04:58:41,310
SPEAKER_1:  That's amazing.

04:58:41,538 --> 04:58:42,622
SPEAKER_1:  So in terms of.

04:58:43,042 --> 04:58:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  long-term iterative process.

04:58:45,410 --> 04:58:48,126
SPEAKER_1:  if we're really talking about hitting the ground running and...

04:58:48,546 --> 04:58:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  and just seeing where the evolution takes you, I think that's about as good as you can get.

04:58:52,802 --> 04:58:56,606
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I think what SpaceX is doing at Starbase just physically bending cheap steel is probably

04:58:56,930 --> 04:58:58,398
SPEAKER_1:  Also a very valid solution.

04:58:59,170 --> 04:59:02,590
SPEAKER_1:  So I really think, and they have the engineering chops, I think they've got some amazing people.

04:59:03,426 --> 04:59:04,862
SPEAKER_1:  Again, Rocket Lab.

04:59:05,858 --> 04:59:16,670
SPEAKER_1:  adore what they work on. And you know, like everyone, there's a caveat here that everything takes longer. Anything any company tells you it's two or three times longer, just period. Lab's no different.

04:59:17,026 --> 04:59:20,350
SPEAKER_1:  But I really they're they're working on a neutron rocket. That's gonna be

04:59:20,802 --> 04:59:27,006
SPEAKER_1:  I think 8,000 to 15,000 kilograms to lower the orbit. It's a good medium class rocket will compete.

04:59:27,490 --> 04:59:29,022
SPEAKER_1:  right along with Falcon 9, hopefully.

04:59:29,506 --> 04:59:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  By the way, Neutron would be its name.

04:59:31,746 --> 04:59:36,621
SPEAKER_0:  It's not some kind of fascinating new physics breakthrough where they're using neutrons.

04:59:36,621 --> 04:59:40,446
SPEAKER_1:  No, no, but they are using, they're also using liquid methane and liquid oxygen.

04:59:40,962 --> 04:59:44,990
SPEAKER_1:  Um, I just think it's a really, it's a, it seems like a great rocket and

04:59:45,474 --> 04:59:48,766
SPEAKER_1:  assuming they can actually get it flying in two or three years, I think they're going to be.

04:59:49,250 --> 04:59:50,238
SPEAKER_1:  It's here to stay, you know?

04:59:50,786 --> 04:59:56,126
SPEAKER_1:  I'd be remiss right now I'm editing a video from an interview with Stoke Aerospace out in Kent, Washington.

04:59:56,738 --> 04:59:57,150
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

04:59:57,378 --> 05:00:08,382
SPEAKER_1:  It's just one of these companies that they have a long ways to go. Like they're still in the very they're they're behind the curve, frankly, in terms of launch vehicles right now, because, like I said, there's so many coming out of the woodwork.

05:00:08,674 --> 05:00:10,302
SPEAKER_1:  Well, the idea they're working on.

05:00:11,138 --> 05:00:13,822
SPEAKER_1:  Their solution to a fully reusable rocket is.

05:00:14,114 --> 05:00:15,326
SPEAKER_1:  Amazing.

05:00:15,586 --> 05:00:18,211
SPEAKER_1:  one of the coolest concepts I've ever seen. You got

05:00:18,211 --> 05:00:18,961
SPEAKER_0:  cover in the video.

05:00:18,961 --> 05:00:22,142
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that'll be hopefully coming out the next depending on

05:00:22,402 --> 05:00:26,590
SPEAKER_1:  what the schedule like is down there. I'm actively editing that as we speak and it is.

05:00:27,138 --> 05:00:29,118
SPEAKER_1:  So cool. I mean, it is like.

05:00:29,506 --> 05:00:30,526
SPEAKER_1:  It's, it's...

05:00:30,754 --> 05:00:32,030
SPEAKER_1:  Genius, and the

05:00:32,482 --> 05:00:35,998
SPEAKER_1:  If they can actually get it to work, I can see them merging. I can for sure see someone.

05:00:36,418 --> 05:00:37,342
SPEAKER_1:  potentially like I

05:00:37,666 --> 05:00:39,998
SPEAKER_1:  perfectly in a perfect world they've merged with Rocket Lab.

05:00:40,546 --> 05:00:44,414
SPEAKER_1:  Stoke develops the upper stage, and maybe even the engines, they are.

05:00:44,994 --> 05:00:47,870
SPEAKER_1:  the two guys, the CEO, the co-founders of that company.

05:00:48,290 --> 05:00:49,342
SPEAKER_1: bieces? you

05:00:49,666 --> 05:00:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  They are engine, like propulsion engineer.

05:00:52,418 --> 05:00:55,422
SPEAKER_1:  magnificence. They have they used to they both have worked at Blue.

05:00:55,906 --> 05:01:01,182
SPEAKER_1:  developed engines in a hurry there and then left blue and it felt like it was getting too slow for them and now they are.

05:01:01,698 --> 05:01:03,518
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, these guys fired a...

05:01:03,810 --> 05:01:05,310
SPEAKER_1:  15 chambered rocket engine.

05:01:05,826 --> 05:01:09,502
SPEAKER_1:  instead of four from the Soviet. We're talking 15 chambers, single turbo pump.

05:01:10,242 --> 05:01:12,158
SPEAKER_1:  70 times in the month of October.

05:01:14,210 --> 05:01:15,358
SPEAKER_1:  That's impressive.

05:01:15,874 --> 05:01:18,974
SPEAKER_1:  And that's like, that was on average, you know, if you think about like days off.

05:01:19,426 --> 05:01:21,246
SPEAKER_1:  Time off, you know, parts changing.

05:01:21,474 --> 05:01:21,950
SPEAKER_1:  Yes.

05:01:22,434 --> 05:01:25,758
SPEAKER_1:  over twice a day on average of a Hydrolux engine?

05:01:26,242 --> 05:01:27,614
SPEAKER_1:  That's insane. So I....

05:01:28,258 --> 05:01:35,582
SPEAKER_1:  I love them and I hope the best for them. But they're also topical right now. They're at the top of my head. What about Firefly?

05:01:36,034 --> 05:01:37,278
SPEAKER_1:  What I like about Firefly.

05:01:37,730 --> 05:01:43,998
SPEAKER_1:  They've already got kind of a traditional aerospace backing. They're starting to buddy up a lot with Northrop Grumman. They're going to be building the booster stage.

05:01:44,418 --> 05:01:47,806
SPEAKER_1:  for Antares, which is currently flying only out of Wallops, Virginia.

05:01:48,418 --> 05:01:52,862
SPEAKER_1:  and is one of the only other commercial providers for the International Space Station. And Northrop Grumman is very-

05:01:53,282 --> 05:01:57,758
SPEAKER_1:  traditional aerospace company, you know, like lots of solid rocket boosters and they've

05:01:58,178 --> 05:01:59,614
SPEAKER_1:  purchased ironically there.

05:01:59,842 --> 05:02:00,926
SPEAKER_1:  their current Antares.

05:02:01,218 --> 05:02:02,718
SPEAKER_1:  is reliant on Russian engines.

05:02:03,074 --> 05:02:04,222
SPEAKER_1:  and Ukrainian boosters.

05:02:04,674 --> 05:02:14,014
SPEAKER_1:  that I don't think you're gonna be able to get your hands on too much anymore. So they're looking to some US propulsion and stages. So they actually.

05:02:14,242 --> 05:02:15,230
SPEAKER_1:  are partnering with.

05:02:15,522 --> 05:02:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  with Firefly and their new Antares rocket will be

05:02:19,426 --> 05:02:23,518
SPEAKER_1:  a first stage built entirely by Firefly. So I'm excited that Firefly already has.

05:02:23,874 --> 05:02:25,118
SPEAKER_1:  the propulsion technology.

05:02:25,506 --> 05:02:29,662
SPEAKER_1:  And they actually developed, ironically, their tap-off cycle engine was developed.

05:02:30,114 --> 05:02:32,926
SPEAKER_1:  in partnership with Ukraine with Ukrainian engineers.

05:02:33,314 --> 05:02:35,710
SPEAKER_1:  who developed the whole turbo pump system.

05:02:36,354 --> 05:02:37,566
SPEAKER_1:  So it's like, is this cool?

05:02:37,858 --> 05:02:40,926
SPEAKER_1:  meddling of these worlds.

05:02:41,378 --> 05:02:46,302
SPEAKER_1:  Um, their former CEO, Tom Rekusick was like, I have an interview with him and he's

05:02:46,818 --> 05:02:47,838
SPEAKER_1:  Anyone that can just...

05:02:48,354 --> 05:02:48,894
SPEAKER_1:  Spout.

05:02:49,314 --> 05:02:52,222
SPEAKER_1:  nuances and facts. I just love I just

05:02:52,546 --> 05:02:55,166
SPEAKER_1:  soaked that guy's information up as best I could because he is.

05:02:55,586 --> 05:02:59,486
SPEAKER_1:  Brilliant. Literally a doctor, a rocket doctor.

05:02:59,682 --> 05:03:10,494
SPEAKER_0:  So yeah, I mean, that's what like you said, that's the fascinating thing about these folks. They're legit. They're such great engineers, the people that bring these rockets to life. And then there's all this stuff that we.

05:03:10,818 --> 05:03:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  know and don't know about in China and other parts and other nations that are putting stuff into orbit. One of the sad things also is like you know with Lockheed and Boeing.

05:03:20,930 --> 05:03:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  is uh

05:03:22,882 --> 05:03:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  and just military applications in general.

05:03:25,922 --> 05:03:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  so much technology that's currently being developed.

05:03:28,994 --> 05:03:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  that we probably know nothing about.

05:03:31,586 --> 05:03:34,110
SPEAKER_0:  And that makes me a little bit sad, of course.

05:03:35,938 --> 05:03:39,614
SPEAKER_0:  uh... for several reasons one is that the use of that technology is

05:03:40,194 --> 05:03:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  has really much

05:03:42,914 --> 05:03:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  It's not that inspiring, it's like a very military focus. Yeah, it's to kill someone. It's to kill someone, yeah. There's not even like a-

05:03:50,914 --> 05:03:52,478
SPEAKER_0:  a side application.

05:03:52,738 --> 05:03:59,486
SPEAKER_0:  Right. And the big one is that it's shrouded in secrecy as opposed to being a source of inspiration.

05:04:00,162 --> 05:04:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  But that's the way of the world.

05:04:02,274 --> 05:04:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  Like what was that one plane that you covered that was like we know nothing about?

05:04:06,818 --> 05:04:07,943
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, the X37B.

05:04:07,943 --> 05:04:08,693
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, there's

05:04:08,693 --> 05:04:12,094
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, orbited for over 900 days and returned.

05:04:12,578 --> 05:04:15,710
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I want to know about that thing. I don't know. That's what's-

05:04:16,226 --> 05:04:18,910
SPEAKER_1:  It's so frustrating, we know when it launches, people...

05:04:19,330 --> 05:04:21,630
SPEAKER_1:  You know, amateurs track and no.

05:04:22,050 --> 05:04:25,950
SPEAKER_1:  They even will be like, oh, it changed orbit. You know, it raised and lowered its orbit, blah, blah, blah.

05:04:26,850 --> 05:04:29,182
SPEAKER_1:  I generally have just almost no idea what it's doing up there.

05:04:29,634 --> 05:04:30,078
SPEAKER_1:  I just...

05:04:30,530 --> 05:04:32,478
SPEAKER_1:  That saddens me, because I wanna know!

05:04:32,802 --> 05:04:34,430
SPEAKER_1:  And it's awesome, it's a great vehicle.

05:04:35,490 --> 05:04:36,030
SPEAKER_0:  War.

05:04:36,322 --> 05:04:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  What is it good for?

05:04:38,370 --> 05:04:46,206
SPEAKER_0:  You mentioned Kerbal Space Program, the video game. Someone asked you what video game you recommend for learning about space and rockets and you said...

05:04:47,234 --> 05:04:47,678
SPEAKER_0:  Duh.

05:04:47,938 --> 05:04:51,806
SPEAKER_0:  Kerbal Space Program. So tell me about this game. What is this game?

05:04:52,066 --> 05:04:53,310
SPEAKER_0:  And I also saw...

05:04:53,634 --> 05:04:54,046
SPEAKER_0:  heard.

05:04:54,722 --> 05:04:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  second one is coming out.

05:04:56,258 --> 05:04:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  So what? This is your Watch...

05:04:59,330 --> 05:05:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, you know, I've been playing more games recently.

05:05:02,338 --> 05:05:02,942
SPEAKER_0:  uh... cuz

05:05:03,170 --> 05:05:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  Games are fun and they remind you.

05:05:06,050 --> 05:05:07,070
SPEAKER_0:  That life is awesome.

05:05:07,650 --> 05:05:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  uh

05:05:08,354 --> 05:05:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  So.

05:05:08,962 --> 05:05:11,614
SPEAKER_0:  Why should I play this game? If you want to learn about.

05:05:11,778 --> 05:05:16,126
SPEAKER_1:  rockets, how to fly, how to build, how to get into orbit, how to get to other planets.

05:05:16,802 --> 05:05:19,847
SPEAKER_1:  There's no better way to learn about rockets.

05:05:19,847 --> 05:05:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  What does it entail? Like, do you actually like-

05:05:22,754 --> 05:05:24,446
SPEAKER_1:  It's like SimCity.

05:05:24,706 --> 05:05:26,174
SPEAKER_1:  and Microsoft Flight Simulator.

05:05:26,530 --> 05:05:27,198
SPEAKER_1:  for rockets.

05:05:27,490 --> 05:05:29,310
SPEAKER_0:  Oh interesting, so you will get to like...

05:05:29,890 --> 05:05:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  Would you design rockets? Yeah?

05:05:33,218 --> 05:05:33,566
SPEAKER_1:  It's.

05:05:33,858 --> 05:05:37,758
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so I started playing it in like 2014, I think around...

05:05:38,050 --> 05:05:43,966
SPEAKER_1:  as I'm like falling in love with space. And I became obsessed with this game. Like literally you, you know, you.

05:05:44,418 --> 05:05:44,958
SPEAKER_1:  You, you.

05:05:45,282 --> 05:05:53,790
SPEAKER_1:  Take a look at the get a little command module. Click you click on a fuel tank. Boop you choose your engine. Boop you choose a stage connector. Boop you connect more tanks and build these.

05:05:54,402 --> 05:05:58,046
SPEAKER_1:  space planes and fantastical things and it's all like physics based.

05:05:58,370 --> 05:05:59,934
SPEAKER_1:  It's a fail. This sounds like a commercial.

05:06:00,226 --> 05:06:06,718
SPEAKER_1:  It's available on PC and Mac and console. It's available everywhere. But wait, there's more. And you can send me a message there and there should be next time

05:06:06,946 --> 05:06:11,821
SPEAKER_0:  You said like you streamed yourself playing this. Are those any of those videos up? Oh yeah.

05:06:11,821 --> 05:06:18,366
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, yeah, there's some of my, actually the first videos I ever uploaded to YouTube were recaptured streams from Twitch.

05:06:18,658 --> 05:06:19,518
SPEAKER_1:  that are just physically.

05:06:19,778 --> 05:06:21,438
SPEAKER_0:  uploaded to YouTube. This is awesome.

05:06:21,762 --> 05:06:26,206
SPEAKER_1:  And so it's me playing. We I see this kind of like a podcast style thing.

05:06:26,626 --> 05:06:29,182
SPEAKER_1:  I should get back into this because it's one of my favorite things I ever did. It's called-

05:06:29,602 --> 05:06:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  We called it today-ish in space flight history, but these days that probably just-

05:06:33,250 --> 05:06:35,678
SPEAKER_1:  play Kerbal, but I had my friend come sit next to me.

05:06:35,906 --> 05:06:36,702
SPEAKER_1:  His name's Jacob.

05:06:37,506 --> 05:06:37,950
SPEAKER_1:  and

05:06:38,402 --> 05:06:40,734
SPEAKER_1:  He is a former professional pole vaulter.

05:06:41,154 --> 05:06:42,142
SPEAKER_1:  Just this really.

05:06:42,530 --> 05:06:47,742
SPEAKER_1:  knows nothing about rockets, knows nothing about space, hilarious, like in the sweetest-

05:06:48,258 --> 05:06:52,382
SPEAKER_1:  most fun way he, you know, as an adult asked me which is bigger the earth or the moon?

05:06:53,026 --> 05:06:56,862
SPEAKER_1:  And I love that for him, you know, that's fantastic. He's just a delightful human.

05:06:57,314 --> 05:06:58,174
SPEAKER_1:  He would sit next to me.

05:06:58,466 --> 05:07:08,094
SPEAKER_1:  we would recreate a historical space flight mission in Kerbal Space Program. And he would just sit there and play guitar and sing about what I'm like doing and asking questions. And it's still one of my favorite things I've ever done.

05:07:08,354 --> 05:07:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, you should definitely do something like that. So basically

05:07:11,266 --> 05:07:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  Just, yeah.

05:07:13,250 --> 05:07:14,375
SPEAKER_0:  Shoot the shit with a friend.

05:07:14,375 --> 05:07:17,566
SPEAKER_1:  Get their curiosity going, let them just sit there and ask questions.

05:07:18,114 --> 05:07:19,102
SPEAKER_1:  It was awesome, like.

05:07:19,746 --> 05:07:20,158
SPEAKER_1:  I mean it.

05:07:20,610 --> 05:07:20,926
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

05:07:21,154 --> 05:07:25,694
SPEAKER_1:  Those are some, I've done it a handful of times. I think we probably did like 20 or 30 episodes or something in this.

05:07:26,178 --> 05:07:28,190
SPEAKER_1:  It's definitely something I would like to get back to doing.

05:07:28,418 --> 05:07:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  Can you in the game go to the moon?

05:07:31,522 --> 05:07:37,150
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so it's technically a different solar system. It's the Kerbal system and you're on the planet Kerbin.

05:07:37,474 --> 05:07:38,430
SPEAKER_1:  So there's the Mun.

05:07:38,882 --> 05:07:41,246
SPEAKER_1:  M-U-N. There's a second moon.

05:07:41,506 --> 05:07:43,518
SPEAKER_1:  in the system on this planet.

05:07:43,810 --> 05:07:44,926
SPEAKER_1:  It's called MinMess.

05:07:45,250 --> 05:07:47,875
SPEAKER_0:  They didn't want to pay licensing fees or what?

05:07:47,875 --> 05:07:52,350
SPEAKER_1:  Well, it's just a little easier. It's a little bit smaller, so the physics are easier.

05:07:52,770 --> 05:07:53,895
SPEAKER_1:  Also tries to

05:07:53,895 --> 05:07:54,645
SPEAKER_0:  be consistent.

05:07:54,645 --> 05:07:55,774
SPEAKER_1:  physics. Yeah, oh yeah.

05:07:56,002 --> 05:07:58,270
SPEAKER_1:  The physics are all real world.

05:07:58,594 --> 05:08:00,830
SPEAKER_1:  physics and I mean there's aero simulations there's

05:08:01,314 --> 05:08:01,854
SPEAKER_1:  All of its-

05:08:02,178 --> 05:08:08,350
SPEAKER_1:  like one-to-one, you know, for Earth physics. It's just on an easier scale, solar system. So it's easier.

05:08:08,898 --> 05:08:12,638
SPEAKER_1:  to navigate, but there's still like, there's a planet called Eve that's kind of like Venus.

05:08:13,090 --> 05:08:16,030
SPEAKER_1:  So it has a really thick atmosphere, really thick, really soupy.

05:08:16,450 --> 05:08:20,670
SPEAKER_1:  It's a lot more gravity, so it's just really, really hard to get off of.

05:08:21,218 --> 05:08:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  It's relatively easy to land on Eve, but that's kind of like the ultimate boss in the game, is getting off of Eve. So that's one of my favorite things to do.

05:08:28,546 --> 05:08:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  is build these crafts to get to Eve and try to return home.

05:08:32,546 --> 05:08:36,990
SPEAKER_0:  You mentioned that there's almost like a podcast thing. You also did our Ludacris feature.

05:08:37,634 --> 05:08:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  What, uh...

05:08:39,458 --> 05:08:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  Is there a podcast in the future? Are you thinking, do you enjoy the media? You're so incredibly good at talking.

05:08:45,442 --> 05:08:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  It's less effort to...

05:08:48,930 --> 05:08:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  sort of to produce. Is that something in the back of your mind also?

05:08:53,442 --> 05:08:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  Ah man.

05:08:54,498 --> 05:08:55,742
SPEAKER_1:  I love.

05:08:56,418 --> 05:08:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  talking. Yeah, you're very good at it. I mean, yeah.

05:08:59,682 --> 05:09:00,542
SPEAKER_1:  Um, I.

05:09:01,346 --> 05:09:02,398
SPEAKER_1:  I find...

05:09:02,850 --> 05:09:03,326
SPEAKER_1:  DRIVE

05:09:03,778 --> 05:09:04,190
SPEAKER_1:  It's just.

05:09:04,578 --> 05:09:05,566
SPEAKER_1:  The problem with for me is.

05:09:06,146 --> 05:09:08,222
SPEAKER_1:  podcast and I guess the podcasts that I've done.

05:09:09,122 --> 05:09:11,838
SPEAKER_1:  tried to be relatively topical about like the current spaceflight.

05:09:12,162 --> 05:09:12,734
SPEAKER_1:  Affairs.

05:09:13,346 --> 05:09:13,758
SPEAKER_1:  and

05:09:14,018 --> 05:09:14,462
SPEAKER_1:  See ya.

05:09:14,786 --> 05:09:16,606
SPEAKER_1:  three or four years ago, that was actually.

05:09:17,218 --> 05:09:20,414
SPEAKER_1:  you know, manageable for me to keep up with these days.

05:09:20,738 --> 05:09:21,566
SPEAKER_1:  Man, I can't.

05:09:23,042 --> 05:09:24,062
SPEAKER_1:  just can't keep up with it.

05:09:24,322 --> 05:09:26,974
SPEAKER_1:  I gave up on trying to be super topical and I realized.

05:09:27,426 --> 05:09:28,446
SPEAKER_1:  that maybe my...

05:09:28,834 --> 05:09:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  biggest talent and the things that resonate most with people is

05:09:32,290 --> 05:09:37,662
SPEAKER_1:  just trying to explain the basics and the root. So I'm really just trying to like.

05:09:39,138 --> 05:09:45,374
SPEAKER_1:  I'm trying to do less live streams if I can, but then again, like, Starship, I gotta stream that. There's no way I'm not gonna do that.

05:09:45,666 --> 05:09:49,950
SPEAKER_1:  but I'm really just trying to get back to making the deep dive videos where I have no

05:09:50,338 --> 05:09:54,463
SPEAKER_1:  limit on how long and how deep and just really go for it. Because that's actually what I love to do.

05:09:54,463 --> 05:09:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I mean, that's like, uh, views aside.

05:09:58,018 --> 05:10:02,526
SPEAKER_0:  Those are just works of genius and you're getting better and better at them. And like that's the.

05:10:04,706 --> 05:10:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of the beautiful things you can create in this world, those are that. So like if you continue, especially where the way space travel is developing.

05:10:13,186 --> 05:10:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  Like that, your voice is very much needed.

05:10:15,810 --> 05:10:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's wise to...

05:10:18,818 --> 05:10:20,286
SPEAKER_0:  to do what you do best.

05:10:20,738 --> 05:10:29,150
SPEAKER_1:  And I think I'm feeling more and more, especially this last year, I did a lot of like live streaming and traveling back and forth between Florida and California and here. And just.

05:10:29,506 --> 05:10:32,158
SPEAKER_1:  handling major like big live streams.

05:10:32,578 --> 05:10:34,814
SPEAKER_1:  really stressed myself out and at the end of the day I was like

05:10:35,138 --> 05:10:37,758
SPEAKER_1:  All of this is taking away from my ability to make videos.

05:10:38,146 --> 05:10:45,246
SPEAKER_1:  And that's ideally, honestly, if I had my choice of things, I would just ignore everything else and just sit and lock myself in a-

05:10:45,858 --> 05:10:46,270
SPEAKER_1:  and

05:10:47,010 --> 05:10:50,910
SPEAKER_1:  in my house for a year and just sit there and make videos and go and travel every...

05:10:51,138 --> 05:10:54,142
SPEAKER_1:  every other month, you know, for fun, like not for space stuff.

05:10:54,562 --> 05:10:57,950
SPEAKER_1:  just go and do some light traveling, you know, some.

05:10:58,146 --> 05:10:59,742
SPEAKER_0:  Like around the moon or what?

05:11:00,546 --> 05:11:02,014
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, just some light traveling.

05:11:03,394 --> 05:11:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  What advice?

05:11:04,898 --> 05:11:09,214
SPEAKER_0:  you would you give the young folks are just folks struggling to find.

05:11:09,730 --> 05:11:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  their way in life, whether they're in high school, college, or beyond.

05:11:13,570 --> 05:11:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  I kind of have a life that can be proud of.

05:11:15,810 --> 05:11:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  to have a career they can be proud of. You've had a-

05:11:18,498 --> 05:11:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  Really interesting journey yourself.

05:11:20,962 --> 05:11:22,558
SPEAKER_0:  What from that can you draw?

05:11:23,682 --> 05:11:25,246
SPEAKER_0:  Give good advice to others.

05:11:25,794 --> 05:11:27,166
SPEAKER_1:  To be honest, I feel like...

05:11:27,458 --> 05:11:28,318
SPEAKER_1:  It's so...

05:11:28,802 --> 05:11:35,646
SPEAKER_1:  painfully obvious to follow your heart and follow what makes you happy that I'm just shocked that people allow themselves.

05:11:36,482 --> 05:11:41,310
SPEAKER_1:  to sit on like mediocrity, you know, like to just sit there and be like, well, this is just what I do. Wait on some and...

05:11:41,538 --> 05:11:43,294
SPEAKER_1:  for a lot of people that's perfectly fine. Like I have.

05:11:44,034 --> 05:11:45,214
SPEAKER_1:  some of my best friends are.

05:11:45,730 --> 05:11:49,598
SPEAKER_1:  They're clocking in and out and they're perfectly happy. They have a wonderful life. Absolutely no judgment there, of course.

05:11:50,242 --> 05:11:50,590
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

05:11:51,202 --> 05:11:51,518
SPEAKER_1:  but.

05:11:52,322 --> 05:11:54,174
SPEAKER_1:  for people that are stuck feeling like they're.

05:11:54,658 --> 05:11:55,742
SPEAKER_1:  not sure if you know.

05:11:56,162 --> 05:11:57,374
SPEAKER_1:  what's next and how to.

05:11:57,826 --> 05:11:58,846
SPEAKER_1:  bring light into their world.

05:11:59,330 --> 05:12:05,342
SPEAKER_1:  You really just gotta listen to like what does make you happy, you know, people feel guilty about I play video games for eight hours

05:12:05,698 --> 05:12:07,518
SPEAKER_1:  then start learning how to make a video game.

05:12:08,034 --> 05:12:09,854
SPEAKER_1:  Learn how to do reviews of video games or make

05:12:10,370 --> 05:12:16,510
SPEAKER_1:  There's so many, you can work in the video game industry. You don't have to isolate your love from your work.

05:12:17,250 --> 05:12:19,870
SPEAKER_1:  It's just funny that we, you know, maybe.

05:12:20,418 --> 05:12:31,543
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe you feel guilty that you drink too much. Okay, I don't know if this is a good advice. Go learn how to make alcohol. Start a liquor company. Yeah, start a liquor company. But, yeah, make sure you make a perguntt.

05:12:31,543 --> 05:12:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  So it's great advice, but it's also in your own story. It seems like you've almost stumbled on

05:12:37,090 --> 05:12:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  Like.

05:12:38,434 --> 05:12:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  Some of it is just exploration and keeping your mind and heart open.

05:12:42,786 --> 05:12:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  discovering that thing that grabs you.

05:12:44,898 --> 05:12:46,686
SPEAKER_1:  What are you fall asleep thinking about?

05:12:47,170 --> 05:12:47,742
SPEAKER_1:  You know, like...

05:12:48,034 --> 05:12:49,159
SPEAKER_1:  But you stumbled on-

05:12:49,159 --> 05:12:51,006
SPEAKER_0:  the space almost accidentally, right?

05:12:51,234 --> 05:12:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  Any?

05:12:52,002 --> 05:12:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, yeah, I get the good deal would you when you were doing up being a professional photographer, would you have known?

05:12:58,050 --> 05:12:58,526
SPEAKER_0:  Oh no.

05:12:59,074 --> 05:13:01,598
SPEAKER_1:  Do you want to know what I wanted to be when I was a kid?

05:13:02,050 --> 05:13:05,054
SPEAKER_1:  Well, first when I was young, I wanted to be a tractor. I'm not quite sure I understood.

05:13:05,154 --> 05:13:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

05:13:05,954 --> 05:13:06,590
SPEAKER_1:  how that works.

05:13:07,138 --> 05:13:08,670
SPEAKER_1:  then I wanted to be a scorpion trainer.

05:13:09,538 --> 05:13:12,638
SPEAKER_1:  Thought I could train them to cut people's lawns. Better and better. Yep.

05:13:13,218 --> 05:13:16,593
SPEAKER_1:  And then honestly, the majority of my childhood was long. Got it.

05:13:16,593 --> 05:13:19,390
SPEAKER_0:  I think your understanding of physics early on was just a little.

05:13:20,098 --> 05:13:21,223
SPEAKER_0:  The Pintures, man.

05:13:21,223 --> 05:13:23,774
SPEAKER_1:  Get it off. Ahh.

05:13:24,066 --> 05:13:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  from like probably six until like early college, I wanted to be a prosthetic engineer.

05:13:29,218 --> 05:13:29,662
SPEAKER_1:  and

05:13:30,082 --> 05:13:31,646
SPEAKER_1:  Never once did I think about.

05:13:32,546 --> 05:13:35,198
SPEAKER_1:  anything rockets really. You know, I had like a.

05:13:35,650 --> 05:13:38,750
SPEAKER_1:  I had like a space shuttle poster, I had some space shuttle Legos.

05:13:39,170 --> 05:13:43,230
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I liked space and you know, I knew of the space shuttle, but.

05:13:43,554 --> 05:13:44,222
SPEAKER_1:  You know, is it?

05:13:44,514 --> 05:13:46,174
SPEAKER_1:  Far down the list as far as.

05:13:46,530 --> 05:13:47,422
SPEAKER_1:  Things that I thought were cool.

05:13:48,610 --> 05:13:49,566
SPEAKER_1:  Ninja Turtles.

05:13:49,890 --> 05:13:51,198
SPEAKER_1:  Lamborghini Countach.

05:13:51,938 --> 05:13:53,630
SPEAKER_1:  B-17G Flying Fortress.

05:13:54,146 --> 05:13:55,271
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I guess, I guess that.

05:13:55,271 --> 05:14:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  That means if you just keep your heart open to falling in love with an idea, with a passion, yeah. You could start from that, from Ninja Turtles and Scorpions and lawn.

05:14:05,314 --> 05:14:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  to a being.

05:14:07,394 --> 05:14:10,654
SPEAKER_0:  one of the best, one of the top educators.

05:14:10,946 --> 05:14:12,926
SPEAKER_0:  inspirational figures in space.

05:14:13,570 --> 05:14:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  and actually traveling around the moon. And who knows maybe one day stepping foot on the moon and

05:14:19,170 --> 05:14:21,022
