SPEAKER_0:  podcast.

00:00:11,394 --> 00:00:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  Based off of our connection.

00:00:13,218 --> 00:00:14,814
SPEAKER_0:  and just you being a friend.

00:00:15,234 --> 00:00:16,798
SPEAKER_0:  I need to show you.

00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  my two tech companies and get your perspective on it.

00:00:21,762 --> 00:00:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  because now I have friends that can give perspective.

00:00:24,098 --> 00:00:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  When I would work on albums, I had other friends that worked on albums and they would give me their perspectives on it.

00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:29,502
SPEAKER_0:  You wanna do this?

00:00:30,146 --> 00:00:33,630
SPEAKER_0:  If we are doing it, this is part of it. This is part of it? Absolutely. Yep.

00:00:34,114 --> 00:00:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  I wanted to finish the thing is, okay, you're going to ask me different questions.

00:00:38,274 --> 00:00:43,518
SPEAKER_0:  but I'm about growing and building and bringing the idea to life. So when I see you, I say.

00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  Oh this guy understands.

00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  how to hire engineers.

00:00:48,066 --> 00:00:49,246
SPEAKER_0:  Where I'm coming from.

00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  coming from Hollywood, coming from press, coming from media.

00:00:52,994 --> 00:00:59,966
SPEAKER_0:  all of the guys, you know, that so many of the guys that have been like voices and faces and talking heads, whatever.

00:01:00,354 --> 00:01:03,102
SPEAKER_0:  have not understood how to engineer.

00:01:03,394 --> 00:01:05,918
SPEAKER_0:  product and that's the reason why I was able to jump past

00:01:06,178 --> 00:01:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  everyone in the entertainment field and become

00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:01:10,114 --> 00:01:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  You know, whatever the net worth is 11 billion. I'm going to stop putting the whole black.

00:01:13,922 --> 00:01:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  thing on my work.

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  Let's just see where I am.

00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  on the scale of life because that's a cop out for me to say Rich is Black Guy.

00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  of all time because that's feeding into the same.

00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,406
SPEAKER_0:  you know, trauma economy that Black Lives Matter feeds into.

00:01:29,762 --> 00:01:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  That's why I love and respect engineers.

00:01:32,514 --> 00:01:35,582
SPEAKER_0:  That's the only thing that we really need to teach.

00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  in school is engineering.

00:01:37,602 --> 00:01:39,230
SPEAKER_0:  We don't need to teach history.

00:01:39,714 --> 00:01:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  We don't need to teach anything.

00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:42,846
SPEAKER_0:  that is subjective.

00:01:43,426 --> 00:01:47,038
SPEAKER_0:  It needs to only be engineering taught in school.

00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  and everything else needs to be recessed.

00:01:49,858 --> 00:01:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  Nothing at all. Any force.

00:01:52,482 --> 00:01:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  subjective information is just to weaken and indoctrinate.

00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  our species. And that's what schools do now.

00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,006
SPEAKER_1:  As an engineer, I love hearing you say that, but to push back...

00:02:03,618 --> 00:02:04,638
SPEAKER_1:  History is not

00:02:05,538 --> 00:02:09,182
SPEAKER_1:  interpretation is you might be subjective but history has some facts

00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,422
SPEAKER_1:  and they're useful to give a grounding.

00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,958
SPEAKER_1:  to the way you do engineering.

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  I don't 100% believe in anything, any concept of the future or any concept of history.

00:02:20,258 --> 00:02:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  because history was just written by the victors.

00:02:22,914 --> 00:02:28,798
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, that's so if I see stuff happen on the day that later that day is reported wrong

00:02:29,314 --> 00:02:32,190
SPEAKER_0:  So how wrong is something reported a thousand years ago?

00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,614
SPEAKER_0:  And why would we argue about something that's not?

00:02:36,098 --> 00:02:36,830
SPEAKER_0:  in the now.

00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,718
SPEAKER_0:  because that's the only thing that...

00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  everyone can agree upon is that it is now.

00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  right now.

00:02:43,202 --> 00:02:45,758
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. You try not to make the mistakes of the past.

00:02:46,306 --> 00:02:48,931
SPEAKER_1:  That's the usefulness of history, the limited usefulness of history.

00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:52,894
SPEAKER_0:  The biggest mistake from the past that we keep making is looking at the past.

00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,078
SPEAKER_1:  too much.

00:02:54,338 --> 00:02:55,774
SPEAKER_1:  giving too much value to the past.

00:02:56,162 --> 00:02:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  Too much value to the past, we are now.

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,990
SPEAKER_0:  We are now, we are here, we are one species.

00:03:01,346 --> 00:03:02,366
SPEAKER_0:  We are one race.

00:03:03,362 --> 00:03:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  We're here.

00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:08,286
SPEAKER_0:  It's time and the leadership is changing.

00:03:08,642 --> 00:03:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  because you have Elon.

00:03:10,562 --> 00:03:13,630
SPEAKER_0:  as a leader, yay, as a leader, and we're the top leaders.

00:03:14,178 --> 00:03:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  We're more influential than the presidents.

00:03:16,802 --> 00:03:17,854
SPEAKER_1:  See your human being.

00:03:19,522 --> 00:03:23,646
SPEAKER_1:  with the engineering challenges before you, with a stem player, with parlor.

00:03:24,674 --> 00:03:26,549
SPEAKER_1:  What's the hardest thing in front of you on the engineer?

00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  That's the first sentence.

00:03:28,738 --> 00:03:29,406
SPEAKER_0:  that any

00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:31,358
SPEAKER_0:  of our species needs to hear.

00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,254
SPEAKER_0:  when they're born.

00:03:32,994 --> 00:03:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  You are a human being when engineering.

00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:37,310
SPEAKER_0:  challenges and I considered.

00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  consider challenges to be opportunities in front of you. Literally, like, let me see a piece of paper, I need to write that down. That's the beginning of our new species constitution.

00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:48,606
SPEAKER_0:

SPEAKER_0:  Top Rider and Humor Exist and we know who it is. That's a-

00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:04,190
SPEAKER_1:  objective.

00:05:04,482 --> 00:05:08,222
SPEAKER_0:  Who's that? It's factual though. It's like, okay, who's the top person in tech?

00:05:08,514 --> 00:05:08,990
SPEAKER_0:  History.

00:05:09,762 --> 00:05:10,686
SPEAKER_0:  It's not subjective.

00:05:11,842 --> 00:05:15,134
SPEAKER_0:  Wow. A non subjective answer.

00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  to both of those.

00:05:17,346 --> 00:05:18,462
SPEAKER_0:  Both of those people.

00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:19,870
SPEAKER_0:  have influence.

00:05:20,802 --> 00:05:21,790
SPEAKER_0:  30%.

00:05:22,626 --> 00:05:23,751
SPEAKER_0:  of our existence.

00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:26,494
SPEAKER_1:  The influence is the main metric. Am i forgetting in time?

00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:29,118
SPEAKER_0:  of greatness. Okay, one person. Yeah.

00:05:29,378 --> 00:05:34,750
SPEAKER_0:  30% of our language was the English language was written by them. The other person 30% of the products we use.

00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:35,838
SPEAKER_0:  was led by them.

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,895
SPEAKER_0:  So, it's time.

00:05:37,895 --> 00:05:42,558
SPEAKER_1:  language room Shakespeare and it was then the product product product product

00:05:43,714 --> 00:05:44,478
SPEAKER_1:  Steve Jobs.

00:05:46,338 --> 00:05:48,734
SPEAKER_1:  You put Steve above like Elans of the world.

00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,038
SPEAKER_1:  cause Steve is a designer, not.

00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:55,614
SPEAKER_1:  He's a designer engineer, but he's a designer, he's a visionary in the design space.

00:05:55,874 --> 00:05:59,249
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I would lean to him because I'm not an engineer, right? Some more like then you're in a

00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:01,918
SPEAKER_1:  If Steve is an engineer, you're an engineer.

00:06:02,306 --> 00:06:03,134
SPEAKER_1:  Essentially.

00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:04,158
SPEAKER_0:  He's a cultural.

00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:10,654
SPEAKER_0:  engineer, like the people who run the emotions of the world and run the world off of people's emotions right now are.

00:06:11,234 --> 00:06:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  Social Engineers.

00:06:12,994 --> 00:06:15,134
SPEAKER_0:  And social engineering is so important. Like—

00:06:15,426 --> 00:06:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  like, um, city design. There's a fancier word for that.

00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,926
SPEAKER_0:  Um, but I was.

00:06:21,442 --> 00:06:22,078
SPEAKER_0:  Oh.

00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,694
SPEAKER_0:  I was in Oxnard last night to see Anthony Jeselnik.

00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  and I gotta find out what his opening joke was.

00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  because I'm doing interviews and I'm thinking I'm funny?

00:06:33,122 --> 00:06:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  And I like that he said, he just kept on saying, 20 year anniversary, I've been doing this for 20 years.

00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  and his opening joke.

00:06:41,058 --> 00:06:43,038
SPEAKER_0:  was so high level.

00:06:43,426 --> 00:06:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  I realized that I wasn't funny.

00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:48,350
SPEAKER_0:  I realized that this dude is a professional.

00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  at what he does and so many things are subjective. I always talk about this is like.

00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  You know, people are arguing like, is Emily Ratajkowski the hottest?

00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:58,718
SPEAKER_0:  you know, person and I'm like.

00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  That's such a subjective.

00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  But like if you go and shoot three-pointers with Steph Curry, it's not

00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  subjective.

00:07:08,418 --> 00:07:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  Right. Or if you go and compare bank accounts with Elon, it's not.

00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  subjective.

00:07:13,986 --> 00:07:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  And another thing that's not subjective.

00:07:16,418 --> 00:07:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  Porn.

00:07:18,626 --> 00:07:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  What about it?

00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  Dick size.

00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,398
SPEAKER_0:  It's not subjective, you can measure.

00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  P cinecom rejects the Shop Novel

00:07:24,674 --> 00:07:27,486
SPEAKER_1:  but porn is more about more.

00:07:28,098 --> 00:07:33,470
SPEAKER_1:  than just dick size and greatness is more than the size of the bank account, right?

00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:34,919
SPEAKER_1:  So there's a subject.

00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,254
SPEAKER_0:  Greatness is subjective though.

00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:37,246
SPEAKER_1:  Right.

00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:38,302
SPEAKER_1:  So you do.

00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,094
SPEAKER_1:  Do you care about the stuff?

00:07:41,282 --> 00:07:43,070
SPEAKER_1:  that's objective or subjective more.

00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,878
SPEAKER_1:  Because greatness to me is what matters.

00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,894
SPEAKER_1:  bank account comes and goes.

00:07:50,338 --> 00:07:51,326
SPEAKER_1:  The Impact.

00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:56,542
SPEAKER_1:  on our society, like you said, social engineering, the impact on the collective intelligence of our species.

00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,134
SPEAKER_1:  that what's permeates throughout.

00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:00,487
SPEAKER_1:  rest of time.

SPEAKER_0:  Well now...

00:13:44,162 --> 00:13:46,686

SPEAKER_0:  where Nikolai Tesla was...

00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  later into his...

00:13:53,154 --> 00:13:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  career where it wasn't about.

00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  being loved, it wasn't about sitting at the...

00:13:57,826 --> 00:14:01,630
SPEAKER_0:  dinner parties next to Anna Wintour and stuff. It was...

00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,966
SPEAKER_0:  about getting the idea across.

00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:05,726

SPEAKER_0:  Anointing it isn't just sci-fi what he's doing.

00:14:19,746 --> 00:14:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  There's something in there, just like George Lucas.

00:14:24,034 --> 00:14:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  There's something different that's there.

00:14:28,898 --> 00:14:29,502
SPEAKER_0:  So...

00:14:30,978 --> 00:14:31,614

SPEAKER_0:  Okay, let's do like.

00:14:45,122 --> 00:14:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  I don't like talking about money because it's like...

00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  Man-made money up anyway, it's like four quadrillion

00:14:51,394 --> 00:14:52,318

00:14:52,546 --> 00:14:55,294

00:14:59,682 --> 00:15:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  Drawing.

00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  and it's at a pretty good place.

00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  Now...

00:15:05,794 --> 00:15:06,334

00:15:14,018 --> 00:15:16,414

SPEAKER_0:  I'm just draw a person here for scale.

00:15:21,026 --> 00:15:21,694
SPEAKER_1:  Uh....

00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:22,846
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, that would help.

00:15:25,954 --> 00:15:28,670
SPEAKER_0:  What do you think of that? Look at my purse and see the scale in this room.

00:15:29,826 --> 00:15:31,070
SPEAKER_0:  All right, so.

00:15:32,162 --> 00:15:33,287

SPEAKER_0:  I'm saying it's 40,000 square feet.

00:15:38,114 --> 00:15:39,239
SPEAKER_0:  But that would be like.

00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:39,989
SPEAKER_1:  and the,

00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  cell.

00:15:41,378 --> 00:15:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, so it's a screen. It doesn't go all the way to the top and it's one.

00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:47,390
SPEAKER_0:  Hole for light.

00:15:47,682 --> 00:15:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  but the water and the light and air all come in from the top. So that's like...

00:15:52,738 --> 00:15:53,598
SPEAKER_0:  Like the mouth.

00:15:54,082 --> 00:15:56,030
SPEAKER_0:  And then this is the belly button.

00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:59,614

00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,662

00:19:22,498 --> 00:19:29,310
SPEAKER_0:  You know, and Trump where they try to say that when they say their truths out loud, that it's inciting violence. So let's be like really clear.

00:19:29,858 --> 00:19:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  I'm saying that.

00:19:31,874 --> 00:19:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  they have criminalized free thought.

00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  You know, they, I hate when people use they, like they gets to blame for everything, right? It's always they. Who the fuck is they? Exactly.

00:19:43,522 --> 00:19:45,086
SPEAKER_1:  I promise they's us.

00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, I love that. What we needed to do is turn I to we.

00:19:50,818 --> 00:19:53,406
SPEAKER_0:  So we take the responsibility and turn they.

00:19:53,698 --> 00:19:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  to us.

00:19:54,722 --> 00:19:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  So we take.

00:19:55,938 --> 00:19:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  accountability.

00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,398
SPEAKER_0:  to us.

00:19:59,778 --> 00:20:02,046
SPEAKER_0:  They to I to we and they to us.

00:20:02,818 --> 00:20:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  And that relates, it's a language at the same time. We've seen the language.

00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,190
SPEAKER_0:  of our surroundings.

00:20:08,546 --> 00:20:09,790
SPEAKER_0:  You're seeing the language.

00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:10,846
SPEAKER_0:  of

00:20:11,682 --> 00:20:14,718
SPEAKER_0:  One of the things, okay, let's go back to the sale explanation because...

00:20:15,266 --> 00:20:16,190
SPEAKER_0:  I'm also.

00:20:16,642 --> 00:20:22,398
SPEAKER_0:  doing. What's that thing when Elon just put all the information in the open and people could figure out they could figure it out and

00:20:22,914 --> 00:20:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  Open source. Yeah, open source. So I'm open sourcing this idea right now.

00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:27,838
SPEAKER_0:  so that.

00:20:28,162 --> 00:20:28,734
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

00:20:29,634 --> 00:20:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  engineers and anointed.

00:20:32,226 --> 00:20:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  people.

00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  beings, anointed beings can collectively contribute to this.

00:20:38,658 --> 00:20:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  to push our species forward.

00:20:40,802 --> 00:20:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:20:41,986 --> 00:20:42,526
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:20:43,234 --> 00:20:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  Where I've got to with my research is that there would be a hole at the top.

00:20:48,258 --> 00:20:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  that allows natural light.

00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  Natural Air.

00:20:52,738 --> 00:20:53,502
SPEAKER_0:  And there's...

00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  A constant

00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:59,742
SPEAKER_0:  water system so it becomes like a water city where it's a constant flow.

00:21:00,002 --> 00:21:03,358
SPEAKER_0:  that's not, it's regenerative, it's not wasting the water.

00:21:03,586 --> 00:21:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  and it's just a constant flow. So I put the toilet.

00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  really close to wear this.

00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  this

00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:14,782
SPEAKER_0:  Um, I don't want to call it a wave pool, but in the pool the water is not still.

00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:16,574
SPEAKER_1:  So that exists in...

00:21:17,186 --> 00:21:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  and water.

00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:23,550
SPEAKER_0:  surrounded by water. Well, the living room is that you have two rooms. You have the dry room.

00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  which people would call the living room before.

00:21:26,338 --> 00:21:27,998
SPEAKER_0:  and then you have the wet room.

00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  How is that a source of happiness?

00:21:33,698 --> 00:21:42,889
SPEAKER_1:  What is broken about our world today that that gives you in terms of the pursuit of happiness which is one of the things all of our previous declaration

00:21:42,889 --> 00:21:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  All of our buildings are based on just

00:21:47,618 --> 00:21:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  the industry and the economy.

00:21:49,858 --> 00:21:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  and then people lean into...

00:21:52,322 --> 00:21:53,502
SPEAKER_0:  what people are used to seeing.

00:21:54,626 --> 00:21:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  And like.

00:21:56,674 --> 00:21:59,326
SPEAKER_0:  what we think is attractive, because then you go back to...

00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:00,926
SPEAKER_0:  The

00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:02,014
SPEAKER_0:  You know...

00:22:02,306 --> 00:22:03,934
SPEAKER_0:  Women who give life.

00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  So everyone wants to.

00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:08,286
SPEAKER_0:  Be attractive.

00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,070
SPEAKER_0:  to the attractive.

00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,278
SPEAKER_0:  And that's the reason why.

00:22:13,762 --> 00:22:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  The Media.

00:22:15,426 --> 00:22:16,574
SPEAKER_0:  GOES AND GETS.

00:22:16,898 --> 00:22:18,366
SPEAKER_0:  You know, Bella Hadid.

00:22:18,978 --> 00:22:20,286
SPEAKER_0:  Kim Kardashian.

00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  Emily Ratajkowski

00:22:24,354 --> 00:22:24,862
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

00:22:27,682 --> 00:22:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  Those are the only ones I'm gonna...

00:22:29,762 --> 00:22:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  Is this more?

00:22:30,914 --> 00:22:38,686
SPEAKER_0:  There's more, but I'm thinking of ones that I think are attractive. It is subjective. Yeah, because it's subjective. So to my subjective, which I think-

00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

00:22:40,546 --> 00:22:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  the only guys that could argue with me on

00:22:45,218 --> 00:22:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  Um, my opinion?

00:22:46,978 --> 00:22:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  on girls who beat Brad and Leo.

00:22:49,698 --> 00:22:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  because we're the only ones with the track record.

00:22:52,642 --> 00:22:57,022
SPEAKER_0:  Everything else. So for everybody else, it's subjective. We've got history.

00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:00,030
SPEAKER_0:  Are you happy?

00:23:01,378 --> 00:23:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  Absolutely, I'm just here.

00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,702
SPEAKER_0:  It's actually...

00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  It's difficult to make me.

00:23:13,282 --> 00:23:15,678
SPEAKER_0:  Unhappy. Now I can deal with frustrations.

00:23:16,738 --> 00:23:18,814
SPEAKER_0:  But when those frustrations are, it's like...

00:23:20,002 --> 00:23:24,222
SPEAKER_0:  When you've allowed people to be in your life that shouldn't be there

00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  And then they do the thing you knew they were going to do and you're screaming at them but you really need to scream at yourself.

00:23:32,642 --> 00:23:36,606
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so you realize anything that's like anger or frustration.

00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,965
SPEAKER_1:  that's something that's wrong with you then you

00:23:38,965 --> 00:23:39,646
SPEAKER_0:

00:23:41,314 --> 00:23:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

00:23:42,274 --> 00:23:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  Like right now, okay, say I got this pattern cutter that.

00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  I want it.

00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  to remove because I felt like she was.

00:23:51,202 --> 00:23:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  copying our patterns into the computer.

00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:57,246
SPEAKER_0:  and I didn't know why she wanted to do that and I just wanted to do the patterns by hand.

00:23:58,082 --> 00:23:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  and then, you know.

00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:02,174
SPEAKER_1:  You mean like automating the patterns? Is that what you mean?

00:24:02,658 --> 00:24:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  and my head of it, because they just, that's the whole thing, it's like...

00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:11,939
SPEAKER_0:  It's a war of human beings and robots.

00:24:11,939 --> 00:24:17,310
SPEAKER_1:  But that makes it more efficient, right? You don't like the efficiency. You like the creativity of the singular nature of the pattern.

00:24:17,794 --> 00:24:18,846
SPEAKER_1:  I believe that.

00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  the human beings.

00:24:20,642 --> 00:24:27,646
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm saying this to you as a person who makes robots and a person who's friends with Elon. I'm deeply offended right now. Yeah. Well, yeah, I'll let it go.

00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

00:24:28,738 --> 00:24:30,613
SPEAKER_0:  So yeah, I believe that the.

00:24:30,613 --> 00:24:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  Yay hates robots.

00:24:33,122 --> 00:24:34,247
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not gonna put that out there.

00:24:34,247 --> 00:24:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  as a joke.

00:24:35,138 --> 00:24:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  Robots have feelings too. Yeah, yeah, that's right. That was also a joke.

00:24:39,554 --> 00:24:42,782
SPEAKER_1:  Was it would need to clarify that future robots?

00:24:43,138 --> 00:24:44,830
SPEAKER_1:  with the pattern cutter.

00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,390
SPEAKER_1:  the pattern cutter, you don't like that. That had to be.

00:24:47,714 --> 00:24:48,030
SPEAKER_1:  that.

00:24:49,058 --> 00:24:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  You can't have that part of your life.

00:24:51,554 --> 00:24:52,446
SPEAKER_0:  That's not what I'm-

00:24:52,674 --> 00:24:53,790
SPEAKER_0:  Um, my...

00:24:54,498 --> 00:24:57,598
SPEAKER_0:  Everything that I'm doing is for.

00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:02,750
SPEAKER_0:  the sake of.

00:25:03,394 --> 00:25:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  The human race.

00:25:05,954 --> 00:25:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  There's things.

00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:09,118
SPEAKER_0:  In capitalism there's things.

00:25:09,826 --> 00:25:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  and technology.

00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  We'll tech.

00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:14,238

SPEAKER_0:  original human species.

00:25:17,378 --> 00:25:18,302
SPEAKER_0:  can exist.

00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  in a peaceful way.

00:25:23,362 --> 00:25:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  as long as the people that know how to make robots.

00:25:26,402 --> 00:25:29,054
SPEAKER_0:  aren't using their robots to control the humans.

00:25:30,146 --> 00:25:30,590
SPEAKER_0:  Lex

00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:35,230
SPEAKER_1:  definitely something you have to be concerned about as we become more technologically savvy.

00:25:35,554 --> 00:25:39,294
SPEAKER_1:  That, my friend, is why engineering isn't everything.

00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,758
SPEAKER_1:  that you have to desperately

00:25:42,178 --> 00:25:43,678
SPEAKER_1:  study the lessons of history.

00:25:44,226 --> 00:25:45,534
SPEAKER_1:  in Nazi Germany.

00:25:45,954 --> 00:25:47,390
SPEAKER_1:  science was used.

00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,534
SPEAKER_1:  to create atrocities.

00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:53,991
SPEAKER_1:  engineering the same. engineering could be.

00:25:53,991 --> 00:25:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  tool of war.

00:25:55,426 --> 00:25:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  We're still in the Holocaust.

00:25:58,562 --> 00:26:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  A friend, a Jewish friend of mine said.

00:26:03,106 --> 00:26:07,614
SPEAKER_0:  Come go visit the Holocaust Museum. And my response was, let's visit.

00:26:07,906 --> 00:26:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  Our Holocaust Museum Planned Parenthood.

00:26:10,786 --> 00:26:12,094
SPEAKER_1:  With all due respect.

00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:14,526
SPEAKER_1:  I grew up in the Soviet Union.

00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,094
SPEAKER_1:  I'm Jewish.

00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:21,758
SPEAKER_1:  Parts of my family perished in the...

00:26:22,018 --> 00:26:23,838
SPEAKER_1:  Holocaust of Nazi Germany.

00:26:24,642 --> 00:26:25,918
SPEAKER_1:  I have to push back.

00:26:26,242 --> 00:26:27,646
SPEAKER_1:  that there is a difference.

00:26:28,418 --> 00:26:30,910
SPEAKER_1:  of the atrocities at that scale.

00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,126
SPEAKER_1:  at that time.

00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:35,326
SPEAKER_0:  on an entire people. I was going to say the number, that's the difference.

00:26:35,682 --> 00:26:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  It's not the number. Because six million В

00:26:39,138 --> 00:26:39,902
SPEAKER_0:  will also

00:26:40,738 --> 00:26:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  African Americans are actually Jew also.

00:26:43,138 --> 00:26:44,263

SPEAKER_0:  that too. Okay, so.

00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  Well, everyone came from Africa.

00:26:48,706 --> 00:26:49,630
SPEAKER_1:  I am African.

00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:52,515
SPEAKER_1:  I'm basically African-American, we're brothers.

00:26:52,515 --> 00:26:54,302
SPEAKER_0:  And we're both Jew, and we're brothers.

00:26:54,626 --> 00:26:55,966
SPEAKER_0:  So we're human

00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  Six million people died in the Holocaust, over 20 million have died.

00:27:00,258 --> 00:27:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  by the hands of abortion.

00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  and the media.

00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  promotes the my body, my choice.

00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,742
SPEAKER_0:  which is actually...

00:27:08,034 --> 00:27:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  Still a promotion for Planned Parenthood.

00:27:11,202 --> 00:27:13,758
SPEAKER_0:  50% of black deaths.

00:27:14,786 --> 00:27:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  A year.

00:27:15,746 --> 00:27:19,006
SPEAKER_0:  is actually abortion. It's not, it's not the cop with the knee.

00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:25,278
SPEAKER_0:  It's not black on black violence and gang violence. It's not heart attacks. It's actually abortion, the most dangerous place.

00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  Four.

00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:29,694

SPEAKER_1:  but there's something about.

00:27:40,866 --> 00:27:42,686
SPEAKER_1:  the rape, the torture.

00:27:43,074 --> 00:27:44,350

SPEAKER_1:  the complete.

00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,174
SPEAKER_1:  Complete humiliation and

00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:53,022
SPEAKER_1:  just the suffering that was endured during World War II.

00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  That's what we deal with on our TVs right now with black people.

00:27:57,986 --> 00:28:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  Soros would use black trauma economy.

00:28:02,178 --> 00:28:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  Four.

00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:04,190
SPEAKER_0:  to win an election.

00:28:05,442 --> 00:28:07,902
SPEAKER_0:  And what I love is having a healthy conversation.

00:28:08,322 --> 00:28:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  And as opposed to there's certain things, you know, boom, this drops.

SPEAKER_0:  Hey.

00:28:21,442 --> 00:28:24,094
SPEAKER_0:  Left agenda, hey, what we're gonna do.

00:28:24,354 --> 00:28:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  is say that our species can have a healthy conversation.

00:28:27,714 --> 00:28:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  The AIDS.

00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:32,062
SPEAKER_1:  Can I just linger on this? Because when you say Jewish media...

00:28:33,154 --> 00:28:33,502
SPEAKER_1:  it.

00:28:33,954 --> 00:28:37,086
SPEAKER_1:  there's a echo of a pain that people feel.

00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:38,535
SPEAKER_1:  that reminds you.

00:28:38,535 --> 00:28:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  You're saying it's redundant, right?

00:28:41,218 --> 00:28:50,302
SPEAKER_1:  No, I'm not saying it's redundant. I'm saying redundant. You're saying it's redundant. It's a saying it's something that I'm saying that is something that Joseph Goebbels

00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:53,566
SPEAKER_1:  the propaganda minister of Nazi Germany said.

00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,222
SPEAKER_1:  I'm saying it's been said so many times.

00:28:56,674 --> 00:28:57,694
SPEAKER_1:  in order to

00:28:58,018 --> 00:28:59,358
SPEAKER_1:  murder and

00:28:59,586 --> 00:29:00,254
SPEAKER_1:  culture.

00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,302
SPEAKER_1:  Jewish people.

00:29:02,978 --> 00:29:05,182
SPEAKER_1:  that it just rings wrong.

00:29:05,762 --> 00:29:08,830
SPEAKER_1:  And that's just like the N word when spoken by.

00:29:09,282 --> 00:29:11,966
SPEAKER_1:  people that have the same skin color as me.

00:29:12,258 --> 00:29:14,883
SPEAKER_1:  It reminds people of a very

00:29:14,883 --> 00:29:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  dark time.

00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  then they would see what I'm saying in a different way.

00:29:22,082 --> 00:29:24,707
SPEAKER_0:  They would hear it in a different way.

00:29:24,707 --> 00:29:26,078
SPEAKER_1:  saying you're Jewish.

00:29:26,466 --> 00:29:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  No, I'm Jew, not Jewish. Jewish means like that of a Jew, I'm saying I'm Jew.

00:29:30,786 --> 00:29:31,294
SPEAKER_0:  You're Jew.

00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  Blood of Christ, Orthodox Christian.

00:29:34,978 --> 00:29:35,422
SPEAKER_0:  But that.

00:29:36,194 --> 00:29:37,534
SPEAKER_1:  Are you?

00:29:39,042 --> 00:29:41,790
SPEAKER_1:  Are you a follower of the philosophy of the black?

00:29:42,338 --> 00:29:43,486
SPEAKER_1:  Hebrew Israelites.

00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,526
SPEAKER_1:  because that's where the idea comes from.

00:29:47,842 --> 00:29:51,697
SPEAKER_1:  Not all of those folks are extremists, but some are extremists.

00:29:51,697 --> 00:29:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  I'm a follower of the idea. I have a vague idea that all people came from.

00:29:58,818 --> 00:29:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  Africa.

00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  But what I wanted to do...

00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah..

00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,822
SPEAKER_0:  Now could Andy Kaufman this?

00:30:06,114 --> 00:30:07,710
SPEAKER_0:  About seven more minutes.

00:30:08,066 --> 00:30:11,623
SPEAKER_0:  and then tell you what it is. Should I count?

00:30:11,623 --> 00:30:13,022
SPEAKER_1:  Let's count seven minutes.

00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:16,030
SPEAKER_0:  No, I did this to do a spoiler alert.

00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:16,926
SPEAKER_0:  Sure spoiler.

00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  What's the first thing I said at the beginning?

00:30:21,314 --> 00:30:23,358
SPEAKER_1:  We're talking about engineering and humans.

00:30:23,586 --> 00:30:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  And I said

00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  And then what did I say we shouldn't focus on?

00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:27,742
SPEAKER_0:  race.

00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  Not just that.

00:30:30,114 --> 00:30:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  said they shouldn't teach this in school.

00:30:32,802 --> 00:30:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  History.

00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  the history because.

00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:39,774
SPEAKER_0:  What they do, what schools are doing is exactly what the CIA.

00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:40,798
SPEAKER_0:  does.

00:30:41,122 --> 00:30:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  with Pixar films and Disney films.

00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:47,390
SPEAKER_0:  They make Bambi's mom die in the beginning, right?

00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,958
SPEAKER_0:  and off that pain.

00:30:49,346 --> 00:30:49,950
SPEAKER_0:  comes.

00:30:50,754 --> 00:30:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  A Purchase of-

00:30:51,938 --> 00:30:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  Ice cream.

00:30:52,930 --> 00:31:03,902
SPEAKER_0:  Off that pain comes, I need some more toys. Off that pain comes, I need a bigger house. Off that pain comes, I need more girls than my wife. Off that pain comes, so they put that pain.

00:31:04,354 --> 00:31:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  and to make us.

00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  Now we're the orphans of capitalism to make us be consumers.

00:31:10,562 --> 00:31:12,478
SPEAKER_0:  and we need to be a community.

00:31:12,802 --> 00:31:14,238
SPEAKER_0:  not just consumers.

00:31:14,562 --> 00:31:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  So I could have went another seven minutes by being a person.

00:31:19,842 --> 00:31:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  who presents himself in a way that says, well, I don't have to feel your pain because I also have pain too that's not being recognized. And in every interview.

00:31:28,514 --> 00:31:30,974
SPEAKER_0:  When I say, well, why did I get to the point of putting up the tweet?

00:31:31,874 --> 00:31:34,430
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, no one wants to understand.

00:31:34,722 --> 00:31:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  why I got to that point, right? You had pain, you had pain. Yeah, but no one- You had pain in your heart, but-

00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:40,798
SPEAKER_0:  Let's say this.

00:31:41,282 --> 00:31:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  Undoubtedly.

00:31:42,562 --> 00:31:43,806
SPEAKER_0:  Jewish people have

00:31:44,354 --> 00:31:45,854
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of movies.

00:31:46,402 --> 00:31:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  about.

00:31:48,034 --> 00:31:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  That pain?

00:31:49,186 --> 00:31:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  And black people have a lot of movies.

00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,598
SPEAKER_0:  about the pain of slavery.

00:31:53,986 --> 00:31:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

00:31:54,818 --> 00:31:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  It's almost impossible.

00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:59,326
SPEAKER_0:  to find a movie about Mansa Munsa.

00:31:59,746 --> 00:32:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  When you go to the African History Museum in Washington, DC, it doesn't start with the idea.

00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  of

00:32:06,978 --> 00:32:07,902
SPEAKER_0:  Africans.

00:32:08,258 --> 00:32:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  being kings.

00:32:09,858 --> 00:32:13,022
SPEAKER_0:  It starts with the idea of Africans being slaves.

00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:16,030
SPEAKER_0:  But here's another interesting point about this.

00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:19,454
SPEAKER_0:  This was said to me one time and it stuck with me as a family member of mine.

00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  With Africans, how many times you've heard like a rapper?

00:32:24,098 --> 00:32:25,150
SPEAKER_0:  you know, talk about.

00:32:25,858 --> 00:32:27,070
SPEAKER_0:  We were kings.

00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  That's incorrect.

00:32:31,266 --> 00:32:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  if we're Jew.

00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,414
SPEAKER_0:  If we're Jew, and since we are,

00:32:36,962 --> 00:32:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  We weren't the Kings.

00:32:38,754 --> 00:32:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  We were the slaves.

00:32:40,386 --> 00:32:41,406

SPEAKER_0:  Fucked all my deals and a person that has friends that never figured out

00:41:18,498 --> 00:41:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  how to make shoes with a German company that couldn't tell me to wear a BLM shirt and take off my red hat. Like what would have happened if I was at Nike, right?

00:41:29,218 --> 00:41:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  Tell me exactly

00:41:31,234 --> 00:41:31,998

00:41:35,729 --> 00:41:36,638
SPEAKER_1:  big voice.

00:41:36,898 --> 00:41:41,662
SPEAKER_1:  Have the balls as a man to call out the individuals. Don't call them Jews, call them-

00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,134
SPEAKER_1:  by their name.

00:41:43,426 --> 00:41:46,801
SPEAKER_1:  and start a war against those individuals. They're not Jewish.

00:41:46,801 --> 00:41:48,062
SPEAKER_0:  But if that's the case...

00:41:48,834 --> 00:41:49,758
SPEAKER_0:  Will you help me with that?

00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  Sure.

00:41:50,946 --> 00:41:53,127
SPEAKER_0:  Okay. 100%. Okay.

00:41:53,127 --> 00:41:54,110
SPEAKER_1:  Well, let me like

00:41:54,530 --> 00:42:01,438
SPEAKER_1:  Flip that too, I don't understand the industry well. I see that people are fucking people over for sure, but how do you solve that?

00:42:01,826 --> 00:42:05,470
SPEAKER_1:  If you run, if you right now run the world's.

00:42:05,954 --> 00:42:08,579
SPEAKER_1:  You're doing a million things, but say you ran also

00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  record label.

00:42:10,146 --> 00:42:13,822
SPEAKER_0:  I have ran a record label, well I've been ran by a record label where I was the face.

00:42:14,082 --> 00:42:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  of a record label and had...

00:42:15,874 --> 00:42:28,798
SPEAKER_0:  Big Sean and different people complaining to me, and I knew fuck about running a record label. I was simply just a talented producer and an influencer that then started good music, but I wasn't the one running good music. How would you do it differently?

00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  This is something I propose.

00:42:31,362 --> 00:42:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  I would look at.

00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  the top 10 execs and three fields.

00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  and sports.

00:42:39,106 --> 00:42:39,742

SPEAKER_0:  and music.

00:42:42,658 --> 00:42:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  and I would look at the top 10.

00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:46,814
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,286

SPEAKER_0:  Participant Act Talent.

00:42:50,306 --> 00:42:51,646
SPEAKER_0:  I would look at the top talent.

00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  and each of those fill the top 10 of them.

00:42:54,402 --> 00:42:54,878
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:42:55,202 --> 00:43:00,990
SPEAKER_0:  Some of them are going to be Tom Brady. Some of them are going to be Taylor Swift. They're not all going to be black, right? So.

00:43:02,434 --> 00:43:04,606
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, someone would be Adele, right?

00:43:04,866 --> 00:43:05,534
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:43:05,858 --> 00:43:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  End.

00:43:07,202 --> 00:43:09,406
SPEAKER_0:  We'll look at all their contracts.

00:43:10,466 --> 00:43:11,774
SPEAKER_0:  Trans-parently.

00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,374
SPEAKER_0:  and we'll compare.

00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  The Notes.

00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  and re-engineer like it's a new constitution.

00:43:17,858 --> 00:43:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  Because when I told my dad

00:43:19,554 --> 00:43:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  When I was 19, I was going to get into

00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:25,214
SPEAKER_0:  The music industry, he begged me not to. He said, I heard it's treacherous.

00:43:25,858 --> 00:43:27,806
SPEAKER_0:  Now I'm in a position where I've been through it.

00:43:28,194 --> 00:43:28,990
SPEAKER_0:  I saw it.

00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  I went out, made some money somewhere else.

00:43:31,906 --> 00:43:35,326
SPEAKER_0:  I saw my name get smeared. I saw my family get destroyed.

00:43:35,682 --> 00:43:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  I saw my reputation get destroyed.

00:43:37,858 --> 00:43:39,678
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm back here to have this kind of.

00:43:40,354 --> 00:43:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  I'm back here as a being.

00:43:42,402 --> 00:43:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  with engineering opportunities. So,

00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  And wait a second, if you say it as a shitty apology...

00:43:47,298 --> 00:43:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  What is the version?

00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:52,894
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, of the apology short of kissing Howard Stern's dick.

00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:55,797
SPEAKER_1:  I don't think anyone wants to kiss Howard Stern.

00:43:55,797 --> 00:44:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  That's the whole point Howard Stern, nobody wants to kiss your dicks so shut the fuck up. I said, by the way, I'm antagonized you Howard Stern.

00:44:02,722 --> 00:44:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  I used to be a fan of you.

00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:05,406
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, me too.

00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:11,198
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, not still a fan and not not now you're just doing clickbait like everybody else

00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,686
SPEAKER_0:  Now you're just a sad old man Howard.

00:44:16,066 --> 00:44:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  Now Howard Stern, this is the first time.

00:44:18,466 --> 00:44:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  Anyone's

00:44:19,586 --> 00:44:21,246
SPEAKER_0:  said your name in years.

00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  Your own family doesn't say your name unless they're calling to get their bills paid.

00:44:27,074 --> 00:44:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  You're going hard.

00:44:28,898 --> 00:44:32,277
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, I'm just kidding. See, that's beautiful right there.

00:44:32,277 --> 00:44:35,006
SPEAKER_1:  That's much better than calling Jewish media

00:44:35,234 --> 00:44:36,734
SPEAKER_0:  Call it go after individuals.

00:44:36,994 --> 00:44:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, so after individually and you don't talk shit about me

00:44:40,034 --> 00:44:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  Talk shit about me. This is great. And you know what that is? Yeah, what's that?

00:44:45,602 --> 00:44:48,277
SPEAKER_0:  engineering. That's the engineers approach. Yeah.

00:44:48,277 --> 00:44:48,766
SPEAKER_1:  engineers.

00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:51,006
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, you should learn some of that.

00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:53,662
SPEAKER_0:  We all can use our pain against each other.

00:44:53,922 --> 00:44:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  or

00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  We can say we're being.

00:44:56,866 --> 00:44:58,622
SPEAKER_0:  with engineering opportunities.

00:44:58,914 --> 00:45:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  and we can know about history. So let me change something.

00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:03,390
SPEAKER_0:  We can have...

00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  A, just to be judgmental, people say that I should not judge.

00:45:08,962 --> 00:45:14,590
SPEAKER_0:  I was talking to Camille Vasquez. She says, I'm very judgmental. That's what we're doing. I believe-

00:45:14,914 --> 00:45:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  Now you could go to Bible and one thing's gonna say one thing another thing may be s-

00:45:18,946 --> 00:45:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  contradicting away and then the pastor has to

00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  Unpack it!

00:45:22,466 --> 00:45:23,422
SPEAKER_0:  I believe.

00:45:24,898 --> 00:45:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  that we are to judge.

00:45:26,914 --> 00:45:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  If you look at some food...

00:45:29,698 --> 00:45:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  and it's got a fly coming out of it.

00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  you can then judge at that point. You're supposed to use your better judgment. But whenever someone doesn't wanna change something they're doing, they'll say...

00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:43,134
SPEAKER_0:  Don't judge me, right?

00:45:43,778 --> 00:45:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  as a species, you called for me, you got the breakthrough. And by the way, it's only an engineer that I would respect to tell me of how to update.

00:45:55,298 --> 00:45:59,550
SPEAKER_0:  how I'm communicating because this started off, right? I've been through all these.

00:46:00,002 --> 00:46:00,638
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:01,662
SPEAKER_0:  Interviews

00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  Let me go to this. You said this was a sorry apology.

00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  I was very specific, I said, the Jewish, because by the way, it's a barrage, right? It's a thing where I don't even remember the names at a certain point, right? It's like.

00:46:15,938 --> 00:46:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  If a-

00:46:16,578 --> 00:46:18,526
SPEAKER_0:  if a girl was getting raped.

00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  by men.

00:46:22,882 --> 00:46:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  If that person's not 18, right?

00:46:25,666 --> 00:46:27,710
SPEAKER_0:  and she was getting raped since 14, right?

00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  and she still got this face, this super like, Irina Shake level face, right?

00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:35,390
SPEAKER_0:  Ah.

00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  She might say...

00:46:38,018 --> 00:46:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  I hate men.

00:46:40,002 --> 00:46:44,574
SPEAKER_0:  That woman may say, I hate men. She might get to that point because she was raped.

00:46:45,474 --> 00:46:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  All my contracts and no one can say this is ramped up. No one, Howard Stern can't say this is ramped up. Ari Emanuel can't say this is ramped up. George Soros knows damn well.

00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  that I'm not ramped up. Jorsuro's nose like wow this guy's like.

00:47:00,098 --> 00:47:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  a younger.

00:47:01,762 --> 00:47:04,158
SPEAKER_0:  guy that's looking at what I did.

00:47:04,546 --> 00:47:07,678
SPEAKER_0:  and looking at how I control the world silently.

00:47:08,066 --> 00:47:09,278
SPEAKER_0:  and he's calling it out.

00:47:09,698 --> 00:47:10,526
SPEAKER_0:  And he's not.

00:47:11,106 --> 00:47:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  using any of the fear tactics. I can't send his homeboys around him. I can't send his wife to him. This guy...

00:47:17,506 --> 00:47:21,214
SPEAKER_0:  That's what George Soros sees when he's dealing with me. So...

00:47:22,018 --> 00:47:25,310
SPEAKER_0:  You guys are actually asking me to do. I'm comparing myself to that.

00:47:25,826 --> 00:47:27,678
SPEAKER_0:  18 year old, beautiful.

00:47:28,258 --> 00:47:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  uh, woman that had been mistreated by men for

00:47:32,034 --> 00:47:33,598
SPEAKER_0:  Four years of her life, right?

00:47:34,146 --> 00:47:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  And you're saying...

00:47:36,066 --> 00:47:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  You know, as a man.

00:47:37,762 --> 00:47:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  You can't blame all men.

00:47:39,714 --> 00:47:40,670
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm saying...

00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  as a responsible.

00:47:43,106 --> 00:47:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  uh... forward philosopher leader

00:47:46,594 --> 00:47:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

00:47:47,682 --> 00:47:48,958
SPEAKER_0:  I'll drop the pain.

00:47:49,474 --> 00:47:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  and I will specify because I'm a peer.

00:47:52,418 --> 00:47:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  I lost my fucking family, I lost my kids.

00:47:56,194 --> 00:47:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  I lost my best friend in fashion.

00:47:59,106 --> 00:48:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  I lost, I lost the black community, I lost-

00:48:02,498 --> 00:48:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  You know, people said I lost my mind, all of these things, lost my reputation.

00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:09,310
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm up here just like...

00:48:09,794 --> 00:48:11,102
SPEAKER_0:  I just want my family.

00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  But I don't want my family to have to say what the left wants us to say, to have to say what China wants us to say. I wanna be an American and protect my kids and protect my wife and raise my kids.

00:48:24,994 --> 00:48:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  As Christians.

00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  and have my wife be a Christian.

SPEAKER_0:  and innovate.

00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  and America Made Rock and Roll, I wanna innovate as a creative person and be a successful American, but all of that had been taken away from me. So I'm coming back.

00:48:40,162 --> 00:48:47,774
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm removing the PSTD right now, right? I'm standing up and saying the only way that we're gonna be able to get past this and the way God is gonna...

00:48:48,066 --> 00:48:48,734
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:48:49,474 --> 00:48:57,790
SPEAKER_0:  use me right now is for me to stop talking about the pain, stop talking about what happened and do something about it. And that's where I'm at.

00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  right now in this moment.

00:49:00,098 --> 00:49:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  Like, yeah, people agree. At least there was something we could say. He has a reason of why he got to that tweet.

00:49:06,594 --> 00:49:08,478

00:49:10,082 --> 00:49:10,558

SPEAKER_1:  I think you choose.

00:50:29,991 --> 00:50:35,582
SPEAKER_0:  You have a powerful voice. Did I prove that there was censorship over the past two weeks?

00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  I approved it.

00:50:37,442 --> 00:50:38,526
SPEAKER_1:  I'll drink champs.

00:50:38,626 --> 00:50:39,518

SPEAKER_1:  to don your conversation

00:50:53,858 --> 00:50:54,590
SPEAKER_1:  It didn't hurt you.

00:50:56,162 --> 00:50:58,037
SPEAKER_1:  Man, you gotta be honest about the pain.

00:50:58,037 --> 00:50:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  See you next time.

00:50:58,946 --> 00:51:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  We're still the kids we used to be

00:51:02,466 --> 00:51:05,054

00:51:05,378 --> 00:51:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  to see if I still bleed.

00:51:08,866 --> 00:51:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kind of free

00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:15,646
SPEAKER_0:  No, I-

00:51:15,874 --> 00:51:16,830
SPEAKER_0:  Do you think?

00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I went to Japan for two to three months, right?

00:51:23,906 --> 00:51:24,830

SPEAKER_0:  My kids are supposed to be there.

00:51:29,922 --> 00:51:31,806
SPEAKER_0:  and my kids would know where to be found.

00:51:32,418 --> 00:51:33,374

SPEAKER_0:  We get into an argument.

00:51:38,594 --> 00:51:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  and then I get a text.

00:51:40,866 --> 00:51:42,206
SPEAKER_0:  from a number I don't know.

00:51:42,722 --> 00:51:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  and it's Pete Davidson.

00:51:44,514 --> 00:51:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  bragging about being in bed with my wife.

00:51:49,346 --> 00:51:49,918
SPEAKER_0:  Then...

00:51:52,386 --> 00:51:53,246
SPEAKER_0:  Just fucking with you.

00:51:53,634 --> 00:51:55,710
SPEAKER_0:  Well, at that point, it's like...

00:51:56,994 --> 00:51:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  They're trying to put me in jail.

00:51:58,754 --> 00:52:00,030
SPEAKER_0:  or put a friend of mine in jail.

00:52:01,794 --> 00:52:03,358
SPEAKER_0:  because then I'm gonna go.

00:52:03,906 --> 00:52:05,310
SPEAKER_0:  Surround the hotel.

00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  and do something which...

00:52:09,058 --> 00:52:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  would have me not be able to be here.

00:52:11,394 --> 00:52:14,590
SPEAKER_0:  And instead I walked away from that situation. I went to Japan.

00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:16,350
SPEAKER_0:  like the samurai that I am.

00:52:17,026 --> 00:52:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  and went to the top of the mountain.

00:52:19,074 --> 00:52:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:52:20,322 --> 00:52:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  Cause I knew.

00:52:21,826 --> 00:52:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  that I mean I knew there was no way

00:52:25,218 --> 00:52:25,758

SPEAKER_1:  You said.

00:53:11,778 --> 00:53:17,310
SPEAKER_1:  something that inspired, that resonated with a lot of people when you said George Bush doesn't care about black people.

00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:19,262
SPEAKER_1:  I have to say.

00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:38,206
SPEAKER_1:  after Katrina.

00:53:38,722 --> 00:53:43,230
SPEAKER_1:  You're not giving a fuck about the suffering of the Jewish people across the world.

00:53:43,394 --> 00:53:44,542
SPEAKER_0:  Why am I not?

00:53:45,218 --> 00:53:45,950

00:55:20,834 --> 00:55:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  No matter.

00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

00:56:57,922 --> 00:56:59,934

SPEAKER_0:  And why did you go like this?

00:57:05,762 --> 00:57:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  I went like this.

00:57:08,162 --> 00:57:09,150
SPEAKER_0:  Because...

00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:15,518
SPEAKER_0:  I can't even, I would look insane to physically show you.

00:57:16,354 --> 00:57:19,230
SPEAKER_0:  uh... a metaphor uh... uh... uh... uh...

00:57:19,778 --> 00:57:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  a physical representation.

00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:23,678
SPEAKER_0:  of my last 20 years.

00:57:24,514 --> 00:57:25,694
SPEAKER_0:  of what I've been through.

00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  as a musician.

00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  as a father.

00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:33,489
SPEAKER_0:  and as a black person with a political opinion. A great man.

00:57:33,489 --> 00:57:37,438
SPEAKER_1:  Still, through the pain does the right thing and I think the right thing.

00:57:38,082 --> 00:57:41,694
SPEAKER_1:  is to not say that there's Jewish control of the media.

00:57:41,794 --> 00:57:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  That's incorrect though! That's a fucking lie, there is!

00:57:45,122 --> 00:57:47,747
SPEAKER_0:  and they did come and bully me, it proved the point.

00:57:47,747 --> 00:57:49,630
SPEAKER_1:  No, the reason you don't say it...

00:57:50,018 --> 00:57:52,222
SPEAKER_1:  Why? Because the world is much bigger than-

00:57:52,642 --> 00:57:53,086
SPEAKER_1:  The...

00:57:53,506 --> 00:57:56,926
SPEAKER_1:  Forgive me, the narrow little world you exist in.

00:57:57,346 --> 00:57:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  Your impact stretches way past.

00:57:59,746 --> 00:58:02,371
SPEAKER_1:  those little boardroom meetings over contracts.

00:58:02,371 --> 00:58:03,358
SPEAKER_0:  What's your ass done?

00:58:03,586 --> 00:58:04,711
SPEAKER_0:  What should I have done? Not s-

00:58:04,711 --> 00:58:07,230
SPEAKER_1:  that you should be a strong man that doesn't mention

00:58:07,714 --> 00:58:09,822
SPEAKER_1:  that doesn't match the religion of people and then f-

00:58:10,914 --> 00:58:12,039
SPEAKER_1:  Do you want to win this fight?

00:58:12,039 --> 00:58:15,454
SPEAKER_0:  How do we win? Call out individual people, build-

00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:21,470
SPEAKER_1:  That's one way because they have a big voice. The other voice that I prefer is to build another label.

00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:29,470
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like you're controlling my creative narrative and my, because just like how you're telling me I shouldn't have said that.

00:58:29,794 --> 00:58:32,094
SPEAKER_0:  Do you think there are people telling me I shouldn't have wore a red hat?

00:58:34,082 --> 00:58:35,207
SPEAKER_0:  No, you, cause you asked-

00:58:35,207 --> 00:58:35,678
SPEAKER_1:  me.

00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:39,038
SPEAKER_1:  What should I have done? You're supposed to be a scarecrow.

00:58:39,298 --> 00:58:43,486
SPEAKER_1:  So I thought I'm gonna beat the shit out of the scarecrow with my words, right? You let me.

00:58:43,682 --> 00:58:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  It was consensual.

00:58:45,218 --> 00:58:51,710
SPEAKER_0:  The punching bag is a bag because Scarecrow actually has a different real name. Yeah, that's right. So let's say a punching bag. I shouldn't say a Scarecrow. Yeah.

00:58:52,066 --> 00:58:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  But every single person that I've sat with from the point when I wore the red hat till now has done the same thing.

00:58:59,234 --> 00:59:02,974
SPEAKER_0:  sit in the principal's office and don't do what you're doing.

00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:08,062
SPEAKER_1:  We're in the generous closet right now together. And I'm not the red hat is very different.

00:59:08,354 --> 00:59:09,118
SPEAKER_1:  The red hat.

00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:10,590
SPEAKER_1:  is a...

00:59:11,042 --> 00:59:15,230
SPEAKER_1:  You have a set of beliefs you represent half the country that has.

00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:16,190
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, uh.

00:59:16,802 --> 00:59:17,374
SPEAKER_1:  I hope.

00:59:17,922 --> 00:59:20,830
SPEAKER_1:  a vision for the future of America that's very different.

00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:24,190
SPEAKER_1:  than without any purpose whatsoever saying Jewish media.

00:59:24,386 --> 00:59:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  just control the media. You said that there's no purpose. So you're taking away my history and my reason of what my purpose was.

00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:34,686
SPEAKER_0:  I'm saying it was dumb.

00:59:35,106 --> 00:59:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  Also, also I'm speaking my voice.

00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:40,030
SPEAKER_0:  vocalize also

00:59:41,442 --> 00:59:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  It's God's plan.

00:59:43,042 --> 00:59:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  There's a lot of things that open up. Let me tell you something that opened up. There's a guy.

00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:49,214
SPEAKER_0:  Like I told you, that was running Stem Player.

00:59:49,634 --> 00:59:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  who I've had issues with, we hadn't got paid on time, certain things right.

00:59:53,794 --> 00:59:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  and he took his...

00:59:55,842 --> 01:00:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  his IQ, his know-how, his engineering know-how to, he basically was trying to adidas me.

01:00:02,722 --> 01:00:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  with even though I was the bigger money in the situation. That was fun and we funded together.

01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:10,238
SPEAKER_0:  and he hired these engineers.

01:00:10,722 --> 01:00:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  And he said, well, because of your comments, we're not going to be able to hire anybody else.

01:00:14,946 --> 01:00:22,270
SPEAKER_0:  And I was like, well, how many Jewish people do we have in our company? He said, I don't know. He didn't say exactly, right? I said, do we have black people? We said...

01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, it's in how many set? Two.

01:00:24,994 --> 01:00:28,734
SPEAKER_0:  So we have like 60 full-time employees, like 40 half-time. And...

01:00:28,962 --> 01:00:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  part time.

01:00:30,146 --> 01:00:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  And...

01:00:32,322 --> 01:00:33,214
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

01:00:36,002 --> 01:00:38,174
SPEAKER_0:  I took as a responsibility. Let's- let's-

01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  Let's take a step back from us being one species and say, hey.

01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  You're Jewish. I'm black. Right. Step by step back.

01:00:45,922 --> 01:00:46,750
SPEAKER_0:  For this example.

01:00:46,978 --> 01:00:49,150
SPEAKER_0:  for the sake of this example. And I said.

01:00:49,474 --> 01:00:50,046
SPEAKER_0:  Wow!

01:00:51,298 --> 01:00:54,686
SPEAKER_0:  I'm sure I could hire more than two black engineers.

01:00:55,714 --> 01:00:57,374
SPEAKER_0:  And what happens is...

01:00:58,210 --> 01:00:59,166
SPEAKER_0:  Because...

01:00:59,394 --> 01:01:02,398
SPEAKER_0:  There are so many businessmen that just so happen to be Jewish.

01:01:02,914 --> 01:01:03,358
SPEAKER_0:  that.

01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  It's good business, right? Just to monopolize. That's what people are looking. Everybody wants to be Elon, right? So suggest something cool.

01:01:10,914 --> 01:01:11,742
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhhhhh

01:01:12,482 --> 01:01:15,806
SPEAKER_0:  The... I disagree with that. Okay, but let me finish this point.

01:01:16,258 --> 01:01:23,262
SPEAKER_0:  I'm gonna let you finish. I'm gonna let you finish. A lot of businessmen want to be as successful as Elon and as popular as Elon.

01:01:23,778 --> 01:01:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  A lot.

01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  I could just word it like that.

01:01:26,562 --> 01:01:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  which I hate the term a lot actually, I want to be more specific, but I haven't done the math on it.

01:01:31,362 --> 01:01:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  Let's say some.

01:01:32,962 --> 01:01:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  Factually, for sure, there are some.

01:01:35,842 --> 01:01:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  business people of all different.

01:01:37,922 --> 01:01:39,230
SPEAKER_0:  walks and backgrounds.

01:01:39,458 --> 01:01:42,814
SPEAKER_0:  that would like to be as rich and as popular as Elon Musk.

01:01:43,426 --> 01:01:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  So let me just take a step back from the we're one species into the we're separated by race, gender, socioeconomic class conversation and say.

01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  As a black owner of two tech platforms, hardware and software, I need to take...

01:01:59,554 --> 01:02:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  Let's not call it affirmative. Let's just say I need to take action and-

01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  I need to take accountability.

01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  and ensuring

01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  That.

01:02:12,482 --> 01:02:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  Black engineers.

01:02:14,978 --> 01:02:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  are hired.

01:02:16,226 --> 01:02:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  And guess what? We're hired together.

01:02:18,978 --> 01:02:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  because when the black people that are brilliant are separated

01:02:23,618 --> 01:02:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  from our culture.

01:02:24,898 --> 01:02:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  We forget who we are.

01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  and we'll get to a point where...

01:02:28,866 --> 01:02:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, oh JSA, I'm not black. I'm OJ.

01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:35,742
SPEAKER_0:  because just to be on the golf course.

01:02:36,194 --> 01:02:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  we put on the golf shirt.

01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  But the golf shirt...

01:02:39,362 --> 01:02:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  might not be something that our culture would have done.

01:02:42,466 --> 01:02:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  and our culture.

01:02:44,098 --> 01:02:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:02:45,186 --> 01:02:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  uh, poor communities is

01:02:47,682 --> 01:02:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, everybody's got Draco on them. Everybody's got a gun on them. Oh.

01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:52,798
SPEAKER_0:  If you run up on me.

01:02:53,058 --> 01:03:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  on the gas station, I'ma kill you. A, you ain't gotta talk to me like a man if I haven't killed at least five people. But you know what happens is we can kill five people, we could kill 10 people and still be.

01:03:04,002 --> 01:03:05,022
SPEAKER_0:  In the media.

01:03:05,602 --> 01:03:09,310
SPEAKER_0:  as long as we play by the rules, right? cause what will happen is

01:03:09,634 --> 01:03:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  Any of these guys.

01:03:11,426 --> 01:03:12,766
SPEAKER_0:  that I have talked about.

01:03:13,218 --> 01:03:14,846
SPEAKER_0:  killing people and different things.

01:03:15,234 --> 01:03:24,094
SPEAKER_0:  Unless Trump had pardoned them, right? But let's say, even if Trump had pardoned them, they could still go to someone like a Lil Boozy or Meek Mills.

01:03:24,322 --> 01:03:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  or Puff Daddy, anybody, and say, Hey, we need you to talk shit about yay.

01:03:29,474 --> 01:03:34,654
SPEAKER_0:  right now. And also, you're not allowed, if you do want to vote for Trump or vote outside of

01:03:34,914 --> 01:03:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  what this arrangement is.

01:03:36,642 --> 01:03:38,718
SPEAKER_0:  then we're gonna put you in jail.

01:03:39,554 --> 01:03:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  It ain't- Nah, we're not gonna bring you down.

01:03:41,858 --> 01:03:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  We have this on you.

01:03:44,482 --> 01:03:47,582
SPEAKER_0:  You get what I'm saying? If I had ever killed someone-

01:03:48,322 --> 01:03:49,246
SPEAKER_0:  If I wasn't.

01:03:49,538 --> 01:03:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  The bitch.

01:03:50,562 --> 01:03:53,822
SPEAKER_0:  with the pink polo on, I wouldn't be able to be.

01:03:54,466 --> 01:03:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  the vocal man that I am today.

01:03:56,994 --> 01:04:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  You understand what I'm saying? This is the reason why I'm happy that my gangster disciple brothers

01:04:02,306 --> 01:04:04,542
SPEAKER_0:  kept me from the initiations.

01:04:04,802 --> 01:04:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  which made me feel like a pussy.

01:04:07,138 --> 01:04:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  My whole life.

01:04:08,770 --> 01:04:09,278
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:10,686
SPEAKER_0:  But now...

01:04:10,946 --> 01:04:12,318
SPEAKER_0:  I am someone.

01:04:12,674 --> 01:04:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  who legally can say this.

01:04:15,074 --> 01:04:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  other people in my position.

01:04:17,442 --> 01:04:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  They legally cannot speak.

01:04:20,418 --> 01:04:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  They legally cannot speak.

01:04:23,138 --> 01:04:24,702
SPEAKER_0:  or they will go to prison.

01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:31,358
SPEAKER_0:  I am in a bit of a glass prison because I don't have say so of where my children go to school.

01:04:33,058 --> 01:04:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  But.

01:04:34,114 --> 01:04:37,054
SPEAKER_0:  I'm in a freedom place where I can have this conversation with you right now.

01:04:37,698 --> 01:04:38,302
SPEAKER_0:  And that...

01:04:38,658 --> 01:04:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  is.

01:04:40,034 --> 01:04:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  I don't like the word breakthrough.

01:04:42,242 --> 01:04:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  You know, that-

01:04:43,106 --> 01:04:45,150
SPEAKER_0:  That's God's hand on this situation.

01:04:46,114 --> 01:04:48,638
SPEAKER_0:  But you get what I'm saying about if I hadn't said the tweet.

01:04:48,994 --> 01:04:52,734
SPEAKER_0:  I wouldn't have had to take the accountability myself to hire.

01:04:53,026 --> 01:04:55,651
SPEAKER_0:  black engineers into my two tech platforms.

01:04:55,651 --> 01:04:59,134
SPEAKER_1:  And do you get what I'm saying? That's a beautiful personal journey you're on.

01:04:59,682 --> 01:05:00,807
SPEAKER_1:  but you get what I'm saying?

01:05:00,807 --> 01:05:03,006
SPEAKER_0:  personal is for my people as a whole.

01:05:03,362 --> 01:05:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  as a tribal person.

01:05:05,218 --> 01:05:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  It's a small company.

01:05:06,562 --> 01:05:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  As a tribal person.

01:05:09,026 --> 01:05:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  I believe that I am.

01:05:11,202 --> 01:05:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  My people.

01:05:12,674 --> 01:05:14,110
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that...

01:05:14,530 --> 01:05:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  that

01:05:15,266 --> 01:05:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  Business man.

01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  have done to my people, have pulled the brightest out of our tribes.

01:05:20,354 --> 01:05:21,406
SPEAKER_0:  and siloed them.

01:05:21,698 --> 01:05:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  and made us lose our culture.

01:05:24,066 --> 01:05:29,854
SPEAKER_0:  and lose who they were. All the only thing I wanted to say at Virgil's funeral, which I wasn't allowed to.

01:05:30,946 --> 01:05:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

01:05:31,842 --> 01:05:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  It was a white pastor.

01:05:33,378 --> 01:05:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  that talked the majority of the funeral.

01:05:35,618 --> 01:05:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  Half the funeral was pissed.

01:05:38,082 --> 01:05:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  Pissed, right?

01:05:39,458 --> 01:05:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:05:40,514 --> 01:05:41,182
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:05:41,794 --> 01:05:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, and this pastor actually married me and Kim, right? It looks like Justin Timberlake a little bit. Uh.

01:05:47,426 --> 01:05:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  And, um...

01:05:49,922 --> 01:05:52,478
SPEAKER_0:  He talked to her after the funeral. He knew Virgil was passing.

01:05:52,770 --> 01:05:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  did a collaboration with him.

01:05:54,498 --> 01:05:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  before he passed by the way.

01:05:56,258 --> 01:05:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  A clothing collaboration.

01:05:58,274 --> 01:06:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't know Virgil was passing.

01:06:00,578 --> 01:06:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  But the thing I wanted to say...

01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  I saw ASAP Rocky.

01:06:05,858 --> 01:06:08,350
SPEAKER_0:  and I saw some other members of his gang.

01:06:08,994 --> 01:06:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  You know...

01:06:09,858 --> 01:06:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  in the audience at the funeral.

01:06:13,762 --> 01:06:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  And all I wanted to tell him is...

01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  Don't.

01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:18,974
SPEAKER_0:  them split the gang up.

01:06:20,386 --> 01:06:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  Don't let them split the gang up.

01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  when...

01:06:25,282 --> 01:06:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  I did the first Yeezy.

SPEAKER_0:  high end luxury, all leather.

01:06:35,266 --> 01:06:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  kind of design, not all leather, but high-end materials.

SPEAKER_0:  a battle in the spiritual form.

01:14:20,098 --> 01:14:24,126

01:14:27,938 --> 01:14:28,318

01:15:10,786 --> 01:15:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  I'll sing another song.

01:15:12,098 --> 01:15:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  from one of my mentors future.

01:15:14,242 --> 01:15:15,518
SPEAKER_0:  I never feel pain.

01:15:16,162 --> 01:15:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  I done felt too much pain.

01:15:18,018 --> 01:15:19,038
SPEAKER_0:  Like...

01:15:19,426 --> 01:15:25,726
SPEAKER_0:  There was a day where I was headed to Nashville to meet with George Farmer who is the CEO of Parla.

01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  the day when we made the announcement.

01:15:29,378 --> 01:15:30,654
SPEAKER_0:  At that same day...

01:15:31,426 --> 01:15:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  uh, Balenciaga.

01:15:33,922 --> 01:15:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  was taking my imagery off of their site.

01:15:37,506 --> 01:15:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  and the drink champs was being taken down.

01:15:42,594 --> 01:15:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  And I said, this is the happiest day of my life.

01:15:46,786 --> 01:15:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  I love cutting the grass low.

01:15:50,146 --> 01:15:52,382
SPEAKER_0:  People wasn't really with you, they was part time.

01:15:52,642 --> 01:15:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  People switch up when it's war time.

01:15:54,882 --> 01:15:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  I'd rather have people who are really with me.

01:15:58,562 --> 01:16:00,766
SPEAKER_0:  and not people who are just trying to use me.

01:16:01,154 --> 01:16:02,270
SPEAKER_1:  Listen as a friend.

01:16:03,394 --> 01:16:05,886
SPEAKER_1:  Somebody cares for you. You have to be really careful.

01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:07,198
SPEAKER_1:  by the people.

01:16:07,522 --> 01:16:09,118
SPEAKER_1:  by all people, always.

01:16:09,442 --> 01:16:11,902
SPEAKER_1:  the people that are gonna try to be close to you now.

01:16:12,258 --> 01:16:13,758
SPEAKER_1:  You don't know if you can trust them.

01:16:14,114 --> 01:16:15,038
SPEAKER_0:  Anymore than-

01:16:15,458 --> 01:16:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  With the Balenciaga, I have more to say about it though.

01:16:19,586 --> 01:16:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  Let's do this.

01:16:20,930 --> 01:16:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  Demna will still work.

01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  For yay

01:16:26,594 --> 01:16:27,262
SPEAKER_0:  Someday

01:16:27,938 --> 01:16:29,886
SPEAKER_0:  and this is just speeding the process up.

01:16:30,914 --> 01:16:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  Have you talked?

01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  share if you've talked.

01:16:33,858 --> 01:16:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, I talked to Demna. This is like, we're kindred spirits. None of this can keep us away from each other. I brought Demna to Gap.

01:16:42,882 --> 01:16:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  to be able to bring the best product in the world. At that time, I wanted to go under $100. I'm like, okay, we're going to go $20 a product.

01:16:50,754 --> 01:16:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhh

01:16:51,778 --> 01:16:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  I brought Demna in.

01:16:55,522 --> 01:16:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  to.

01:16:56,610 --> 01:16:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  Engineer.

01:16:57,826 --> 01:17:03,102
SPEAKER_0:  That's why I said, engineer by Balenciaga, EasyGap engineered by Balenciaga, to engineer the best product.

01:17:03,522 --> 01:17:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  for the people.

01:17:04,514 --> 01:17:05,214
SPEAKER_0:  The people.

01:17:05,442 --> 01:17:05,982
SPEAKER_0:  that

01:17:07,682 --> 01:17:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  that

01:17:08,802 --> 01:17:09,310
SPEAKER_0:  They.

01:17:09,570 --> 01:17:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  say are at the bottom of the Maslow hierarchy of need.

01:17:14,018 --> 01:17:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  chart. They're at the bottom of the pyramid.

01:17:17,986 --> 01:17:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:21,694
SPEAKER_0:  Gap didn't want that.

01:17:22,306 --> 01:17:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  Balenciaga didn't want that.

01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  Our genders were not aligned.

01:17:26,946 --> 01:17:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  I was brought in.

01:17:29,698 --> 01:17:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  the gap for political reasons and influence.

01:17:32,802 --> 01:17:34,558
SPEAKER_0:  like a Virgil, like a George Floyd.

01:17:35,298 --> 01:17:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  When popular celebrities are brought into Fortune 500 companies, it's not to raise the stock.

01:17:41,186 --> 01:17:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  It's to strengthen the position.

01:17:44,066 --> 01:17:45,022
SPEAKER_0:  and influence.

01:17:47,010 --> 01:17:48,222
SPEAKER_0:  and is definitely.

01:17:48,514 --> 01:17:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  not to be out here.

01:17:50,050 --> 01:17:51,806
SPEAKER_0:  Lettin' a nigga think he's Steve Jobs.

01:17:56,034 --> 01:17:57,342
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, there's people like that.

01:17:59,298 --> 01:18:02,270
SPEAKER_1:  but you as a great man of visionary.

01:18:03,618 --> 01:18:04,414
SPEAKER_1:  Your job.

01:18:05,314 --> 01:18:06,942
SPEAKER_1:  is to understand that game.

01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:08,798
SPEAKER_1:  and be one step ahead.

01:18:09,922 --> 01:18:11,102
SPEAKER_0:  Well that's what I'm telling them.

01:18:11,842 --> 01:18:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  That relationship, you know some relationships only last for a summer.

01:18:16,226 --> 01:18:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  you know, if some lasts for a year, the relationship ran its course.

01:18:20,226 --> 01:18:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  You know...

01:18:22,082 --> 01:18:23,966
SPEAKER_0:  in that relationship I invested.

01:18:24,354 --> 01:18:26,430
SPEAKER_0:  a lot of my social capital.

01:18:26,754 --> 01:18:27,998
SPEAKER_0:  an actual capital.

01:18:28,482 --> 01:18:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  I spent somewhere between $5 to $10 million personally on Balenciaga.

01:18:34,082 --> 01:18:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  How much money do you think Balenciaga had paid me?

01:18:36,834 --> 01:18:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  in the past two years.

01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  Just take a really wild guess, a really wild guess. Less than that.

01:18:43,906 --> 01:18:45,278
SPEAKER_0:  Just take a super wild one.

01:18:46,370 --> 01:18:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  Just go to the furthest extent of your imagination.

01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:53,182
SPEAKER_0:  1.2 million.

01:18:54,562 --> 01:18:55,006
SPEAKER_1:  lower.

01:18:56,994 --> 01:18:58,119
SPEAKER_0:  500,000

01:18:58,119 --> 01:18:58,526
SPEAKER_1:  lower.

01:18:59,618 --> 01:19:00,062
SPEAKER_1:  zero.

01:19:00,354 --> 01:19:00,926
SPEAKER_0:  Zero.

01:19:01,986 --> 01:19:02,814
SPEAKER_0:  And actually...

01:19:03,234 --> 01:19:04,126
SPEAKER_0:  two weeks ago.

01:19:04,642 --> 01:19:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  I paid at a Saints account.

01:19:07,138 --> 01:19:09,150
SPEAKER_0:  $862,000.

01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:10,558
SPEAKER_0:  Not in clothes.

01:19:10,818 --> 01:19:12,926
SPEAKER_0:  For me, from Balenciaga from the store.

01:19:13,474 --> 01:19:14,718
SPEAKER_0:  in royalties.

01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:16,222
SPEAKER_0:  to Balenciaga.

01:19:16,802 --> 01:19:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  where the deal had been engineered.

01:19:19,394 --> 01:19:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  where I was coming out of my pocket. So I paid, last year I paid Demna.

01:19:24,642 --> 01:19:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  $3 million.

01:19:27,042 --> 01:19:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  to.

01:19:28,866 --> 01:19:33,950
SPEAKER_0:  to design the collection, right? And we got it out of the Gap Marketing Fund.

01:19:34,626 --> 01:19:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  and he was going to deliver 160 skews or 120 skews. 100 skews are separate items of clothing.

01:19:42,402 --> 01:19:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, so...

01:19:44,578 --> 01:19:46,014
SPEAKER_0:  uh, styles of clothing.

01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:49,278
SPEAKER_0:  So he ended up delivering about 60.

01:19:50,306 --> 01:19:53,982
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like we're on the people's court because we actually are, right? In the court of public opinion.

01:19:55,810 --> 01:19:56,542
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:19:56,834 --> 01:19:58,622
SPEAKER_0:  So he delivered about 60.

01:19:58,978 --> 01:20:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  There were all kinds of people that were working on it. Part of the reason why I had to get Demna

01:20:02,946 --> 01:20:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  Like I didn't want to have to, I wanted to compete with him.

01:20:06,338 --> 01:20:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  I don't want to have to like get him.

01:20:08,258 --> 01:20:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  You know, when I made Stronger, I did it to compete with Timbaland. An- and dealer man like Timbaland really did a great job doing that.

01:20:12,642 --> 01:20:14,398
SPEAKER_0:  Justin Timberlake because.

01:20:14,786 --> 01:20:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  my fiance at that time, like Justin Timberlake, just a little bit too much.

01:20:18,242 --> 01:20:18,782
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:20:19,202 --> 01:20:20,286
SPEAKER_0:  I made it to compete.

01:20:20,578 --> 01:20:22,110
SPEAKER_0:  And then we have the song out.

01:20:22,626 --> 01:20:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  It's number one on Apple.

01:20:24,258 --> 01:20:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  I play it in a club and it sounds muddy.

01:20:27,234 --> 01:20:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  It doesn't sound the way...

01:20:30,050 --> 01:20:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  Sexy back sounded in the club.

01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  So I go to...

01:20:35,490 --> 01:20:36,094
SPEAKER_0:  for real.

01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  Williams to-

01:20:38,146 --> 01:20:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  to.

01:20:39,042 --> 01:20:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  Do the drums.

01:20:40,514 --> 01:20:48,030
SPEAKER_0:  and it doesn't, it sounds like a different record. And so it can't be a different record because I'm like, I'm gonna swap it out on radio, right? Then I go to.

01:20:48,514 --> 01:20:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  Swiss beats, it sounds like a different record. I go to Timbaland, the person who did Sexyback.

01:20:54,402 --> 01:20:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  And...

01:20:55,842 --> 01:20:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  P.

01:20:57,122 --> 01:20:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  He did it.

01:20:59,394 --> 01:21:00,574
SPEAKER_0:  in five minutes.

01:21:00,962 --> 01:21:05,406
SPEAKER_0:  and then spent the rest of the hour talking about how nobody could have done it except for him.

01:21:06,114 --> 01:21:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  running around the studio.

01:21:07,490 --> 01:21:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  I'm the best. No one could've, that's why he had to go to me. He had to go to the king. Well he had a point, right?

01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  He had a point, right? So-

01:21:15,714 --> 01:21:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  What makes the song muddy? Is it the beat? It was in the drums. It was something that Timberland had in those drums. Like now.

01:21:21,538 --> 01:21:22,270
SPEAKER_0:  Watch this.

01:21:23,586 --> 01:21:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  I said I'm going.

01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  DEF CON 3, right?

01:21:27,330 --> 01:21:28,542
SPEAKER_0:  and the actual

01:21:29,026 --> 01:21:32,254
SPEAKER_0:  I spelled it wrong, I have a tendency to do that, I'm not quite John Legend.

01:21:32,514 --> 01:21:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  tight sweater level.

01:21:33,986 --> 01:21:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  spelling B.

01:21:35,586 --> 01:21:35,966
SPEAKER_0:  level.

01:21:36,322 --> 01:21:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  So I feel a parallel.

01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:40,670
SPEAKER_0:  to me going to Timberland.

01:21:41,442 --> 01:21:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  to when I said, hey, you as an engineer.

01:21:44,450 --> 01:21:45,534
SPEAKER_0:  I need to work with you.

01:21:45,826 --> 01:21:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  as an engineer that is Jewish.

01:21:48,418 --> 01:21:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  to.

01:21:49,666 --> 01:21:52,254
SPEAKER_0:  Look at these contracts and what my people

01:21:52,866 --> 01:21:54,622
SPEAKER_0:  Not just black people, let's say artists.

01:21:54,978 --> 01:21:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  are dealing with in our contracts.

01:21:56,994 --> 01:21:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  These contracts need to be fixed.

01:21:59,394 --> 01:22:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  Everyone could be so mad at the messenger, right? Yay, you said it the wrong way.

01:22:05,922 --> 01:22:14,718
SPEAKER_0:  You're offensive. You're like Hitler now, because you said it. You said this out loud, but it does not, you're, you weren't getting enough sleep.

01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  All this shit.

01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  Does not.

01:22:17,922 --> 01:22:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  negate the fact.

01:22:20,226 --> 01:22:22,686
SPEAKER_0:  that we do have Houston, we have a problem.

01:22:23,906 --> 01:22:26,302
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, but we is just the music industry.

01:22:27,618 --> 01:22:30,302
SPEAKER_1:  There's a lot of hate that was created by just saying that, you know?

01:22:30,850 --> 01:22:38,595
SPEAKER_0:  But you're saying what is just is everything to me, right? Yeah, yeah. One person can mean everything to me, right? And for George,

01:22:38,595 --> 01:22:43,454
SPEAKER_1:  Bush winning an election was everything. And then when you said George Bush doesn't care about black people.

01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:45,790
SPEAKER_1:  that you woke him up.

01:22:46,178 --> 01:22:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  You woke the people up to the fact that he was narrowly being selfish.

01:22:50,658 --> 01:22:51,294
SPEAKER_1:  You are-

01:22:51,650 --> 01:22:55,134
SPEAKER_1:  There's a sense to which you're being corrupted by your own greatness.

01:22:55,426 --> 01:22:58,526
SPEAKER_1:  that you're focusing too much on the industry that you've made great.

01:22:59,106 --> 01:23:00,702
SPEAKER_1:  that you've roasted the very top.

01:23:01,282 --> 01:23:03,454

01:23:03,842 --> 01:23:06,718

01:25:14,786 --> 01:25:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  Me and Dem lonely speaking Shrek.

01:25:16,610 --> 01:25:19,902

01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:23,230
SPEAKER_1:  You are one of the great fashion designers of our time.

01:25:24,130 --> 01:25:24,638

SPEAKER_1:  about it.

01:25:26,946 --> 01:25:27,966
SPEAKER_1:  Do you have a philosophy?

01:25:28,386 --> 01:25:30,654
SPEAKER_0:  You know what I like about the zipper is

01:25:31,746 --> 01:25:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  The zipper hoodie replaces the dress shirt.

01:25:36,482 --> 01:25:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  Cause you could get on your douchebag shit and like unzip it and give it a little bit of

01:25:41,378 --> 01:25:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  You know, that type of look.

01:25:43,298 --> 01:25:45,150
SPEAKER_0:  and which is the douchebag.

01:25:45,442 --> 01:25:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  You know, like when the douchebags would go to Vegas and unbutton their dress shirt? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:25:51,202 --> 01:25:53,502
SPEAKER_0:  and the problem with the pullover hoodie

01:25:54,082 --> 01:25:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  is...

01:25:55,938 --> 01:26:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  you can't do the douchebag thing where you unbutton it, but then still get the stomach. Because the thing is, the ultimate look would be like...

01:26:03,938 --> 01:26:05,406
SPEAKER_0:  You know, military tank.

01:26:06,306 --> 01:26:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  pullover hoodie.

01:26:07,618 --> 01:26:08,958
SPEAKER_0:  And if you get a little hot.

01:26:09,378 --> 01:26:10,526
SPEAKER_0:  You take off the hoodie.

01:26:10,754 --> 01:26:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  but you're like crazy in shape.

01:26:14,114 --> 01:26:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  So it gives you that flexibility. Yeah, it's given the zippers, given some flexibility and it's like.

01:26:19,298 --> 01:26:24,254
SPEAKER_0:  maybe you want to keep your jacket on, like this considered like a hoodie to be like a jacket.

01:26:24,578 --> 01:26:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  If you want to keep your jacket on.

01:26:26,562 --> 01:26:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  then

01:26:28,962 --> 01:26:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  You might wanna do this.

01:26:30,466 --> 01:26:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  as opposed to pulling it all the way off.

01:26:32,322 --> 01:26:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  You know, so...

01:26:34,338 --> 01:26:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  And it's just comfort, but then you get...

01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

01:26:38,818 --> 01:26:40,798
SPEAKER_0:  Can I do a jogging pant on this?

01:26:41,122 --> 01:26:44,254
SPEAKER_0:  with elasticity. Now people argue about climate.

01:26:44,898 --> 01:26:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  where we are with the climate.

01:26:47,522 --> 01:26:51,134
SPEAKER_0:  I take responsibility as being the most influential.

01:26:52,258 --> 01:26:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  designer.

01:26:53,666 --> 01:26:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  of all time.

01:26:55,234 --> 01:26:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  uh... to

01:26:57,314 --> 01:26:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:26:58,946 --> 01:27:00,766
SPEAKER_0:  to say we're going to use biodegradable.

01:27:01,346 --> 01:27:02,206
SPEAKER_0:  uh... clothing

01:27:02,722 --> 01:27:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  Now the issue there is...

01:27:04,930 --> 01:27:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:27:06,786 --> 01:27:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  The elastic.

01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  is not biodegradable.

01:27:12,162 --> 01:27:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  So that means it's actually better to use.

01:27:15,298 --> 01:27:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  jeans and a belt.

01:27:17,986 --> 01:27:19,870
SPEAKER_0:  than to have an elastic waistband.

01:27:21,186 --> 01:27:23,422
SPEAKER_0:  because the elastic waistband is not biodegradable.

01:27:24,450 --> 01:27:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:27:25,506 --> 01:27:26,110
SPEAKER_0:  I...

01:27:26,434 --> 01:27:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  use the planet.

01:27:28,738 --> 01:27:31,294
SPEAKER_0:  as a big the future of the planet is a

01:27:31,522 --> 01:27:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  BIG. Peace.

01:27:33,314 --> 01:27:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  of

01:27:35,394 --> 01:27:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  the way I engineer.

01:27:37,634 --> 01:27:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  and the way we talk about where designs are going.

01:27:39,842 --> 01:27:43,006
SPEAKER_1:  The constraints on your design and engineering is given by the-

01:27:43,778 --> 01:27:44,350
SPEAKER_1:  the future.

01:27:44,802 --> 01:27:45,150
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

01:27:47,074 --> 01:27:49,214
SPEAKER_0:  That could almost make Jewish people like me again.

01:27:52,418 --> 01:27:54,302
SPEAKER_1:  Every time you say Jewish people.

01:27:54,786 --> 01:27:58,558
SPEAKER_1:  I think I've been maybe reading a little too much about Warlord 2, but...

01:27:59,010 --> 01:27:59,486
SPEAKER_1:  Man.

01:28:00,162 --> 01:28:01,758
SPEAKER_1:  I'd recommend you listen to some.

01:28:02,498 --> 01:28:04,222
SPEAKER_1:  uh, audio books.

01:28:04,706 --> 01:28:07,998
SPEAKER_1:  or read some books on the Holocaust. Department of Humanities, in cooperation withNI August king toac

01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:10,110
SPEAKER_1:  It's heavy.

01:28:10,434 --> 01:28:11,102
SPEAKER_1:  It's heavy.

01:28:11,458 --> 01:28:12,094
SPEAKER_1:  It will put-

01:28:12,770 --> 01:28:13,854
SPEAKER_1:  into context.

01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:15,335
SPEAKER_1:  would you impact of your work

01:28:15,335 --> 01:28:22,014
SPEAKER_0:  Would you read books on the current holocaust that black people are in? I read...

01:28:22,402 --> 01:28:23,966
SPEAKER_0:  What have you read about abortion?

01:28:24,610 --> 01:28:25,086
SPEAKER_0:  I've...

01:28:25,602 --> 01:28:26,814
SPEAKER_1:  red.

01:28:27,106 --> 01:28:30,398
SPEAKER_1:  a lot of short form writing and I've listened to a lot of debates.

01:28:31,426 --> 01:28:32,798
SPEAKER_1:  because it's really humbling.

01:28:33,506 --> 01:28:34,142
SPEAKER_1:  that the

01:28:35,266 --> 01:28:36,030
SPEAKER_1:  The question of.

01:28:36,386 --> 01:28:37,854
SPEAKER_1:  When does life begin?

01:28:38,562 --> 01:28:40,222
SPEAKER_1:  is a really difficult question.

01:28:40,962 --> 01:28:42,846
SPEAKER_1:  for me as an engineer and scientist.

01:28:43,714 --> 01:28:45,342
SPEAKER_1:  It's a philosophical question.

01:28:45,666 --> 01:28:49,918
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, we could just go on population control, not like if abortion is right or wrong.

01:28:50,434 --> 01:28:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  We could say...

01:28:51,842 --> 01:28:52,670
SPEAKER_0:  Factually.

01:28:53,858 --> 01:28:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  the clinics were made by eugenics.

01:28:57,698 --> 01:28:59,166
SPEAKER_0:  for population control.

01:28:59,714 --> 01:29:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  and it is controlling the population as is the

01:29:03,138 --> 01:29:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  never being given a 40 acres and a mule, so you don't have the opportunity. And when the people that do have the opportunity are separated from our people, our tribe, and placed in suburban communities, next test, Chris Rock will put it, the dentist.

01:29:16,962 --> 01:29:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  and you know, whitewashed.

01:29:18,914 --> 01:29:22,686
SPEAKER_0:  and made to shut the fuck up and vote left or whatever.

01:29:22,946 --> 01:29:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  uh niggas are supposed to do when we make it.

01:29:25,666 --> 01:29:27,102

01:32:04,290 --> 01:32:06,846
SPEAKER_0:  professors that are actually intelligent.

01:32:07,202 --> 01:32:10,526
SPEAKER_0:  actually have multiple degrees that have been cancelled.

01:32:11,874 --> 01:32:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  from their schools.

01:32:13,890 --> 01:32:19,838
SPEAKER_0:  and they don't have a music industry or a fan base or shoe design or...

01:32:20,162 --> 01:32:22,590
SPEAKER_0:  smoking hot ex-wife to complain about.

01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  They've just got the truth of what they saw and what they dedicated to this country and to education.

01:32:29,954 --> 01:32:31,166
SPEAKER_0:  that has been muted.

01:32:31,714 --> 01:32:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

01:32:32,706 --> 01:32:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  scores.

01:32:33,762 --> 01:32:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  that have been taken over with an agenda.

01:32:36,258 --> 01:32:40,126
SPEAKER_0:  And so you want the brightest minds to be these professors.

01:32:40,578 --> 01:32:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  and then you mute them.

01:32:42,306 --> 01:32:44,062
SPEAKER_0:  and they have nowhere to go.

01:32:44,642 --> 01:32:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  and you might get...

01:32:46,146 --> 01:32:48,510
SPEAKER_0:  a guy now that went from being someone's

01:32:48,738 --> 01:32:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  favorite professor.

01:32:50,210 --> 01:32:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  to his

01:32:51,202 --> 01:32:52,478
SPEAKER_0:  Working at Starbucks.

01:32:52,834 --> 01:32:53,278
SPEAKER_0:  like

01:32:53,634 --> 01:32:56,286
SPEAKER_0:  Like he was back at school, or like he was back in high school.

01:32:57,410 --> 01:32:59,870
SPEAKER_1:  So even if that voice is about anger and hate.

01:33:00,674 --> 01:33:02,174
SPEAKER_1:  It still deserves to be heard.

01:33:04,322 --> 01:33:07,454
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it deserves to be heard, and we deserve to ask why.

01:33:07,746 --> 01:33:11,166
SPEAKER_0:  You know, like you have to ask why I just feel like that's what's.

01:33:11,554 --> 01:33:14,558
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like that is sympathizing Mr. Hugecock up beat.

01:33:14,914 --> 01:33:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  I'm just sayin'.

01:33:16,898 --> 01:33:17,758
SPEAKER_0:  that.

01:33:18,594 --> 01:33:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  It just needs to be.

01:33:21,090 --> 01:33:23,518
SPEAKER_1:  You should change that to your name on Twitter.

01:33:24,706 --> 01:33:26,581
SPEAKER_1:  While you're still out on there

01:33:26,581 --> 01:33:29,918
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. Do you think that would get censored? I feel like they'd...

01:33:30,178 --> 01:33:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  you know, they definitely cut it down some inches. the we

01:33:34,594 --> 01:33:36,990

SPEAKER_0:  Thanks for watching!

01:33:37,922 --> 01:33:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  I'm pointing out this truth.

01:33:40,098 --> 01:33:42,654
SPEAKER_0:  Now I'm serious, this is not a Christian thing, right?

01:33:43,138 --> 01:33:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhh...

01:33:45,442 --> 01:33:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  And...

01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I wonder right there when I say these jokes.

01:33:52,226 --> 01:33:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  Is it something that, because I do feel like laughter.

01:33:56,066 --> 01:33:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  is the key.

01:33:57,378 --> 01:33:59,070
SPEAKER_0:  Engineering and laughter, right?

01:33:59,298 --> 01:34:00,638
SPEAKER_0:  is the key to...

01:34:01,602 --> 01:34:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  Peace.

01:34:02,338 --> 01:34:04,190

SPEAKER_0:  And I have the nitrous.

01:34:06,882 --> 01:34:08,062
SPEAKER_0:  There's a...

01:34:09,282 --> 01:34:14,238
SPEAKER_0:  There's something that I want to go and hug Christian or I want to go and hug Corey Gamble. I want to go and hug.

SPEAKER_0:  and what about talking it out or is he gonna be screaming at me

01:34:30,562 --> 01:34:34,142

SPEAKER_0:  You know the thing is...

01:34:37,762 --> 01:34:39,422
SPEAKER_0:  I think Howard's just jealous.

01:34:40,770 --> 01:34:42,206
SPEAKER_0:  You know, not just.

01:34:42,690 --> 01:34:43,294

01:34:46,434 --> 01:34:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:34:48,642 --> 01:34:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  He's jealous that I started my campaign earlier than him.

01:34:52,834 --> 01:34:54,430
SPEAKER_1:  You gotta let go of that jealousy.

01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  You gotta let go of that jealousy, Howard.

01:34:57,282 --> 01:34:58,407
SPEAKER_0:  You got it.

01:34:58,407 --> 01:35:00,638
SPEAKER_1:  jealous jealous is a natural human thing man

01:35:00,994 --> 01:35:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  I wonder just as a Christian, right, when I joke and say this stuff, I...

01:35:06,018 --> 01:35:08,702
SPEAKER_0:  It's like, hmm, am I being disobedient?

01:35:08,962 --> 01:35:09,694
SPEAKER_0:  to God.

01:35:10,050 --> 01:35:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  Because as a boss, right, I'll talk to...

01:35:14,114 --> 01:35:14,686
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:35:16,226 --> 01:35:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  And...

01:35:17,314 --> 01:35:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  an employee and I'll be like, why didn't you just listen? Because I've got the bigger plan, right?

01:35:23,650 --> 01:35:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  So...

01:35:24,962 --> 01:35:28,894
SPEAKER_0:  It's like me talking to God, where the things that I did in this-

01:35:29,570 --> 01:35:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  Interview

01:35:30,594 --> 01:35:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  that were disobedient to God.

01:35:32,642 --> 01:35:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  and... and...

01:35:34,018 --> 01:35:34,974
SPEAKER_0:  For those things I-

01:35:35,202 --> 01:35:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  I pray.

01:35:36,450 --> 01:35:38,942
SPEAKER_0:  And I repent for anything that I've said that.

01:35:39,522 --> 01:35:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  was disobedient to God.

01:35:41,570 --> 01:35:42,974
SPEAKER_1:  But humor is not one of them.

01:35:43,682 --> 01:35:44,318
SPEAKER_1:  Jokings

01:35:44,642 --> 01:35:48,222
SPEAKER_1:  I feel like humor is the way we avoid so much suffering in the world.

01:35:48,450 --> 01:35:50,686
SPEAKER_1:  It's the way to, it's like a catalyst.

01:35:50,978 --> 01:35:52,926
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. For love. Like it's a way to-

01:35:53,474 --> 01:35:53,854
SPEAKER_1:  So

01:35:54,242 --> 01:35:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  People that have gone through some of the darkest trauma that I've ever met through war. I just came back from Ukraine.

01:36:00,610 --> 01:36:01,374
SPEAKER_1:  They're laughing.

01:36:02,530 --> 01:36:04,094
SPEAKER_1:  They're making jokes.

01:36:04,386 --> 01:36:06,622
SPEAKER_1:  That's the best way to deal with dark times.

01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:10,014
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know what it is about humans. I feel like humor.

01:36:11,170 --> 01:36:14,846
SPEAKER_1:  That's the best way to social engineer a good future, I think it's humor.

01:36:15,202 --> 01:36:19,390
SPEAKER_1:  Not taking shit too seriously. That's the problem with censorship, one of the things that really suffer.

01:36:20,002 --> 01:36:20,606
SPEAKER_1:  is humor.

01:36:21,122 --> 01:36:21,566
SPEAKER_1:  Jokes.

01:36:22,114 --> 01:36:23,646
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe going too far in the jokes.

01:36:23,874 --> 01:36:26,558
SPEAKER_1:  You mentioned Anthony Jeselnik. That guy goes hard.

01:36:27,266 --> 01:36:29,246
SPEAKER_1:  That guy goes really hard and it's great.

01:36:29,570 --> 01:36:33,726
SPEAKER_1:  He crosses all the lines and that's why he's a genius.

01:36:34,082 --> 01:36:36,382
SPEAKER_1:  And that's what people feels refreshing when he does it.

01:36:37,474 --> 01:36:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know what it is. But then is it like hurtful when I do it?

01:36:40,546 --> 01:36:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  But I'll tell you something that was interesting. I'm pretty sure-

01:36:44,610 --> 01:36:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  Anthony doesn't like

01:36:46,786 --> 01:36:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  Sorry for the sub-shim.

01:36:48,066 --> 01:36:48,766
SPEAKER_0:  but just...

01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:51,070
SPEAKER_0:  Most comedians I know.

01:36:51,394 --> 01:36:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  didn't vote for Trump.

01:36:54,402 --> 01:37:00,931
SPEAKER_0:  That's interesting. I'm not saying there aren't communities that did, but just the ones I know, because I live in California, right? But they have an appreciation.

01:37:00,931 --> 01:37:03,262
SPEAKER_1:  for Trump because of the sense of humor.

01:37:04,034 --> 01:37:07,262
SPEAKER_1:  Gotta ask about parlor and engineering, cuz I'm interested about that.

01:37:07,490 --> 01:37:08,926
SPEAKER_1:  Dung dung dung dung.

01:37:10,722 --> 01:37:15,742
SPEAKER_1:  Hey man, I'm actually trying to hold it together. You're pretty offensive towards a lot.

01:37:16,578 --> 01:37:17,150
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:37:17,570 --> 01:37:21,695
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not looking to be offensive. I really want to bring people together and get these cells done. I'm not looking to be offensive.

01:37:21,695 --> 01:37:28,094
SPEAKER_1:  But the word I 100% I see your vision. How do we do somebody care? Well not don't say Jewish media

01:37:28,386 --> 01:37:28,990
SPEAKER_1:  and Jewish.

01:37:29,506 --> 01:37:30,686
SPEAKER_1:  Jewish controlled media.

01:37:31,042 --> 01:37:31,550
SPEAKER_1:  JM.

01:37:35,426 --> 01:37:37,662
SPEAKER_1:  Man, you sound like...

01:37:37,986 --> 01:37:42,462
SPEAKER_1:  It sounds too much like 1930s Nazi Germany.

01:37:42,850 --> 01:37:44,725
SPEAKER_1:  that was leading up to the atrocities.

01:37:44,725 --> 01:37:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, he would say jam.

01:37:47,170 --> 01:37:49,150
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, he was branded JM, that's right.

01:37:49,858 --> 01:37:52,766
SPEAKER_1:  No, it's just the implied.

01:37:53,282 --> 01:37:54,398
SPEAKER_1:  like this.

01:37:55,138 --> 01:37:56,414
SPEAKER_1:  Meme-ified.

01:37:59,202 --> 01:37:59,550
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:38:00,994 --> 01:38:02,174
SPEAKER_1:  prejudice towards a group.

01:38:02,562 --> 01:38:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  in a way that's going to lead to hate.

01:38:04,834 --> 01:38:08,062
SPEAKER_1:  And I know you don't mean that. I know you have love in your heart.

01:38:08,226 --> 01:38:11,102
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it was a prejudice towards a group that led to hate.

01:38:11,938 --> 01:38:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  BLM.

01:38:13,858 --> 01:38:14,494
SPEAKER_0:  BLM.

01:38:15,042 --> 01:38:16,222
SPEAKER_0:  took a black person.

01:38:17,346 --> 01:38:18,366
SPEAKER_0:  showed his deaf.

01:38:18,658 --> 01:38:19,582
SPEAKER_0:  on camera.

01:38:20,354 --> 01:38:21,182
SPEAKER_0:  Because...

01:38:21,730 --> 01:38:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

01:38:23,906 --> 01:38:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  There are examples of.

01:38:26,850 --> 01:38:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  us being killed and being killed on camera.

01:38:29,762 --> 01:38:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  but if it was spread on camera, it was done on purpose by.

01:38:34,050 --> 01:38:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  The Media.

01:38:35,394 --> 01:38:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  Because...

01:38:38,690 --> 01:38:41,406
SPEAKER_0:  14, 20 kids get killed in Chicago.

01:38:41,826 --> 01:38:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  every week.

01:38:43,106 --> 01:38:45,150
SPEAKER_0:  and it's not spread that much.

01:38:45,826 --> 01:38:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  day.

01:38:46,594 --> 01:38:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  Like you said.

01:38:48,034 --> 01:38:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  singled out a person.

01:38:50,274 --> 01:38:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  Directed everything on that person

01:38:52,642 --> 01:38:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  Right? As the martyr.

01:38:54,562 --> 01:38:55,230
SPEAKER_0:  And...

01:38:55,906 --> 01:38:56,990
SPEAKER_0:  Raise the people.

01:38:57,442 --> 01:38:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  That Hat and Hat.

01:38:58,946 --> 01:39:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  Annie, we didn't have our 40 acres and a mule. We didn't have.

01:39:01,762 --> 01:39:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  You know, like a lot of things, right? Like that black people have not.

01:39:05,218 --> 01:39:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  ever been given so once we've given just a little bit like

01:39:09,730 --> 01:39:11,486
SPEAKER_0:  Your life matters, right?

01:39:12,194 --> 01:39:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  Then.

01:39:13,090 --> 01:39:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  We literally like, oh, okay, now we're being heard.

01:39:17,154 --> 01:39:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  Right, but.

01:39:18,882 --> 01:39:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  Actually, the deaf.

01:39:20,098 --> 01:39:20,830
SPEAKER_0:  Toll is up.

01:39:21,922 --> 01:39:22,558
SPEAKER_0:  The city.

01:39:22,818 --> 01:39:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:39:23,650 --> 01:39:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  where this happened.

01:39:24,770 --> 01:39:27,486
SPEAKER_0:  It's completely been turned to a war zone. They actually-

01:39:28,546 --> 01:39:31,198
SPEAKER_0:  It's actually something like Candace Owens can actually...

01:39:32,450 --> 01:39:33,758
SPEAKER_0:  specify this better.

01:39:34,146 --> 01:39:34,558
SPEAKER_0:  But it's.

01:39:34,978 --> 01:39:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  like its own city or something?

01:39:37,794 --> 01:39:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  They made it not be a part of the actual state or something. It's like...

01:39:41,218 --> 01:39:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  like DC and Service Psych.

01:39:43,298 --> 01:39:46,014
SPEAKER_0:  It's like Washington DC now and stuff like that.

01:39:46,370 --> 01:39:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  has to be from a.

01:39:48,034 --> 01:39:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  government.

01:39:50,338 --> 01:39:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  You know, that's got-

01:39:53,570 --> 01:39:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  higher level agenda.

01:39:55,458 --> 01:39:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  written all over it.

01:39:57,058 --> 01:39:59,326
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, they're using the death of an individual.

01:39:59,554 --> 01:39:59,870

SPEAKER_1:  and pushes it towards whatever narrative.

01:40:15,202 --> 01:40:16,926
SPEAKER_1:  that gets more clicks and views and so on.

01:40:17,346 --> 01:40:19,006
SPEAKER_1:  Sure, and then politicians do the same.

01:40:19,298 --> 01:40:22,110
SPEAKER_1:  They use the media, they influence the media to tell a story.

01:40:22,786 --> 01:40:23,646
SPEAKER_1:  and uh...

01:40:24,002 --> 01:40:25,630
SPEAKER_0:  This is a simple thing I'll put.

01:40:26,146 --> 01:40:27,454
SPEAKER_0:  I believe that...

01:40:29,186 --> 01:40:32,126
SPEAKER_0:  the idea of anti-Semitism.

01:40:32,450 --> 01:40:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:40:33,986 --> 01:40:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  the closeness.

01:40:36,226 --> 01:40:36,862

SPEAKER_0:  Bye!

01:40:43,906 --> 01:40:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  certain individuals in media.

01:40:46,722 --> 01:40:48,926
SPEAKER_0:  to not take accountability.

01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:50,046
SPEAKER_0:  4

01:40:50,818 --> 01:40:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  The bad things that...

01:40:52,290 --> 01:40:53,246
SPEAKER_0:  that are happening.

01:40:53,954 --> 01:40:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  And...

01:40:55,682 --> 01:40:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  What's happening is there's a new frontier, right? Meaning like...

01:40:59,202 --> 01:41:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  It used to be...

01:41:00,418 --> 01:41:04,702
SPEAKER_0:  okay for somebody to be a billionaire. we thought about a billionaire

01:41:05,250 --> 01:41:05,726
SPEAKER_0:  Right.

01:41:06,242 --> 01:41:11,198
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of times you think I'm actually kind of being out of shape and, you know, 20 years ago, 30 years ago.

01:41:11,714 --> 01:41:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  Like.

01:41:12,546 --> 01:41:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, NASA's something like you thought about a different way. Now you think about it, but you think about.

01:41:16,738 --> 01:41:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  Elon, Kim, think yay, you think...

01:41:20,354 --> 01:41:24,702
SPEAKER_0:  It's a new kind of billionaire. You know, it's not just Soros is a billionaire. It's a new.

01:41:24,962 --> 01:41:26,174
SPEAKER_0:  form a billionaire will

01:41:27,170 --> 01:41:29,310
SPEAKER_0:  Right now and I'm calling for...

01:41:29,698 --> 01:41:32,126
SPEAKER_0:  the industry is I'm calling it.

01:41:32,354 --> 01:41:34,462
SPEAKER_0:  I'm calling the industry out and saying like, hey.

01:41:35,042 --> 01:41:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  It just so happens that...

01:41:37,602 --> 01:41:39,102
SPEAKER_0:  There's been times where I had.

01:41:39,714 --> 01:41:46,206
SPEAKER_0:  my lawyer was Jewish, my regulator was Jewish, but like eight people that basically would collude and talk without me.

01:41:46,562 --> 01:41:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  We're in groups.

01:41:48,290 --> 01:41:53,662
SPEAKER_0:  saying, okay, this is what the tour is gonna be. This is his next house. And they were making all these decisions and they're making.

01:41:54,018 --> 01:41:57,118
SPEAKER_0:  all this money and at the end I was like I ended my tour and I don't have the money.

01:41:57,538 --> 01:42:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  And it just so happens that that's the case of what they were, but what I'm saying is-

01:42:01,858 --> 01:42:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  If everyone can say

01:42:04,002 --> 01:42:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  Hey, you can't point out this fact.

01:42:06,850 --> 01:42:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  or we're gonna say you're anti-Semitic and we're gonna call you Hitler.

01:42:10,594 --> 01:42:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  I feel that there has to be at least

01:42:13,218 --> 01:42:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  1% of safeguarding.

01:42:16,034 --> 01:42:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  The ability...

01:42:17,538 --> 01:42:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  to screw the artist.

01:42:19,746 --> 01:42:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  based on saying it's anti-Semitic by pointing out that they just so happen.

01:42:24,642 --> 01:42:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  to all B.

01:42:26,082 --> 01:42:26,942
SPEAKER_0:  uh... jewish

01:42:28,098 --> 01:42:32,030
SPEAKER_0:  And I don't think that's anti-Semitism. I just think that's, hey.

01:42:32,290 --> 01:42:35,262
SPEAKER_0:  This is another thing, like, okay, the Kardashians.

01:42:35,490 --> 01:42:36,478
SPEAKER_0:  When you hear that...

01:42:37,058 --> 01:42:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  Do you think male or do you think female?

01:42:40,162 --> 01:42:41,054
SPEAKER_0:  You think female?

01:42:41,602 --> 01:42:47,102
SPEAKER_0:  You get what I'm saying? You think this is the realities. This is why rap works, right? They're going to make an anti-

01:42:47,714 --> 01:42:51,806
SPEAKER_0:  Women thing in a second, right? And it's going to say, well, if you point out.

01:42:52,130 --> 01:42:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  that.

01:42:53,186 --> 01:43:00,030
SPEAKER_0:  These five women, six women, are having a meeting on where the Christmas party is, and none of the ballplayers are rappers.

01:43:00,258 --> 01:43:05,022
SPEAKER_0:  that they have babies with have any say so, so that Christmas happened at Courtney's house.

01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  all eight years when I was there, and it never happened at anyone else's black family.

01:43:10,498 --> 01:43:11,006
SPEAKER_0:  house.

01:43:11,426 --> 01:43:11,838
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

01:43:12,674 --> 01:43:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  If I'm the one that pointed it out.

01:43:14,402 --> 01:43:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  They just don't have.

01:43:15,842 --> 01:43:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  They don't have their, oh, you're anti-Semitic.

01:43:18,338 --> 01:43:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  WERK!

01:43:19,202 --> 01:43:20,638
SPEAKER_0:  to say shut the fuck up.

01:43:21,154 --> 01:43:25,086
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, but this is the way it runs. Is this the way we want to do it? You say.

01:43:25,954 --> 01:43:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  though that-

01:43:27,042 --> 01:43:29,726
SPEAKER_1:  Women are silencing the black voice.

01:43:30,434 --> 01:43:33,342
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, you're going to get the same response, but.

01:43:33,858 --> 01:43:35,733
SPEAKER_1:  especially if historically

01:43:35,733 --> 01:43:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  What about the fact that it's true?

01:43:38,818 --> 01:43:39,614
SPEAKER_1:  when you talk.

01:43:39,874 --> 01:43:40,862
SPEAKER_1:  in groups.

01:43:41,730 --> 01:43:42,654
SPEAKER_1:  that breeds hate.

01:43:43,650 --> 01:43:46,275
SPEAKER_1:  When you talk about individuals, it solves problems.

01:43:46,275 --> 01:43:50,846
SPEAKER_0:  You're an engineering. Okay, but this is something I pointed out on Pierce.

01:43:51,170 --> 01:43:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  I said.

01:43:52,162 --> 01:43:54,718
SPEAKER_0:  If a black person gets pulled over with a car...

01:43:55,234 --> 01:43:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  and it's three other people in the car.

01:43:57,090 --> 01:43:59,326
SPEAKER_0:  They're also going to jail.

01:43:59,618 --> 01:44:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  They're not going to single them out.

01:44:02,210 --> 01:44:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  They're gonna say you guys are all in collusion.

01:44:04,802 --> 01:44:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  I just described collusion.

01:44:07,138 --> 01:44:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  five times in this interview.

01:44:09,858 --> 01:44:14,078
SPEAKER_0:  And you keep on going back to this is like 1930.

01:44:14,370 --> 01:44:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  This is like this, this is like that. What I'm saying is look.

01:44:18,562 --> 01:44:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  I want to work with you as an engineer.

01:44:22,306 --> 01:44:34,238
SPEAKER_0:  free my people. Can we start as a being with engineer opportunities right here? I am sorry to the people who had to be hurt and affected.

01:44:34,498 --> 01:44:35,294
SPEAKER_0:  By that.

01:44:35,746 --> 01:44:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  NOW!

01:44:36,706 --> 01:44:37,342
SPEAKER_0:  Wee.

SPEAKER_0:  are here.

01:44:39,426 --> 01:44:41,086
SPEAKER_0:  and I'm looking to solve it.

01:44:41,538 --> 01:44:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  But what happens is every time if I talk to any of these business people one by one, because mind you, I didn't get to the tweet by not having a conversation.

01:44:50,594 --> 01:44:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  I had the conversations beforehand before I got to the tweet.

01:44:54,050 --> 01:44:56,254
SPEAKER_0:  Now, we gonna take it to the stage.

01:44:56,610 --> 01:45:02,814
SPEAKER_0:  Now we're on the world stage, right? And you saw Ari Emanuel do exactly the kind of thing.

01:45:03,202 --> 01:45:07,902
SPEAKER_0:  that I was saying had been done behind closed doors. Now he's doing it and opened doors.

01:45:08,290 --> 01:45:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  They told Candace Owens...

01:45:09,794 --> 01:45:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  I couldn't be.

01:45:11,330 --> 01:45:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  on the daily wire.

01:45:12,994 --> 01:45:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  Like you can't even explain yourself.

01:45:16,450 --> 01:45:19,326
SPEAKER_0:  And we don't care how you got to that point either.

01:45:19,650 --> 01:45:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  And that's fucked up!

01:45:21,794 --> 01:45:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  They told.

01:45:22,594 --> 01:45:23,719
SPEAKER_1:  You can't be on day-

01:45:23,719 --> 01:45:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  She said even about, yeah she did. That's what they said.

01:45:27,266 --> 01:45:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  And you know what?

01:45:28,546 --> 01:45:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  And you can have my voice raised or lower. I'm going to do it lower, right? Because what's happening to me by-

01:45:33,890 --> 01:45:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  I put in your words.

01:45:35,426 --> 01:45:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  The media is saying.

01:45:38,114 --> 01:45:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  Not only.

01:45:40,258 --> 01:45:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  Can you not explain yourself?

01:45:42,210 --> 01:45:44,190
SPEAKER_0:  We don't care how you got to that point.

01:45:44,546 --> 01:45:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  You need to apologize and you can't explain and that's the end of the story. So just apologize so we can have Mel Gibson do some more films.

01:45:52,546 --> 01:45:57,246
SPEAKER_0:  is exactly what Ari Emanuel was saying. No one is looking to change.

01:45:57,506 --> 01:46:04,894
SPEAKER_0:  the problem that led so many people to that same level of frustration. And I just so happen to be the one that's not gonna back up on it.

01:46:05,314 --> 01:46:07,550
SPEAKER_0:  until this changes.

01:46:08,258 --> 01:46:20,862
SPEAKER_0:  You know what? I'm sorry I had a sleepy text. I'm sorry I would. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I put, uh, that I was, uh, 512 or 511 on, uh...

01:46:21,186 --> 01:46:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  Tinder.

01:46:22,018 --> 01:46:27,742
SPEAKER_0:  Okay. My cock is not 14 inches. I lied. Okay. It's only 13. Yeah. So.

01:46:28,034 --> 01:46:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  I'm sorry, right? So the... Hahahaha

01:46:32,258 --> 01:46:34,133
SPEAKER_1:  I dropping so many facts.

01:46:34,133 --> 01:46:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  So what I'm saying is, but where do we get to this? Because even you...

01:46:38,978 --> 01:46:41,406
SPEAKER_0:  as engineering, as intelligent as you are.

01:46:41,794 --> 01:46:45,214
SPEAKER_0:  You, just like everyone else that I say was colluding.

01:46:45,570 --> 01:46:48,030
SPEAKER_0:  won't let us get to the point of fixing it.

01:46:48,642 --> 01:46:49,767
SPEAKER_0:  But I'm not.

01:46:49,767 --> 01:46:51,454
SPEAKER_1:  I think you're more powerful than the media.

01:46:51,714 --> 01:46:54,910
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not saying you need to apologize because the media, I'm saying.

01:46:55,458 --> 01:46:58,590
SPEAKER_1:  everything we've been talking about just because I care for you and I want you to be.

01:46:58,978 --> 01:47:00,222
SPEAKER_1:  the best possible.

01:47:00,450 --> 01:47:01,502
SPEAKER_1:  man you can be.

01:47:01,762 --> 01:47:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  To me, a definition of a great man.

01:47:03,842 --> 01:47:05,342
SPEAKER_1:  I'm with Martin Luther King on this.

01:47:05,666 --> 01:47:11,422
SPEAKER_1:  You don't talk about Jews or black people. You talk about engineering, you talk about humanity, you solve problems.

01:47:11,650 --> 01:47:13,118
SPEAKER_1:  You identify the problems in the world?

01:47:13,410 --> 01:47:13,950
SPEAKER_1:  and you don't.

01:47:14,242 --> 01:47:17,086
SPEAKER_1:  come from a place of resentment. This group did this this

01:47:17,378 --> 01:47:18,046
SPEAKER_1:  Fuck all that.

01:47:18,530 --> 01:47:20,094
SPEAKER_1:  uh... that is in the past

01:47:20,322 --> 01:47:21,694
SPEAKER_1:  You just build solutions.

01:47:22,210 --> 01:47:29,022
SPEAKER_1:  I'm gonna create a new record label. I'm gonna create a new design firm. I'm gonna create a new social network. I'm gonna do it better. I'm gonna do it right.

01:47:29,314 --> 01:47:33,735
SPEAKER_1:  I'm gonna do it right by the people that I know don't have a voice. I'm gonna give them a voice and talk.

01:47:33,735 --> 01:47:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  about that. Is it okay to call out collusion?

01:47:36,706 --> 01:47:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  Do people collude in your business under you, like the engineers that come together and like say, they collude against the bosses, right? You know why Bernardo Noh offered the deal and took it away from me?

01:47:46,242 --> 01:47:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  Collusion

01:47:48,098 --> 01:47:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  because I was too powerful.

01:47:49,730 --> 01:47:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  with the collective that I had right there.

01:47:51,778 --> 01:47:53,406
SPEAKER_0:  He had to stop that at all costs.

01:47:53,666 --> 01:47:56,254
SPEAKER_0:  They said, for whatever reason, this kid, yay.

01:47:56,674 --> 01:47:59,294
SPEAKER_0:  It has the ability to have all of the Kardashians.

01:47:59,714 --> 01:48:00,926
SPEAKER_0:  Jay Z and Beyonce.

01:48:01,314 --> 01:48:07,134
SPEAKER_0:  Justin Bieber, Demna, Virgil, all these people in the same room working towards the same goal.

01:48:07,938 --> 01:48:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  I've been that person.

01:48:10,146 --> 01:48:11,006
SPEAKER_0:  since preschool.

01:48:11,554 --> 01:48:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  That's called a leader, right?

01:48:13,410 --> 01:48:14,398
SPEAKER_0:  And right now...

01:48:14,946 --> 01:48:15,998
SPEAKER_0:  What I'm saying is...

01:48:17,122 --> 01:48:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  Hey.

01:48:18,978 --> 01:48:20,254
SPEAKER_0:  for the people in business.

01:48:20,546 --> 01:48:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  whatever their background is, whether they turn their cell phones off on Friday or not.

01:48:26,242 --> 01:48:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  There's been some bad business done. There's some bad business practices.

01:48:29,634 --> 01:48:30,782
SPEAKER_0:  and we have to change that.

01:48:31,106 --> 01:48:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  Because...

01:48:32,578 --> 01:48:34,430
SPEAKER_0:  This game is like boxing.

01:48:34,850 --> 01:48:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  more people end up retarded than rich.

01:48:38,818 --> 01:48:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm saying like...

01:48:40,258 --> 01:48:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  beat to a pulp, driven crazy.

01:48:42,658 --> 01:48:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  beat by the media to a pulp. Right now the media has done everything they could.

01:48:47,394 --> 01:48:54,046
SPEAKER_0:  to make me apologize and to make me look crazy. And that one person has done anything to find out.

01:48:54,274 --> 01:48:56,030
SPEAKER_0:  why I was frustrated enough.

01:48:56,258 --> 01:48:58,334
SPEAKER_0:  to do that tweet and that's facts.

01:48:58,562 --> 01:48:59,454
SPEAKER_0:  And that's fucked up.

01:49:00,546 --> 01:49:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I-

01:49:01,218 --> 01:49:09,406
SPEAKER_1:  I was hoping to, I am finding out, we found out. I mean, but like, I want solutions. Like, see, there's something about human nature where if you focus too much on resentment,

01:49:09,762 --> 01:49:11,454
SPEAKER_0:  We're not focusing on any more!

01:49:11,714 --> 01:49:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  Fuck the resentment, we're moving forward.

01:49:13,922 --> 01:49:18,814
SPEAKER_1:  Right. So there's two things I think that are required for, I mean, this is how I've lived my life.

01:49:19,138 --> 01:49:21,310
SPEAKER_1:  for great engineering. You surround yourself.

01:49:22,018 --> 01:49:22,814
SPEAKER_1:  personal life.

01:49:23,586 --> 01:49:24,766
SPEAKER_1:  by people you trust.

01:49:25,666 --> 01:49:29,726
SPEAKER_1:  And then in your professional life, from the engineer perspective with the team.

01:49:30,690 --> 01:49:31,806
SPEAKER_1:  with an incredible team.

01:49:32,482 --> 01:49:35,774
SPEAKER_1:  and everything else doesn't matter. That allows you not to focus on other groups.

01:49:36,034 --> 01:49:37,310
SPEAKER_1:  how they're fucking you over.

01:49:37,602 --> 01:49:44,478
SPEAKER_1:  how they're like trying to manipulate a collude and all that kind of stuff. You focus on solutions and you find a way around all the difficult shit.

01:49:45,506 --> 01:49:48,318
SPEAKER_1:  That's it. If you have people in your life you can trust.

01:49:50,050 --> 01:49:53,438
SPEAKER_1:  That's like lifelong. You said like some people you're with for the summer.

01:49:54,530 --> 01:49:55,134
SPEAKER_1:  for a year.

01:49:55,714 --> 01:49:57,502
SPEAKER_1:  Find people you can be with for your whole life.

01:49:58,114 --> 01:49:59,198
SPEAKER_1:  Do you have people in your life?

01:49:59,586 --> 01:50:00,414
SPEAKER_1:  that you trust.

01:50:00,834 --> 01:50:01,630
SPEAKER_0:  I can really trust.

01:50:02,946 --> 01:50:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  No, I trust God.

01:50:05,634 --> 01:50:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  at any point a human being.

01:50:08,098 --> 01:50:09,246
SPEAKER_0:  Can you, like, I could like...

01:50:09,826 --> 01:50:11,678
SPEAKER_0:  If I like go and like...

01:50:13,282 --> 01:50:14,270
SPEAKER_0:  Really?

01:50:15,010 --> 01:50:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  you know, treat this guy like a piece of shit or do this, that, that, that. Am I supposed to?

01:50:19,618 --> 01:50:20,670
SPEAKER_0:  You know, trust him.

01:50:21,090 --> 01:50:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  to be.

01:50:22,114 --> 01:50:26,430
SPEAKER_0:  loyal and stay in the situation or I trust people to be people and people are flawed.

01:50:26,978 --> 01:50:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  and people can have the right intentions.

01:50:28,930 --> 01:50:29,726
SPEAKER_0:  but it only makes

01:50:30,018 --> 01:50:30,558
SPEAKER_0:  since

01:50:30,786 --> 01:50:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  for us to work together when our agendas align.

01:50:33,858 --> 01:50:35,390
SPEAKER_0:  when Kim was pulled.

01:50:36,098 --> 01:50:37,150
SPEAKER_0:  really far.

01:50:37,538 --> 01:50:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  to the left.

01:50:39,458 --> 01:50:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  Our agenda's no longer.

01:50:41,474 --> 01:50:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  you know, aligned.

01:50:42,658 --> 01:50:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  So that made the marriage.

01:50:44,834 --> 01:50:45,534
SPEAKER_0:  Impossible.

01:50:45,922 --> 01:50:50,590
SPEAKER_0:  in a line where it's like, oh, I could wear a red hat that can help her to get Alice Johnson out of jail.

01:50:50,882 --> 01:50:54,046
SPEAKER_0:  because Trump's willing to do that for my wife because.

01:50:54,338 --> 01:50:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  I was the only person in my position that stood up and said, Waste a guy like you.

01:50:59,202 --> 01:51:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  You know, because...

01:51:00,386 --> 01:51:03,742
SPEAKER_1:  But isn't the deeper agenda the human agenda of just being in love?

01:51:04,866 --> 01:51:07,491
SPEAKER_1:  That's just politics. What you're talking about, red hat is just politics.

01:51:07,491 --> 01:51:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  right?

01:51:08,354 --> 01:51:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, the world is becoming more and more transactional every day and actually.

01:51:12,322 --> 01:51:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  Marriages are actually, actually originally based on transactions.

01:51:15,970 --> 01:51:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  And that's why they're less needed, the more autonomous as we.

01:51:19,746 --> 01:51:26,334
SPEAKER_0:  or the world makes it less needed. I feel like we do need each other. I feel like we do need someone we can always.

01:51:26,946 --> 01:51:27,838
SPEAKER_0:  You know, count on.

01:51:28,162 --> 01:51:29,118
SPEAKER_0:  It's a NBA.

01:51:29,378 --> 01:51:30,558
SPEAKER_0:  pulled away by...

01:51:30,978 --> 01:51:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  Cancopa, which is...

01:51:32,738 --> 01:51:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  the media, the politics, the promise, oh, we're gonna keep you safe. So the thing, the reason why I get.

01:51:38,626 --> 01:51:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  really frustrated with Chris Generous.

01:51:41,922 --> 01:51:44,062
SPEAKER_0:  She says losing Rob Kardashian.

01:51:44,514 --> 01:51:46,494
SPEAKER_0:  was the greatest mistake of her life.

01:51:46,754 --> 01:51:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  but she never gave Kim's hand over in marriage.

01:51:49,634 --> 01:51:50,814
SPEAKER_0:  Because this is the bottom line.

01:51:51,618 --> 01:51:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  when

01:51:52,258 --> 01:51:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  Me and Kim Matt, we were millionaires or whatever, right?

01:51:56,130 --> 01:51:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  You're telling me.

01:51:57,538 --> 01:51:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  You just hand her hand over in marriage.

01:52:00,162 --> 01:52:00,510
SPEAKER_0:  that.

01:52:00,770 --> 01:52:02,046
SPEAKER_0:  Your daughter's not successful?

01:52:02,466 --> 01:52:02,974
SPEAKER_0:  Handing your-

01:52:03,202 --> 01:52:07,262
SPEAKER_0:  hand over in marriage too. But no, she had to still be the husband.

01:52:07,490 --> 01:52:08,574
SPEAKER_0:  to all of her daughters.

01:52:09,026 --> 01:52:09,598
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:52:10,402 --> 01:52:12,318
SPEAKER_0:  We see what the results are consistently.

01:52:12,994 --> 01:52:13,790
SPEAKER_0:  So...

01:52:14,178 --> 01:52:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  That's where I get.

01:52:15,330 --> 01:52:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  You know, frustrated. It's like, let that go. Let this person...

01:52:20,098 --> 01:52:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  Do what.

01:52:21,314 --> 01:52:22,334
SPEAKER_0:  You made mistakes on.

01:52:22,594 --> 01:52:27,070
SPEAKER_0:  Don't make this person relive those same mistakes and then put that agenda into my daughters too.

01:52:28,578 --> 01:52:30,782
SPEAKER_1:  Is there somebody in your life close to you that

01:52:31,330 --> 01:52:32,222
SPEAKER_1:  that you trust.

01:52:32,450 --> 01:52:33,086
SPEAKER_1:  Enough.

01:52:33,762 --> 01:52:35,230
SPEAKER_1:  to call you out on your bullshit.

01:52:35,522 --> 01:52:36,990
SPEAKER_1:  We're all full of shit sometimes.

01:52:37,922 --> 01:52:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  What's my bullshit?

01:52:40,642 --> 01:52:42,302
SPEAKER_1:  Well, some of it I pointed out today.

01:52:42,754 --> 01:52:44,286
SPEAKER_1:  But I don't know you deeply enough.

01:52:44,706 --> 01:52:45,831
SPEAKER_1:  What was the point? Jewish meat warning

01:52:45,831 --> 01:52:47,742
SPEAKER_0:  That's not bullshit.

01:52:48,546 --> 01:52:55,230
SPEAKER_0:  The bullshit is that the Jewish man won't admit. Your dad was right. Your dad was right. The words you used.

01:52:55,618 --> 01:52:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  that you weren't.

01:52:56,898 --> 01:53:00,318
SPEAKER_0:  And I said it, you're not gonna make me say it 800 more times.

01:53:01,410 --> 01:53:04,035
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if it resonated, because you keep saying like...

01:53:04,035 --> 01:53:11,742
SPEAKER_0:  the words.

01:53:12,002 --> 01:53:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  your bullshit that you've been doing the whole time.

01:53:15,522 --> 01:53:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  You on the same bullshit as the other people.

01:53:19,298 --> 01:53:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  So you're doing the same thing.

01:53:21,122 --> 01:53:25,214
SPEAKER_0:  that the other, let's say media, because I'm not allowed to say has done.

01:53:25,730 --> 01:53:31,582
SPEAKER_0:  So until somebody stands up. Which is what, which is what man? Is. Which is what? Is. I'm trying to call you out and you're bullshit.

01:53:32,130 --> 01:53:35,870
SPEAKER_0:  because I hope I'm somebody you can trust. That's it. Trust you.

01:53:38,114 --> 01:53:39,989
SPEAKER_1:  Well, you should find people in your life.

01:53:39,989 --> 01:53:41,822
SPEAKER_0:  Don't tell me what I should do!

01:53:42,050 --> 01:53:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not one of your BLM marchers.

01:53:44,738 --> 01:53:46,814
SPEAKER_1:  Listen, I'm with you on the BLM.

01:53:47,266 --> 01:53:49,022
SPEAKER_1:  a lot of organizations.

01:53:49,666 --> 01:53:50,782
SPEAKER_1:  Use tragedy.

01:53:51,010 --> 01:53:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  And...

01:53:52,610 --> 01:53:54,462
SPEAKER_1:  and I watched the Candace Owens documentary.

01:53:55,490 --> 01:53:56,574
SPEAKER_1:  and what was your take on it?

01:53:57,698 --> 01:54:00,254
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's important to question the mainstream narratives.

01:54:00,738 --> 01:54:02,174
SPEAKER_1:  but I don't agree with it.

01:54:02,562 --> 01:54:05,182
SPEAKER_1:  I still believe that George Floyd.

01:54:05,922 --> 01:54:06,782
SPEAKER_1:  died.

01:54:07,874 --> 01:54:09,214
SPEAKER_1:  from the knee of the cop.

01:54:10,050 --> 01:54:11,006
SPEAKER_1:  not from fentanyl.

01:54:11,394 --> 01:54:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  And even if that was the case...

01:54:13,730 --> 01:54:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  there's still 50% of black deaths is actually abortion.

01:54:20,802 --> 01:54:26,430
SPEAKER_0:  So let's get into engineering. Let's just go, cause that's so- How do you fix that? Population control is social engineering.

01:54:28,450 --> 01:54:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  and it's most literals.

01:54:30,242 --> 01:54:30,654
SPEAKER_0:  form.

01:54:31,906 --> 01:54:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  the blacks that are under population control.

01:54:35,938 --> 01:54:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  That's something.

01:54:37,282 --> 01:54:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, that's just what it is.

01:54:39,234 --> 01:54:43,486
SPEAKER_1:  African-Americans are not choosing to get the abortion. I mean, it's a choice. It's an individual choice.

01:54:44,002 --> 01:54:45,022
SPEAKER_0:  we're being influenced to.

01:54:46,594 --> 01:54:50,846
SPEAKER_1:  Well then speak to the community and help. I mean I don't know what the engineering solutions there are.

01:54:52,290 --> 01:54:54,526
SPEAKER_1:  It could be you're doing that in part.

01:54:54,946 --> 01:54:57,022
SPEAKER_1:  by speaking to the value and the power of family.

01:54:57,186 --> 01:54:57,790
SPEAKER_0:  Well...

01:54:58,050 --> 01:55:00,318
SPEAKER_0:  Well watch this, I was building.

01:55:01,634 --> 01:55:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  shelters

01:55:02,978 --> 01:55:03,678
SPEAKER_0:  I bought

01:55:04,610 --> 01:55:08,574
SPEAKER_0:  land in Calabasas, about two ranches in Wyoming.

01:55:09,122 --> 01:55:12,990
SPEAKER_0:  300 acres in Calabasas, 12,000 acres in total in Wyoming.

01:55:13,794 --> 01:55:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  and I started building ideas for shelters.

01:55:17,602 --> 01:55:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  And God set it on my heart to make monasteries, which would be modern day facilities.

01:55:23,586 --> 01:55:25,278
SPEAKER_0:  facilities that don't turn people down.

01:55:25,730 --> 01:55:26,334
SPEAKER_0:  that have.

01:55:26,818 --> 01:55:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  Farms?

01:55:28,610 --> 01:55:29,630
SPEAKER_0:  that have.

01:55:30,658 --> 01:55:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  shelter, clothing.

01:55:32,418 --> 01:55:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  But first of all, water.

01:55:34,050 --> 01:55:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  First of all,

01:55:34,946 --> 01:55:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  Knowledge.

01:55:36,258 --> 01:55:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  because knowledge is the most important resource.

01:55:39,522 --> 01:55:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  our species.

01:55:40,674 --> 01:55:41,406
SPEAKER_0:  Above water.

01:55:41,826 --> 01:55:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  Knowledge. It's.

01:55:43,874 --> 01:55:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  itself.

01:55:44,930 --> 01:55:48,158
SPEAKER_0:  because then you can go get water. I mean, you can argue like if you're a baby, okay I need a cuppa can get buccal pan,

01:55:49,890 --> 01:55:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  but the baby doesn't have it.

01:55:51,170 --> 01:55:52,990
SPEAKER_0:  You know, so someone with the knowledge.

01:55:53,346 --> 01:55:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  than feeds.

01:55:55,394 --> 01:55:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  The.

01:55:56,898 --> 01:55:57,790
SPEAKER_0:  A baby.

01:55:58,082 --> 01:55:58,686
SPEAKER_0:  The water.

01:55:59,042 --> 01:56:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  but it's important.

01:56:00,738 --> 01:56:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  that those with the knowledge.

01:56:02,690 --> 01:56:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  teach the baby how to find the water themselves.

01:56:06,466 --> 01:56:07,102
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:56:08,130 --> 01:56:11,838
SPEAKER_0:  The business people that I've been dealing with have been keeping the baby sick.

01:56:12,898 --> 01:56:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  by not sharing the information and the knowledge.

01:56:16,162 --> 01:56:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  with inside of those contracts.

01:56:17,954 --> 01:56:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  My people.

01:56:19,362 --> 01:56:20,190
SPEAKER_0:  are sick.

01:56:20,642 --> 01:56:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  If I load up...

01:56:23,042 --> 01:56:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  Apple Music right now.

01:56:25,666 --> 01:56:30,206
SPEAKER_0:  and I play the top songs in the rap chart. I will tell you my people.

01:56:30,466 --> 01:56:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  are sick.

01:56:31,554 --> 01:56:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  If I go.

01:56:32,674 --> 01:56:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  to the restaurants and opportunity zones.

01:56:35,586 --> 01:56:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  and we look at.

01:56:36,802 --> 01:56:40,798
SPEAKER_0:  the calorie rating and the cholesterol, I will tell you that my people

01:56:41,058 --> 01:56:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  are sick.

01:56:42,082 --> 01:56:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  If we look at the obesity rate.

01:56:44,674 --> 01:56:45,854
SPEAKER_0:  If you go to just...

01:56:46,114 --> 01:56:48,158
SPEAKER_0:  a restaurant somewhere.

01:56:48,546 --> 01:56:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  in middle America, Denny's or something, I went to Denny's the other day, you will see that my people are sick, my people meaning all people.

01:56:56,258 --> 01:56:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  But black people are very influential to all people.

01:56:59,650 --> 01:57:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  So right, if so, if the media.

01:57:01,986 --> 01:57:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  Hicks.

01:57:02,850 --> 01:57:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:57:03,586 --> 01:57:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  overweight black woman and says this is body goals.

01:57:07,234 --> 01:57:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  than the media.

01:57:08,546 --> 01:57:11,198
SPEAKER_0:  are influencing my people to stay.

01:57:11,522 --> 01:57:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  Sick.

01:57:12,770 --> 01:57:14,302
SPEAKER_0:  And it just so happens.

01:57:14,754 --> 01:57:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  that.

01:57:15,874 --> 01:57:16,606
SPEAKER_0:  That night.

01:57:17,474 --> 01:57:20,446
SPEAKER_0:  I was so frustrated after 20 years.

01:57:21,410 --> 01:57:22,974
SPEAKER_0:  that I had to call it out.

01:57:23,586 --> 01:57:24,670
SPEAKER_0:  and one tweet.

01:57:25,026 --> 01:57:25,822
SPEAKER_0:  that now.

01:57:26,914 --> 01:57:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  Even if I say hey, okay?

01:57:28,642 --> 01:57:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  I was frustrated for these reasons.

01:57:30,498 --> 01:57:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  Now it's not good enough.

01:57:32,098 --> 01:57:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  You've literally

01:57:33,346 --> 01:57:38,750
SPEAKER_0:  tried to make me re-apologize 10 times in this meeting, re-say this, re-say that.

01:57:39,170 --> 01:57:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  but it doesn't change the fact that my people are sick and I'm the only person in my position that will say that my people are sick.

01:57:47,458 --> 01:57:48,222
SPEAKER_0:  TODAY.

01:57:48,450 --> 01:57:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  Not 30 years ago, not 60 years ago. My people are sick today. 50% of my peoples of deaths are abortion today.

01:57:55,714 --> 01:57:58,110
SPEAKER_0:  My people don't have the opportunities today.

01:57:58,850 --> 01:58:05,726
SPEAKER_0:  even to the point that because if JP Morgan had been nice to me and if Alex Klein is STEM player it'd been fair to me different things

01:58:05,954 --> 01:58:09,406
SPEAKER_0:  then I wouldn't even point it out that we don't have any black, we have two black engineers.

01:58:09,986 --> 01:58:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  So I have to have.

01:58:11,234 --> 01:58:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  a responsibility obviously to all people, but specifically to my tribe because tribes.

01:58:18,946 --> 01:58:19,998
SPEAKER_0:  Tribes move.

01:58:20,354 --> 01:58:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  You know, tribalism is real with black people, to separate the brightest from the tribe.

01:58:25,314 --> 01:58:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  or to separate the leaders. It is factual that the CIA removed the leaders from the black community, put crack in the communities, put guns in the communities, and locked up all the leaders and called them gang leaders, right?

01:58:37,858 --> 01:58:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  locked up all the leaders, locked up all the fathers. Now 72% of black mothers are raising.

01:58:43,714 --> 01:58:45,214
SPEAKER_0:  children by themselves.

01:58:45,698 --> 01:58:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  This is a gender like a Tuskegee experiment set on my people.

01:58:49,538 --> 01:58:51,710
SPEAKER_0:  Right. And what I'm calling out.

01:58:52,002 --> 01:58:54,334
SPEAKER_0:  for the black people in entertainment is.

01:58:55,810 --> 01:58:58,014
SPEAKER_0:  What are we doing? We have to collude.

01:58:58,306 --> 01:59:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  And if we don't collude, because even if I said, hey...

01:59:01,570 --> 01:59:04,030
SPEAKER_0:  I'd like to make a company that's all black.

01:59:05,122 --> 01:59:06,398
SPEAKER_0:  Right, is that okay for me to say?

01:59:07,426 --> 01:59:08,542
SPEAKER_0:  Is that okay for me to say?

01:59:09,026 --> 01:59:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  Or is that anti-Semitic?

01:59:10,946 --> 01:59:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  See, if I hadn't crossed the line so far, then that would have sounded anti-semitic.

01:59:16,290 --> 01:59:18,302
SPEAKER_0:  Now I've stretched a bit.

01:59:18,690 --> 01:59:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  So now we can go to, okay, let's make an all black company.

01:59:22,082 --> 01:59:24,222
SPEAKER_0:  but that would have been anti-Semitic.

01:59:25,154 --> 01:59:27,582
SPEAKER_0:  Just that concept, because you could word that in a different way.

01:59:27,842 --> 01:59:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  that would sound anti-semitic.

01:59:29,986 --> 01:59:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, man. I have to be actually... No, no, listen. If I said I didn't want to have the...

01:59:34,306 --> 01:59:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  Jewish people in the company, would that be anti-Semitic?

01:59:38,690 --> 01:59:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  It would sound like it, right? You'd say I'm from 1930s, right? Yeah.

01:59:42,466 --> 01:59:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  for me as a tribe to say, no I want an all black company.

01:59:46,018 --> 01:59:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

01:59:46,626 --> 01:59:51,501
SPEAKER_1:  I'm generally against that kind of thing, but first of all, you have the right to do whatever the hell you want. So, do whatever you want, fuck it!

01:59:51,501 --> 01:59:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  But what I'm saying is that's what I feel.

01:59:54,210 --> 01:59:55,486
SPEAKER_0:  may need to happen.

01:59:55,906 --> 02:00:01,662
SPEAKER_0:  for my people to have power again, because when my people have been left under the media's control,

02:00:02,274 --> 02:00:07,454
SPEAKER_0:  We've been made sick. We've been allowed to be sick. We've been promoting sickness. I think this case, I think that we have a slots to say that we will wrapped member,

02:00:07,842 --> 02:00:10,238
SPEAKER_1:  At least in the engineering realm, I haven't met.

02:00:10,946 --> 02:00:11,966
SPEAKER_1:  an engineer.

02:00:12,834 --> 02:00:16,158
SPEAKER_1:  who happens to be black, who would like to be called a black engineer.

02:00:16,482 --> 02:00:20,510
SPEAKER_1:  And when you have a company of all black people that are engineers, I don't know-

02:00:20,930 --> 02:00:22,366
SPEAKER_1:  Creative Arts, I apologize.

02:00:22,722 --> 02:00:23,582
SPEAKER_1:  but engineering.

02:00:25,314 --> 02:00:26,046
SPEAKER_1:  the really...

02:00:26,338 --> 02:00:28,030
SPEAKER_1:  tried to look at each other as humans.

02:00:28,354 --> 02:00:29,438
SPEAKER_1:  and look at the problem.

02:00:30,018 --> 02:00:34,110
SPEAKER_1:  and you want to know, you want to have the confidence that everybody on the team.

02:00:34,626 --> 02:00:36,501
SPEAKER_1:  is the best possible person for the

02:00:36,501 --> 02:00:38,174
SPEAKER_0:  job. What I can say is.

02:00:39,746 --> 02:00:40,798
SPEAKER_0:  The world is sick.

02:00:41,890 --> 02:00:42,654
SPEAKER_0:  And...

02:00:43,682 --> 02:00:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  I have slight...

02:00:45,282 --> 02:00:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  Images.

02:00:46,818 --> 02:00:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  of

02:00:47,618 --> 02:00:48,382
SPEAKER_0:  Utopia.

02:00:48,770 --> 02:00:51,230
SPEAKER_0:  Slight images of happiness, slight images.

02:00:51,714 --> 02:00:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  as a visionary and a creator.

02:00:54,338 --> 02:00:56,190
SPEAKER_0:  And I know for fact.

02:00:56,578 --> 02:00:59,614
SPEAKER_0:  the way that business deals have been done for me.

02:01:00,770 --> 02:01:02,590
SPEAKER_0:  are keeping the world sick.

02:01:04,642 --> 02:01:05,086
SPEAKER_1:  fix them.

02:01:06,754 --> 02:01:08,222
SPEAKER_1:  I see that's what you're trying to do.

02:01:08,770 --> 02:01:10,270
SPEAKER_1:  and you probably listen.

02:01:11,234 --> 02:01:12,862
SPEAKER_1:  People should not doubt, yay.

02:01:13,506 --> 02:01:15,038
SPEAKER_1:  But I gotta tell you, I have to be honest.

02:01:15,778 --> 02:01:16,190
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

02:01:17,634 --> 02:01:19,550
SPEAKER_1:  This is silly, because you don't know me.

02:01:20,226 --> 02:01:22,942
SPEAKER_1:  but it hurt when you say you don't trust me. You kinda lost me.

02:01:23,970 --> 02:01:25,534
SPEAKER_1:  I don't think anyone's ever said that to me.

02:01:27,906 --> 02:01:28,638
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know man.

02:01:29,474 --> 02:01:30,046
SPEAKER_1:  Fuck that.

02:01:30,498 --> 02:01:31,710
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not, I don't care about-

02:01:32,802 --> 02:01:34,974
SPEAKER_1:  Views or clickbait or any of that bullshit

02:01:35,490 --> 02:01:37,406
SPEAKER_1:  I just thought you were one of the great

02:01:38,146 --> 02:01:39,486
SPEAKER_1:  greatest artists ever.

02:01:39,970 --> 02:01:41,086
SPEAKER_1:  It'd be cool to talk to you.

02:01:41,474 --> 02:01:44,382
SPEAKER_1:  And I just, I feel like you got pain you're working through.

02:01:44,866 --> 02:01:49,150
SPEAKER_1:  and never had anyone say that to me. Maybe I'm just being a mess about it, I guess.

02:01:49,570 --> 02:01:50,430
SPEAKER_1:  That's fucked up though.

02:01:50,882 --> 02:01:54,257
SPEAKER_1:  But maybe it's not, maybe you shouldn't trust it, but I just haven't had that experience.

02:01:54,257 --> 02:01:54,718
SPEAKER_0:  size.

02:01:55,042 --> 02:01:56,478
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. Do you think I would trust?

02:01:57,250 --> 02:01:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  Anybody at this point in my life?

02:01:58,978 --> 02:01:59,614
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's tough.

02:02:00,802 --> 02:02:02,398
SPEAKER_1:  It's tough, it's tough, I hear you.

02:02:03,042 --> 02:02:06,622
SPEAKER_1:  And it's also kind of good to see how much strength you got.

02:02:07,330 --> 02:02:08,830
SPEAKER_1:  You're not broken by any of this.

02:02:09,090 --> 02:02:10,398
SPEAKER_1:  You're under a lot of attack.

02:02:11,426 --> 02:02:12,350
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of attack.

02:02:13,218 --> 02:02:14,302
SPEAKER_1:  by a lot of people.

02:02:15,202 --> 02:02:16,062
SPEAKER_1:  You have a vision.

02:02:16,386 --> 02:02:18,302
SPEAKER_1:  and you're trying to feel your way through it.

02:02:18,562 --> 02:02:19,902
SPEAKER_1:  and you might get destroyed for it.

02:02:20,962 --> 02:02:22,110
SPEAKER_1:  That's the human, uh...

02:02:22,818 --> 02:02:23,870
SPEAKER_1:  That's the risk you take.

02:02:25,602 --> 02:02:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  It's a wonderful life though.

02:02:27,874 --> 02:02:29,182
SPEAKER_0:  What do you hope your legacy is?

02:02:29,954 --> 02:02:30,750
SPEAKER_0:  to be forgotten.

02:02:31,842 --> 02:02:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  You think you'll be forgotten?

02:02:33,826 --> 02:02:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  Because the memory...

02:02:35,074 --> 02:02:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  There's ego in memory.

02:02:36,674 --> 02:02:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  and the memories.

02:02:38,434 --> 02:02:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  Who designed?

02:02:39,970 --> 02:02:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  The Sidewalk

02:02:41,378 --> 02:02:44,254
SPEAKER_0:  Who designed the water fountain? Who designed the stop sign?

02:02:44,482 --> 02:02:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  who designed the...

02:02:45,794 --> 02:02:46,430
SPEAKER_0:  Stoplight.

02:02:46,850 --> 02:02:50,718
SPEAKER_0:  These things are so ubiquitous that the person that designed them.

02:02:51,298 --> 02:02:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  is forgotten.

02:02:53,762 --> 02:02:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  If it's.

02:02:54,594 --> 02:02:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  A good idea.

02:02:56,226 --> 02:02:57,406
SPEAKER_0:  It's a God idea.

02:02:58,146 --> 02:03:00,318
SPEAKER_0:  and I don't know VCs.

02:03:00,578 --> 02:03:01,022
SPEAKER_0:  can own it.

02:03:03,394 --> 02:03:07,870
SPEAKER_1:  So you want your designs in all realms of life to be so simple.

02:03:09,122 --> 02:03:09,758
SPEAKER_1:  the day.

02:03:11,714 --> 02:03:12,830
SPEAKER_1:  They permeate everything.

02:03:13,218 --> 02:03:13,918
SPEAKER_1:  The Takeover.

02:03:14,658 --> 02:03:15,550
SPEAKER_1:  and you are forgotten.

02:03:15,874 --> 02:03:18,334
SPEAKER_1:  That's a successful design, as you've forgotten.

02:03:18,786 --> 02:03:19,198
SPEAKER_1:  Yes.

02:03:20,578 --> 02:03:24,350
SPEAKER_1:  Give advice for people. A lot of young people look up to you.

02:03:24,738 --> 02:03:26,046
SPEAKER_1:  Give advice for young people.

02:03:27,458 --> 02:03:29,662
SPEAKER_1:  of how to live a life they can be proud of.

02:03:32,450 --> 02:03:34,110
SPEAKER_0:  Don't tweet while you're sleepy.

02:03:35,330 --> 02:03:35,838
SPEAKER_1:  Take a nap.

02:03:37,794 --> 02:03:43,390
SPEAKER_1:  Surely there's other things. I love the humor. Don't take it seriously, I suppose is what that means.

02:03:44,258 --> 02:03:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  Don't send sleepy tweets.

02:03:47,106 --> 02:03:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:03:48,354 --> 02:03:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  Unless you buy your own social platform the very next week.

02:03:52,386 --> 02:03:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  Call Parler.

02:03:53,826 --> 02:03:58,247
SPEAKER_0:  But other than that, if you're not gonna buy a social flat, then don't.

02:03:58,247 --> 02:04:02,718
SPEAKER_1:  why you bought parlors so you could be sleepy and send messages out into the wild.

02:04:03,490 --> 02:04:07,358
SPEAKER_1:  I actually am really interested in the engineering aspects of Parler. Is there a vision there?

02:04:07,938 --> 02:04:10,270
SPEAKER_1:  Cause I'm also super interested in Elon buying Twitter.

02:04:10,786 --> 02:04:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  I like Instagram.

02:04:12,898 --> 02:04:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, better?

02:04:14,722 --> 02:04:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  then

02:04:15,778 --> 02:04:16,222
SPEAKER_0:  Twitter.

02:04:16,770 --> 02:04:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm sure...

02:04:18,818 --> 02:04:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  Mark Zuckerberg liked Instagram better than Facebook.

02:04:21,826 --> 02:04:22,590
SPEAKER_0:  or saw.

02:04:23,074 --> 02:04:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  How?

02:04:24,450 --> 02:04:24,990
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:04:25,282 --> 02:04:27,157
SPEAKER_0:  You know how valuable that was and he bought it.

02:04:27,157 --> 02:04:31,657
SPEAKER_1:  So you'd like to take part or something, whatever is the magic that makes Instagram work, you'll want to push.

02:04:31,657 --> 02:04:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I thought it was interesting how...

02:04:34,274 --> 02:04:37,566
SPEAKER_0:  It felt like Snapchat made the Kardashians bully Instagram.

02:04:38,146 --> 02:04:39,271
SPEAKER_0:  What's the point?

02:04:39,271 --> 02:04:41,022
SPEAKER_1:  going to Snapchat going to war.

02:04:41,922 --> 02:04:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  on Instagram.

02:04:43,586 --> 02:04:45,726
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I mean, just everyone wants to say, well.

02:04:45,986 --> 02:04:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  this is our value, Snapchat, you know, no one wants to lose their value to someone else's value, whatever it's like.

02:04:51,458 --> 02:04:52,798
SPEAKER_0:  And everything is just.

02:04:53,218 --> 02:04:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  What's the difference between permanent?

02:04:55,266 --> 02:04:56,542
SPEAKER_0:  and temporary.

02:04:57,218 --> 02:04:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it was just a permanent structure.

02:05:00,034 --> 02:05:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  Until God says it's not.

02:05:01,794 --> 02:05:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it's like nothing's permanent. Our life is not permanent.

02:05:06,306 --> 02:05:08,670
SPEAKER_0:  So how do we just let go those things even like.

02:05:08,898 --> 02:05:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  going from the name Kanye West to Ye was the beginning of just.

02:05:12,386 --> 02:05:13,278
SPEAKER_0:  letting go.

02:05:14,978 --> 02:05:16,702
SPEAKER_0:  of some things, of these titles.

02:05:17,090 --> 02:05:19,230
SPEAKER_0:  Like we need to remove the titles like, hey.

02:05:19,810 --> 02:05:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  If I have to leave Adidas and I have to go next computers.

02:05:25,602 --> 02:05:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  that

02:05:26,882 --> 02:05:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  may take me out of the-

02:05:28,610 --> 02:05:29,470
SPEAKER_0:  billionaire.

02:05:29,890 --> 02:05:31,006
SPEAKER_0:  Standing all together.

02:05:31,778 --> 02:05:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  and I gotta get low for however long God says I have to get low.

02:05:35,842 --> 02:05:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  and refocus.

02:05:37,154 --> 02:05:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  I've been-

02:05:38,722 --> 02:05:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  reshaping, refocusing my staff.

02:05:42,530 --> 02:05:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  I had some people that were good and I had some people that weren't. I had too many people and...

02:05:46,850 --> 02:05:48,926
SPEAKER_0:  I've got a vision inside of me and I'm like.

02:05:49,378 --> 02:05:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  This is how I make this vision. I have to bring this vision to life.

02:05:54,274 --> 02:05:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  I have to bring these houses to life?

02:05:56,642 --> 02:05:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  I was talking to...

02:05:58,850 --> 02:06:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  one of our architects.

02:06:00,866 --> 02:06:01,534
SPEAKER_0:  on

02:06:02,210 --> 02:06:04,702
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we're actually getting close on it, I'm like...

02:06:05,218 --> 02:06:08,798
SPEAKER_0:  built it a few times. I had like the domes you probably saw.

02:06:09,154 --> 02:06:10,494
SPEAKER_0:  Colum- n- a nice hair

02:06:10,850 --> 02:06:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  you know, how he transformed Kim's house.

02:06:13,826 --> 02:06:14,590
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:06:15,266 --> 02:06:16,798
SPEAKER_0:  No, we're getting there, like...

02:06:17,026 --> 02:06:21,310
SPEAKER_1:  So you want to get into architecture. Like you really want this to become physical reality.

02:06:21,666 --> 02:06:25,041
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, and I've got close. Rome wasn't built today.

02:06:25,041 --> 02:06:33,566
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, but Rome had to start somewhere. Yeah. I gotta call you out on the advice. There really is a lot of people that look up to you, and you've lived a really difficult life.

02:06:34,786 --> 02:06:36,030
SPEAKER_1:  and you made it through all of it.

02:06:37,858 --> 02:06:39,870
SPEAKER_1:  What do you advise them to do?

02:06:40,386 --> 02:06:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  Do everything that you feel.

02:06:43,426 --> 02:06:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  Even if you.

02:06:44,674 --> 02:06:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  are toll.

02:06:46,018 --> 02:06:47,102
SPEAKER_0:  that it's the wrong thing.

02:06:47,682 --> 02:06:48,542
SPEAKER_0:  No, no, no, no, no.

02:06:49,090 --> 02:06:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  but not anything violent.

02:06:51,106 --> 02:06:52,990
SPEAKER_1:  To do what you feel, say what you feel.

02:06:53,314 --> 02:06:54,174
SPEAKER_1:  I trust your heart.

02:06:54,562 --> 02:06:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, trust your gut.

02:06:56,834 --> 02:07:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  trust your instincts because that instinct is who God made you to be.

02:07:02,242 --> 02:07:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  Nah.

02:07:03,330 --> 02:07:07,262
SPEAKER_0:  You know what lines up with your life, frat brothers, or what lines up with.

02:07:07,842 --> 02:07:12,318
SPEAKER_0:  what your dad wanted or what lines up with your classmates. you know it's just

02:07:14,050 --> 02:07:19,966
SPEAKER_0:  God has something inside of you. And when you walk down the street, you're thinking about it, and then you just see it in the window.

02:07:20,610 --> 02:07:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  and you go down another stream, you see the same thing, or you're thinking about a number and that number pops up, or you see it on a license plate.

02:07:26,786 --> 02:07:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  And that's just...

02:07:28,738 --> 02:07:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

02:07:30,210 --> 02:07:34,526
SPEAKER_0:  Something is trying to say be the maximum.

02:07:35,330 --> 02:07:35,838
SPEAKER_0:  Yay.

02:07:36,514 --> 02:07:38,750
SPEAKER_0:  you know, be the maximum you.

02:07:39,330 --> 02:07:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  and God won't give you anything that you can't handle.

02:07:43,170 --> 02:07:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  So for me...

02:07:45,954 --> 02:07:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  Everything is a yes.

02:07:47,778 --> 02:07:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  I think they say be like water.

02:07:50,050 --> 02:07:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  I know Bruce Lee said that.

02:07:52,994 --> 02:07:53,822
SPEAKER_0:  Or matter of fact...

02:07:54,498 --> 02:07:55,166
SPEAKER_0:  just be.

02:07:56,322 --> 02:07:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  Because we are.

02:07:57,698 --> 02:07:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  beings.

02:07:58,850 --> 02:08:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  with engineering opportunities.

02:08:01,922 --> 02:08:02,718
SPEAKER_1:  beautifully put.

02:08:03,298 --> 02:08:04,350
SPEAKER_1:  Yay.

02:08:04,674 --> 02:08:05,566
SPEAKER_1:  I have hope.

02:08:06,082 --> 02:08:07,006
SPEAKER_1:  I have faith that

02:08:08,002 --> 02:08:09,406
SPEAKER_1:  However, this turns out that...

02:08:10,242 --> 02:08:14,910
SPEAKER_1:  You have the skill and the capacity to really add love to the world. I hope you do that.

02:08:16,322 --> 02:08:17,246
SPEAKER_1:  I really, really hope.

02:08:17,474 --> 02:08:19,262
SPEAKER_1:  You do that. And we talked about.

02:08:19,746 --> 02:08:23,038
SPEAKER_1:  the tension of that, the challenges and the opportunities of that.

02:08:23,554 --> 02:08:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I see...

02:08:25,666 --> 02:08:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  how we could be of use to each other. You actually have a.

02:08:29,378 --> 02:08:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  particular thing for me as I eject from media.

02:08:33,666 --> 02:08:35,710
SPEAKER_0:  Cause even also, you know I'm really big at like...

02:08:36,290 --> 02:08:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  you know, burning the Phoenix too.

02:08:38,306 --> 02:08:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  All you know as an engineer that your cells completely regenerate every seven years, I think I rushed the process a little bit. It's like I run around looking like a burn victim sometimes.

02:08:48,546 --> 02:08:50,238
SPEAKER_1:  But I gotta tell you, anyone I...

02:08:50,882 --> 02:08:54,718
SPEAKER_1:  I'm close with, I work with, there has to be trust, there has to be love.

02:08:55,234 --> 02:08:57,109
SPEAKER_1:  and I think you've been burned quite a bit.

02:08:57,109 --> 02:08:57,886
SPEAKER_0:  in your life.

02:08:59,362 --> 02:09:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  Sometimes I did it myself. I put my hand on the stove.

02:09:04,866 --> 02:09:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  So how do we get to engineering? There's a deal to be done here.

02:09:08,546 --> 02:09:11,921
SPEAKER_0:  Not saying you making this money off of that, I'm making that money off, but there's

02:09:11,921 --> 02:09:13,421
SPEAKER_1:  care about money by the way

02:09:13,421 --> 02:09:14,014
SPEAKER_0:  Twins.

02:09:14,306 --> 02:09:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  So there's dealings here.

02:09:16,994 --> 02:09:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  You got pain, I got pain.

02:09:19,522 --> 02:09:20,670
SPEAKER_0:  but we're beings with

02:09:20,994 --> 02:09:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  engineering opportunities.

02:09:22,978 --> 02:09:25,534
SPEAKER_1:  For a long time I thought somebody should create a new social network.

02:09:26,466 --> 02:09:27,998
SPEAKER_1:  And it looks like.

02:09:28,738 --> 02:09:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  Great engineering could do that.

02:09:30,754 --> 02:09:33,662
SPEAKER_0:  You got two at one time from two of your homeboys at one time. Yeah.

02:09:34,146 --> 02:09:39,102
SPEAKER_1:  And that's a great way to, I mean, every, you know, it can be done from scratch or it can be done anew.

02:09:39,330 --> 02:09:40,926
SPEAKER_1:  with an already established platform.

02:09:42,178 --> 02:09:43,966
SPEAKER_1:  i'm very excited by that possibility

02:09:44,866 --> 02:09:46,142
SPEAKER_1:  Parlor is smaller.

02:09:46,754 --> 02:09:48,638
SPEAKER_1:  Twitter is larger. I wonder—

02:09:48,866 --> 02:09:52,382
SPEAKER_1:  whether you can do any kind of revolutionary engineering with a large company.

02:09:52,674 --> 02:09:54,686
SPEAKER_1:  If anyone can, I would say it's Elon.

02:09:55,202 --> 02:09:59,742
SPEAKER_0:  Well, Elon can look at what we do over here. That's what I like.

02:10:00,226 --> 02:10:02,878
SPEAKER_0:  God does this a lot of times.

02:10:03,522 --> 02:10:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  He creates doppelgangers.

02:10:05,986 --> 02:10:08,798
SPEAKER_0:  There's a lot of examples where theory happened.

02:10:09,058 --> 02:10:10,718
SPEAKER_0:  two places at one time.

02:10:10,978 --> 02:10:14,686
SPEAKER_0:  a really similar type of personality happens at one time.

02:10:15,042 --> 02:10:16,030
SPEAKER_1:  It's weird. It's beautiful.

02:10:16,258 --> 02:10:17,406
SPEAKER_1:  Hilarious actually.

02:10:17,922 --> 02:10:19,070
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. It's kinda humorous.

02:10:19,650 --> 02:10:20,670
SPEAKER_0:  So we should-

02:10:21,218 --> 02:10:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  We should just share.

02:10:24,418 --> 02:10:27,998
SPEAKER_0:  every piece of information together as like as I go bill.

02:10:28,802 --> 02:10:29,502
SPEAKER_0:  Parlor.

02:10:29,730 --> 02:10:34,398
SPEAKER_0:  And as he builds up Twitter and see how to make both those better, but I'll be like, Hey,

02:10:34,658 --> 02:10:37,470
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not gonna let Snapchat bully me out of.

02:10:38,114 --> 02:10:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  you know, adding something to it that's best. it should just be.

02:10:42,050 --> 02:10:43,710
SPEAKER_0:  the best platform.

02:10:44,194 --> 02:10:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  That means that...

02:10:46,626 --> 02:10:47,966
SPEAKER_0:  You know, that means TikTok.

02:10:48,354 --> 02:10:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  has.

02:10:49,698 --> 02:10:55,998
SPEAKER_0:  Amazing features Twitter has amazing things about it. I know this girl that's like I like Instagram better than

02:10:56,258 --> 02:10:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  Twitter.

02:10:57,410 --> 02:10:59,198
SPEAKER_0:  It's just, she likes that Twitter has porn.

02:11:00,066 --> 02:11:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  but other than that, Instagram, but I was like, whoa.

02:11:02,562 --> 02:11:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  Instagram is porn also, it's like.

02:11:04,578 --> 02:11:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  soft it's more subtle it's not telling you it's not

02:11:08,034 --> 02:11:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  It's not conservative.

02:11:10,306 --> 02:11:11,326
SPEAKER_0:  by any means.

02:11:12,354 --> 02:11:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  You know, and...

02:11:13,698 --> 02:11:16,862
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, that's the thing. You have to please a lot of people with these platforms.

02:11:17,090 --> 02:11:17,566
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:11:17,954 --> 02:11:20,382
SPEAKER_1:  I think the goal of a platform should be.

02:11:20,706 --> 02:11:21,406
SPEAKER_1:  to, uh...

02:11:21,986 --> 02:11:23,230
SPEAKER_1:  help individuals.

02:11:24,994 --> 02:11:27,070
SPEAKER_1:  maximize their long-term happiness.

02:11:28,130 --> 02:11:28,798
SPEAKER_1:  and growth.

02:11:29,506 --> 02:11:30,686
SPEAKER_1:  like intellectually.

02:11:31,426 --> 02:11:35,550
SPEAKER_1:  spiritually, psychologically, all of that. That's a tricky thing to figure out how to do that.

02:11:36,642 --> 02:11:40,894
SPEAKER_1:  Of course you could just have a platform that's just strictly for fun. I think that's where TikTok leans.

02:11:42,082 --> 02:11:42,462
SPEAKER_1:  Bye.

02:11:42,914 --> 02:11:44,542
SPEAKER_1:  There has I think there's a

02:11:44,834 --> 02:11:46,462
SPEAKER_1:  balance the strike like Twitter.

02:11:46,722 --> 02:11:53,854
SPEAKER_1:  There's a lot of intellectual philosophical stuff going on on Twitter, but it somehow currently makes it too easy to be divisive and hateful towards each other.

02:11:54,434 --> 02:11:56,062
SPEAKER_1:  and cancel and all that kind of stuff.

02:11:56,290 --> 02:11:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  I think we need to have these healthy conversations.

02:11:59,458 --> 02:12:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  That's what it is, healthy conversations, healthy dialogues.

02:12:02,658 --> 02:12:04,094
SPEAKER_0:  That's the biggest thing like...

02:12:04,898 --> 02:12:06,654
SPEAKER_0:  When I first wore the red hat

02:12:07,490 --> 02:12:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  The conversation is less healthy than it is today.

02:12:11,874 --> 02:12:13,310
SPEAKER_0:  the conversation about.

02:12:13,890 --> 02:12:14,942
SPEAKER_0:  George Floyd.

02:12:15,650 --> 02:12:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it's like, did I send the tweet the right way?

02:12:18,786 --> 02:12:19,134
SPEAKER_0:  DEAD.

02:12:19,394 --> 02:12:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  It's Candice Owen's documentary, Perfect.

02:12:22,818 --> 02:12:26,686
SPEAKER_0:  is what Michael Moore as that documentary is perfect, just the core of the H

02:12:27,106 --> 02:12:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  Is it fully accurate?

02:12:28,610 --> 02:12:29,182
SPEAKER_0:  You know it's...

02:12:29,986 --> 02:12:31,102
SPEAKER_0:  Two to three hours.

02:12:31,394 --> 02:12:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  of a transmit of information through a

02:12:34,722 --> 02:12:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  particularly usually one person's.

02:12:37,026 --> 02:12:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  View.

02:12:38,690 --> 02:12:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:12:39,810 --> 02:12:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  Anything you want to research if you're interested in it.

02:12:43,810 --> 02:12:44,798
SPEAKER_0:  You got to look at.

02:12:45,474 --> 02:12:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  10 versions of it, 20 versions of it. George Floyd we've looked at.

02:12:49,410 --> 02:12:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  one version.

SPEAKER_0:  what I'm doing right now.

02:18:54,882 --> 02:18:55,710
SPEAKER_0:  But you will.

02:18:56,162 --> 02:18:57,982
SPEAKER_0:  And that's what I would say to everyone.

02:18:58,370 --> 02:19:00,030
SPEAKER_0:  You may not understand.

02:19:00,386 --> 02:19:04,318
SPEAKER_0:  what I'm doing and this gives a little bit, maybe we're like 20% there.

02:19:04,706 --> 02:19:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  But there's still going to be people who leave this interview.

02:19:07,234 --> 02:19:11,326
SPEAKER_0:  And they were like, I still don't like the way you apologize. I still don't want to say.

02:19:11,682 --> 02:19:21,246
SPEAKER_0:  what my involvement would have been to make him, lead him to that point. And we just want things to be how they are. There's people in the world who want the world to stay as it is.

02:19:21,474 --> 02:19:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  and there's people who want to change the world.

02:19:23,970 --> 02:19:24,830

02:19:25,218 --> 02:19:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  throughout time. They say that.

02:19:26,978 --> 02:19:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  with DaVinci.

02:19:28,290 --> 02:19:33,022
SPEAKER_0:  halfway into a conversation, he could not suffer fools so much that he would walk away.

02:19:33,506 --> 02:19:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  halfway into the conversation.

02:19:35,618 --> 02:19:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  And I said...

02:19:36,962 --> 02:19:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  Well...

02:19:37,986 --> 02:19:38,878

SPEAKER_0:  the DaVinci Code and at the DaVinci World.

02:19:44,162 --> 02:19:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  And every time I go and piss off a group of people or do these things.

02:19:49,154 --> 02:19:50,110
SPEAKER_0:  On some end.

02:19:50,786 --> 02:19:55,102
SPEAKER_0:  It's like I could be turning my thing from a potential world vision to a code.

02:19:56,674 --> 02:20:01,022
SPEAKER_0:  Or I could be opening up conversations with new friends that I may trust someday.

02:20:01,346 --> 02:20:01,886
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

02:20:02,082 --> 02:20:07,102

02:20:08,930 --> 02:20:10,206
SPEAKER_1:  but it'll happen across.

02:20:10,914 --> 02:20:14,910
SPEAKER_1:  uh... years even decades so you have to think in the future

02:20:15,234 --> 02:20:24,158
SPEAKER_1:  Like you're working in the future, your actions are working in the future. And a lot of people will judge this conversation and others you've done and so on in the present and that doesn't matter.

02:20:24,322 --> 02:20:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  You know why I apologize when I say I'm sorry to the Jewish people that I hurt?

02:20:28,898 --> 02:20:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  It's not about, like I said, all I said.

02:20:31,906 --> 02:20:33,630
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not gonna hold this apology.

02:20:34,210 --> 02:20:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  hostage, right?

02:20:35,810 --> 02:20:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  It's obviously it's about God, but God is everything, right? So what's the point of having language and being, you can't engineer if you say God, God, God, right? It's like.

02:20:45,186 --> 02:20:45,598
SPEAKER_0:  It's

02:20:46,082 --> 02:20:52,990
SPEAKER_0:  God asks us to be judgmental so that you become, if you're a doctor, right? It's your judgment that saves grandma. Right.

02:20:53,442 --> 02:20:55,102
SPEAKER_0:  And God puts that in this.

02:20:55,362 --> 02:20:58,334
SPEAKER_0:  We have God inside us. We're a piece of God also.

02:20:58,786 --> 02:20:59,230
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

02:20:59,458 --> 02:21:01,630
SPEAKER_0:  So I'm gonna go specific to a person.

02:21:03,426 --> 02:21:05,982
SPEAKER_0:  that story about DaVinci alone.

02:21:06,658 --> 02:21:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  is enough of a reason for me to give a sincere apology.

02:21:10,306 --> 02:21:11,262
SPEAKER_0:  to the Jewish people.

02:21:11,650 --> 02:21:13,150
SPEAKER_0:  because I do believe.

02:21:13,666 --> 02:21:18,654
SPEAKER_0:  that there's a DaVinci code inside of all of my misspellings and scribbles right here.

02:21:19,426 --> 02:21:19,838
SPEAKER_0:  that.

02:21:20,610 --> 02:21:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  God wants me.

02:21:22,050 --> 02:21:22,590
SPEAKER_0:  to get.

02:21:22,978 --> 02:21:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  to the world.

02:21:24,322 --> 02:21:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:21:25,762 --> 02:21:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  When I'm in my way, if God has set something on me, when I'm in my way, I'm in God's way.

02:21:31,938 --> 02:21:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  I can point at other people and say, hey, you guys are in God's way because you're not listening to me.

02:21:36,962 --> 02:21:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  But if I'm in...

02:21:38,338 --> 02:21:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  My way, I'm not listening to God.

02:21:41,090 --> 02:21:45,054
SPEAKER_0:  And for me to be a philosopher and a leader, whatever other language.

02:21:45,378 --> 02:21:46,174
SPEAKER_0:  I have to...

02:21:46,626 --> 02:21:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  Listen to God. Before God, what I will do is start off.

02:21:50,466 --> 02:21:51,454
SPEAKER_0:  as a samurai.

02:21:52,482 --> 02:21:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  and say I'm sorry for hurting you.

02:21:55,330 --> 02:21:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  As a Jewish person, I'm sorry for the way that made you feel.

02:21:58,690 --> 02:22:00,510
SPEAKER_0:  and I'm sorry for the entire

02:22:01,410 --> 02:22:05,918
SPEAKER_0:  population of a race that I feel is actually my brother's because I

02:22:06,178 --> 02:22:09,246
SPEAKER_0:  classify and feel that I'm also connected with Christ.

02:22:09,666 --> 02:22:19,294
SPEAKER_0:  in that way, that my people came from Africa in that way. And I can't say it's this exact teaching or that exact teaching, but I feel that there's an important.

02:22:19,586 --> 02:22:22,558
SPEAKER_0:  you know, the sons of Abraham, however we want to word it, right?

02:22:22,882 --> 02:22:25,822
SPEAKER_0:  for us to come together and bring our different talents.

02:22:26,242 --> 02:22:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  together to serve God collectively.

02:22:29,026 --> 02:22:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:22:29,922 --> 02:22:30,366
SPEAKER_0:  He.

02:22:30,786 --> 02:22:34,270
SPEAKER_0:  As much of an alien as I am, he does not cause me.

02:22:34,498 --> 02:22:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  He did not call for me to alienate. And that's what the problem has been, especially in politics and in America. He plays America as the TV, as the radio to the world. We invented rock and roll, right? We are the influencers of the rest of the planet. We're the youngest startup in history, right? We're the youngest.

02:22:54,434 --> 02:22:55,102
SPEAKER_0:  country.

02:22:55,330 --> 02:22:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  We're the youngest super power.

02:22:57,474 --> 02:23:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  Right? So for me in my position, the fact that I can talk to Trump one day and be at a game with Kim Kardashian the next day and then be-

02:23:06,050 --> 02:23:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  Paris Fashion Week.

02:23:08,098 --> 02:23:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  They don't want me to be involved with language of decisive, divisive language.

02:23:14,338 --> 02:23:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  you know, proving that I can be just as racist as a racist white person.

02:23:20,450 --> 02:23:21,182
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, I can-

02:23:21,410 --> 02:23:23,262
SPEAKER_0:  I could be a racist black person also.

02:23:23,586 --> 02:23:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  That's not what God-

02:23:25,026 --> 02:23:27,198
SPEAKER_0:  has called me to do. So how do I?

02:23:27,522 --> 02:23:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  simplify and say hey to you.

02:23:29,954 --> 02:23:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  as

02:23:31,010 --> 02:23:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  A visionary as a-

02:23:33,218 --> 02:23:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  as an engineer, as a person that's given me a platform that.

02:23:36,994 --> 02:23:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  as my

02:23:37,762 --> 02:23:42,654
SPEAKER_0:  Brother, I want to apologize to you for how that made you feel and to the rest of

02:23:43,330 --> 02:23:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  the people that carry specifically that pain, not the pain that I talk about.

02:23:48,258 --> 02:23:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  That doesn't seem to be as much of a pain for people when I talk about.

02:23:52,130 --> 02:23:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  abortion clinics and stuff. That's...

02:23:53,986 --> 02:23:59,070
SPEAKER_0:  It's like, that's the argued pain even in my own community. Like not everyone thinks that's the pain.

02:23:59,426 --> 02:24:00,958
SPEAKER_0:  But for the Jewish community...

02:24:01,186 --> 02:24:03,038
SPEAKER_0:  It's collectively this.

02:24:03,458 --> 02:24:04,190
SPEAKER_0:  was.

02:24:04,770 --> 02:24:05,982
SPEAKER_0:  A pain and I've gone.

02:24:06,562 --> 02:24:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  I've gone.

02:24:07,810 --> 02:24:12,574
SPEAKER_0:  so far just psychologically on this journey since that statement had happened.

02:24:13,314 --> 02:24:13,982
SPEAKER_0:  Where...

02:24:14,306 --> 02:24:25,630
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't want to like give up the candy in my pocket. I didn't want to say, hey, I stuck my hand in a candy jar. I wanted to defend my freedom of speech. I wanted this, but even with freedom of speech, pain is pain.

02:24:26,050 --> 02:24:27,486
SPEAKER_0:  causing people to hurt.

02:24:27,810 --> 02:24:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  is not.

02:24:28,674 --> 02:24:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  Helping.

02:24:29,794 --> 02:24:35,870
SPEAKER_0:  causing people to hurt is not helping. That means I have to take a more sophisticated approach.

02:24:36,738 --> 02:24:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  Two.

02:24:38,082 --> 02:24:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  Engineering.

02:24:39,650 --> 02:24:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  This problem, this problem is the opportunity.

02:24:42,690 --> 02:24:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  And yes,

02:24:44,290 --> 02:24:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  that.

02:24:44,962 --> 02:24:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  What could-

02:24:45,922 --> 02:24:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  some people may deem as a mistake.

02:24:48,226 --> 02:24:50,462
SPEAKER_0:  Would it be more genuine if I called it a mistake?

02:24:52,418 --> 02:24:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  I think I would be hypocritical.

02:24:55,874 --> 02:25:02,398
SPEAKER_0:  by calling it a mistake with the ending of that, the idea I'm gonna say out loud. I don't try to be a hypocrite on purpose.

02:25:02,786 --> 02:25:03,390
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhh

02:25:03,746 --> 02:25:05,758
SPEAKER_0:  So, but I will call it a mistake.

02:25:05,986 --> 02:25:07,550
SPEAKER_0:  to add a genuine.

02:25:08,098 --> 02:25:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, to be genuine.

02:25:10,210 --> 02:25:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  about the feeling.

02:25:12,226 --> 02:25:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  With that mistake...

02:25:15,938 --> 02:25:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  with me as a human being.

02:25:18,402 --> 02:25:20,958
SPEAKER_0:  Not to justify, but I have to state that.

02:25:21,666 --> 02:25:29,470
SPEAKER_0:  God makes no mistakes, because if I hadn't made that mistake, I wouldn't be in front of you today. And that's not to justify.

02:25:30,274 --> 02:25:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  This.

02:25:31,650 --> 02:25:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhh...

02:25:32,866 --> 02:25:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  Sleepy.

02:25:34,082 --> 02:25:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  text.

02:25:34,658 --> 02:25:39,358
SPEAKER_1:  But I can tell you're a man that has love in his heart and I hear that, I hear it through the words.

02:25:39,778 --> 02:25:45,630
SPEAKER_1:  explicitly and implicitly. And I think if we're to engineer a better future, the way to do that is with love.

02:25:46,498 --> 02:25:48,446
SPEAKER_1:  So as one human to another.

02:25:49,122 --> 02:25:49,854
SPEAKER_1:  I love you, brother.

02:25:50,242 --> 02:25:51,230
SPEAKER_1:  Thank you for talking today.

02:25:54,338 --> 02:25:54,846
SPEAKER_1:  I like you too.

02:25:55,682 --> 02:25:56,478
