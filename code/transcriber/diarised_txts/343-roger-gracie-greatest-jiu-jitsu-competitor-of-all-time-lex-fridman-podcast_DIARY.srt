00:00:00,194 --> 00:00:02,590
SPEAKER_0:  In my mind, I have to tap everybody else.

00:00:03,042 --> 00:00:04,158
SPEAKER_0:  Winning is not enough.

00:00:06,946 --> 00:00:09,726
SPEAKER_1:  Following is a conversation with Hodger Gracie.

00:00:10,146 --> 00:00:11,166
SPEAKER_1:  widely considered.

00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:13,598
SPEAKER_1:  to be the greatest Jiu-Jitsu competitor.

00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:14,846
SPEAKER_1:  of all time.

00:00:15,426 --> 00:00:17,982
SPEAKER_1:  This is the Lex Friedman podcast to support it.

00:00:18,306 --> 00:00:20,350
SPEAKER_1:  Please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:00:20,738 --> 00:00:21,150
SPEAKER_1:  And now...

00:00:21,474 --> 00:00:22,142
SPEAKER_1:  to your friends.

00:00:22,562 --> 00:00:23,262
SPEAKER_1:  Here's Hodger.

00:00:23,746 --> 00:00:24,190
SPEAKER_1:  Crazy.

00:00:25,346 --> 00:00:30,462
SPEAKER_1:  Let's start with possibly the greatest match in Jiu Jitsu history, your second match against Puchesha.

00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:35,582
SPEAKER_1:  Let's go through the details. Let's go through the whole thing. So the walk leading up to it.

00:00:35,906 --> 00:00:39,454
SPEAKER_1:  You always do this walk. It's an epic walk. You post on Instagram.

00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,182
SPEAKER_1:  Hands up post that on Instagram.

00:00:41,538 --> 00:00:43,262
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. Calm walk.

00:00:43,906 --> 00:00:46,206
SPEAKER_1:  towards the mat. Let's go to that.

00:00:46,626 --> 00:00:50,750
SPEAKER_1:  Match in particular was going through your mind. You've been away from competition facing probably.

00:00:51,202 --> 00:00:55,582
SPEAKER_1:  one of the greatest and at that time many people consider it the greatest jiu-jitsu.

00:00:56,162 --> 00:00:57,726
SPEAKER_1:  competitor of all time in bocce.

00:00:58,562 --> 00:01:03,262
SPEAKER_1:  uh... here's the old man the old timer getting back at uh... out there what were you thinking

00:01:03,778 --> 00:01:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I think that's the first time.

00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,454
SPEAKER_0:  since probably I got my black belt that I wasn't the favorite walking into a fight, I have to say.

00:01:11,874 --> 00:01:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  like a lot of people saw.

00:01:13,378 --> 00:01:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  Consider him the favorite.

00:01:16,258 --> 00:01:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  I mean...

00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  Understandable, you know, I was out of competition for a while. He was just winning everything.

00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  You know, saying about the walk, like for me.

00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,702
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the fight starts way before.

00:01:29,218 --> 00:01:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  the referee say go.

00:01:30,402 --> 00:01:30,782
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

00:01:31,042 --> 00:01:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  It's all the focus and concentration.

00:01:34,242 --> 00:01:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  that I think.

00:01:35,234 --> 00:01:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  It's very important for me to start before, like, you know, I almost...

00:01:39,074 --> 00:01:39,934
SPEAKER_0:  Walk blind.

00:01:40,354 --> 00:01:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  to the mat.

00:01:41,506 --> 00:01:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  Many times I passed like great friends and I couldn't.

00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  see anyone, you know, they're trying to talk to you and I'm like, I'm...

00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  100% focus.

00:01:49,058 --> 00:01:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  on my opponent already, even though that I cannot even see him in front of me.

00:01:52,674 --> 00:01:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  So I think that's what it was always like.

00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:56,190
SPEAKER_0:  very important to try to

00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  Clear my mind out.

00:01:58,242 --> 00:01:58,558
SPEAKER_0:  from.

00:01:58,786 --> 00:01:59,326
SPEAKER_0:  everything.

00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  Are you visualizing the opponent or are you just clearing? Not at that time.

00:02:03,714 --> 00:02:09,438
SPEAKER_1:  What's in your head? Is it like a calm river with birds chirping? What's in your head? Is it like a calm river with birds chirping?

00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:10,430
SPEAKER_1:  just blank.

00:02:10,754 --> 00:02:11,678
SPEAKER_1:  BE are they?

00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:17,854
SPEAKER_1:  And that's what we see in that calmness is just blankness. How hard is it to achieve that blankness?

00:02:18,274 --> 00:02:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  It's difficult to say because...

00:02:20,546 --> 00:02:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

00:02:21,346 --> 00:02:21,790
SPEAKER_0:  Think I.

00:02:22,114 --> 00:02:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  I don't remember when, I'll say probably as a black belt.

00:02:25,602 --> 00:02:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  I try to.

00:02:27,298 --> 00:02:29,470
SPEAKER_0:  focus like that, not to think because...

00:02:30,306 --> 00:02:34,558
SPEAKER_0:  It's probably something you learn is the more you think the more nervous you get

00:02:35,106 --> 00:02:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  And there's nothing that you're going to gain by thinking of the fight or the possibilities what you can do, what can go wrong, what can go right because...

00:02:43,618 --> 00:02:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  It's unpredictable. You have absolutely no idea. It is impossible to predict.

00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  the fight.

00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,366
SPEAKER_1:  and you discover that.

00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:54,302
SPEAKER_1:  If you just let those nervous feelings go and empty your mind.

00:02:54,562 --> 00:02:55,742
SPEAKER_1:  It actually is pretty effective.

00:02:55,842 --> 00:03:02,814
SPEAKER_0:  It is, it makes you feel better. It's, you know, you, you kind of control your emotion, control the adrenaline on your body up to a level.

00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:06,942
SPEAKER_0:  So it absolutely helps you focus in the fight.

00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,430
SPEAKER_1:  I've learned that in Jiu Jitsu and in general in life.

00:03:11,074 --> 00:03:13,086
SPEAKER_1:  that whenever something feels really shitty

00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:20,190
SPEAKER_1:  You can just like take that thought and not think about it. Yeah. Like I do that like on long runs or like a fast run or.

00:03:20,482 --> 00:03:23,358
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, in jujitsu, especially now you're getting older, out of shape.

00:03:23,874 --> 00:03:27,102
SPEAKER_1:  Like that feeling of exhaustion. Well you can always get to the feeling of exhaustion.

00:03:27,426 --> 00:03:28,382
SPEAKER_1:  You could just not.

00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:31,710
SPEAKER_1:  Think about it. Yeah. Not think about being exhausted. Yeah.

00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:34,078
SPEAKER_1:  and that somehow relaxes you.

00:03:34,402 --> 00:03:40,062
SPEAKER_1:  I think maybe in the face of exhaustion, all the fears start to creep in, maybe your muscles tighten up, I don't know.

00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:40,958
SPEAKER_1:  This is for the...

00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:42,142
SPEAKER_1:  The uh...

00:03:42,434 --> 00:03:44,446
SPEAKER_1:  the amateur juxtaperson.

00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,870
SPEAKER_1:  It's kind of funny how you can just.

00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,726
SPEAKER_1:  Take that thought and let go of it.

00:03:50,114 --> 00:03:52,830
SPEAKER_1:  So you get, as a black belt competitor, you get used to.

00:03:53,154 --> 00:03:55,326
SPEAKER_1:  you get good at letting go of any thoughts.

00:03:56,258 --> 00:03:57,758
SPEAKER_0:  When you mention to exhaustion is...

00:03:58,178 --> 00:03:59,038
SPEAKER_0:  And that's another.

00:03:59,266 --> 00:04:00,926
SPEAKER_0:  good example of it, it's...

00:04:01,602 --> 00:04:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  You know, there's a lot of times in the fight you're getting tired.

00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  and you're getting pretty tired.

00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:09,918
SPEAKER_0:  So it's like the last thing you want to think of it is how tired you are.

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  It doesn't matter.

00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  because.

00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:12,862
SPEAKER_0:  It doesn't.

00:04:13,346 --> 00:04:14,206
SPEAKER_0:  What are you going to quit?

00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:15,390
SPEAKER_0:  I mean...

00:04:15,746 --> 00:04:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  It doesn't matter. It's how tall you are.

00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  It's, there's no value thinking about it. There's no value. You just have to go through it.

00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:23,358
SPEAKER_1:  So when you're like a...

00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:26,270
SPEAKER_1:  you know, many minutes into the match and you're...

00:04:26,882 --> 00:04:33,534
SPEAKER_1:  slowly moving as you sometimes do, tying your belt, catching your breath, you're not thinking about anything, you're trying to let go of thinking.

00:04:33,922 --> 00:04:36,222
SPEAKER_0:  I'm trying to like to save.

00:04:37,058 --> 00:04:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  everything.

00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:40,734
SPEAKER_0:  to the file, like nothing goes to waste.

00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:42,494
SPEAKER_0:  It's, you know, every...

00:04:42,786 --> 00:04:44,222
SPEAKER_0:  Move Unnecessarily.

00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,126
SPEAKER_0:  It's just going to make you more tired or it's going to take something out of you.

00:04:49,346 --> 00:04:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  I try to calculate every single move I make, save as much energy as I can.

00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,710
SPEAKER_0:  so I can fully...

00:04:56,098 --> 00:04:57,982
SPEAKER_0:  you know, be focused 100%.

00:04:58,338 --> 00:05:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  in the fight with Norway especially energy wise.

00:05:01,122 --> 00:05:02,334
SPEAKER_1:  And that's instinctual.

00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:03,230
SPEAKER_1:  Like, uh...

00:05:03,682 --> 00:05:06,270
SPEAKER_1:  minimizing the amount of moves. You're not like-

00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:09,950
SPEAKER_1:  explicitly thinking should I do this or not? It's just

00:05:10,946 --> 00:05:13,790
SPEAKER_1:  Don't move unless it's absolutely required. Yes.

00:05:14,178 --> 00:05:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  Because fight, you cannot really...

00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  There's not really time to think much, you know, it's like, your instincts are playing, it's like it's...

00:05:22,274 --> 00:05:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  You already have your...

00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  You know, your weapons, let's say, you know, the things that you do, it's just to wait for the-

00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  Perfect moment.

00:05:31,554 --> 00:05:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  The beauty of it is that's the...

00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  right moment to everything. If you feel one second too late, it doesn't work.

00:05:37,634 --> 00:05:41,278
SPEAKER_0:  or you get messy. So you're trying to catch that moment.

00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,798
SPEAKER_0:  And for that you have to be...

00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  fully focusing on what you're doing, because one second you're out.

00:05:49,026 --> 00:05:49,470
SPEAKER_0:  It won't work.

00:05:50,082 --> 00:05:53,886
SPEAKER_1:  but you're not exactly known as somebody that moves super quickly.

00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,150
SPEAKER_1:  So the moment.

00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,662
SPEAKER_1:  It's not about how quickly you move. It's about the right moment.

00:06:01,954 --> 00:06:03,070
SPEAKER_0:  See you next time, yeah.

00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it's not.

00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  like speed.

00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  It's not like you have to move the speed of light.

00:06:10,242 --> 00:06:15,646
SPEAKER_0:  It's the move itself at that precise moment. It doesn't have to be super fast because...

00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:21,022
SPEAKER_0:  your opponent's not moving super fast, you know, so it's a combination of moving with tuning you and him.

00:06:21,762 --> 00:06:25,502
SPEAKER_1:  I mean the same thing happens in Judo and the movement can be really small.

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  I think Judo is a bit more explosive now, you know, it moves on slightly faster.

00:06:32,514 --> 00:06:34,462
SPEAKER_0:  So he did know he does require a bit more.

00:06:34,722 --> 00:06:35,294
SPEAKER_0:  Closeness.

00:06:35,554 --> 00:06:35,966
SPEAKER_0:  Thank you.

00:06:36,514 --> 00:06:37,214
SPEAKER_1:  but even just.

00:06:37,794 --> 00:06:40,030
SPEAKER_1:  the right timing for an off balance.

00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:42,046
SPEAKER_1:  Just a little tug.

00:06:42,338 --> 00:06:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it's not that, you know, moving the speed is not going to count that much.

00:06:47,138 --> 00:06:49,086
SPEAKER_0:  is the timing that you initiate that move.

00:06:49,474 --> 00:06:56,446
SPEAKER_1:  You see that with foot sweeps. There's nothing more beautiful than not like an Olympic level athletes going at it in the Olympics.

00:06:56,898 --> 00:06:58,142
SPEAKER_1:  in a decade.

00:06:58,946 --> 00:07:00,670
SPEAKER_1:  And it's just, and you see.

00:07:01,442 --> 00:07:04,350
SPEAKER_1:  one man's life flashed before his eyes and realized

00:07:04,738 --> 00:07:07,710
SPEAKER_1:  Like I'm supposed to be the top three person in the world.

00:07:08,002 --> 00:07:11,838
SPEAKER_1:  Did I just find, they have this look on their face, like I don't know what just happened.

00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:14,046
SPEAKER_1:  It's beautiful to see. You don't see that?

00:07:14,402 --> 00:07:18,151
SPEAKER_1:  I guess you see that in boxing, knockouts and stuff like that. You don't know what the hell just happened.

00:07:18,151 --> 00:07:18,654
SPEAKER_0:  happen.

00:07:18,882 --> 00:07:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  Is that

00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:22,014
SPEAKER_0:  precise moment of movement.

00:07:22,562 --> 00:07:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  that you get caught, like is that one split second?

00:07:27,298 --> 00:07:27,742
SPEAKER_0:  That's it.

00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,558
SPEAKER_1:  Do you get that in Jiu Jitsu at all? Cause Judo has

00:07:31,522 --> 00:07:34,334
SPEAKER_1:  because of the explosiveness, because of the point scoring system.

00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,150
SPEAKER_1:  that incentivizes these giant throws.

00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,438
SPEAKER_1:  has these moments where everything just turns into a single moment.

00:07:41,698 --> 00:07:42,823
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I've done it since I was a kid.

00:07:42,823 --> 00:07:44,478
SPEAKER_0:  not really because then it's points.

00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,102
SPEAKER_0:  is you get like, you know, two points.

00:07:47,586 --> 00:07:48,062
SPEAKER_0:  So is.

00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  Because I think regarding the submission.

00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  It's not just one precise movement that changes everything.

00:07:55,874 --> 00:07:56,990
SPEAKER_0:  I think, Juro.

00:07:57,282 --> 00:08:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  is the takedown that counts as a submission. Like Epon, fight over.

00:08:01,346 --> 00:08:02,366
SPEAKER_0:  Jujutsu don't have that.

00:08:03,298 --> 00:08:03,934
SPEAKER_0:  So you would.

00:08:04,194 --> 00:08:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  It will score points, but I think in terms of submission.

00:08:07,938 --> 00:08:09,022
SPEAKER_0:  You need to get to.

00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:12,190
SPEAKER_0:  in a dominant position first.

00:08:12,738 --> 00:08:14,718
SPEAKER_0:  and then the submission will come slowly.

00:08:15,106 --> 00:08:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  It's a process.

00:08:17,058 --> 00:08:21,470
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, let's go back to that guy with his mind. So actually in the weeks leading up to it.

00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,414
SPEAKER_1:  in the days, in the hours, in the minutes.

00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:27,038
SPEAKER_1:  Is there some fear in you?

00:08:28,194 --> 00:08:29,086
SPEAKER_1:  leading up to this.

00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:31,006
SPEAKER_0:  I mean...

00:08:31,298 --> 00:08:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not gonna say that I'm fearless because everybody fears.

00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,254
SPEAKER_0:  something, you know?

00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  The fear is there, but it's like how much you let that control you. I think I was a lot more confident then.

00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  Fearful.

00:08:44,706 --> 00:08:46,174
SPEAKER_0:  walk into their fight like I...

00:08:46,882 --> 00:08:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  I was pretty confident that...

00:08:48,354 --> 00:08:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I could beat him.

00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  Where's the source of that confidence?

00:08:52,482 --> 00:08:55,070
SPEAKER_0:  my belief on me.

00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:56,583
SPEAKER_0:  I can take the board.

00:08:56,583 --> 00:09:02,014
SPEAKER_1:  You can take anyone in the world, but is there a specific strategic?

00:09:02,722 --> 00:09:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  Like, you know, talking to Donna Herr.

00:09:05,698 --> 00:09:08,126
SPEAKER_1:  He believes that there's no such thing as confidence.

00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:09,694
SPEAKER_1:  Like, or rather...

00:09:09,954 --> 00:09:12,510
SPEAKER_1:  The way you get confidence is through data.

00:09:13,154 --> 00:09:16,830
SPEAKER_1:  Like that you have proven yourself effective.

00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,478
SPEAKER_1:  uh... in previous situations but with the chat

00:09:21,634 --> 00:09:23,262
SPEAKER_1:  You don't have much data.

00:09:23,714 --> 00:09:26,430
SPEAKER_1:  It was a very tough, the first time you faced him was a very tough

00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,534
SPEAKER_1:  That was also one of the greatest matches of all time.

00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  That was very tough.

00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:31,518
SPEAKER_1:  So.

00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:34,878
SPEAKER_1:  Doesn't that creep in like that doubt because you know, you don't have enough data.

00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:36,862
SPEAKER_1:  Halfway best.

00:09:37,986 --> 00:09:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I mean...

00:09:42,722 --> 00:09:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, if I never have thought before.

00:09:44,674 --> 00:09:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  you know, suddenly walk into a fight with someone like that.

00:09:47,746 --> 00:09:49,342
SPEAKER_0:  then would I be that confident?

00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,262
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, probably no.

00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:52,734
SPEAKER_0:  And I'll solve that.

00:09:53,314 --> 00:09:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  history of what you've been doing, what you've been achieving, those gives you confidence.

00:09:57,634 --> 00:09:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  I think that was my first fight ever.

00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:02,531
SPEAKER_0:  I wouldn't probably I wouldn't be that one.

00:10:02,531 --> 00:10:03,198
SPEAKER_1:  time off?

00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,118
SPEAKER_1:  It doesn't matter.

00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,174
SPEAKER_1:  Doesn't matter.

00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:07,422
SPEAKER_1:

00:10:07,938 --> 00:10:13,182
SPEAKER_1:  You don't have the fear or the actual physical experience, the psychological experience of being rusty.

00:10:13,794 --> 00:10:14,919
SPEAKER_1:  of being out of the competition.

00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:15,998
SPEAKER_0:  I will come out on training.

00:10:17,186 --> 00:10:19,811
SPEAKER_1:  So you simulate some aspect of that in the track.

00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:22,238
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, the training will tell you how you walk.

00:10:23,618 --> 00:10:26,718
SPEAKER_1:  Did you increase the intensity of the training leading up to this?

00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:28,990
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I mean, I train normal.

00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  Let's say compared to the first fight, the second one's a lot more confidence because...

00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  in a location training.

00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,054
SPEAKER_0:  training for the first fight.

00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:38,270
SPEAKER_0:  You were terrible.

00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  So what do you mean?

00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  I think I was...

00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  Focused in MMA for a while for a couple months and I wasn't really focusing the gear and you know by the time I accept if I didn't start training.

00:10:50,658 --> 00:10:53,310
SPEAKER_0:  like all my responses on training were off.

00:10:54,146 --> 00:10:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  Oh my

00:10:54,882 --> 00:10:57,374
SPEAKER_0:  training partner that I was trained with that I destroyed.

00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,006
SPEAKER_0:  I mean now they like...

00:10:59,234 --> 00:11:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  They bit me.

00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:04,286
SPEAKER_0:  It's like I cannot beat them the way I was used to.

00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:07,358
SPEAKER_0:  So I knew something was not right.

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,054
SPEAKER_0:  for the first fight.

00:11:09,922 --> 00:11:12,414
SPEAKER_0:  But then it's, you know, no points.

00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:14,334
SPEAKER_0:  is submission or draw.

00:11:14,818 --> 00:11:18,558
SPEAKER_1:  So yeah, for people who don't know, it was in one of Morris, which is a 20 minute match.

00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:23,006
SPEAKER_1:  Submission only so there's no the winner is determined only by submission. Otherwise, it's a draw

00:11:23,714 --> 00:11:24,062
SPEAKER_0:  So...

00:11:24,322 --> 00:11:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  Physically, I wasn't myself in that fight.

00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  I was tired.

00:11:28,578 --> 00:11:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  My body wasn't responding.

00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  Anyway, so the confidence was different from the first, the second, I think I was confident enough that I wouldn't get tapped out on the first.

00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  that I was still gonna fight because

00:11:40,642 --> 00:11:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  He asked to talk me out to a bit me.

00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  and I trust on my defense.

00:11:44,226 --> 00:11:46,878
SPEAKER_0:  I'm confident enough for my defense that he will not have me out.

00:11:47,746 --> 00:11:48,126
SPEAKER_0:  Buh.

00:11:48,578 --> 00:11:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of

00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,798
SPEAKER_0:  Winning, you know, walking to the second fight.

00:11:53,282 --> 00:11:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  I was a lot more conf-

00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,366
SPEAKER_1:  What can you say about that feeling when something's not right?

00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,135
SPEAKER_1:  It's not a thing that breaks people.

00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:03,454
SPEAKER_0:  It's weird, it's weird. People crack, they give up.

00:12:03,874 --> 00:12:05,150
SPEAKER_0:  You know, this is...

00:12:05,762 --> 00:12:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  is a big test.

00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  because it's like being.

00:12:09,602 --> 00:12:10,238
SPEAKER_0:  Really tired.

00:12:10,658 --> 00:12:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  It's the same thing. It's like a lot of people crack because they just feel they cannot give in.

00:12:15,842 --> 00:12:17,438
SPEAKER_0:  I have nothing more to give.

00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:19,294
SPEAKER_0:  So they just like give up.

00:12:19,778 --> 00:12:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  It's too hard.

00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,422
SPEAKER_1:  So what do you do? Again, take the thoughts out.

00:12:23,874 --> 00:12:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  There's no giving up.

00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, uh...

00:12:26,978 --> 00:12:28,414
SPEAKER_0:  I don't mind, I don't care.

00:12:28,738 --> 00:12:30,590
SPEAKER_0:  Like, you're just giving up, it's not enough.

00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  is not.

00:12:32,194 --> 00:12:33,534
SPEAKER_1:  That's always the way you thought.

00:12:33,762 --> 00:12:34,887
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:35,422
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:12:35,906 --> 00:12:38,270
SPEAKER_0:  I never gave up. I mean, I topped.

00:12:38,594 --> 00:12:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  is.

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  You know, not giving up is not typing. That's just stupid.

00:12:43,394 --> 00:12:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  especially during training.

00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:47,902
SPEAKER_0:  Like it's, I get caught like that. I've never ever.

00:12:49,218 --> 00:12:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  hurt myself by not tapping. I get you get angry.

00:12:53,474 --> 00:12:56,126
SPEAKER_0:  Train hard, improve, make yourself better.

00:12:56,578 --> 00:12:59,134
SPEAKER_0:  you got caught. Accept that you made a mistake.

00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  Give up.

00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,014
SPEAKER_0:  then try harder.

00:13:02,754 --> 00:13:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  So, you know, the not tapping, it's...

00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:10,878
SPEAKER_0:  you're sacrificing your body and you know, you will never be the same. Like if you let your elbow popped.

00:13:11,234 --> 00:13:13,150
SPEAKER_0:  The air will never ever be the same ever.

00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,294
SPEAKER_0:  You let yourself go to sleep.

00:13:15,874 --> 00:13:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  your resistant drops.

00:13:17,634 --> 00:13:19,230
SPEAKER_0:  So everybody has a...

00:13:19,682 --> 00:13:23,102
SPEAKER_0:  has a limit of resistance to resist a choke.

00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  before you pass out.

00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  The moment that you go to sleep.

00:13:28,418 --> 00:13:29,758
SPEAKER_0:  that resistance will drop.

00:13:30,562 --> 00:13:36,937
SPEAKER_1:  I've never heard anyone say that. That's awesome. That's true. So tap this. The reason people usually say it's.

00:13:36,937 --> 00:13:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  No, it's the same way you get it knocked out. You get knocked out the first time.

00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  your resistance drops.

00:13:42,498 --> 00:13:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  Your drug gets weaker.

00:13:44,386 --> 00:13:47,902
SPEAKER_1:  Just for the record, I've never gone to sleep in Jesus.

00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:50,910
SPEAKER_1:  Which means my resistance is high, right? I don't know.

00:13:51,074 --> 00:13:53,621
SPEAKER_0:  must be. Oh, your defense is pretty good.

00:13:53,621 --> 00:13:56,574
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know about that.

00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:59,166
SPEAKER_1:  Um, because it doesn't make sense to me.

00:13:59,394 --> 00:13:59,934
SPEAKER_1:  Or maybe...

00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,878
SPEAKER_1:  In my case, I think my understanding...

00:14:03,362 --> 00:14:04,030
SPEAKER_1:  of when I'm

00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,078
SPEAKER_1:  Screwed is pretty good.

00:14:06,818 --> 00:14:09,342
SPEAKER_1:  Like there's no, yeah.

00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,934
SPEAKER_1:  one of the things I regret the most.

00:14:12,162 --> 00:14:14,334
SPEAKER_1:  about my jujitsu journey is not having.

00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,374
SPEAKER_1:  given enough time to...

00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,030
SPEAKER_1:  of being in really bad positions.

00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,702
SPEAKER_1:  Like the better I got, I think the less I started being in bad positions.

00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  Which is terrible. year for

00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,182
SPEAKER_0:  That's how you train.

00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:29,726
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,102
SPEAKER_0:  because you suggest.

00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  Spa.

00:14:32,546 --> 00:14:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  when you spar, like it's difficult to be in.

00:14:35,906 --> 00:14:38,750
SPEAKER_0:  bad positions a lot. You train with better people but...

00:14:39,234 --> 00:14:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, let's say five, six minute rolls.

00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  how long you're going to be in a really bad position. Not long, right? So you don't really have time to develop.

00:14:46,946 --> 00:14:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  That's why.

00:14:48,002 --> 00:14:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  people they don't.

00:14:50,018 --> 00:14:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  you know, they don't train.

00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,310
SPEAKER_0:  in bad position because you have to start there.

00:14:54,082 --> 00:14:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  over and over again.

00:14:56,322 --> 00:14:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  be used to it.

00:14:57,186 --> 00:15:00,414
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, or put yourself there. I just didn't have that mindset, I think.

00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:01,214
SPEAKER_1:  I think.

00:15:01,506 --> 00:15:09,758
SPEAKER_1:  you start, I mean part of the fun of jujitsu is as you get better and better, you have certain people you go with, you have these puzzles that you've figured out that you're playing very...

00:15:10,146 --> 00:15:13,790
SPEAKER_1:  specific details you're working out, you're trying to improve your main

00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:18,142
SPEAKER_1:  like techniques and so on. But yeah, just the percentage of time you spend.

00:15:18,562 --> 00:15:19,358
SPEAKER_1:  being submitted.

00:15:19,714 --> 00:15:22,590
SPEAKER_1:  or being or trying even going against like lower ranks.

00:15:23,138 --> 00:15:25,054
SPEAKER_1:  trying to escape basic submissions is low.

00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:28,318
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if that's true for most people. Probably is, right?

00:15:28,546 --> 00:15:30,014
SPEAKER_0:  Most people have very bad defense.

00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,894
SPEAKER_0:  because they don't allow themselves to be there because...

00:15:33,922 --> 00:15:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, who wants to get tapped?

00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:36,222
SPEAKER_0:  Because you will.

00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  until you work on your defense.

00:15:39,586 --> 00:15:40,318
SPEAKER_0:  course you're gonna get.

00:15:41,282 --> 00:15:43,710
SPEAKER_0:  or you're not gonna escape, you're gonna struggle to escape.

00:15:44,546 --> 00:15:46,174
SPEAKER_0:  So people they don't want.

00:15:46,658 --> 00:15:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  I'll be there.

00:15:48,546 --> 00:15:53,886
SPEAKER_1:  I regret it most because of the effect it clearly had on how I competed.

00:15:55,394 --> 00:16:01,502
SPEAKER_1:  it was clear that my competition was constantly driven by conservative thinking.

00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,934
SPEAKER_1:  like don't take risks.

00:16:04,354 --> 00:16:06,206
SPEAKER_1:  I think because of a weak defense.

00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:06,974
SPEAKER_1:  Honestly.

00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:08,510
SPEAKER_1:  And I think...

00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:10,430
SPEAKER_1:  a lot of any of the fear.

00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,062
SPEAKER_1:  Like for example.

00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:16,542
SPEAKER_1:  exhaustion was accompanied by fear because of weak defense, I think.

00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:20,606
SPEAKER_1:  I would just psychoanalyze myself and I regret it. I regret it a lot

00:16:23,938 --> 00:16:25,246
SPEAKER_1:  Speaking of which...

00:16:27,074 --> 00:16:29,342
SPEAKER_1:  I don't think anyone's ever submitted you in competition.

00:16:30,018 --> 00:16:30,622
SPEAKER_1:  Sears.

00:16:32,002 --> 00:16:33,630
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I was a juvenile, yes.

00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,118
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, so when you are a young person.

00:16:37,378 --> 00:16:38,334
SPEAKER_1:  That's still hot, you.

00:16:38,786 --> 00:16:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  I know.

00:16:40,802 --> 00:16:41,246
SPEAKER_0:  Peace.

00:16:42,242 --> 00:16:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  First I was winning that fight.

00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:44,542
SPEAKER_0:  by a large.

00:16:45,602 --> 00:16:52,670
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I think by six points or four, something like that. But I was like, I was done. You don't remember it though, huh? By the details. I mean, I think by six points or four, something like that.

00:16:54,466 --> 00:16:55,742
SPEAKER_0:

00:16:56,994 --> 00:16:58,119
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. Your skin is something completely different from what I had�도 hey that 여러분

00:16:58,119 --> 00:17:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  He never competed again.

00:17:02,818 --> 00:17:03,198
SPEAKER_0:

00:17:03,394 --> 00:17:04,094
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:13,310
SPEAKER_1:  Whoever you are, please let's do a podcast. I don't want to talk shit about Hajar the whole time. No, but what are you attributed to that too? You're saying you're confident.

00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:14,910
SPEAKER_1:  You're confident that...

00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,238
SPEAKER_1:  the top of the world, the number one.

00:17:18,594 --> 00:17:20,318
SPEAKER_1:  But Chacha would not submit you.

00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:24,222
SPEAKER_1:  Um, so where's that confidence grounded and what do you attribute?

00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:26,782
SPEAKER_1:  the fact that nobody was able to submit you.

00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  First.

00:17:28,898 --> 00:17:31,006
SPEAKER_0:  It comes on training, you know, I train.

00:17:32,066 --> 00:17:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  a lot.

00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,422
SPEAKER_0:  bad position. My defense is good because I've...

00:17:35,714 --> 00:17:37,630
SPEAKER_0:  I practice over and over again.

00:17:37,922 --> 00:17:40,670
SPEAKER_0:  as much as I practice all my offensive positions.

00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  So it's...

00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:47,358
SPEAKER_0:  You have to train both equally, not just be in a good position, you have to be in bed.

00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,590
SPEAKER_0:  So I think that's a very strong part of my game.

00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  in order to be complete.

00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  fighter.

00:17:54,722 --> 00:17:58,206
SPEAKER_0:  you know, this complete martial artist, you have to be...

00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  good in every single position.

00:18:00,482 --> 00:18:03,710
SPEAKER_0:  every single one. Those that you're not, you have a weakness.

00:18:04,546 --> 00:18:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  So it's, you know, to be complete, you should have no weakness.

00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  So that was always my...

00:18:10,114 --> 00:18:11,422
SPEAKER_0:  And I was always very...

00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:15,294
SPEAKER_0:  particularly on that, like it's one of my weakness.

00:18:15,682 --> 00:18:17,310
SPEAKER_0:  where I don't feel good at it.

00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,638
SPEAKER_0:  If you put me in a position where I struggle, how do I escape? How do I get out?

00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  Everything.

00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:22,206
SPEAKER_0:

00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,550
SPEAKER_0:  submission locked.

00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:24,862
SPEAKER_0:  any position.

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,734
SPEAKER_0:  you know, back mount, everything. It doesn't matter.

00:18:28,994 --> 00:18:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  which position I...

00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  practice over and over again so that when I

00:18:33,698 --> 00:18:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  If I get there in a fighting situation, I will know how to get out. At least I'll have a direction.

00:18:39,554 --> 00:18:41,438
SPEAKER_0:  And I would know this is my way out.

00:18:42,626 --> 00:18:43,806
SPEAKER_1:  Do you practice both?

00:18:44,162 --> 00:18:46,046
SPEAKER_1:  escaping the back position and

00:18:46,434 --> 00:18:47,966
SPEAKER_1:  or the transition.

00:18:49,218 --> 00:18:51,230
SPEAKER_1:  into the back position, avoiding it.

00:18:51,938 --> 00:18:54,238
SPEAKER_1:  because that's how it happens, you know, jiu-jitsu.

00:18:54,658 --> 00:18:56,542
SPEAKER_1:  You start in a neutral position.

00:18:57,346 --> 00:19:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  The transition then becomes the fight itself.

00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  You see, being there is the most important. It's when you're there.

00:19:04,866 --> 00:19:05,598
SPEAKER_0:  you have to.

00:19:06,082 --> 00:19:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  know how to get out. That's your weakness, huh?

00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:09,406
SPEAKER_0:  You know

00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  Stopping the person getting that is something different. They're two different things.

00:19:13,442 --> 00:19:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  Either you practice one or the other.

00:19:16,962 --> 00:19:23,358
SPEAKER_1:  So, but both are important, I guess. But the stopping the person is easier to practice because that comes naturally in training.

00:19:24,066 --> 00:19:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  What was the actual process? Like what was your biggest weakness throughout your-

00:19:28,706 --> 00:19:32,510
SPEAKER_1:  Like you just remembering what was annoying to you to figure out.

00:19:32,802 --> 00:19:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, side control is always... Bottom of side control. Listen closely.

00:19:37,122 --> 00:19:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  it's regardless how much you practice, it's not ever easy, you'll never be easy.

00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,566
SPEAKER_1:  It's so annoying. It makes no sense.

00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, someone pins you down, doesn't want to move much, is a big and strong guy, regardless of who, he's not going to be easy to escape. So some situations are just...

00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,094
SPEAKER_1:  That must be the Sorry to Interrupt.

00:19:56,418 --> 00:19:59,582
SPEAKER_1:  I'm interrupting Hajar Gracie to discuss the new Jets.

00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,694
SPEAKER_1:  You just made me realize.

00:20:02,818 --> 00:20:04,606
SPEAKER_1:  If you're really good.

00:20:05,026 --> 00:20:07,390
SPEAKER_1:  If you're going against the perfect...

00:20:07,938 --> 00:20:09,022
SPEAKER_1:  Jiu Jitsu competitor.

00:20:09,794 --> 00:20:13,799
SPEAKER_1:  Probably side control might be one of the hardest positions. Is it the hardest position?

00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:18,897
SPEAKER_0:  and escape? It's one of them. If the person doesn't want to progress, it's just a concern about hope.

00:20:18,897 --> 00:20:19,294
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:20:19,874 --> 00:20:25,054
SPEAKER_1:  Like the best pinners in the world. I mean, partially because I've just seen judo people that know how to pin.

00:20:25,762 --> 00:20:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  They......scaped their second chosen nightmare.

00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  It's a nightmare. Doesn't matter how much you practice. It's a nightmare.

00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,710
SPEAKER_1:  and it's also just frustrating.

00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:40,670
SPEAKER_1:  I think I guess it is also frustrating because a lot of people in that position

00:20:41,154 --> 00:20:43,390
SPEAKER_1:  will be about maintaining control, not progressing.

00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:48,478
SPEAKER_1:  And usually people when they're a mile in back control are usually trying to

00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:52,350
SPEAKER_1:  progress towards a submission which opens up opportunities for escape.

00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,070
SPEAKER_1:  to what's the actual process.

00:20:55,874 --> 00:20:56,318
SPEAKER_1:  of

00:20:57,378 --> 00:21:01,118
SPEAKER_1:  just time and time again, putting yourself in side, bottom of side control. a

00:21:01,442 --> 00:21:02,334
SPEAKER_0:  over and over again.

00:21:02,722 --> 00:21:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  starting there, scape.

00:21:05,154 --> 00:21:05,598
SPEAKER_0:  Quebec.

00:21:06,978 --> 00:21:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  Mount Yucca back.

00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  any situation outside that stops that again, any situation outside that stops that again.

00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:12,414
SPEAKER_0:  end.

00:21:12,866 --> 00:21:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  It has to be.

00:21:14,018 --> 00:21:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  I'll say five minutes.

00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,406
SPEAKER_0:  because it's the repetition that will teach you.

00:21:17,954 --> 00:21:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  if you train like three minutes on top

00:21:20,386 --> 00:21:22,014
SPEAKER_0:  you have time to, you know, one thing.

00:21:22,626 --> 00:21:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  and then time out.

00:21:24,066 --> 00:21:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  is the repetition over and over again. When you try the same move over and over again, then you see what can go.

00:21:32,002 --> 00:21:36,094
SPEAKER_1:  And is it understanding the details of the movement are actually doing the movement and feeling it?

00:21:36,738 --> 00:21:40,158
SPEAKER_0:  It's both. First you have to understand the movement and then practice.

00:21:42,242 --> 00:21:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  but

00:21:44,482 --> 00:21:46,430
SPEAKER_0:  The most important thing is defense.

00:21:47,298 --> 00:21:47,966
SPEAKER_0:  scape coming.

00:21:49,858 --> 00:21:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  because he's attacking you.

00:21:52,162 --> 00:21:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  The one thing is if he's not trying to submit you, but the other one if he is, let's say if the person is very good, has a very good attack.

00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,702
SPEAKER_0:  First thing is defense.

00:22:01,442 --> 00:22:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  not just scape and expose yourself to an even worse position.

00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,678
SPEAKER_0:  because that is very risky.

00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  When you're trying to escape, you'll always expose yourself to a worse position.

00:22:12,194 --> 00:22:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  So avoiding that, first is defense, not getting caught.

00:22:16,354 --> 00:22:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  And then.

00:22:17,186 --> 00:22:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  when you're scaping.

00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,629
SPEAKER_0:  Don't be in a worse position than you are.

00:22:20,629 --> 00:22:26,142
SPEAKER_1:  So defense in Jiu Jitsu when you're wearing a gi, what does defense entail? Is it mostly grips?

00:22:26,402 --> 00:22:29,278
SPEAKER_1:  is mostly the positioning of your hips and legs.

00:22:29,442 --> 00:22:36,254
SPEAKER_0:  It's everything together because it's a whole body movement. It's constantly moving your arms, legs, body.

00:22:36,802 --> 00:22:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  It's, they have to, everything works.

00:22:40,898 --> 00:22:41,278
SPEAKER_0:  together.

00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,894
SPEAKER_1:  Going back to the mind of that guy.

00:22:45,346 --> 00:22:47,390
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, so confident.

00:22:48,578 --> 00:22:50,078
SPEAKER_1:  No fear at this point.

00:22:51,138 --> 00:22:52,702
SPEAKER_1:  Is there a bit of ego in there too?

00:22:53,282 --> 00:22:53,886
SPEAKER_1:  Yes.

00:22:54,338 --> 00:22:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  Like I say, I'm not going to say I'm fearless. Of course this concerns.

00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  That fight.

00:23:02,626 --> 00:23:05,150
SPEAKER_0:  I would have to say was probably the fight that I...

00:23:05,442 --> 00:23:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  got nervous the most walking in.

00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  because I knew.

00:23:09,026 --> 00:23:09,790
SPEAKER_0:  What that meant.

00:23:10,338 --> 00:23:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  that fight.

00:23:11,138 --> 00:23:11,646
SPEAKER_0:  them in.

00:23:12,098 --> 00:23:12,990
SPEAKER_0:  everything for me.

00:23:13,442 --> 00:23:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  That's what my legacy was on.

00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  the line.

00:23:16,418 --> 00:23:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  because

00:23:17,602 --> 00:23:18,974
SPEAKER_0:  If I lost that fight, I would-

00:23:19,202 --> 00:23:20,542
SPEAKER_0:  Forever I'll be number two.

00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  Forever.

00:23:22,498 --> 00:23:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:23:23,522 --> 00:23:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, Bousheche is a great...

00:23:25,762 --> 00:23:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  Great guy, great.

00:23:26,914 --> 00:23:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  competitor.

00:23:27,938 --> 00:23:28,926
SPEAKER_0:  This is very good.

00:23:30,306 --> 00:23:32,094
SPEAKER_0:  I'm better than him. I knew that.

00:23:32,386 --> 00:23:33,511
SPEAKER_0:  But he's competing.

00:23:33,511 --> 00:23:34,261
SPEAKER_1:  non-stop with them.

00:23:34,261 --> 00:23:36,670
SPEAKER_0:  He's a great competitor, you know.

00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:39,102
SPEAKER_0:  taking nothing out of him. This is super tough.

00:23:39,554 --> 00:23:41,182
SPEAKER_0:  Very, very tough, very good.

00:23:41,858 --> 00:23:45,246
SPEAKER_0:  is probably the best competitor in the G-String I want.

00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,582
SPEAKER_0:  13 times the World Championship, I won 10.

00:23:48,258 --> 00:23:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:23:49,186 --> 00:23:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  As a competitor, you know, he has more tires than I do.

00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:53,598
SPEAKER_0:  So...

00:23:53,858 --> 00:23:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  But.

00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of analyzing the game, I consider it.

00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,550
SPEAKER_0:  technically better than him.

00:24:00,802 --> 00:24:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:24:01,826 --> 00:24:05,918
SPEAKER_0:  knowing all that, everything that I build, all my legacy, it's...

00:24:06,626 --> 00:24:07,751
SPEAKER_0:  If I was right.

00:24:07,751 --> 00:24:09,022
SPEAKER_1:  fighting in this match.

00:24:09,122 --> 00:24:12,350
SPEAKER_0:  If I lose this fight, I'm forever number two.

00:24:13,634 --> 00:24:15,509
SPEAKER_1:  I know that is going through your mind

00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:19,262
SPEAKER_0:  No, I knew. I mean, it's not at that moment. I already...

00:24:19,586 --> 00:24:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  New Dead.

00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  I remember just before the curtains open, I'm standing and before they call my name.

00:24:26,434 --> 00:24:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:24:27,074 --> 00:24:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, my legs were like.

00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,870
SPEAKER_0:  I feel the adrenaline kick in.

00:24:32,162 --> 00:24:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  on my legs and I'm like...

00:24:34,242 --> 00:24:39,422
SPEAKER_0:  I'm hitting the legs, I'm like, wake up, get that adrenaline off of me, you know.

00:24:40,322 --> 00:24:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  So it was intense. It was intense.

00:24:43,202 --> 00:24:44,478
SPEAKER_0:  And this was in Rio.

00:24:44,706 --> 00:24:45,566
SPEAKER_1:  That was in real.

00:24:45,954 --> 00:24:46,430
SPEAKER_1:  So.

00:24:47,234 --> 00:24:52,894
SPEAKER_1:  my hometown. So this is, I mean, and you know, Rio is not exactly known.

00:24:53,346 --> 00:24:55,902
SPEAKER_1:  for its calmness in its fans.

00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,150
SPEAKER_1:  So this is like.

00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,582
SPEAKER_1:  wherever they hosted the Olympics.

00:25:00,578 --> 00:25:03,006
SPEAKER_1:  the year before. So this is like.

00:25:04,098 --> 00:25:06,558
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, this, like the whole.

00:25:06,914 --> 00:25:07,710
SPEAKER_1:  basically

00:25:08,226 --> 00:25:11,742
SPEAKER_1:  Martial arts community is watching this.

00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:15,678
SPEAKER_1:  I mean is there some uh, was Hanzo there?

00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,038
SPEAKER_1:  So people are just...

00:25:19,266 --> 00:25:21,086
SPEAKER_1:  I mean there's attention, it's also...

00:25:22,082 --> 00:25:26,014
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I don't know if you felt that in part, but you're also fighting for the Gracie name.

00:25:27,266 --> 00:25:28,254
SPEAKER_1:  Enough.

00:25:28,674 --> 00:25:32,799
SPEAKER_0:  in our hometown, the greatest where the Gracie really is.

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,574
SPEAKER_1:  competitor of all time, arguably in the hometown.

00:25:37,378 --> 00:25:38,558
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, okay.

00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:43,614
SPEAKER_0:  All my family, my best friends, my friends, everybody watching, everybody there.

00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  There was a lot of pressure.

00:25:45,922 --> 00:25:46,430
SPEAKER_1:  a lot.

00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:48,510
SPEAKER_1:  And then...

00:25:49,218 --> 00:25:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  Were you thinking that you would be able to submit him?

00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:53,982
SPEAKER_0:  No, it's not that point.

00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:58,686
SPEAKER_0:  Like I don't predict how the fight will go. That I never did because it isn't predictable.

00:25:59,362 --> 00:26:00,990
SPEAKER_0:  It's... I never tried.

00:26:01,346 --> 00:26:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  to set any strategy for any fight.

00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,190
SPEAKER_0:  I think I'll...

00:26:04,418 --> 00:26:05,886
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, I did.

00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:06,846
SPEAKER_0:  But.

00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:12,510
SPEAKER_0:  That was the only time that I set any strategy into a fight. That was a 15 minutes fight there.

00:26:13,794 --> 00:26:14,398
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:26:14,978 --> 00:26:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  I said

00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,142
SPEAKER_0:  First five minutes, I'm gonna play defense.

00:26:18,562 --> 00:26:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  His bigger, stronger, younger.

00:26:20,482 --> 00:26:24,222
SPEAKER_0:  I don't want to play his game and I know he comes in very fast, every single time.

00:26:24,706 --> 00:26:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  fight he had, you know, he comes very aggressive.

00:26:27,522 --> 00:26:27,902
SPEAKER_0:  soul.

00:26:28,322 --> 00:26:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  My strategy walking to the fight, I say, five minutes, I'm going to play defense. I'm not going to try to attack. I'm not going to try to match his pace.

00:26:36,226 --> 00:26:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  I already expected, you know, maybe I'm going to start losing the fight because, you know, if he comes in, there's a risk of me maybe getting takedown, you know, or something happened.

00:26:45,026 --> 00:26:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  like.

00:26:45,602 --> 00:26:46,206
SPEAKER_0:  I'm gonna...

00:26:46,594 --> 00:26:47,774
SPEAKER_0:  Stick to the game plan.

00:26:48,834 --> 00:26:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  Five minutes, I'm gonna start picking up the pace because then it's 10 minutes to go, which 10 minutes is a long fight. So I don't need to start fast, but I'm gonna start being more aggressive and then...

00:26:58,498 --> 00:27:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  you know, try to take him down or pull guard, you know, by then I'm like, that's as far as strategy goes.

00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:09,755
SPEAKER_1:  No specific stay on the feet. Were you comfortable being both bottom and top in this?

00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I prefer to be on top.

00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  because

00:27:16,738 --> 00:27:17,758
SPEAKER_0:  been in the bottom.

00:27:18,146 --> 00:27:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  the person on top dictates the pace of the fight because he's on top.

00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:21,854
SPEAKER_0:  over you.

00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  So I always prefer to be on top because I can dictate a pace. I can implement my own pace.

00:27:27,778 --> 00:27:29,854
SPEAKER_0:  and being the bottom they can slow me down.

00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:31,646
SPEAKER_0:  So it's harder.

00:27:32,322 --> 00:27:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  so.

00:27:32,898 --> 00:27:35,262
SPEAKER_0:  If I can choose, I will always be on top.

00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:36,446
SPEAKER_0:  But...

00:27:36,994 --> 00:27:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  By then I was like this...

00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:40,862
SPEAKER_0:  You know, five minutes, hit it.

00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:44,926
SPEAKER_0:  like he's pretty big and strong. I'm gonna spend a lot of energy taking him down.

00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  I forgot.

00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,446
SPEAKER_1:  How do you feel?

00:27:49,282 --> 00:27:54,142
SPEAKER_1:  So here you're stepping in by the way, puzzle math. This is old school as old school as it gets.

00:27:56,418 --> 00:28:01,502
SPEAKER_1:  So calm and relaxed here for people just listening. We're watching the early minutes of the match. Yeah.

00:28:01,762 --> 00:28:11,137
SPEAKER_1:  So just feeling it out. He seems pretty calm too. He must be nervous too. I wonder how, did you ever talk to him? You guys are friends. Yeah, yeah, we're friends. Did he ever say how nervous he was? No.

00:28:11,137 --> 00:28:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  We never spoke about that fight.

00:28:15,202 --> 00:28:16,414
SPEAKER_0: ед

00:28:16,514 --> 00:28:17,374
SPEAKER_1:  Sorry λ

00:28:17,858 --> 00:28:21,086
SPEAKER_1:  He probably lays late at night thinking about it.

00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:21,758
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe.

00:28:21,986 --> 00:28:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know. That is B.

00:28:24,354 --> 00:28:24,702
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:28:24,962 --> 00:28:27,390
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, so you see the first five minutes, no, he kept.

00:28:28,514 --> 00:28:31,422
SPEAKER_0:  I knew what he was going to do in my study his game.

00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  His stand up is.

00:28:34,082 --> 00:28:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  most basic is basic in

00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  take downs.

00:28:38,402 --> 00:28:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  Black attacks.

00:28:39,842 --> 00:28:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  double leg so he goes single or double and he charges in

00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,542
SPEAKER_0:  That is pretty much it.

00:28:45,346 --> 00:28:46,110
SPEAKER_0:  Stand up game.

00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:48,222
SPEAKER_1:  You get a grip.

00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, we got penalized.

00:28:51,842 --> 00:28:53,790
SPEAKER_1:  So do you like to use the

00:28:54,594 --> 00:28:55,998
SPEAKER_1:  Do you like to post with your left?

00:28:56,546 --> 00:28:59,006
SPEAKER_1:  You have a right foot forward usually. You're righty, right?

00:28:59,426 --> 00:29:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  I'm ready, but I know he wants my leg.

00:29:02,018 --> 00:29:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  So I'm, I'm, I'm.

00:29:03,138 --> 00:29:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  playing my stance just because of this game.

00:29:06,082 --> 00:29:07,774
SPEAKER_0:  or you know, all my grips at that.

00:29:08,194 --> 00:29:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  the first five minutes was to kind of try to neutralize

00:29:11,394 --> 00:29:12,190
SPEAKER_0:  He's a Tex.

00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,854
SPEAKER_1:  So he wants to get your left leg. That's what's up guys.

00:29:15,778 --> 00:29:16,158
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,246
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, right there.

00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,742
SPEAKER_1:  So how hard is that to stop that?

00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,878
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, he felt pretty strong coming in.

00:29:23,586 --> 00:29:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  I'm pushing my head down trying to play with his balance.

00:29:27,522 --> 00:29:27,838
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:29:28,482 --> 00:29:31,198
SPEAKER_0:  If you see it, there was a pause.

00:29:32,322 --> 00:29:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  Go back there.

00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  he charged in.

00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:38,014
SPEAKER_0:  There's a pause, me standing in front of him.

00:29:39,266 --> 00:29:40,318
SPEAKER_0:  I did that on purpose.

00:29:41,634 --> 00:29:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  What do you mean?

00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  just to.

00:29:44,066 --> 00:29:46,302
SPEAKER_0:  in front of him because he tried.

00:29:46,562 --> 00:29:48,926
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm like, you fail, I'm here.

00:29:49,282 --> 00:29:50,078
SPEAKER_0:  Hehehe

00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:51,038
SPEAKER_1:  There's a...

00:29:51,938 --> 00:29:52,414
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

00:29:53,026 --> 00:29:55,651
SPEAKER_1:  So you could feel the frustration. Like.

00:29:55,651 --> 00:29:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  feel his frustration not.

00:29:58,242 --> 00:29:59,294
SPEAKER_0:  be able to take me down.

00:30:01,122 --> 00:30:01,694
SPEAKER_1:  So now...

00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,085
SPEAKER_1:  And this is just psychological battles.

00:30:04,085 --> 00:30:07,678
SPEAKER_0:  You see me walking straight into the middle of the mat and he's circling out.

00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:11,166
SPEAKER_0:  See, I'm going very slow, I'm recovering.

00:30:11,778 --> 00:30:13,342
SPEAKER_1:  and he's computing like shit.

00:30:13,602 --> 00:30:17,950
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, because he just made an effort trying to take me down. He needs to recover.

00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  And I mean, you need to recover the other guys that are waiting for you.

00:30:23,714 --> 00:30:26,014
SPEAKER_1:  and do I go for another take down?

00:30:26,562 --> 00:30:27,870
SPEAKER_1:  Cause this one failed.

00:30:28,322 --> 00:30:30,238
SPEAKER_1:  Don't you need to recalculate the strategy?

00:30:30,626 --> 00:30:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, and he kept trying over and over again.

00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:33,982
SPEAKER_0:  and keep failing.

00:30:34,754 --> 00:30:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  I think that...

00:30:36,194 --> 00:30:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  I frustrate him a lot on that fight, I fell.

00:30:40,002 --> 00:30:41,598
SPEAKER_0:  I felt him kind of slowing down.

00:30:41,858 --> 00:30:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  only because he was getting nowhere.

00:30:46,626 --> 00:30:48,062
SPEAKER_1:  So we're five minutes in.

00:30:48,738 --> 00:30:49,758
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, he keeps...

00:30:50,562 --> 00:30:52,798
SPEAKER_1:  So you never got that takedown in the early.

00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,134
SPEAKER_1:  Let's see.

00:30:59,746 --> 00:31:02,046
SPEAKER_1:  So at this point, do you pull guard? Yeah, OK. So.

00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:04,094
SPEAKER_0:  That's when I fell.

00:31:05,058 --> 00:31:05,758
SPEAKER_0:  like his.

00:31:06,274 --> 00:31:06,622
SPEAKER_0:  Peace.

00:31:09,026 --> 00:31:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  mentally he's not.

00:31:10,658 --> 00:31:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  Who's worried now?

00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,942
SPEAKER_0:  Did you try to pull a close guard here? No, I knew he was gonna bring Danny in.

00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:19,070
SPEAKER_1:  Because that's the defense against pulling close guard. Yeah.

00:31:19,842 --> 00:31:20,638
SPEAKER_0:  But I like that.

00:31:21,794 --> 00:31:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  What are you-

00:31:22,402 --> 00:31:23,262
SPEAKER_0:  I like people.

00:31:23,874 --> 00:31:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  bringing the knee between my legs.

00:31:26,306 --> 00:31:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  because see, I'm going to close my guard even with his leg in.

00:31:30,146 --> 00:31:31,198
SPEAKER_1:  because he is, he is

00:31:32,034 --> 00:31:35,409
SPEAKER_1:  He's stopping the club. Well, this is awkward, but.

00:31:35,409 --> 00:31:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  Because I was holding his arm, that's why he fell, he had no hand to post.

00:31:40,642 --> 00:31:42,910
SPEAKER_1:  but still it puts a leg in.

00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:45,827
SPEAKER_1:  But you're able to close your guard around the explicar observation எ and

00:31:45,827 --> 00:31:49,577
SPEAKER_0:  I do that really well. I sweep people from their position a lot.

00:31:49,577 --> 00:31:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  sweep.

00:31:51,074 --> 00:31:52,126
SPEAKER_1:  get just pushed.

00:31:52,482 --> 00:31:54,590
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, he's just like to your left side.

00:31:55,298 --> 00:31:55,678
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

00:31:56,034 --> 00:31:57,054
SPEAKER_1:  Because he has no

00:31:57,474 --> 00:32:00,849
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, it's almost like you mean you're basically around his back a little bit.

00:32:00,849 --> 00:32:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  And he knew that, like I swept a lot of people with that sweep. So you see he kept.

00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  leaning to his left.

00:32:08,194 --> 00:32:08,894
SPEAKER_0:  To my right.

00:32:09,698 --> 00:32:10,654
SPEAKER_0:  So I want to push them.

00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:14,078
SPEAKER_0:  my left so you see him leaning over to my right a lot.

00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:16,341
SPEAKER_1:  What's the right answer for him to like roll or something?

00:32:16,341 --> 00:32:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  No, I mean he's stuck, he does not really.

00:32:19,202 --> 00:32:22,014
SPEAKER_0:  He stuck that, but there was one thing that hit that.

00:32:22,498 --> 00:32:22,942
SPEAKER_0:  He kept.

00:32:23,202 --> 00:32:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  off me completely.

00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  see that he's leaning too, like he's too afraid of my attack now.

00:32:28,834 --> 00:32:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  because he should lean on me.

00:32:31,938 --> 00:32:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  You should bring the fight to me.

00:32:34,562 --> 00:32:35,614
SPEAKER_0:  So why didn't I fail him?

00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,750
SPEAKER_0:  I knew he was like, he's...

00:32:39,074 --> 00:32:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  to worry about my attacks now.

00:32:41,218 --> 00:32:42,334
SPEAKER_1:  Oh yeah, that's right, so he can't...

00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,565
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. He comes back to the center.

00:32:44,565 --> 00:32:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  So he's not engaging now, at that time he's 100% just defending.

00:32:49,346 --> 00:32:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  So I felt that, I'm like, he doesn't want to engage.

00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:57,790
SPEAKER_0:  And he's looking, I knew at that point he wants my foot.

00:32:58,306 --> 00:32:59,230
SPEAKER_0:  because of first fight.

00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:02,398
SPEAKER_0:  I had the exact same position, I wasn't holding his arm.

00:33:02,786 --> 00:33:04,030
SPEAKER_0:  and who went to attack my foot.

00:33:04,514 --> 00:33:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  Which he did, you know, he got into a fight.

00:33:08,258 --> 00:33:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  So I knew he's looking at my foot.

00:33:10,498 --> 00:33:10,974
SPEAKER_1:  Which foot?

00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,455
SPEAKER_1:  Sorry.

00:33:12,455 --> 00:33:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  I have my right foot.

00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:18,142
SPEAKER_0:  But I'm holding his arm. I'm holding his arm.

00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:21,086
SPEAKER_1:  and now you're going to the back as an arm drag type of thing.

00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:26,334
SPEAKER_0:  The moment that I came off, I'm holding his arm so he cannot come up.

00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  So, you know, I'm holding his left arm.

00:33:29,186 --> 00:33:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  So he cannot.

00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  Post a hand on the floor and come up.

00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,334
SPEAKER_1:  And he's holding your right to try to get you. Yep.

00:33:35,106 --> 00:33:37,662
SPEAKER_1:  basically to prevent you from attacking.

00:33:40,034 --> 00:33:41,758
SPEAKER_1:  That's interesting, and he rolls.

00:33:42,338 --> 00:33:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  He tried to.

00:33:43,618 --> 00:33:45,214
SPEAKER_0:  He tried to get me off balance.

00:33:45,506 --> 00:33:48,254
SPEAKER_0:  So see now I'm switching, I switched the grip on his arm.

00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  so I can free my...

00:33:50,082 --> 00:33:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  left on.

00:33:51,714 --> 00:33:53,310
SPEAKER_1:  Can I ask you a question?

00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:56,382
SPEAKER_1:  Was there a chance he sweeps you here?

00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, there's always a chance, but very hard.

00:33:58,978 --> 00:34:00,830
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, but see my left arm is free.

00:34:01,474 --> 00:34:02,590
SPEAKER_1:  I see you can post. Yeah.

00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:06,334
SPEAKER_1:  Why was your left arm free? Oh, because you were using it. You got it.

00:34:07,298 --> 00:34:07,678
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

00:34:08,898 --> 00:34:09,374
SPEAKER_1:  No.

00:34:09,666 --> 00:34:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  I try the hook now, you will see.

00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  Still got your arm. Yeah, but when I knew...

00:34:16,738 --> 00:34:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  He's panicking.

00:34:18,914 --> 00:34:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  because

00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  he did a move that he completely opened himself up. Like I'm holding his.

00:34:24,706 --> 00:34:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  left arm.

00:34:26,018 --> 00:34:27,198
SPEAKER_0:  So by holding their arm.

00:34:27,906 --> 00:34:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  his

00:34:28,578 --> 00:34:31,070
SPEAKER_0:  that prevents you from defending the hook on that side.

00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  because his arm is being held across.

00:34:33,794 --> 00:34:35,550
SPEAKER_0:  so their arm cannot block the hook.

00:34:36,226 --> 00:34:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:40,030
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, the hook with your left leg. Yeah.

00:34:40,834 --> 00:34:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  you'll see when he comes up but I would say I mean that's my guess but Busheshe's

00:34:46,178 --> 00:34:50,590
SPEAKER_0:  He's a big guy, he was like 110 kilos, 112, something like that.

00:34:51,074 --> 00:34:52,350
SPEAKER_0:  which is 245.

00:34:53,154 --> 00:34:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  Right..

00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  Or were you at the time?

00:34:56,258 --> 00:34:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  Last 220, yeah.

00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  to 20.

00:34:59,906 --> 00:35:01,031
SPEAKER_0:  a nice

00:35:01,031 --> 00:35:02,531
SPEAKER_1:  to win 100 kilo.

00:35:02,531 --> 00:35:02,942
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

00:35:03,714 --> 00:35:04,158
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:35:04,962 --> 00:35:05,822
SPEAKER_0:  in hits.

00:35:07,362 --> 00:35:09,406
SPEAKER_0:  His defense are not amazing.

00:35:09,794 --> 00:35:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  He's good, but he's not known to have amazing defense. So by being the big guy in the room when you train.

00:35:16,354 --> 00:35:19,070
SPEAKER_0:  you wish to get out of situations because of your size.

00:35:19,554 --> 00:35:20,638
SPEAKER_0:  You shake people off.

00:35:21,218 --> 00:35:24,478
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it's because of your size you shake them off, you get off.

00:35:24,866 --> 00:35:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  bad positions. You can...

00:35:26,978 --> 00:35:29,630
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I could feel in the first fight, I'm in side control.

00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  you know, so he explode out.

00:35:32,322 --> 00:35:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  So, you know, I've seen him doing that a few of his fights.

00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:36,254
SPEAKER_0:  No.

00:35:36,866 --> 00:35:40,158
SPEAKER_0:  And not in the most technical way, just I'm getting out.

00:35:40,642 --> 00:35:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  and he did because of his size.

00:35:42,818 --> 00:35:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  So, and he did the same thing, like he tried to stood up.

00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  when I'm on his back.

00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  they completely open up the hooks.

00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:52,638
SPEAKER_0:  He will see the next move, his head gonna come up.

00:35:52,962 --> 00:35:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  and he's gonna try to get off the floor.

00:35:54,722 --> 00:35:56,597
SPEAKER_1:  So basically come up, shake you.

00:35:56,597 --> 00:35:59,774
SPEAKER_0:  off-cutting strategy. There was no difference for the hooks. I put both hooks in.

00:36:00,674 --> 00:36:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  straight away.

00:36:02,562 --> 00:36:07,134
SPEAKER_0:  His arm is off balance. Yeah, I'm off balance. Yeah, see, I didn't bring him up. He came up.

00:36:07,746 --> 00:36:08,126
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:36:08,802 --> 00:36:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  And now...

00:36:10,914 --> 00:36:12,254
SPEAKER_0:  I'm attacking his neck.

00:36:12,642 --> 00:36:13,918
SPEAKER_0:  and his worry about the hooks.

00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  That's fatal mistake.

00:36:17,122 --> 00:36:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  this.

00:36:17,986 --> 00:36:20,926
SPEAKER_0:  Like defense always comes first. Remember what I just said now?

00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  Defense first, cape second.

00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  So he's not worried more about the points than...

00:36:26,498 --> 00:36:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  is next.

00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:32,286
SPEAKER_0:  So it was like a progression of mistakes.

00:36:32,674 --> 00:36:35,902
SPEAKER_0:  That's why I think he did. He got frustrated when he couldn't take me down.

00:36:36,578 --> 00:36:38,270
SPEAKER_0:  And then when I pulled God, he was...

00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:41,246
SPEAKER_0:  He was frustrated that the fight wasn't going his way.

00:36:41,506 --> 00:36:45,631
SPEAKER_0:  You know, he's very good about taking down. He try over and over again for five minutes.

00:36:45,631 --> 00:36:47,902
SPEAKER_1:  Here he was frustrated about the hooks, so he's like.

00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:51,665
SPEAKER_1:  It's almost like the frustration things like, no, no, no, these hooks shouldn't be.

00:36:51,665 --> 00:36:53,950
SPEAKER_0:  Like I pull guard on the grips that I want.

00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  He's not comfortable inside my guy. He's not in the position that he wants to be.

00:36:57,858 --> 00:36:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  He's over leaning.

00:36:59,202 --> 00:36:59,966
SPEAKER_0:  to his left.

00:37:00,578 --> 00:37:03,870
SPEAKER_0:  you know, to not, he's not engaged, you're not trying to pass.

00:37:04,258 --> 00:37:07,646
SPEAKER_0:  He's trying to get the foot, but his arm is trapped. He's going to get nowhere.

00:37:08,386 --> 00:37:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  And then when I swapped him...

00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,934
SPEAKER_0:  sound of his world start collapsing.

00:37:12,546 --> 00:37:15,230
SPEAKER_0:  You know, he couldn't take me down, I pulled guard, I'm swept in.

00:37:15,458 --> 00:37:16,798
SPEAKER_0:  He tried to roll me over.

00:37:17,282 --> 00:37:17,694
SPEAKER_0:  No.

00:37:17,922 --> 00:37:19,582
SPEAKER_0:  It didn't get me anywhere.

00:37:20,194 --> 00:37:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  the first movement that he tried to escape, I'm on his back.

00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  Nah, he's lost.

00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,758
SPEAKER_1:  If you just go back to him standing up.

00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  See both hookers in no defense, like there was nothing up.

00:37:35,298 --> 00:37:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  on the way of those hooks.

00:37:38,658 --> 00:37:40,030
SPEAKER_0:  because he tried to come up.

00:37:40,514 --> 00:37:41,054
SPEAKER_1:  coming up.

00:37:41,538 --> 00:37:46,270
SPEAKER_1:  You're high enough on him to where the weight was just probably immense.

00:37:46,914 --> 00:37:47,742
SPEAKER_1:  It just felt.

00:37:48,578 --> 00:37:50,453
SPEAKER_1:  You're heavy. Man, you got to...

00:37:50,453 --> 00:37:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  You already got...

00:37:51,682 --> 00:37:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  You're already going for the choke, man. Of course.

00:37:55,266 --> 00:37:57,182
SPEAKER_0:  There's no time to lose.

00:37:57,698 --> 00:37:58,398
SPEAKER_0:  Look at that.

00:37:58,626 --> 00:37:59,070
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:37:59,394 --> 00:38:02,019
SPEAKER_1:  So you're not like worried I'm gonna get shaken off, you're going for the-

00:38:02,019 --> 00:38:07,527
SPEAKER_0:  No, I'm on your back. You got your right hand on this. There's no shaking me off. I'm on your back now. We're in this together.

00:38:07,527 --> 00:38:11,277
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, and your right hand is opening up the lapel.

00:38:11,277 --> 00:38:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  My right hand is holding his arm.

00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:14,503
SPEAKER_0:  I still hold him asleep.

00:38:14,503 --> 00:38:16,003
SPEAKER_1:  Sorry, you're holding this.

00:38:16,003 --> 00:38:18,782
SPEAKER_0:  sleeve but holding this sleeve and I'm already going for the neck.

00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:20,862
SPEAKER_0:  because it's timing.

00:38:21,154 --> 00:38:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  At which point...

00:38:22,306 --> 00:38:26,590
SPEAKER_1:  Do you let go of the sleeve and open up help with the power? Or do you not need it?

00:38:27,202 --> 00:38:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  No, I did that.

00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:33,918
SPEAKER_0:  but first I wanna try to make a grip. Then I need to establish control before I let go his arm.

00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  So I kept holding that.

00:38:38,178 --> 00:38:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  bit longer.

00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  And then when I fell, okay, I have a good control over the back, then I let go.

00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  Do you?

00:38:45,986 --> 00:38:49,246
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so you have like a light grip on his lapel.

00:38:49,602 --> 00:38:50,727
SPEAKER_1:  but you're thinking...

00:38:50,727 --> 00:38:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  No, I need to adjust that.

00:38:52,034 --> 00:38:54,302
SPEAKER_1:  You need to adjust it. You're like holding it there.

00:38:54,658 --> 00:38:56,533
SPEAKER_1:  And you're thinking, okay, at some point I need to adjust.

00:38:56,533 --> 00:39:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  All I need, all I want is to get under his chin. Then I know, now I can go for it.

00:39:02,018 --> 00:39:04,798
SPEAKER_0:  Because if it's over, there's no choke, right? This is our new Andover Night Makeover!

00:39:06,018 --> 00:39:07,143
SPEAKER_0:  Can you add joke, British?

00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:07,893
SPEAKER_1:  over

00:39:07,893 --> 00:39:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  with a no.

00:39:09,026 --> 00:39:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  That's just not right.

00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  Okay. It's not right or it doesn't work? It deposes.

00:39:13,474 --> 00:39:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  Snow riding doesn't work.

00:39:15,042 --> 00:39:18,110
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, would you tap to a choke on your chin? No, just pressure.

00:39:18,978 --> 00:39:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  You hurt, but it's not gonna choke you out. I don't know.

00:39:22,082 --> 00:39:27,518
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know. I'm not, let me argue this. I love this. Arguing with Hodger Gray thinking about jokes. This is great. Okay.

00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:32,958
SPEAKER_1:  like clock choked, it was always interesting to me because in judo it's illegal to have the gi around

00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:34,750
SPEAKER_1:  face.

00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:38,718
SPEAKER_1:  And so it was kind of liberating for me to be allowed to have.

00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:41,333
SPEAKER_1:  gear on the face.

00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:42,833
SPEAKER_0:  Liberating.

00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:49,549
SPEAKER_1:  No, you don't have to worry about it. Of course it's more effective to go under the chin, but I'm surprised just because the amount of pressure.

00:39:49,549 --> 00:39:58,743
SPEAKER_0:  It's all about how much you can take it. You can take a lot. But it feels like- No, it doesn't feel comfortable. I mean, sometimes on your mouth, it cuts your mouth, now you're bleeding, it feels horrible. But-

00:39:58,743 --> 00:40:02,526
SPEAKER_1:  That's not the feeling, the feeling, it might not be a joke, but the feeling like...

00:40:03,202 --> 00:40:06,110
SPEAKER_1:  Like it's a pressure that everything's just closing in.

00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:11,518
SPEAKER_0:  But it doesn't take you anywhere. Like you're not gonna go to sleep. You might not go to sleep. So it's just pressure.

00:40:12,674 --> 00:40:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:15,646
SPEAKER_0:  Trashy hurts, is uncomfortable.

00:40:16,258 --> 00:40:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  but it is not gonna break your face and it's not gonna put you to sleep. So if I don't get the neck, I don't go for the kill.

00:40:24,194 --> 00:40:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  I'm like, I'm holding the, the, the his.

00:40:27,298 --> 00:40:27,678
SPEAKER_0:

00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,942
SPEAKER_0:  You know, my wrist is almost under.

00:40:31,906 --> 00:40:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  It's...

00:40:32,834 --> 00:40:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I'm trying to kind of dig in.

00:40:35,554 --> 00:40:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  If I can dig in, then I would just call it. But first I need to dig in.

00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:42,846
SPEAKER_1:  I dig in first and adjust. Wait, can you do all that with one hand or no?

00:40:43,106 --> 00:40:43,614
SPEAKER_1:  I did.

00:40:45,858 --> 00:40:47,806
SPEAKER_1:  So you can tighten the choke with just one hand.

00:40:48,194 --> 00:40:48,574
SPEAKER_0:  No.

00:40:48,802 --> 00:40:50,677
SPEAKER_0:  I need the second one to open it like that.

00:40:50,677 --> 00:40:51,134
SPEAKER_1:  on the bell.

00:40:51,586 --> 00:40:52,711
SPEAKER_1:  But you're like digging in with-

00:40:52,711 --> 00:40:57,182
SPEAKER_0:  I'm digging in under the chin. Under is under. Now I need to go deeper.

00:40:57,346 --> 00:41:00,510
SPEAKER_1:  but that, the going deeper requires a second hand. He does.

00:41:02,274 --> 00:41:04,899
SPEAKER_1:  and but that requires you letting go of the other hand.

00:41:04,899 --> 00:41:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  I have to let go eventually.

00:41:07,618 --> 00:41:08,798
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, see. All right.

00:41:08,962 --> 00:41:10,142
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. That's over.

00:41:10,338 --> 00:41:10,654
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  because I'm already under his.

00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,782
SPEAKER_0:  like the first hand got on the duchen.

00:41:15,714 --> 00:41:18,339
SPEAKER_1:  Do you need the hand on the second lapel?

00:41:18,339 --> 00:41:19,390
SPEAKER_0:  D 알�Vee eigenta disee pizza Decr structure Cookies Fries Whiskies Mozzarella Q E S G K J H S D L K Q E G D Q E K Q

00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  And he's out.

00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:23,134
SPEAKER_1:  That's the control of the churning versus the tightening of the choke.

00:41:24,034 --> 00:41:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  It does both. It helps tighten the coil and stop the person rolling.

00:41:29,122 --> 00:41:29,566
SPEAKER_1:  out.

00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:37,406
SPEAKER_1:  Boo-Yoo!

00:41:39,682 --> 00:41:41,854
SPEAKER_1:  Feeling pretty good about this position? Yes.

00:41:41,986 --> 00:41:42,494
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:41:42,722 --> 00:41:46,654
SPEAKER_0:  I just felt it's getting tighter, tighter, tighter, tighter because...

00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  It wasn't.

00:41:48,098 --> 00:41:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  super tight from the beginning. It wasn't like the perfect choke.

00:41:51,298 --> 00:41:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  So we're still.

00:41:52,706 --> 00:41:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I knew it was like he's very close to the end, but you know, I still need to adjust. Those are the risks of maybe his escape.

00:41:58,882 --> 00:42:00,670
SPEAKER_1:  Is it possible for his head to slip out?

00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  It is possible, yes.

00:42:03,234 --> 00:42:04,318
SPEAKER_0:  I'm closing that gap.

00:42:07,842 --> 00:42:08,350
SPEAKER_1:  here.

00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  What did that feel like? Relief? Relief.

00:42:14,946 --> 00:42:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  awesome.

00:42:15,874 --> 00:42:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  Easy.

00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:19,198
SPEAKER_1:  Somebody on Reddit asked.

00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:22,910
SPEAKER_1:  Ask him about the cross grip he used to sweep.

00:42:23,138 --> 00:42:25,054
SPEAKER_1:  followed with a Genius Grip switch.

00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:28,702
SPEAKER_1:  when buchasha was inverted. did you use a cross grip when you sweep?

00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:31,783
SPEAKER_0:  I guess the cross grip in the arm, that must be it.

00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:32,254
SPEAKER_1:  Costco.

00:42:32,866 --> 00:42:33,246
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:38,782
SPEAKER_1:  What's the genius behind that? Or was that just the, uh, do you like that kind of.

00:42:39,074 --> 00:42:39,870
SPEAKER_1:  that kind of grip.

00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, because I always like clothes guard.

00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  and no one wants to be in anyone's close guard, right? It's open guard, isn't it?

00:42:48,002 --> 00:42:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  step to pass.

00:42:49,826 --> 00:42:53,790
SPEAKER_0:  So everybody, when you try to close the gap, they bring them in in the middle.

00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:54,686
SPEAKER_0:  Like if you...

00:42:55,586 --> 00:42:57,726
SPEAKER_0:  if you're not standing, if you're lower on the ground.

00:42:58,274 --> 00:43:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  and the open guard, if you're close to me, you'll need that knee between.

00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:02,878
SPEAKER_0:  So it is a must.

00:43:03,202 --> 00:43:04,030
SPEAKER_0:  That's when I stop.

00:43:04,642 --> 00:43:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  developing the attack. You know, I managed to have long legs to close.

00:43:08,898 --> 00:43:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  my legs around people even with that.

00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  and then I just developed that sweep.

00:43:13,602 --> 00:43:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  When did you start developing that? I don't remember when, but I would say before Black Belt.

00:43:19,298 --> 00:43:20,158
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so.

00:43:21,442 --> 00:43:25,022
SPEAKER_1:  Your answer to that is not to figure out how to prevent them from putting the knee in.

00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:27,198
SPEAKER_1:  Is there an answer to that?

00:43:29,058 --> 00:43:30,933
SPEAKER_1:  But good guys will always know you're coming.

00:43:30,933 --> 00:43:32,798
SPEAKER_0:  Remove that leg out of the way.

00:43:33,058 --> 00:43:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  It's not possible.

00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:35,765
SPEAKER_1:  Well maybe off balance them enough to wear this.

00:43:35,765 --> 00:43:36,222
SPEAKER_0:  No.

00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:41,438
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, you can try but like it's hard. You cannot balance the use with them.

00:43:43,298 --> 00:43:45,790
SPEAKER_0:  So that means you're going to have to solve that problem.

00:43:46,722 --> 00:43:50,718
SPEAKER_0:  because that is extremely common to have that.

00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, if I'm on your guard, open guard.

00:43:54,690 --> 00:44:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  If you have your legs, if the thumb between both of your legs in the open guard, my knee will be between your legs because it's a must. My knee cannot be on the floor.

00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:05,310
SPEAKER_1:  Since Hanzo was there, what did he tell you before?

00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:10,206
SPEAKER_0:  I think it just motivates you. I think that's what Hanzo always did.

00:44:10,562 --> 00:44:11,486
SPEAKER_0:  fantastically well.

00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  to motivate me.

00:44:13,474 --> 00:44:15,390
SPEAKER_0:  like before in fight a match.

00:44:16,194 --> 00:44:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  I think that the confidence is...

00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  you know, his energy being around you. I think that's the...

00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:27,646
SPEAKER_0:  It's the great thing to have hands on your corner. It's the motivation that he gives you.

00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:30,782
SPEAKER_1:  What did you learn about Jiu Jitsu and Life from Hensel Gracie?

00:44:31,618 --> 00:44:35,774
SPEAKER_1:  We got to hang out with him in Vegas a little bit. He's a character. He's one of the...

00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:41,886
SPEAKER_1:  uh, historic coaches and jiu-jitsu competitors, but also personalities in the martial arts world.

00:44:42,178 --> 00:44:44,382
SPEAKER_1:  in the world in general. There's very few like them.

00:44:44,674 --> 00:44:46,814
SPEAKER_0:  Hansel is a fantastic person.

00:44:47,426 --> 00:44:47,966
SPEAKER_0:  It's.

00:44:48,738 --> 00:44:53,630
SPEAKER_0:  It's like, you know, what I've learned most from him is like, it's, you know, you can take any challenge.

00:44:54,146 --> 00:44:55,998
SPEAKER_0:  It doesn't matter.

00:44:56,514 --> 00:44:57,278
SPEAKER_0:  where and where.

00:44:58,210 --> 00:44:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, what you know who?

00:45:00,034 --> 00:45:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  It's, you know, you have to be ready.

00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:02,366
SPEAKER_0:  and.

00:45:03,426 --> 00:45:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  With the warrior spirit that he has, he always took any challenge.

00:45:08,674 --> 00:45:10,206
SPEAKER_0:  Ready or not ready.

00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:14,334
SPEAKER_1:  Was it you that said it or he said it where?

00:45:15,074 --> 00:45:16,702
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, not until...

00:45:18,018 --> 00:45:19,710
SPEAKER_1:  You go in.

00:45:20,514 --> 00:45:24,254
SPEAKER_1:  you know, to do something difficult, do you discover the strength that you have?

00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:26,878
SPEAKER_1:  If you really think about it.

00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:32,574
SPEAKER_1:  you might think that you're not good enough, you don't have the strength to take on something.

00:45:32,706 --> 00:45:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  I fully agree that I think we are measured not...

00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:38,782
SPEAKER_0:  when we're on the strongest, but when we're on the weakest.

00:45:39,618 --> 00:45:40,318
SPEAKER_0:  That's when we...

00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  truly measure ourselves or character.

00:45:42,626 --> 00:45:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  who we are.

00:45:43,714 --> 00:45:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  not when in a position of power.

00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  and we're in a position of weakness.

00:45:47,586 --> 00:45:48,734
SPEAKER_1:  Have you surprised yourself?

00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:50,782
SPEAKER_1:  like how damn good you are.

00:45:51,522 --> 00:45:51,934
SPEAKER_1:  Thank you.

00:45:52,514 --> 00:45:52,990
SPEAKER_1:  Is this?

00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,614
SPEAKER_1:  Is this really how good I am in this situation?

00:45:55,938 --> 00:45:58,563
SPEAKER_1:  where in retrospect you might think how the hell was I able to accomplish this?

00:45:58,563 --> 00:45:59,550
SPEAKER_0:  accomplish this.

00:46:00,578 --> 00:46:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  how good I am because...

00:46:02,722 --> 00:46:03,966
SPEAKER_0:  Otherwise I wouldn't be there.

00:46:04,834 --> 00:46:08,574
SPEAKER_0:  So, you know, being there in the first place, it's already...

00:46:08,962 --> 00:46:09,886
SPEAKER_0:  and not a great thing.

00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:16,670
SPEAKER_0:  But I say, you know, every single time I found myself there, I was super proud that...

00:46:17,282 --> 00:46:18,302
SPEAKER_0:  I've never cracked.

00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  Like I've never gave up.

00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  ever.

00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  Any second, any fight, never.

00:46:24,354 --> 00:46:26,229
SPEAKER_1:  never been broken in competition.

00:46:26,229 --> 00:46:27,038
SPEAKER_0:  ever.

00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,942
SPEAKER_0:  It's not about winning or losing, it's about you giving up.

00:46:31,618 --> 00:46:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  I've never doubt myself. I always fought to the very end.

00:46:35,554 --> 00:46:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  always.

00:46:36,674 --> 00:46:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  that I'm.

00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  Most proud of.

00:46:39,842 --> 00:46:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  because there was moments, you know, it's...

00:46:41,762 --> 00:46:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  You're in a terrible position.

00:46:43,874 --> 00:46:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  You know, mainly like there was moments that I was super tired, but like exhaustive tired when

00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:53,182
SPEAKER_0:  And it was easy to give up, like I had nothing more to give.

00:46:54,114 --> 00:46:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  Bye bye.

00:46:55,362 --> 00:46:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  pushed.

00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:57,118
SPEAKER_0:  took.

00:46:58,146 --> 00:46:59,614
SPEAKER_0:  energy out of my soul.

00:46:59,842 --> 00:47:02,526
SPEAKER_0:  I'll have to say, because my body had zero.

00:47:03,042 --> 00:47:05,150
SPEAKER_0:  my spirit, my soul.

00:47:05,858 --> 00:47:06,270
SPEAKER_0:  holler at.

00:47:07,522 --> 00:47:11,102
SPEAKER_1:  Is that in part just not allowing yourself to have...

00:47:12,354 --> 00:47:14,174
SPEAKER_1:  to ever quit.

00:47:16,194 --> 00:47:17,278
SPEAKER_1:  I have a...

00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:20,670
SPEAKER_1:  One other thing I regret, I remember like a blue belt match.

00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:22,046
SPEAKER_1:  Remember.

00:47:22,562 --> 00:47:24,158
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not gonna say who it was against.

00:47:24,674 --> 00:47:25,022
SPEAKER_1:  but.

00:47:25,346 --> 00:47:25,790
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:28,766
SPEAKER_1:  I remember it as just being extremely exhausted.

00:47:29,922 --> 00:47:30,910
SPEAKER_1:  And um...

00:47:31,202 --> 00:47:36,734
SPEAKER_1:  just constantly fighting a guy was really good mount, really good guard passing. And I just remember.

00:47:37,378 --> 00:47:39,166
SPEAKER_1:  uh... him passing my guard

00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:42,910
SPEAKER_1:  Eventually, it was the second finals of one of the IBGJF tournaments.

00:47:43,874 --> 00:47:44,446
SPEAKER_1:  and then.

00:47:45,442 --> 00:47:47,294
SPEAKER_1:  It's right away going to mount.

00:47:48,194 --> 00:47:48,894
SPEAKER_1:  and just...

00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:54,046
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know, the level of frustration, I mean, I quit.

00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:54,846
SPEAKER_1:  that point.

00:47:55,586 --> 00:47:59,262
SPEAKER_1:  I remember that still. It's not about losing winning or losing.

00:47:59,554 --> 00:48:03,806
SPEAKER_1:  I just remember I was like, I was like teary-eyed frustrated.

00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:07,262
SPEAKER_1:  And then I knew there was a lot of fights still left.

00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:11,166
SPEAKER_1:  in there somewhere and I quit and I regret that to this day.

00:48:11,682 --> 00:48:15,294
SPEAKER_1:  is I think the reason I regret that is because it gave me an option.

00:48:16,002 --> 00:48:19,102
SPEAKER_1:  to now quit in every other aspect of life.

00:48:19,682 --> 00:48:20,830
SPEAKER_1:  that this is an option.

00:48:21,922 --> 00:48:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  It is.

00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  it sucks

00:48:26,242 --> 00:48:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it teaches you, you know.

00:48:28,738 --> 00:48:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  makes us stronger.

00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:31,294
SPEAKER_0:  I think it made you stronger.

00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:36,030
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it makes you stronger that you did that to learn that don't do that again.

00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:37,022
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:48:37,634 --> 00:48:39,038
SPEAKER_1:  But still, like you said, just-

00:48:39,586 --> 00:48:40,862
SPEAKER_1:  going to sleep in training.

00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:43,134
SPEAKER_1:  I do think it made me weaker.

00:48:43,362 --> 00:48:47,966
SPEAKER_1:  It did make me weaker in the rest of my life too. Those, you know, I've quit a few times in my life.

00:48:48,578 --> 00:48:49,470
SPEAKER_1:  and small things.

00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:51,742
SPEAKER_1:  and you realize, okay, it's not that big of a deal.

00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:53,982
SPEAKER_1:  Like who cares?

00:48:54,434 --> 00:48:54,846
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:48:55,138 --> 00:48:58,558
SPEAKER_1:  But what you learn over time is that voice always comes there.

00:48:59,042 --> 00:48:59,486
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

00:49:00,098 --> 00:49:00,734
SPEAKER_1:  I see.

00:49:00,962 --> 00:49:03,230
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe it does for you too, even at the highest level.

00:49:03,618 --> 00:49:06,686
SPEAKER_1:  of like, it's not that big of a deal. Like, it's okay to quit here.

00:49:06,914 --> 00:49:07,486
SPEAKER_1:  Hehehe

00:49:07,746 --> 00:49:09,790
SPEAKER_1:  Like it makes sense. I really would understand.

00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:10,750
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:13,470
SPEAKER_1:  you know, in some sense like.

00:49:13,954 --> 00:49:14,782
SPEAKER_1:  your

00:49:15,426 --> 00:49:19,326
SPEAKER_1:  You know, many people would say you're past your prime in this match with the projection. Like...

00:49:19,554 --> 00:49:22,782
SPEAKER_1:  It makes sense. You've been focusing on MMA. Makes sense? Yeah.

00:49:22,882 --> 00:49:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  Meh.

00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:25,022
SPEAKER_1:  Makes sense to lose.

00:49:25,442 --> 00:49:27,966
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I don't know that that's a weird voice.

00:49:28,226 --> 00:49:28,574
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:49:28,802 --> 00:49:29,950
SPEAKER_1:  in some sense.

00:49:30,242 --> 00:49:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  It's that voice and the voice that says like.

00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:33,918
SPEAKER_1:  Why are you doing this?

00:49:34,242 --> 00:49:39,335
SPEAKER_1:  Like this is silly. Doesn't make any sense. Just stop, just stop, just stop.

00:49:39,335 --> 00:49:40,835
SPEAKER_0:  we'll meet the Earl.

00:49:40,835 --> 00:49:41,214
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:46,814
SPEAKER_1:  and shutting that voice down and never allowing yourself to quit. That's a really powerful thing. Like everybody I've met.

00:49:48,002 --> 00:49:49,662
SPEAKER_1:  Everybody that's successful.

00:49:50,242 --> 00:49:50,686
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:54,750
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, down to the even engineers, CEOs.

00:49:55,074 --> 00:49:55,774
SPEAKER_1:  Yamas

00:49:56,354 --> 00:49:57,182
SPEAKER_1:  Just never quitting.

00:49:58,466 --> 00:50:01,310
SPEAKER_1:  Like when everybody around you says quit, never quitting.

00:50:01,602 --> 00:50:02,974
SPEAKER_1:  That's weird. I don't know what that is.

00:50:03,202 --> 00:50:04,062
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe genetic.

00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:09,918
SPEAKER_1:  It might be like using the stubbornness to just never allow yourself to.

00:50:11,522 --> 00:50:14,398
SPEAKER_1:  develop that, it's basically developing a callus.

00:50:14,882 --> 00:50:17,214
SPEAKER_1:  to that voice that tries to tell you to quit.

00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:18,782
SPEAKER_1:  You never quit, huh?

00:50:19,426 --> 00:50:20,670
SPEAKER_1:  What would you attribute that to?

00:50:21,474 --> 00:50:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  It's.

00:50:22,946 --> 00:50:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  Like it.

00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  how much you want.

00:50:25,218 --> 00:50:27,038
SPEAKER_0:  to get to the destination you chose.

00:50:27,938 --> 00:50:28,542
SPEAKER_0:  Who knows?

00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  How badly do you want to get there?

00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  If you quit, you're never gonna get there.

00:50:33,922 --> 00:50:35,047
SPEAKER_0:  And you always wanted to.

00:50:35,047 --> 00:50:35,710
SPEAKER_1:  I always wanted.

00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:43,294
SPEAKER_1:  Is there something you remember from that match? Some things that happened before and after that stand out to you?

00:50:43,746 --> 00:50:44,734
SPEAKER_1:  Just since in Rio.

00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:46,878
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, there was an interview, you know, like...

00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  Trial to the fight.

00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:54,494
SPEAKER_0:  You know, there was a big fight. We were doing media every day before. We were meeting, you know, me and him, and we were meeting for media.

00:50:55,426 --> 00:50:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:50:57,538 --> 00:51:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  It's like five days before, five, six days before. I'm quite chatty.

00:51:02,018 --> 00:51:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  The closer we get to the file, the more focus I get.

00:51:05,154 --> 00:51:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  the less they talk, stop.

00:51:07,202 --> 00:51:09,278
SPEAKER_0:  joke around playing with people.

00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  But I remember, I think it was maybe three or four days before we were doing an interview together.

00:51:15,746 --> 00:51:19,230
SPEAKER_0:  My cousin Kira was there, she was doing one of the interviews with us.

00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:51:22,594 --> 00:51:30,046
SPEAKER_0:  I don't remember exactly what we were talking about, but I just remember we were talking about the fight, of course, and then we were standing beside each other.

00:51:30,722 --> 00:51:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm like...

00:51:32,194 --> 00:51:33,598
SPEAKER_0:  And then I, you know, suddenly I...

00:51:33,954 --> 00:51:46,430
SPEAKER_0:  chop him and grab him by the neck. I said, I'm gonna tap you by the neck. And then he's like, you know, very shy. And then I let go, I said, no, I'm gonna tap you by the arm. And I could feel he was like, he wasn't comfortable.

00:51:46,786 --> 00:51:48,382
SPEAKER_0:  you know, with being the Aidos.

00:51:48,834 --> 00:51:52,798
SPEAKER_0:  You know me saying that I'm gonna tap him out. I was so relaxed.

00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  joking about it, but I'm joking that I'm going to tap him out in a fight that we're going to have him for this time.

00:51:58,818 --> 00:51:59,358
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:52:00,354 --> 00:52:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I felt he was like...

00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:03,550
SPEAKER_0:  Not close at all.

00:52:04,418 --> 00:52:07,582
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think you got in his head a little bit? Did he give you a little bit of confidence?

00:52:08,418 --> 00:52:14,078
SPEAKER_1:  You said that Jiu Jitsu is a reflection of your personality. So both your Jiu Jitsu and your personality, there's a calmness.

00:52:14,402 --> 00:52:16,062
SPEAKER_1:  What is that? Why are you so calm?

00:52:16,418 --> 00:52:23,262
SPEAKER_1:  Is there like an ocean underneath that's boiling? Is this developed or is this your personality? Are you basically leveraging who you are?

00:52:23,554 --> 00:52:24,126
SPEAKER_1:  already.

00:52:24,994 --> 00:52:28,670
SPEAKER_1:  to develop a game around the Jijetsu or the Jijetsu and make you calm.

00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:32,542
SPEAKER_0:  I think both. I was always very calm since I was a kid.

00:52:32,866 --> 00:52:33,918
SPEAKER_0:  No, it's very young.

00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  I was never very, you know, fiery.

00:52:36,546 --> 00:52:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  person.

00:52:37,282 --> 00:52:38,814
SPEAKER_0:  So that is a reflection.

00:52:39,042 --> 00:52:41,246
SPEAKER_0:  you know, you reflected on my deduces of my life.

00:52:41,538 --> 00:52:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  on my fights, the way I fight.

00:52:43,522 --> 00:52:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  So it's a direct influence of my personality.

00:52:47,362 --> 00:52:49,950
SPEAKER_0:  And I think it's also in the day, you know, you.

00:52:50,466 --> 00:52:51,006
SPEAKER_0:  develop.

00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  the more you practice, the more you...

00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  Fight this!

00:52:55,106 --> 00:52:56,606
SPEAKER_0:  Like, you know, you don't want.

00:52:56,834 --> 00:52:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  get nervous you don't want the adrenaline in so you just

00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  Learn how to shut that off from your mind.

00:53:02,914 --> 00:53:06,494
SPEAKER_0:  So the last I thought about it, you know, is like how many times I fought.

00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

00:53:07,458 --> 00:53:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  Let's say the week before the fight, that's when you start.

00:53:10,786 --> 00:53:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  More.

00:53:11,906 --> 00:53:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  when you're concerned the most, because now it's getting very close. Before it was just far away.

00:53:16,738 --> 00:53:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  Nice.

00:53:17,474 --> 00:53:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  It's normal to think of the tournament, you get a bit nervous, but it goes away quick.

00:53:22,018 --> 00:53:25,950
SPEAKER_0:  But the fight, you know, the week before, now you're constantly thinking of that day.

00:53:26,818 --> 00:53:30,334
SPEAKER_0:  And every time you think, adrenaline pumps in, your heart accelerates.

00:53:30,754 --> 00:53:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  And it doesn't.

00:53:31,874 --> 00:53:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it makes it, it's like, why am I feeling this? What difference will it make? So you kinda...

00:53:36,962 --> 00:53:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  you're sharing that thought out of your mind because you don't wanna feel the adrenaline, your heart accelerating. It's not gonna add you anything.

00:53:44,674 --> 00:53:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  So it's the practice also that.

00:53:47,394 --> 00:53:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  I think you helped me.

00:53:49,762 --> 00:53:50,750
SPEAKER_0:  shut that off my mind.

00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  Has that helped you in regular life?

00:53:52,706 --> 00:53:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, of course. It's suddenly when you...

00:53:56,258 --> 00:53:57,246
SPEAKER_0:  going to any

00:53:57,762 --> 00:54:03,390
SPEAKER_0:  any situation that might be stressful, like an important meeting or super whatever it is.

00:54:03,714 --> 00:54:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  It's like how much would you worry about that before? Worry is not gonna help you anywhere. It's the opposite.

00:54:10,082 --> 00:54:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  Just gonna make you more nervous, your heart will accelerate.

00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  your ability to think clearly is gonna be.

00:54:15,714 --> 00:54:16,574
SPEAKER_0:  Damaged by that.

00:54:16,898 --> 00:54:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  So it's like the more calm, the more.

00:54:20,386 --> 00:54:21,406
SPEAKER_0:  Relax you all.

00:54:22,146 --> 00:54:23,166
SPEAKER_0:  better you can think of.

00:54:24,002 --> 00:54:24,894
SPEAKER_1:  Do you ever get angry?

00:54:25,314 --> 00:54:25,630
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:27,166
SPEAKER_1:  like in traffic.

00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:30,878
SPEAKER_1:  Do you ever get like not calm just like you're screaming?

00:54:31,362 --> 00:54:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  not in a screen incident.

00:54:33,954 --> 00:54:37,182
SPEAKER_1:  but just angry. What does angry look like? Is it still calm?

00:54:38,082 --> 00:54:38,686
SPEAKER_0:  Hehehe w

00:54:39,458 --> 00:54:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I like a few seconds of complaining, but then it goes away.

00:54:42,818 --> 00:54:46,193
SPEAKER_1:  Have you ever like thrown a cell phone at a wall or something like that?

00:54:46,193 --> 00:54:52,350
SPEAKER_0:  No, I never get that. That's just silly. It's like it's...

00:54:52,642 --> 00:54:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  If I would have done that.

00:54:54,338 --> 00:54:57,342
SPEAKER_0:  I would not be able to control my emotions prior to a fight.

00:54:58,562 --> 00:54:59,687
SPEAKER_0:

00:54:59,687 --> 00:55:01,937
SPEAKER_1:  reflection. Letting yourself lose.

00:55:01,937 --> 00:55:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, losing control that will reflect other.

00:55:07,682 --> 00:55:08,190
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think?

00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,526
SPEAKER_1:  It has, uh, make you-

00:55:10,946 --> 00:55:14,302
SPEAKER_1:  in part made you more emotionally closed off from the world.

00:55:14,562 --> 00:55:17,438
SPEAKER_1:  Like it's harder for you to be vulnerable to others.

00:55:17,794 --> 00:55:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  Probably.

00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, but I heard that a few times.

00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:24,158
SPEAKER_0:  emotionally close.

00:55:25,026 --> 00:55:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe, I think that influences it.

00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  Have you ever cried in a movie?

00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  Not for many years, but for that thing, maybe I'm getting older. Do you remember the movie? Something, no. It's a silly movie. I mean, it's not... No, I mean... A good book.

00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  You're not sane.

00:55:42,114 --> 00:55:43,582
SPEAKER_0:  the last few years.

00:55:44,002 --> 00:55:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  I've been crying more than before.

00:55:46,146 --> 00:55:48,766
SPEAKER_0:  for some reason, I don't know why, like silly movies.

00:55:49,058 --> 00:55:51,134
SPEAKER_0:  Nothing suddenly brings tears to my eyes.

00:55:52,226 --> 00:55:53,351
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I've already...

00:55:53,351 --> 00:55:55,870
SPEAKER_1:  Already just having met you and interacted with you.

00:55:56,098 --> 00:55:57,214
SPEAKER_1:  I can see that you're...

00:55:57,762 --> 00:55:59,902
SPEAKER_1:  kind of opening your heart and mind to the world.

00:56:00,258 --> 00:56:01,470
SPEAKER_1:  You could see like...

00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:02,494
SPEAKER_1:  Here's.

00:56:02,914 --> 00:56:05,214
SPEAKER_1:  this historically great

00:56:05,826 --> 00:56:06,526
SPEAKER_1:  athlete.

00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:18,321
SPEAKER_0:  Probably I'm bringing my guard down now. I don't have to get up all the time. I'm going to take a quick bite.

00:56:18,321 --> 00:56:24,446
SPEAKER_1:  You could even do some podcasts. You said you watched movies beforehand sometimes. You mentioned Braveheart.

00:56:24,706 --> 00:56:28,081

SPEAKER_0:  I mean, there's a few others that I've always watched the day before, because the day before I used to do nothing.

00:56:41,378 --> 00:56:45,630

00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  stretching by myself, so it's like it's just want to save energy.

00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:54,270
SPEAKER_0:  So, you know, I...

00:56:54,626 --> 00:56:56,670

SPEAKER_1:  Should you put your life on the line?

00:57:16,322 --> 00:57:17,726
SPEAKER_1:  for a thing that matters.

00:57:18,082 --> 00:57:19,006
SPEAKER_1:  or run away.

00:57:19,426 --> 00:57:20,382
SPEAKER_1:  just so you can live.

00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:21,086

SPEAKER_1:  Oh man.

00:57:40,418 --> 00:57:42,142
SPEAKER_1:  What is that about human nature?

00:57:42,402 --> 00:57:42,750
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:57:44,546 --> 00:57:47,902
SPEAKER_1:  Is there some aspect of like the glory you were able to achieve?

00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:48,798
SPEAKER_1:  being.

00:57:49,506 --> 00:57:50,974
SPEAKER_1:  More important than anything else.

00:57:51,874 --> 00:57:54,942
SPEAKER_1:  There's some aspect of that. That's greatness.

00:57:55,362 --> 00:57:57,598
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I never pursue glory.

00:57:58,466 --> 00:58:03,870
SPEAKER_0:  So it just came, you know, it came with it, but that was never my goal.

00:58:04,194 --> 00:58:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  I never cared for.

00:58:06,658 --> 00:58:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  Glory.

00:58:07,138 --> 00:58:08,894
SPEAKER_1:  Were you able to experience?

00:58:09,154 --> 00:58:09,630
SPEAKER_1:  like.

00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:12,158

SPEAKER_1:  this thing.

00:58:13,154 --> 00:58:16,030
SPEAKER_1:  Whatever humanity is able to achieve in various things.

00:58:16,418 --> 00:58:17,150
SPEAKER_1:  Holy shit.

00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:19,038

SPEAKER_0:  like.

00:58:21,474 --> 00:58:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  up.

00:58:22,818 --> 00:58:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  no one can touch me.

00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  I can destroy people.

00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:29,022
SPEAKER_1:  prolonged periods of time or just momentarily.

00:58:31,906 --> 00:58:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  I always knew.

00:58:33,698 --> 00:58:37,662
SPEAKER_0:  You know, from before I got to Black Belt, like, you know, it's...

00:58:37,922 --> 00:58:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  I can be great.

00:58:39,074 --> 00:58:41,886
SPEAKER_0:  because I used to train with the best in the world.

00:58:42,114 --> 00:58:42,846
SPEAKER_0:  I used to be a knight.

00:58:43,426 --> 00:58:45,726
SPEAKER_0:  for many years and I used to see my progression.

00:58:46,338 --> 00:58:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  with.

00:58:47,266 --> 00:58:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  than everybody else. So I knew I was.

00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  getting somewhere.

00:58:51,266 --> 00:58:52,766
SPEAKER_0:  I know I could be.

00:58:52,994 --> 00:58:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  the best.

00:58:54,242 --> 00:58:57,246
SPEAKER_0:  And that was always my goal since very, very young.

00:58:58,306 --> 00:59:00,638
SPEAKER_0:  and I always believed that I could be.

00:59:00,994 --> 00:59:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  I'm dead.

00:59:02,114 --> 00:59:03,166
SPEAKER_0:  over the years, Doug.

00:59:04,066 --> 00:59:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  telling me over and over again because...

00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  I'm getting better and better, faster than everybody else.

00:59:11,042 --> 00:59:12,766
SPEAKER_0:  So it's, I just need to carry on.

00:59:13,154 --> 00:59:14,279
SPEAKER_0:  with what I'm doing.

00:59:14,279 --> 00:59:16,670
SPEAKER_1:  but I think you've said that you wanted to.

00:59:17,378 --> 00:59:20,414
SPEAKER_1:  and maybe you thought you could be the greatest of all time.

00:59:21,538 --> 00:59:23,134
SPEAKER_1:  like at the very beginning.

00:59:23,746 --> 00:59:25,758
SPEAKER_1:  Like when you sucked.

00:59:26,498 --> 00:59:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, not the greatest of all time because...

00:59:29,922 --> 00:59:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  And I never really thought about that, but I thought I'm going to be the best in the world when I saw it.

00:59:35,522 --> 00:59:38,206
SPEAKER_1:  when I saw it. So what is that?

00:59:39,426 --> 00:59:40,158
SPEAKER_1:  What is that?

00:59:40,578 --> 00:59:41,950
SPEAKER_1:  Like that self-belief.

00:59:42,434 --> 00:59:45,854
SPEAKER_1:  Is there a component to that self-belief being a prerequisite?

00:59:46,274 --> 00:59:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  It's difficult to say because that was a decision.

00:59:49,122 --> 00:59:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

00:59:50,498 --> 00:59:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  like

00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:53,310
SPEAKER_0:  Why did I believe I could be?

00:59:53,986 --> 00:59:55,966
SPEAKER_0:  I can't tell her that because I don't know.

00:59:56,418 --> 01:00:00,543
SPEAKER_0:  But you think you decided to be? I decided to be and I believed I could.

01:00:00,543 --> 01:00:02,590
SPEAKER_1:  You think there's like a day somewhere?

01:00:02,978 --> 01:00:07,006
SPEAKER_1:  When you were young, were you like, huh, you're sitting on a couch eating Cheetos.

01:00:07,682 --> 01:00:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think it was a day, like a moment.

01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:11,774
SPEAKER_0:  because...

01:00:14,018 --> 01:00:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  for many years is.

01:00:15,618 --> 01:00:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  I wasn't really training much as a child.

01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  I've done a bit of, I used to train and then stop, done a bit of judo, never stay away from it.

01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  much.

01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  Until in all it.

01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  like from 10 to...

01:00:28,898 --> 01:00:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  14.

01:00:29,922 --> 01:00:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  I barely train Jiu-Jitsu much. I used to.

01:00:32,866 --> 01:00:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  There was no Gracie school near where I used to live.

01:00:36,002 --> 01:00:36,414
SPEAKER_0:  in.

01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:39,422
SPEAKER_0:  There was a Jiu Jitsu, a Judo school.

01:00:40,418 --> 01:00:41,054
SPEAKER_0:  twice a week.

01:00:42,018 --> 01:00:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  I went to a judis tournament, I lost in five seconds, left crying.

01:00:46,978 --> 01:00:49,086
SPEAKER_0:  The guy, he pulled me in five seconds. Anyway.

01:00:49,858 --> 01:00:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:00:51,362 --> 01:00:52,478
SPEAKER_0:  When I was 14

01:00:52,706 --> 01:00:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  I went to the south of Brazil to see my uncle Helium.

01:00:56,546 --> 01:00:59,134
SPEAKER_0:  to spend summer holidays. I was there for like four weeks, I think.

01:01:00,066 --> 01:01:03,518
SPEAKER_0:  And when I got there, my cousin Hollis was living with him. Hollis like.

01:01:04,546 --> 01:01:06,846
SPEAKER_0:  bigger than me, it was, I think it's four years.

01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  I was four years old, so I was 14, I was already 18.

01:01:10,402 --> 01:01:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  1718.

01:01:11,938 --> 01:01:13,310
SPEAKER_0:  Purple Belt competitor.

01:01:13,890 --> 01:01:18,398
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that was the first time in my life that I felt what it means.

01:01:19,106 --> 01:01:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  what it meant to be a Gracie.

01:01:21,474 --> 01:01:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of

01:01:23,074 --> 01:01:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  having a school, teaching, training.

01:01:25,346 --> 01:01:30,942
SPEAKER_0:  living that Jiu-Jitsu lifestyle, what a great city it means to be. And I've just, I've loved it.

01:01:31,778 --> 01:01:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  I was out of shape.

01:01:33,474 --> 01:01:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  My uncle was like, he knows.

01:01:35,266 --> 01:01:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  incentivizing me to lose weight, to train.

01:01:38,402 --> 01:01:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  you're not training, why? It's like you've got a shape, you need to diet, so it's...

01:01:42,882 --> 01:01:47,902
SPEAKER_0:  I used to run every day, I was eating super well. I start, you know, I start that when I start changing.

01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  So when I go back to Rio, I was super motivated.

01:01:51,394 --> 01:01:51,806
SPEAKER_0:  follow up.

01:01:52,098 --> 01:01:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  carry on.

01:01:53,154 --> 01:01:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  And he invited me to go back there to live with him.

01:01:57,442 --> 01:01:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  But I couldn't, it was too soon.

01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  and to change schools and everything. My mom said no, but maybe next year if you want to go.

01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:04,830
SPEAKER_0:  You can.

01:02:05,698 --> 01:02:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  So I kept that in my mind next year.

01:02:08,546 --> 01:02:11,710
SPEAKER_0:  I moved to the south to live with them. I was 15.

01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  And it was him, my uncle Hilon.

01:02:15,138 --> 01:02:16,702
SPEAKER_0:  and my uncle crawling.

01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:20,606
SPEAKER_0:  They both used to live very close to each other. They used to have their own schools close to each other.

01:02:21,282 --> 01:02:22,590
SPEAKER_0:  So I was with both.

01:02:23,266 --> 01:02:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  And I stayed there for almost a year.

01:02:25,058 --> 01:02:27,038
SPEAKER_0:  I mean I was the youngest in the academy, that was...

01:02:27,522 --> 01:02:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  or some, you know.

01:02:28,866 --> 01:02:31,902
SPEAKER_0:  blue, purple bells, normal guy, but they're very competing.

01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  ahead of me and I just joined the group of training.

01:02:36,706 --> 01:02:40,030
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't compete while I was there because there was no composition at that time.

01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  And I wasn't really ready, but it's not about competing, it's more about the training.

01:02:44,226 --> 01:02:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  and I start training every day, start improving.

01:02:46,754 --> 01:02:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  And a year after that when I came back to Rio...

01:02:49,634 --> 01:02:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  I was already on a mission. I was like, I love this.

01:02:52,578 --> 01:02:54,270
SPEAKER_0:  I'm just carrying on training every day.

01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  with my uncle Carlos, Carlos Gracie Jr., Gracie Barra.

01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:02,526
SPEAKER_0:  And the one I got there, I was training a little bit there before, but I'm just 14.

01:03:03,266 --> 01:03:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  But when I got there...

01:03:05,474 --> 01:03:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  That was one of the most competitive, one of the biggest.

01:03:09,858 --> 01:03:11,006
SPEAKER_0:  to school at the time.

01:03:11,778 --> 01:03:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  There were so many.

01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  high level.

01:03:14,498 --> 01:03:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  world champs as competitors in every single belt.

01:03:17,922 --> 01:03:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  It's like I've kind of joined in.

01:03:20,738 --> 01:03:21,214
SPEAKER_0:  Was that.

01:03:22,178 --> 01:03:25,246
SPEAKER_0:  And I've carried on, I don't remember when, but I remember.

01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

01:03:26,562 --> 01:03:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  looking and saying, I'm going to be the best in the world.

01:03:29,794 --> 01:03:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  but I used to be, I was at the bottom of the stairs. No one really believed me. I didn't shout, you know.

01:03:36,194 --> 01:03:39,678
SPEAKER_0:  to disguise, but I told a few people, I'm like, I'm going to be the best.

01:03:40,578 --> 01:03:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:42,238
SPEAKER_0:  That's I think up.

01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  I was just losing but I've never ever doubt.

01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:48,126
SPEAKER_0:  I've never tivered from that.

01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:49,950
SPEAKER_0:  Mission outside.

01:03:50,466 --> 01:03:52,670
SPEAKER_1:  Did anyone believe you when you said you'd be great?

01:03:53,122 --> 01:03:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  Nobody. Did it matter?

01:03:54,594 --> 01:03:55,070
SPEAKER_0:  didn't matter.

01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:56,606
SPEAKER_0:  I don't care, I don't need.

01:03:56,866 --> 01:03:58,494
SPEAKER_1:  even people that like love you.

01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:01,534
SPEAKER_0:  Everybody, my mom, my dad, I mean no one saw.

01:04:02,082 --> 01:04:05,022
SPEAKER_0:  No one in my family thought I was gonna be here today.

01:04:05,602 --> 01:04:06,494
SPEAKER_0:  Nobody.

01:04:07,682 --> 01:04:17,118
SPEAKER_0:  because I just started late. I've never had any start that people, oh, that kid's gonna be really good. I was a chubby kid that didn't barely train.

01:04:17,794 --> 01:04:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, do people look at me just another grace?

01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:22,142
SPEAKER_0:  and I'll talk more.

01:04:22,978 --> 01:04:25,278
SPEAKER_1:  What do you learn from that? What do you think most people?

01:04:27,586 --> 01:04:28,798
SPEAKER_1:  lose that self-belief?

01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:29,598
SPEAKER_1:  They quit.

01:04:29,986 --> 01:04:32,126
SPEAKER_1:  When everyone around them doesn't believe. Yeah erf

01:04:32,642 --> 01:04:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,734
SPEAKER_0:  If it doesn't need approval, yes.

01:04:37,954 --> 01:04:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  I see you shouldn't have approval. I'd never need approval from anyone.

01:04:41,986 --> 01:04:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  I don't care if you believe me or not if you...

01:04:45,538 --> 01:04:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  That's not my problem.

01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:48,158
SPEAKER_1:  It's tough, it's tough.

01:04:48,738 --> 01:04:50,302
SPEAKER_1:  I don't need approval, but...

01:04:52,898 --> 01:04:56,510
SPEAKER_1:  You're surrounded by people older, wiser, better than you.

01:04:56,866 --> 01:04:57,790
SPEAKER_1:  And they're kinda...

01:04:58,306 --> 01:05:01,630
SPEAKER_1:  directly or indirectly saying you stop being silly kid.

01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:07,070
SPEAKER_0:  No one ever told me that because that was not something that I used to say all the time.

01:05:07,746 --> 01:05:09,982
SPEAKER_0:  I've maybe said this very, very few times.

01:05:10,754 --> 01:05:12,629
SPEAKER_1:  I just hope you know, maybe that's the secret.

01:05:12,629 --> 01:05:16,030
SPEAKER_0:  Of course, I mean if you start shouting then you've just been silly.

01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:17,854
SPEAKER_0:  then it's not what you really want.

01:05:18,338 --> 01:05:21,790
SPEAKER_0:  then you're saying that for other reasons, if you say it over and over again.

01:05:22,594 --> 01:05:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  Because you shouldn't.

01:05:23,810 --> 01:05:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, why? Well, uh-

01:05:25,506 --> 01:05:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  to push back one of the reasons you might want to say it.

01:05:28,674 --> 01:05:30,750
SPEAKER_1:  is to find the right people that believe in you.

01:05:30,914 --> 01:05:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah but not if you say over and over again.

01:05:33,442 --> 01:05:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  then it's just...

01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:35,646
SPEAKER_0:  then you're just bragging.

01:05:37,378 --> 01:05:37,758
SPEAKER_0:

01:05:38,498 --> 01:05:39,646
SPEAKER_0:  One thing is to say it.

01:05:40,258 --> 01:05:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  But the other one is to do it.

01:05:42,722 --> 01:05:44,478
SPEAKER_0:  So it's, you know, you said it.

01:05:44,930 --> 01:05:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  once or very few times, but now you have to do it saying it's not helping you.

01:05:49,314 --> 01:05:49,918
SPEAKER_0:  Get in there.

01:05:50,402 --> 01:05:52,222
SPEAKER_1:  Was there sacrifices you had to make?

01:05:52,418 --> 01:05:52,990
SPEAKER_0:  Everything

01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  Everything. That was my priority in life.

01:05:56,194 --> 01:05:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  Everything was secondary.

01:05:57,890 --> 01:05:59,198
SPEAKER_1:  Like social life.

01:06:00,834 --> 01:06:02,910
SPEAKER_1:  career paths, everything.

01:06:04,514 --> 01:06:07,454
SPEAKER_1:  and is from 14, 15, 16 as you get.

01:06:07,874 --> 01:06:12,670
SPEAKER_1:  better and better and better and better. It was just becoming sharper the focus on this thing.

01:06:13,122 --> 01:06:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it's just over and over again, over and over again. It's just training.

01:06:18,114 --> 01:06:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  Training, training.

01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:06:20,962 --> 01:06:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  I mean.

01:06:21,698 --> 01:06:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  how many times I lost.

01:06:23,682 --> 01:06:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  I have no clue.

01:06:25,922 --> 01:06:29,502
SPEAKER_0:  So on the mat you were getting beat up. I'm getting smashed by everybody.

01:06:30,178 --> 01:06:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  people my age, I was chubby.

01:06:32,194 --> 01:06:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  I was physically weak.

01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:35,742
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I'm tall, but physically...

01:06:36,322 --> 01:06:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not.

01:06:37,154 --> 01:06:40,670
SPEAKER_0:  physically strong. I'm normally strong for my size, but physically...

01:06:41,474 --> 01:06:42,686
SPEAKER_0:  if you wanna measure.

01:06:43,074 --> 01:06:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  Strength and Weak.

01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:46,750
SPEAKER_0:  because we can measure strength.

01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:48,158
SPEAKER_0:  Living weight.

01:06:48,514 --> 01:06:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  I'm weak.

01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  I-

01:06:50,338 --> 01:06:51,166
SPEAKER_0:  Don't lift.

01:06:51,554 --> 01:06:54,334
SPEAKER_0:  I lift weight the same as people much lighter than me.

01:06:54,786 --> 01:06:56,126
SPEAKER_0:  Everybody my own

01:06:56,354 --> 01:06:58,229
SPEAKER_0:  weight, let's have heavier weight.

01:06:58,229 --> 01:07:00,479
SPEAKER_1:  People that train with you often talk about how...

01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,630
SPEAKER_0:  They sound super strong.

01:07:02,146 --> 01:07:05,118
SPEAKER_0:  because I generate a lot of strength. I can create.

01:07:05,762 --> 01:07:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  I put myself in the right angles.

01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:10,494
SPEAKER_0:  so then I can be strong.

01:07:10,914 --> 01:07:11,614
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not strong.

01:07:12,034 --> 01:07:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  and the only person

01:07:13,506 --> 01:07:14,142
SPEAKER_0:  white.

01:07:14,754 --> 01:07:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  Listen.

01:07:15,842 --> 01:07:20,254
SPEAKER_0:  to saying that is a completely one guy that I fought, Rodrigo Medeiros.

01:07:20,834 --> 01:07:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  I've fought him a few times.

01:07:22,786 --> 01:07:27,198
SPEAKER_0:  And he's the only one that I heard saying about me, that's like, no, Roger's not strong.

01:07:28,386 --> 01:07:28,798
SPEAKER_0:  is not.

01:07:29,602 --> 01:07:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  is technical and he can create strength by his nostrum.

01:07:33,026 --> 01:07:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  He meant that as a compliment.

01:07:35,106 --> 01:07:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I think so.

01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  No, I think he was honest because he...

01:07:39,778 --> 01:07:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  I think he's the only one who could see that. Yes.

01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:44,245
SPEAKER_0:  So I think that's a compliment. He's tech.

01:07:44,245 --> 01:07:47,326
SPEAKER_1:  technically really strong. you had incredible matches with him.

01:07:49,666 --> 01:07:50,910
SPEAKER_1:  Is there a.

01:07:52,482 --> 01:07:55,678
SPEAKER_1:  insight you have about how you went from a person.

01:07:56,674 --> 01:07:58,590
SPEAKER_1:  who was not very good.

01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:00,318
SPEAKER_1:  but had a...

01:08:00,706 --> 01:08:01,438
SPEAKER_1:  a dream.

01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:03,902
SPEAKER_1:  a confident dream.

01:08:05,058 --> 01:08:05,982
SPEAKER_1:  a vision.

01:08:06,626 --> 01:08:09,918
SPEAKER_1:  to somebody that was actually good. Was there something to the practice sessions?

01:08:10,658 --> 01:08:11,806
SPEAKER_1:  Were you getting reps?

01:08:12,322 --> 01:08:13,726
SPEAKER_1:  and specific techniques.

01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  I've never done anything special because I'm in a gym training equally with everybody else. So I've never.

01:08:20,194 --> 01:08:22,590
SPEAKER_0:  did anything on the side different than anybody else.

01:08:23,362 --> 01:08:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  So I was in the school training exactly the same way as everybody else. What?

01:08:28,322 --> 01:08:37,297
SPEAKER_1:  In terms of schedule, yes, but what was, can you reverse engineer what was going through your mind? Because there's so many different ways to actually mentally approach the same exact.

01:08:37,297 --> 01:08:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  training session.

01:08:38,786 --> 01:08:39,550
SPEAKER_0:  to be.

01:08:40,482 --> 01:08:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

01:08:41,026 --> 01:08:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  So in some part it's competitive. Yeah, like at the core of it.

01:08:46,018 --> 01:08:47,422
SPEAKER_1:  is I want to be better.

01:08:47,778 --> 01:08:48,903
SPEAKER_1:  than these particular people.

01:08:48,903 --> 01:08:51,710
SPEAKER_0:  You're gonna keep beating me, I'm gonna keep coming back at you.

01:08:52,322 --> 01:08:55,697
SPEAKER_1:  And to do that, I have to solve problems. I have to figure out how to do stuff.

01:08:55,697 --> 01:08:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  You catch me once?

01:08:57,762 --> 01:08:59,774
SPEAKER_0:  I'm gonna keep on coming, try to not...

01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  get you get on that.

01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:04,158
SPEAKER_1:  At which point did you develop?

01:09:04,386 --> 01:09:06,430
SPEAKER_1:  a game that was basically the white.

01:09:06,818 --> 01:09:08,286
SPEAKER_1:  the famous white belt game.

01:09:08,738 --> 01:09:11,966
SPEAKER_1:  of the very basics, the very fundamentals of Jiu-Jitsu.

01:09:12,226 --> 01:09:12,542
SPEAKER_1:  Bye.

01:09:13,922 --> 01:09:15,902
SPEAKER_1:  saying I'm going to beat you.

01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  There was never a conscious decision.

01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:22,590
SPEAKER_0:  to try to have a basic Jiu-Jitsu.

01:09:22,914 --> 01:09:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  first.

01:09:24,642 --> 01:09:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  I think there's a big misconception there.

01:09:26,978 --> 01:09:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, my dream is to discuss it. My dream is not to be right. It's not basic. It's not old school.

01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:33,470
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

01:09:33,890 --> 01:09:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  People, they just don't see that.

01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:37,054
SPEAKER_0:  It's extremely complex.

01:09:38,562 --> 01:09:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  in a way that is

01:09:41,474 --> 01:09:43,422
SPEAKER_0:  people they cannot copy. I teach people.

01:09:43,938 --> 01:09:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I can teach you.

01:09:45,794 --> 01:09:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  the cross collar choke.

01:09:47,618 --> 01:09:49,758
SPEAKER_0:  but the one thing that people they don't realize.

01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:51,998
SPEAKER_0:  is not the move.

01:09:52,418 --> 01:09:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  is you need to practice the movement you learn.

01:09:55,906 --> 01:09:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  is the practice over and over again. Like it took me.

01:09:59,618 --> 01:10:00,254
SPEAKER_0:  Ears.

01:10:01,218 --> 01:10:02,494
SPEAKER_0:  When I say ears, I'm...

01:10:02,914 --> 01:10:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  Years after I was a black belt, I was able to choke people out with a cross-collar choking them out effectively.

01:10:10,018 --> 01:10:14,398
SPEAKER_0:  years after I got my black belt. So that's something that you learn first day, first week.

01:10:15,234 --> 01:10:17,438
SPEAKER_0:  So I can teach you, it makes no difference.

01:10:18,114 --> 01:10:19,678
SPEAKER_0:  You know the theory.

01:10:20,354 --> 01:10:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  But until you apply it in them, you will help you, of course, the more details you learn.

01:10:25,506 --> 01:10:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  the more tools you have to practice, but it's still very complex.

01:10:29,474 --> 01:10:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  because it's not about the move itself, it's about how can you...

01:10:33,602 --> 01:10:35,422
SPEAKER_0:  control the movement of the other person.

01:10:36,354 --> 01:10:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  He's resisting, you're blocking.

01:10:38,114 --> 01:10:42,078
SPEAKER_0:  You cannot predict what he would do and he's doing a whole bunch of moves to block you.

01:10:42,402 --> 01:10:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  every single move you do a step of the way because...

01:10:45,346 --> 01:10:45,790
SPEAKER_0:  It's sub-

01:10:46,114 --> 01:10:46,878
SPEAKER_0:  is sub-

01:10:47,458 --> 01:10:50,526
SPEAKER_0:  progression of move from beginning to end until i apply the choke

01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  is a progression of moving.

01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:56,478
SPEAKER_0:  There's not one way to get that, there's many ways because...

01:10:56,802 --> 01:10:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  how many ways can you block.

01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  You can put your arm in every single angle, we have both arms you can bridge.

01:11:02,562 --> 01:11:04,958
SPEAKER_0:  So it's dealing with all that. That's the stick.

01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:08,542
SPEAKER_0:  That is the complexity of that.

01:11:08,834 --> 01:11:09,374
SPEAKER_0:  position.

01:11:09,922 --> 01:11:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  But that goes for everything, like every single move.

01:11:14,114 --> 01:11:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  my strong moves outside.

01:11:16,034 --> 01:11:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  It took me years.

01:11:17,442 --> 01:11:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  developing them.

01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  years.

01:11:19,938 --> 01:11:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  So it's...

01:11:20,930 --> 01:11:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  And you're going to tell me that's basic.

01:11:22,754 --> 01:11:26,974
SPEAKER_0:  So go try and do it. What the other person is defending, that's the thing. Because.

01:11:27,394 --> 01:11:28,798
SPEAKER_0:  Most of the things that I do.

01:11:29,570 --> 01:11:30,750
SPEAKER_0:  I've been doing that for years.

01:11:31,298 --> 01:11:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  and night.

01:11:32,226 --> 01:11:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  They know that I'm gonna do and...

01:11:34,146 --> 01:11:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  I can still.

01:11:35,746 --> 01:11:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  get it most of the time.

01:11:37,538 --> 01:11:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  That's the hardest.

01:11:39,106 --> 01:11:41,726
SPEAKER_0:  is when they know what's coming, and they think you can still do it.

01:11:42,402 --> 01:11:44,510
SPEAKER_1:  And you said that the way...

01:11:44,802 --> 01:11:45,886
SPEAKER_1:  You're able to do that.

01:11:46,274 --> 01:11:47,774
SPEAKER_1:  You just have to do it right.

01:11:49,858 --> 01:11:51,742
SPEAKER_1:  What do you learn by doing?

01:11:52,482 --> 01:11:53,790
SPEAKER_1:  all the steps along the way.

01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:56,446
SPEAKER_1:  and just for people who don't know, cross-collar choke.

01:11:56,994 --> 01:11:57,534
SPEAKER_1:  them out.

01:11:58,658 --> 01:12:03,102
SPEAKER_1:  So, DJs to start in a neutral place, there's people on their feet and then you either...

01:12:03,362 --> 01:12:07,294
SPEAKER_1:  Then you get to the ground somehow and then there's the person on top and on bottom.

01:12:07,522 --> 01:12:11,614
SPEAKER_1:  and then there's a guard with the legs between the two people and then you can get past the guard

01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:14,206
SPEAKER_1:  As you get past the guard and you

01:12:14,722 --> 01:12:20,414
SPEAKER_1:  into side control and so on, you get more and more and more dominant positions. So mount,

01:12:20,738 --> 01:12:23,550
SPEAKER_1:  is considered to be one of the most dominant positions when you're

01:12:24,834 --> 01:12:27,198
SPEAKER_1:  past their legs sitting on top of their stomach.

01:12:27,874 --> 01:12:28,382
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:12:28,994 --> 01:12:33,182
SPEAKER_1:  putting pressure on them and cross collar chokers using their jacket to.

01:12:33,954 --> 01:12:34,910
SPEAKER_1:  How'd you explain that?

01:12:35,746 --> 01:12:40,606
SPEAKER_0:  So I have the collars, I put my both hands on your collars and when I squeeze.

01:12:41,986 --> 01:12:45,726
SPEAKER_0:  It presses your neck, it blocks the vein, you go to sleep.

01:12:45,954 --> 01:12:48,926
SPEAKER_0:  You throw people with your hands in the wrist, you put them, you know.

01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:51,070
SPEAKER_0:  You grab the collar to get the wrist.

01:12:51,394 --> 01:12:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  around people's neck and you squeeze.

01:12:53,762 --> 01:12:58,110
SPEAKER_1:  The discovery of that is fascinating. I mean, cause it's interesting. It's like, uh,

01:12:59,298 --> 01:13:01,566
SPEAKER_1:  You can imagine there's all kinds of ways to choke.

01:13:02,466 --> 01:13:03,230
SPEAKER_1:  human being.

01:13:04,098 --> 01:13:06,366
SPEAKER_1:  What animals do with their like mouth?

01:13:07,042 --> 01:13:09,246
SPEAKER_1:  Right, they put like their jaws around the.

01:13:10,274 --> 01:13:15,678
SPEAKER_1:  And the fact that you can kind of discover this methodology of the right kind of positioning, and then it becomes an art form.

01:13:16,098 --> 01:13:16,446
SPEAKER_1:  like.

01:13:17,154 --> 01:13:19,006
SPEAKER_1:  of why this, why not.

01:13:19,522 --> 01:13:22,270
SPEAKER_1:  this right or why not this or something like.

01:13:22,594 --> 01:13:23,719
SPEAKER_1:  to figure all that out.

01:13:23,719 --> 01:13:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  practice that will come easy.

01:13:25,538 --> 01:13:28,638
SPEAKER_1:  over time you figure out what works and what not.

01:13:28,994 --> 01:13:29,854
SPEAKER_1:  and then more

01:13:30,498 --> 01:13:33,310
SPEAKER_1:  further and further details and subtleties start to emerge.

01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:34,110
SPEAKER_1:  Anyway.

01:13:34,754 --> 01:13:40,606
SPEAKER_1:  on that process of beating, of being able to beat some of the best people in the world in the thing they know is coming.

01:13:41,762 --> 01:13:42,334
SPEAKER_1:  What did you?

01:13:42,946 --> 01:13:48,030
SPEAKER_1:  What's the difference between the white belt doing that and Hadriah Gracie doing that? The thing that's so hard to explain.

01:13:48,386 --> 01:13:49,854
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think you're picking up?

01:13:50,242 --> 01:13:50,750
SPEAKER_1:  Is it some-

01:13:50,978 --> 01:13:53,603
SPEAKER_1:  tiny tiny details and muscle movements.

01:13:53,603 --> 01:13:53,982
SPEAKER_0:  it is.

01:13:54,242 --> 01:13:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  It's many tiny details because...

01:13:57,666 --> 01:14:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  is the whole movement itself, is the perception.

01:14:01,858 --> 01:14:06,814
SPEAKER_0:  from beginning to end, like every step of the movement, it's important and precise.

01:14:07,394 --> 01:14:08,958
SPEAKER_0:  So it's, you know, you miss one

01:14:09,282 --> 01:14:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  One detail on the way, it collapsed.

01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  So I'm going to start with the black belt.

01:14:13,954 --> 01:14:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  The Black Bear has no control over their whole movement.

01:14:16,322 --> 01:14:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  He's thinking.

01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  beginning and end.

01:14:19,522 --> 01:14:24,222
SPEAKER_0:  So he goes straight to your neck, regardless, he cannot read the other person.

01:14:24,962 --> 01:14:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  If it's, you know.

01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:31,646
SPEAKER_0:  If it's time to let go, if it's the time to go for a neck, should I be pushing here before I get my hand in?

01:14:32,258 --> 01:14:37,133
SPEAKER_0:  Is this the right time to go deep or should I deal with this first before the second hand?

01:14:37,133 --> 01:14:39,166
SPEAKER_1:  That's at the beginning, so it's at the white belt.

01:14:39,522 --> 01:14:41,150
SPEAKER_1:  at the very beginning of the journey.

01:14:42,082 --> 01:14:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  The white belt is just ink.

01:14:43,554 --> 01:14:43,966
SPEAKER_0:  Finish.

01:14:45,122 --> 01:14:45,918
SPEAKER_0:  Mm hmm.

01:14:46,402 --> 01:14:46,814
SPEAKER_0:  Ha ha.

01:14:47,394 --> 01:14:50,622
SPEAKER_1:  And then as you get progress, you see that there's like this.

01:14:51,234 --> 01:14:53,694
SPEAKER_1:  giant tree of possibilities that you're.

01:14:54,114 --> 01:14:57,854
SPEAKER_1:  almost feeling your way down? I mean, would you be able to teach?

01:15:00,610 --> 01:15:01,758
SPEAKER_1:  Do you even know what you're doing?

01:15:02,466 --> 01:15:03,358
SPEAKER_1:  by the details.

01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:06,942
SPEAKER_1:  but it's hard to convert into words probably.

01:15:07,202 --> 01:15:07,614
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:15:07,842 --> 01:15:08,190
SPEAKER_0:  No.

01:15:09,378 --> 01:15:10,750
SPEAKER_0:  Then you don't know what you're doing.

01:15:12,514 --> 01:15:12,958
SPEAKER_1:  Oh.

01:15:14,338 --> 01:15:18,270
SPEAKER_1:  So what is some most important details?

01:15:19,522 --> 01:15:22,814
SPEAKER_1:  there you could say maybe positioning of the hand, the gripping.

01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:27,295
SPEAKER_1:  Is it the positioning of your body, the posture? Is there some interesting insights?

01:15:27,295 --> 01:15:34,270
SPEAKER_0:  It's a combination because first you have to put your body in a very strong position that you don't require your hands to.

01:15:34,626 --> 01:15:35,262
SPEAKER_0:  hold them out.

01:15:36,002 --> 01:15:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  So the choke is the test first because.

01:15:38,914 --> 01:15:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  I cannot use my hands on the floor to stop you escaping.

01:15:43,394 --> 01:15:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  So if I have to, my body has to handle that.

01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:50,846
SPEAKER_0:  The way I position myself, I have to do it in a way that don't require my hands.

01:15:51,618 --> 01:15:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  for balance.

01:15:52,418 --> 01:15:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

01:15:52,962 --> 01:15:54,750
SPEAKER_1:  Why is the model such a dominant position?

01:15:55,330 --> 01:15:58,705
SPEAKER_1:  doesn't make any sense, right? Like you're just sitting on top of the stomach of a person.

01:15:58,705 --> 01:16:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  It makes all sense. If you think what's... Forget fighting.

01:16:02,754 --> 01:16:03,390
SPEAKER_0:  Get your jitsu.

01:16:03,714 --> 01:16:04,798
SPEAKER_0:  like you've never trained.

01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  was the-

01:16:06,786 --> 01:16:09,630
SPEAKER_0:  one position, the most dominant position.

01:16:10,338 --> 01:16:11,838
SPEAKER_0:  you can get over another human being.

01:16:12,450 --> 01:16:12,798
SPEAKER_0:  one.

01:16:13,314 --> 01:16:14,142
SPEAKER_0:  the most.

01:16:14,690 --> 01:16:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  for you which one it is.

01:16:16,482 --> 01:16:19,390
SPEAKER_0:  like the most dominant position.

01:16:19,842 --> 01:16:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  that you can get over another human being.

01:16:22,754 --> 01:16:25,374
SPEAKER_1:  So if we were just, because the way I think about it is.

01:16:25,794 --> 01:16:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  putting myself in like a six, seven, eight year old self without knowing any martial arts.

01:16:30,946 --> 01:16:33,118
SPEAKER_1:  and I had an older brother who'd beat the shit out of me.

01:16:33,794 --> 01:16:35,870
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it probably was Mount.

01:16:36,802 --> 01:16:37,662
SPEAKER_1:  It was.

01:16:38,402 --> 01:16:38,846
SPEAKER_0:

01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:39,614
SPEAKER_1:  be

01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:45,758
SPEAKER_1:  Well, yes, okay, so we both didn't know, but if we knew something, it'd probably be back control.

01:16:46,434 --> 01:16:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  If in the back control you're under the other person, the thing being under is the most dominant position that can be over another person.

01:16:54,018 --> 01:16:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  You mean like a back control? If I'm on your back...

01:16:56,898 --> 01:16:59,870
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, like that. You can move, you can roll. I cannot stop you rolling.

01:17:00,770 --> 01:17:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe you can even stand up.

01:17:03,042 --> 01:17:04,030
SPEAKER_0:  How dominant is that?

01:17:04,482 --> 01:17:07,107
SPEAKER_1:  yet both were the same size, both untrained.

01:17:07,107 --> 01:17:09,357
SPEAKER_0:  If I know it doesn't matter. Do you have a scene?

01:17:09,357 --> 01:17:10,974
SPEAKER_1:  kids do they do that? Okay.

01:17:12,066 --> 01:17:12,606
SPEAKER_1:  Mount

01:17:13,218 --> 01:17:17,054
SPEAKER_1:  looks and feels like dominance when you're two eight year olds fighting.

01:17:17,826 --> 01:17:21,694
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, I don't know why it feels that way. Could be some animalistic thing.

01:17:21,986 --> 01:17:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe it is actual dominance. I don't know, but it feels like if you're untrained, you can just buck your way out of it.

01:17:27,746 --> 01:17:31,902
SPEAKER_1:  It feels unstable. It feels unstable to hold them out unless you know what you're doing.

01:17:32,162 --> 01:17:32,542
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  No? I'm out here with both of your hands on the floor.

01:17:36,418 --> 01:17:37,342
SPEAKER_0:  just your hands.

01:17:37,762 --> 01:17:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's easy to take somebody off.

01:17:40,290 --> 01:17:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, maybe not.

01:17:41,538 --> 01:17:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  to think it's easy to remove the hand and bring them out.

01:17:44,770 --> 01:17:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  The hands on the floor, arms straight, I'm leaning in.

01:17:48,034 --> 01:17:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, you're right.

01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:52,446
SPEAKER_0:  You don't need to know fighting to hold yourself back.

01:17:53,026 --> 01:17:53,342
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:58,174
SPEAKER_1:  But you're right, when you take the arms off and balancing, then it gets tricky.

01:17:58,914 --> 01:18:00,382
SPEAKER_1:  is when you're trying to, uh...

01:18:01,058 --> 01:18:02,174
SPEAKER_1:  I think what happens...

01:18:02,466 --> 01:18:03,678
SPEAKER_1:  I'm thinking back to eight year old.

01:18:04,610 --> 01:18:06,366
SPEAKER_1:  because my brother's five years older than me.

01:18:06,722 --> 01:18:11,198
SPEAKER_1:  and he would do the usual like, stop hitting yourself thing. I think he would be in mouth.

01:18:11,906 --> 01:18:13,342
SPEAKER_1:  like hitting me with my own hands.

01:18:14,018 --> 01:18:24,126
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, from, out of place of love, of course, um, I love them deeply and it was very formative and a positive experience for me. Okay. I think, yeah.

01:18:24,386 --> 01:18:26,174
SPEAKER_1:  The weakness is when he takes.

01:18:27,426 --> 01:18:29,502
SPEAKER_1:  when the person who has your mouth

01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:31,006
SPEAKER_1:  takes their arms off to...

01:18:31,554 --> 01:18:32,190
SPEAKER_1:  to do something.

01:18:32,354 --> 01:18:33,950
SPEAKER_0:  But even if you keep your hands up in the air.

01:18:34,434 --> 01:18:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  When I'm falling.

01:18:36,482 --> 01:18:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  Okay..

01:18:38,722 --> 01:18:40,446
SPEAKER_1:  I'm speaking about untrained people.

01:18:40,898 --> 01:18:42,110
SPEAKER_1:  I feel like they get greedy.

01:18:42,658 --> 01:18:43,774
SPEAKER_1:  They try to do stuff.

01:18:43,906 --> 01:18:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  The other day I watched my 9 year old daughter.

01:18:46,818 --> 01:18:48,030
SPEAKER_0:  We're in a friend's house.

01:18:48,898 --> 01:18:50,590
SPEAKER_0:  There's a whole bunch of kids there, they're playing.

01:18:51,266 --> 01:18:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  the one I looked.

01:18:53,186 --> 01:18:55,486
SPEAKER_0:  She's mounting a boy her age, her size.

01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  He cannot escape.

01:18:57,602 --> 01:18:59,134
SPEAKER_1:  Wow, she probably has seen.

01:18:59,490 --> 01:19:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  No, she trains. She's been training for, I'll say, a year and a half.

01:19:02,818 --> 01:19:05,726
SPEAKER_0:  She's not much. I mean, she's a nine-year-old daughter. Yeah, a girl.

01:19:06,082 --> 01:19:06,686
SPEAKER_0:  Over a boy.

01:19:06,882 --> 01:19:08,757
SPEAKER_1:  Has she seen footage of you? Maybe she picked-

01:19:08,757 --> 01:19:13,022
SPEAKER_0:  No, but she's been training for a year and a half, so she has an idea what mount is.

01:19:15,234 --> 01:19:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, in terms of our skills, I never taught her them out.

01:19:18,658 --> 01:19:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, she has.

01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  you know she had lessons that...

01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:23,262
SPEAKER_0:  the academy like any other.

01:19:24,002 --> 01:19:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  Did you make him cry or? No, but he couldn't escape.

01:19:27,522 --> 01:19:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  Which other position would she be able to hold the boy?

01:19:32,162 --> 01:19:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  in the back.

01:19:33,410 --> 01:19:34,398
SPEAKER_0:  he would roll it out.

01:19:35,106 --> 01:19:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  That's true.

01:19:35,906 --> 01:19:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  He couldn't.

01:19:37,026 --> 01:19:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  come out from underneath us, you see, they're kids.

01:19:39,938 --> 01:19:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  There is no other most dominant position that you can pin the other person.

01:19:43,682 --> 01:19:44,542
SPEAKER_1:  Couldn't you argue?

01:19:45,186 --> 01:19:46,750
SPEAKER_1:  from that perspective of site control.

01:19:47,138 --> 01:19:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  No.

01:19:48,546 --> 01:19:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  because I can show you have to hold the other person.

01:19:51,874 --> 01:19:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:19:52,514 --> 01:19:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  It's you're not free. You cannot.

01:19:55,394 --> 01:19:56,126
SPEAKER_0:  released him.

01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:59,998
SPEAKER_1:  but inside control your hips are not on top of theirs.

01:20:00,834 --> 01:20:01,438
SPEAKER_1:  So...

01:20:02,658 --> 01:20:04,222
SPEAKER_1:  They can't buck you off.

01:20:04,642 --> 01:20:04,958
SPEAKER_1:  Right?

01:20:05,826 --> 01:20:09,758
SPEAKER_1:  If you're holding them a little bit and you can hit them with one hand.

01:20:09,986 --> 01:20:11,486
SPEAKER_0:  He's had these here.

01:20:12,226 --> 01:20:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  You gonna?

01:20:13,218 --> 01:20:13,758
SPEAKER_0:  I'm here.

01:20:14,594 --> 01:20:17,310
SPEAKER_0:  but the time you're doing that, but then he has his arms free.

01:20:17,634 --> 01:20:19,230
SPEAKER_0:  And if you turn towards your legs.

01:20:20,034 --> 01:20:21,438
SPEAKER_0:  and he's away from your arms.

01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  He not even has the...

01:20:23,106 --> 01:20:26,814
SPEAKER_0:  perfect angle. I mean it is a good position. You can hit, you can dominate.

01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  but it's not the...

01:20:29,026 --> 01:20:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  best position.

01:20:31,042 --> 01:20:33,630
SPEAKER_0:  be over the other person. He can knee you in the head.

01:20:34,658 --> 01:20:36,990
SPEAKER_0:  At the same time you punch him, then there's a knee coming to your head.

01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:42,078
SPEAKER_1:  I love playing devil's advocate with Hodger Gracie about two eight year olds fighting.

01:20:42,402 --> 01:20:47,678
SPEAKER_0:  And your head is closer to his head? Yeah. Maybe he can give you a punch?

01:20:48,066 --> 01:20:50,782
SPEAKER_0:  All right. So would you choose to be in side control of a mat?

01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  Getting in the head.

01:20:53,186 --> 01:20:57,374
SPEAKER_1:  Well, for a person who in competition prefers neon belly over mouth.

01:20:58,274 --> 01:21:01,086
SPEAKER_1:  But that's my weakness, that's my failure as a human being.

01:21:01,314 --> 01:21:03,774
SPEAKER_1:  Holding a mouth can be tricky.

01:21:04,002 --> 01:21:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  It's very hard.

01:21:05,346 --> 01:21:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  Of course it's hard.

01:21:07,458 --> 01:21:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  But what is easy?

01:21:08,834 --> 01:21:11,038
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, control and neon bell is easier.

01:21:11,202 --> 01:21:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  but to submit. Well, it's easy.

01:21:14,114 --> 01:21:19,454
SPEAKER_1:  Easier. I'm not saying black belt level. I'm saying, well, maybe even black belt. Easy for what?

01:21:19,906 --> 01:21:20,670
SPEAKER_1:  to hold somebody.

01:21:21,890 --> 01:21:23,486
SPEAKER_1:  to make them squirm and hurt.

01:21:24,290 --> 01:21:26,695
SPEAKER_1:  to create openings.

01:21:26,695 --> 01:21:27,358
SPEAKER_0:  the big guy.

01:21:27,874 --> 01:21:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, you can.

01:21:28,770 --> 01:21:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  You can't.

01:21:30,946 --> 01:21:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  he's gonna

01:21:31,842 --> 01:21:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  Push your back and come up.

01:21:33,346 --> 01:21:34,654
SPEAKER_0:  In the mouth he can't see it up.

01:21:35,362 --> 01:21:36,254
SPEAKER_0:  Not when you mounted him.

01:21:36,834 --> 01:21:40,286
SPEAKER_1:  The thing is also about mount is people on the bottom of mount panic more.

01:21:41,282 --> 01:21:42,407
SPEAKER_1:  so they fight for

01:21:42,407 --> 01:21:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  They panic. They're exposed.

01:21:45,826 --> 01:21:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  is the most x

01:21:47,234 --> 01:21:48,254
SPEAKER_0:  you have.

01:21:48,898 --> 01:21:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  Because...

01:21:49,698 --> 01:21:51,358
SPEAKER_0:  The post arms are free, you cannot...

01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  Touch em.

01:21:52,610 --> 01:21:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  His head is too high.

01:21:54,114 --> 01:21:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  There's nothing he can do, his legs won't...

01:21:56,962 --> 01:21:59,966
SPEAKER_0:  get you anywhere, he might touch your lower back. It's like nothing.

01:22:00,706 --> 01:22:02,942
SPEAKER_0:  You're most exposed.

01:22:03,234 --> 01:22:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  been in the mouth.

01:22:05,378 --> 01:22:11,006
SPEAKER_0:  Already you hold me side control a thousand times the amount of me having to look up for your face coming down

01:22:11,842 --> 01:22:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. Psycho control, I hug you, you cannot hurt me.

01:22:17,026 --> 01:22:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, hold me, but I'm hugging you. If I hug you tight.

01:22:20,834 --> 01:22:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  What can you do against me?

01:22:22,114 --> 01:22:22,462
SPEAKER_1:  What?

01:22:22,946 --> 01:22:25,374
SPEAKER_1:  It seems maybe it's just from.

01:22:25,794 --> 01:22:29,310
SPEAKER_1:  And again, I'm arguing just for the fun of it, but.

01:22:30,402 --> 01:22:32,830
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like a more difficult...

01:22:33,538 --> 01:22:34,590
SPEAKER_1:  skill to learn.

01:22:35,554 --> 01:22:38,174
SPEAKER_1:  apply a huge amount of pressure and weight.

01:22:38,466 --> 01:22:38,974
SPEAKER_1:  from now.

01:22:39,298 --> 01:22:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  You don't have to apply pressure and wait for a month.

01:22:41,794 --> 01:22:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  not apply pressure but

01:22:43,682 --> 01:22:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  Be heavy.

01:22:45,026 --> 01:22:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  You don't necessarily need to be heavy. You don't.

01:22:49,378 --> 01:22:51,966
SPEAKER_1:  Why do you, as people say...

01:22:52,194 --> 01:22:53,319
SPEAKER_1:  You feel extremely heavy.

01:22:53,319 --> 01:22:56,030
SPEAKER_0:  If I'm being heavy, I cannot attack.

01:22:57,282 --> 01:22:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  I guess.

01:22:58,242 --> 01:22:59,326
SPEAKER_0:  I have to choose.

01:22:59,874 --> 01:23:00,990
SPEAKER_0:  I can be heavy.

01:23:01,378 --> 01:23:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  Cheers to...

01:23:02,562 --> 01:23:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  and I like, you know, just...

01:23:04,834 --> 01:23:08,254
SPEAKER_0:  pin them, take the energy out to make them suffer.

01:23:08,514 --> 01:23:10,238
SPEAKER_0:  But the moment that I decide to attack.

01:23:10,786 --> 01:23:12,926
SPEAKER_0:  I can only be heavy if I'm sitting up straight.

01:23:13,602 --> 01:23:14,238
SPEAKER_0:  That's when my

01:23:14,530 --> 01:23:16,670
SPEAKER_0:  or my weight can drop down if I'm high.

01:23:17,186 --> 01:23:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  then I'm sitting on your chest and on your solar plexus.

01:23:20,834 --> 01:23:24,062
SPEAKER_0:  the worst position to be seated on the person, because that's where he breathes.

01:23:24,674 --> 01:23:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  So you're in a high mount.

01:23:26,594 --> 01:23:27,550
SPEAKER_0:  sitting up straight.

01:23:28,034 --> 01:23:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  That's when you can, I can be very heavy. I can make people, you know, feel my weight, and you know, be very uncomfortable, but I'm not in a position to attack. The moment that I want to attack, my body has to lean forward.

01:23:38,626 --> 01:23:39,518
SPEAKER_0:  I have to approach.

01:23:39,938 --> 01:23:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  the neck or the arms, the moment that I do that.

01:23:43,042 --> 01:23:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  My weight comes off my hips.

01:23:45,058 --> 01:23:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  It goes to my knees the way it is off you.

01:23:47,906 --> 01:23:49,502
SPEAKER_1:  But at that point, if you have.

01:23:49,602 --> 01:23:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  Now I'm attacking, I'm no longer.

01:23:51,490 --> 01:23:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  Heavy on you.

01:23:52,674 --> 01:23:58,299
SPEAKER_1:  but you want to be at that point to remove any of the defenses they have or some of the defenses by getting their help.

01:23:58,299 --> 01:23:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  No, I'm like, you do.

01:23:59,906 --> 01:24:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  trying to get your collar or bringing your elbow across to takti amla.

01:24:03,778 --> 01:24:07,518
SPEAKER_1:  So what are some interesting details along the way that are tough to get to figure out?

01:24:08,418 --> 01:24:10,014
SPEAKER_1:  What were the big leaps for you?

01:24:10,530 --> 01:24:11,262
SPEAKER_1:  from Waybuilt.

01:24:12,098 --> 01:24:12,414
SPEAKER_1:  too.

01:24:12,674 --> 01:24:14,142
SPEAKER_1:  to the best in the world.

01:24:14,274 --> 01:24:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  It's you trying to attack the neck, you know, putting one hand in the collar. You're priving yourself that hand to place it on the floor.

01:24:21,346 --> 01:24:25,694
SPEAKER_0:  So now you're vulnerable to get bridged, to get rolled over. Because if your hands are free trying to roll you over.

01:24:26,018 --> 01:24:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  You start.

01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:29,278
SPEAKER_0:  the moment they put your hand in the person's collar.

01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  Now you have to be...

01:24:31,202 --> 01:24:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  very careful with your body positioning.

01:24:33,218 --> 01:24:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  very careful. The distribution of the weight. Yeah and how.

01:24:36,514 --> 01:24:40,606
SPEAKER_0:  You know, how high you sit, you know, how tall your upper body goes.

01:24:41,282 --> 01:24:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:24:42,178 --> 01:24:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  Then the biggest challenge comes as you try the second hand. You know, for the choke.

01:24:47,618 --> 01:24:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  That's the biggest challenge, the second hand.

01:24:50,242 --> 01:24:51,358
SPEAKER_0:  because you already have.

01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:53,598
SPEAKER_0:  You already don't have one hand.

01:24:54,146 --> 01:24:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  Now you are trying.

01:24:56,322 --> 01:24:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  the second hand and.

01:24:58,914 --> 01:25:04,286
SPEAKER_0:  If one of my hand is in, you as a defending yourself have two hands.

01:25:05,282 --> 01:25:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  One hand is already on one side.

01:25:07,458 --> 01:25:09,118
SPEAKER_0:  This decides to get an attack.

01:25:09,538 --> 01:25:11,166
SPEAKER_0:  You have two hands blocking that.

01:25:11,682 --> 01:25:12,446
SPEAKER_0:  I have one hand.

01:25:12,962 --> 01:25:14,270
SPEAKER_0:  There's no help for that hand.

01:25:14,914 --> 01:25:16,510
SPEAKER_0:  I cannot remove anything.

01:25:16,962 --> 01:25:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  That's the biggest challenge getting.

01:25:18,722 --> 01:25:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  One hand getting.

01:25:20,002 --> 01:25:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  has to.

01:25:21,314 --> 01:25:22,718
SPEAKER_0:  and not getting.

01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:23,742
SPEAKER_1:  Roll over.

01:25:24,130 --> 01:25:25,950
SPEAKER_1:  but I also have two hands.

01:25:26,562 --> 01:25:28,958
SPEAKER_1:  On bottom I have two hands and can also turn and.

01:25:29,506 --> 01:25:30,846
SPEAKER_1:  and do all kinds of stuff.

01:25:31,682 --> 01:25:35,070
SPEAKER_1:  and my whole mind and everything is focused on that secondhand.

01:25:35,842 --> 01:25:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  It's a big challenge. It's hard.

01:25:37,634 --> 01:25:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  Very hard.

01:25:38,658 --> 01:25:42,398
SPEAKER_1:  Is there an art to getting the first hand into a place where you

01:25:43,074 --> 01:25:44,199
SPEAKER_1:  It's less of...

01:25:44,199 --> 01:25:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  art because it's easier. I'll say most times I get my first hand in.

01:25:49,218 --> 01:25:52,798
SPEAKER_0:  is when you're trying some move. You're trying to escape, you're pushing.

01:25:53,730 --> 01:25:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  I get the first-hand.

01:25:55,202 --> 01:25:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  as an opportunity.

01:25:56,738 --> 01:25:58,366
SPEAKER_1:  And it's going to sit there for a while.

01:25:59,266 --> 01:26:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  And I go as deep as I can. So the first hand.

01:26:02,722 --> 01:26:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  because the second hand is the hardest.

01:26:04,930 --> 01:26:08,062
SPEAKER_0:  I have to compensate the first thing to be as deep as I can.

01:26:08,674 --> 01:26:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  if I cannot get the first ending.

01:26:10,754 --> 01:26:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  Deep.

01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:12,478
SPEAKER_0:  I won't try the second.

01:26:13,410 --> 01:26:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  I need that first hand dip

01:26:15,106 --> 01:26:16,231
SPEAKER_0:  Then I go for this.

01:26:16,231 --> 01:26:18,599
SPEAKER_1:  and everything is like super like tight.

01:26:18,599 --> 01:26:19,294
SPEAKER_0:  super tight

01:26:19,778 --> 01:26:22,302
SPEAKER_0:  The first end has to be super tight, otherwise...

01:26:22,690 --> 01:26:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  the chance of failing is very big.

01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:27,971
SPEAKER_1:  Does the opponent usually feel like they're screwed at that point?

01:26:27,971 --> 01:26:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  also, not as you put in the first hand in.

01:26:30,754 --> 01:26:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  the moment that I...

01:26:32,162 --> 01:26:35,902
SPEAKER_0:  position myself just prior to attempt the second hand.

01:26:36,514 --> 01:26:43,582
SPEAKER_0:  the way my body is positioned, the way I'm collapsing with my weight and they feel this like it's, you know.

01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  This is terrible.

01:26:45,538 --> 01:26:49,534
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah how long did it take you to figure out how to reposition your weight once the first hand is in?

01:26:50,658 --> 01:26:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  Very quickly.

01:26:52,034 --> 01:26:53,150
SPEAKER_0:  or get breached out.

01:26:53,890 --> 01:26:55,765
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so that there's a good feedback.

01:26:55,765 --> 01:26:56,702
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, because...

01:26:57,410 --> 01:26:58,206
SPEAKER_0:  One mistake you out.

01:26:59,554 --> 01:27:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  One.

01:27:00,546 --> 01:27:00,926
SPEAKER_0:  off.

01:27:01,218 --> 01:27:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  positioning you out.

01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:10,430
SPEAKER_1:  but you still have to do that against the best people in the world. Where's the way out for most people? Like if you were in Mount against Prashashah.

01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:12,542
SPEAKER_1:  or some of the best defenses in the world.

01:27:12,706 --> 01:27:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  I do.

01:27:14,882 --> 01:27:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  way out is to obviously defend themselves and prevent the first hand to get deep.

01:27:21,986 --> 01:27:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:27:23,202 --> 01:27:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  I'll say the best.

01:27:25,442 --> 01:27:27,902
SPEAKER_0:  The first thing that they could do is try to

01:27:28,706 --> 01:27:30,750
SPEAKER_0:  change my positioning on the mount.

01:27:31,490 --> 01:27:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  in a way that pushed me to a very low amount.

01:27:34,274 --> 01:27:40,126
SPEAKER_0:  You know, try to change the way I'm dominating you, not to be, you know, get me off the high month.

01:27:40,386 --> 01:27:40,894
SPEAKER_0:  Thank you very much.

01:27:41,122 --> 01:27:45,630
SPEAKER_1:  Are you always, is it a slow, is it a fast thing to go from low to fast?

01:27:45,922 --> 01:27:46,558
SPEAKER_1:  Our Chime 0

01:27:46,690 --> 01:27:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  Slow, very slow.

01:27:47,746 --> 01:27:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  because I need to beat your arms.

01:27:49,282 --> 01:27:50,407
SPEAKER_0:  because you're holding me down.

01:27:50,407 --> 01:27:53,374
SPEAKER_1:  and the arms need to come out, it's a slope.

01:27:54,722 --> 01:27:55,230
SPEAKER_1:  And you just.

01:27:55,522 --> 01:27:56,382
SPEAKER_1:  Is there like a...

01:27:56,770 --> 01:28:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, so I use my legs against your arms.

01:28:01,378 --> 01:28:03,006
SPEAKER_0:  So it's my legs pushing your arms.

01:28:03,618 --> 01:28:06,759
SPEAKER_1:  But how do you get them? How do you get your legs into the elbows?

01:28:06,759 --> 01:28:07,838
SPEAKER_0:  as long as it's...

01:28:08,674 --> 01:28:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  You know, you have to come under the tip of your elbow because now the legs will start forcing your arms up.

01:28:14,146 --> 01:28:16,798
SPEAKER_1:  So your legs aren't like spread out there. No, they're in.

01:28:16,930 --> 01:28:18,814
SPEAKER_0:  your elbow cannot get inside my leg.

01:28:19,490 --> 01:28:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  because it's odd.

01:28:20,802 --> 01:28:22,718
SPEAKER_0:  because that means I'm in a very low amount.

01:28:23,842 --> 01:28:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  and then I cannot attack.

01:28:25,346 --> 01:28:26,334
SPEAKER_0:  because I cannot ignore that.

01:28:26,850 --> 01:28:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  the demand that I attack that wolf.

01:28:29,506 --> 01:28:30,974
SPEAKER_0:  You will stop pushing my leg to push me out.

01:28:32,290 --> 01:28:34,238
SPEAKER_1:  What's the secret to getting the secondhand in?

01:28:36,258 --> 01:28:41,662
SPEAKER_0:  There's two ways, you go four fingers inside, which is the hardest because with the moment that you two hands are defending.

01:28:42,786 --> 01:28:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  you'll be blocking the, you know.

01:28:45,506 --> 01:28:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  The way.

01:28:46,658 --> 01:28:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  and I cannot clear and attack two hands against one.

01:28:50,882 --> 01:28:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  So I go thumb in.

01:28:53,026 --> 01:28:54,462
SPEAKER_0:  I go behind the ear.

01:28:55,010 --> 01:28:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  So my grip goes because for you to defend...

01:28:58,562 --> 01:28:59,934
SPEAKER_0:  You need to get there.

01:29:00,738 --> 01:29:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  And when you get there, you elevate your airways, suppose the armlock.

01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:06,631
SPEAKER_0:  So it's hot.

01:29:06,631 --> 01:29:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  He's put the thumb in.

01:29:08,290 --> 01:29:10,142
SPEAKER_1:  And then there's the dreaded...

01:29:10,914 --> 01:29:13,150
SPEAKER_1:  Like the other person just waits for you to loop.

01:29:15,778 --> 01:29:16,574
SPEAKER_1:  about that.

01:29:16,962 --> 01:29:17,598
SPEAKER_0:  this off.

01:29:18,210 --> 01:29:20,126
SPEAKER_1:  It's a, once you get the thumb in, it's over.

01:29:21,410 --> 01:29:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, not.

01:29:22,306 --> 01:29:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  But when I'm there...

01:29:24,066 --> 01:29:27,358
SPEAKER_0:  If I get that, because they are bridging, you know, and that's what they try.

01:29:27,778 --> 01:29:29,406
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not using their hand to post.

01:29:30,082 --> 01:29:30,910
SPEAKER_0:  Now your head is...

01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  My head is very close to the floor when I've tried to bridge and you know, my forehead would touch the floor that would be used as a hand. It's not on the floor.

01:29:37,986 --> 01:29:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  Not necessary.

01:29:40,002 --> 01:29:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  Because if it's on the floor, my body collapse over you. So there's no place for my hand, for me to work on your neck. So I need some space between us.

01:29:48,898 --> 01:29:50,023
SPEAKER_0:  So I don't completely want to...

01:29:50,023 --> 01:29:52,273
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe it can bob up and down. Yeah. I don't know. Look at that button.

01:29:52,273 --> 01:29:53,982
SPEAKER_0:  I try to keep a gap between us.

01:29:56,194 --> 01:29:59,198
SPEAKER_1:  So that pursuit that takes many, many, many, many years.

01:29:59,970 --> 01:30:01,822
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if you've seen Jiro Dreams of Sushi.

01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:03,070
SPEAKER_1:  the

01:30:04,834 --> 01:30:06,206
SPEAKER_1:  doing the simple thing.

01:30:07,106 --> 01:30:09,246
SPEAKER_1:  That's not so simple, but it kind of looks simple.

01:30:09,698 --> 01:30:13,790
SPEAKER_1:  of the over and over and over and over and over and presumably getting much better.

01:30:14,306 --> 01:30:18,590
SPEAKER_1:  It becomes very simple, but you're picking up details probably along the way. There's wisdom along the way.

01:30:19,362 --> 01:30:20,862
SPEAKER_1:  What is that? Is that, uh...

01:30:23,426 --> 01:30:26,622
SPEAKER_1:  There's like lessons that you just kind of accumulate over time.

01:30:27,106 --> 01:30:29,342
SPEAKER_1:  like one training sessions you'll see.

01:30:30,370 --> 01:30:31,550
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe, uh...

01:30:32,866 --> 01:30:34,238
SPEAKER_1:  like the positioning.

01:30:35,586 --> 01:30:38,142
SPEAKER_1:  of the thumb like this detailed positioning of the thumb.

01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:39,166
SPEAKER_1:  or something like this.

01:30:39,522 --> 01:30:40,542
SPEAKER_1:  And then you're like, okay.

01:30:41,186 --> 01:30:42,174
SPEAKER_1:  You like load that in.

01:30:43,170 --> 01:30:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  They'll be very basic because there is not that many different ways.

01:30:46,978 --> 01:30:47,678
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe one.

01:30:48,770 --> 01:30:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  I just do one.

01:30:50,082 --> 01:30:51,294
SPEAKER_0:  Any other is not as strong.

01:30:51,554 --> 01:30:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  because it's

01:30:52,738 --> 01:30:53,214
SPEAKER_0:  is a boat.

01:30:53,602 --> 01:30:55,294
SPEAKER_0:  getting a strong grip on your collar.

01:30:55,842 --> 01:30:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, this son of a...

01:30:56,994 --> 01:30:57,374
SPEAKER_0:  It's.

01:30:57,794 --> 01:31:02,398
SPEAKER_0:  the thumb goes inside, is it the thumb in or four fingers in? 어�ыш ARE YOU?

01:31:02,722 --> 01:31:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  getting a strong grip on the call.

01:31:04,642 --> 01:31:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  as long as they know this.

01:31:06,914 --> 01:31:08,894
SPEAKER_0:  is just holding and feeling strong.

01:31:09,410 --> 01:31:13,502
SPEAKER_1:  So that's just two options. So it's the dynamic stuff along the way. Yeah.

01:31:14,178 --> 01:31:15,646
SPEAKER_1:  and then some less timing too.

01:31:16,162 --> 01:31:16,574
SPEAKER_1:  timing.

01:31:17,026 --> 01:31:18,078
SPEAKER_1:  Are you also like...

01:31:18,594 --> 01:31:20,126
SPEAKER_1:  making people like faking them out.

01:31:20,418 --> 01:31:21,543
SPEAKER_1:  make him think about something else.

01:31:21,543 --> 01:31:22,718
SPEAKER_0:  No, not at that point.

01:31:23,810 --> 01:31:25,086
SPEAKER_0:  That's not because.

01:31:25,506 --> 01:31:27,230
SPEAKER_0:  I cannot fake anything else at that point.

01:31:28,290 --> 01:31:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  because I would have to change my positioning to fake an armlock.

01:31:32,898 --> 01:31:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  then I have to move out from that.

01:31:35,234 --> 01:31:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  So then I will lose the control I have.

01:31:37,634 --> 01:31:42,814
SPEAKER_1:  So what's the process towards mastery? If you were to convert that to something that generalizes beyond jiu-jitsu.

01:31:43,650 --> 01:31:44,414
SPEAKER_1:  How can you get?

01:31:45,346 --> 01:31:47,006
SPEAKER_1:  that good at a simple thing.

01:31:47,618 --> 01:31:48,094
SPEAKER_1:  practice.

01:31:49,122 --> 01:31:49,534
SPEAKER_1:  It would.

01:31:49,858 --> 01:31:51,934
SPEAKER_1:  That simple. The same exact thing.

01:31:52,450 --> 01:31:53,150
SPEAKER_1:  over and over.

01:31:53,410 --> 01:31:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  It's just a matter of how long it will take.

01:31:56,802 --> 01:31:58,142
SPEAKER_1:  So all... Hehehehehe!

01:31:59,010 --> 01:31:59,646
SPEAKER_1:  That's true.

01:31:59,970 --> 01:32:00,542
SPEAKER_1:  That's true.

01:32:00,642 --> 01:32:03,102
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, like I said, look how long it took me.

01:32:03,874 --> 01:32:05,022
SPEAKER_0:  People give up along the way.

01:32:06,530 --> 01:32:07,422
SPEAKER_1:  There is a...

01:32:07,970 --> 01:32:09,694
SPEAKER_1:  intricacies to that journey.

01:32:10,210 --> 01:32:11,326
SPEAKER_1:  towards perfection.

01:32:11,586 --> 01:32:13,502
SPEAKER_1:  There's a lot of people that do jiu-jitsu.

01:32:13,890 --> 01:32:15,006
SPEAKER_1:  for decades.

01:32:15,938 --> 01:32:16,830
SPEAKER_1:  and don't get better.

01:32:17,506 --> 01:32:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  No, because they don't train the way they should. They don't train to get better, they train to get tough.

01:32:22,210 --> 01:32:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  There's a big difference.

01:32:23,874 --> 01:32:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  Most people, they're trying to get tough, so they are tough.

01:32:26,978 --> 01:32:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  you know, like we were talking before.

01:32:28,898 --> 01:32:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  They don't practice the weakness.

01:32:30,530 --> 01:32:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  You want to be good at, you want to be really good.

01:32:33,186 --> 01:32:33,950
SPEAKER_0:  Adjujitsu.

01:32:35,202 --> 01:32:38,014
SPEAKER_0:  You have to practice your weakness, not your strength.

01:32:38,978 --> 01:32:43,966
SPEAKER_0:  You have to practice everything, but you have to be equally strong in every position. The old is like the same.

01:32:44,610 --> 01:32:45,022
SPEAKER_0:  You know, you...

01:32:45,314 --> 01:32:47,966
SPEAKER_0:  Your guard top bottom, side control top bottom.

01:32:48,514 --> 01:32:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  Turtle, half guard, mount, back.

01:32:51,522 --> 01:32:52,414
SPEAKER_0:  I mean you pick.

01:32:52,866 --> 01:32:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  Take down.

01:32:54,498 --> 01:32:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  And then you get into details of...

01:32:57,954 --> 01:32:59,102
SPEAKER_0:  Scapin Triangle.

01:33:00,034 --> 01:33:03,166
SPEAKER_0:  applying the triangles, keeping armlock.

01:33:03,490 --> 01:33:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  defense.

01:33:04,866 --> 01:33:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  Scenarios off.

01:33:06,210 --> 01:33:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it's the one thing is defending the arm lock when you have your arms.

01:33:10,690 --> 01:33:13,822
SPEAKER_0:  very close to your body. The other thing is to defend the arms when your arm is...

01:33:14,178 --> 01:33:15,454
SPEAKER_0:  in almost getting.

01:33:15,810 --> 01:33:18,142
SPEAKER_0:  and then when he got your arm. So this.

01:33:19,138 --> 01:33:20,958
SPEAKER_0:  So many things to practice.

01:33:21,634 --> 01:33:27,262
SPEAKER_0:  that you need to repeat them over and over again until you're confident enough that when you get there you have a chance.

01:33:27,426 --> 01:33:29,246
SPEAKER_1:  And you can do the same kind of thing for

01:33:29,794 --> 01:33:32,510
SPEAKER_1:  even the final stages of a cross-choke from mom. Weatchetolin ON

01:33:32,994 --> 01:33:33,886

SPEAKER_0:  Practice.

01:33:36,866 --> 01:33:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  escaping the armlock with a full arm straight.

01:33:39,618 --> 01:33:40,542
SPEAKER_0:  because you know it's...

01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  That's gone.

01:33:42,722 --> 01:33:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, you practice.

01:33:44,898 --> 01:33:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  You know you practice keeping the arm lock when he takes your arm.

01:33:48,482 --> 01:33:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  you have a chance of trying to skate but you don't practice.

01:33:52,642 --> 01:33:53,726
SPEAKER_0:  and okay, take my arm.

01:33:54,114 --> 01:33:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  When I say go, go, I mean you got to hip hop the arm.

SPEAKER_0:  That is why you get injured doing that.

01:34:00,034 --> 01:34:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  escaping the cross-coller choke.

01:34:02,434 --> 01:34:03,006
SPEAKER_0:  It's.

01:34:04,002 --> 01:34:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, escape not letting the person get there.

01:34:06,786 --> 01:34:10,430
SPEAKER_0:  You can practice scaping triangles because it's like...

01:34:11,010 --> 01:34:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  It's you have a.

01:34:12,290 --> 01:34:14,686
SPEAKER_0:  way better chance of escaping triumph at the end.

01:34:15,042 --> 01:34:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, mount on me, put both hands in my neck.

01:34:17,986 --> 01:34:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's over.

01:34:20,130 --> 01:34:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  You know, don't be there.

01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:23,358
SPEAKER_1:  What's the best submission in Jujitsu?

01:34:23,586 --> 01:34:24,222
SPEAKER_1:  choke.

01:34:24,386 --> 01:34:24,862
SPEAKER_0:  I would say.

01:34:25,314 --> 01:34:26,302
SPEAKER_1:  from which position.

01:34:27,618 --> 01:34:27,998
SPEAKER_1:  out.

01:34:29,474 --> 01:34:32,094
SPEAKER_1:  If I give you a billion dollars.

01:34:33,090 --> 01:34:34,366

01:34:56,066 --> 01:35:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  I don't care. I have a better escape. I have a better chance of escaping from the back than if you mount on me and put my hands on my neck.

01:35:02,082 --> 01:35:03,207
SPEAKER_0:  So I've been that.

01:35:03,207 --> 01:35:04,606

01:35:11,266 --> 01:35:12,510
SPEAKER_0:  a thousand times over.

01:35:13,154 --> 01:35:15,029
SPEAKER_0:  Like, no comparison.

01:35:15,029 --> 01:35:17,279
SPEAKER_1:  Like with hooks, with like a triangle.

01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  matter.

01:35:18,018 --> 01:35:20,606
SPEAKER_0:  You can do whatever you want. Like a body trying? OK.

01:35:22,754 --> 01:35:24,629
SPEAKER_0:  like a thousand times over.

01:35:24,629 --> 01:35:27,870
SPEAKER_1:  So to you the mount is a super controlling position. It's not just.

01:35:29,218 --> 01:35:29,726
SPEAKER_0:  because...

01:35:30,626 --> 01:35:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  cross-collar choke in the mount the moment they put both hands on my neck you know you have to

01:35:34,626 --> 01:35:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  your arms need to be very close to your body to attack. So that means...

01:35:38,178 --> 01:35:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  Thanks.

01:35:38,978 --> 01:35:40,798
SPEAKER_0:  very little space between us.

01:35:41,474 --> 01:35:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  So that means...

01:35:42,754 --> 01:35:44,062
SPEAKER_0:  There's very little scape.

01:35:44,642 --> 01:35:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  space for you to work on your scape. And the moment that you cannot bridge.

01:35:49,442 --> 01:35:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  Let's suppose I have.

01:35:50,626 --> 01:35:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  The person has a good mouth so you cannot bridge him off.

01:35:53,474 --> 01:35:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  What else? You don't have space.

01:35:55,746 --> 01:35:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  to try to work on your defense.

01:35:58,082 --> 01:35:58,974
SPEAKER_0:  being in the back.

01:35:59,522 --> 01:36:03,390
SPEAKER_0:  I have all the space around me to work on my defense, on my arms.

01:36:03,938 --> 01:36:05,598
SPEAKER_0:  I have the mobility to bring them anywhere.

01:36:06,498 --> 01:36:08,670
SPEAKER_0:  So I, because of that.

01:36:09,474 --> 01:36:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  He gives you and me a much better chance.

01:36:12,514 --> 01:36:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  See you then.

01:36:13,858 --> 01:36:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  you cannot, I can move my body.

01:36:16,482 --> 01:36:18,110
SPEAKER_0:  You feel my back?

01:36:18,498 --> 01:36:19,966
SPEAKER_0:  You cannot pin me.

01:36:20,866 --> 01:36:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  Yuma, I cannot take you off my back. First I need to.

01:36:23,874 --> 01:36:25,086
SPEAKER_0:  Defend the choke.

01:36:25,506 --> 01:36:27,262
SPEAKER_0:  but you have no control over my body.

01:36:27,682 --> 01:36:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  So that means there's still a lot of movement that I can try to.

01:36:31,938 --> 01:36:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  used to scape. In the mount there's no movement. I'm pinned down, I cannot move.

01:36:36,866 --> 01:36:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  and I have no space between us.

01:36:38,786 --> 01:36:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  to escape.

01:36:40,450 --> 01:36:42,302
SPEAKER_1:  The argument against that, this is great.

01:36:42,754 --> 01:36:43,614
SPEAKER_1:  is that...

01:36:44,002 --> 01:36:45,086
SPEAKER_1:  and the bottom of mount.

01:36:45,698 --> 01:36:48,286
SPEAKER_1:  The, uh, I do have my hands between.

01:36:49,154 --> 01:36:51,294
SPEAKER_1:  So you're saying they're pinned, there's nothing? Between where?

01:36:51,586 --> 01:36:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, you could get them in theory. You could somehow.

01:36:55,138 --> 01:36:55,518
SPEAKER_1:  You could.

01:36:56,162 --> 01:37:00,287
SPEAKER_0:  But there's no, you can, but then there's no space. There'll be squeeze between our-

01:37:00,287 --> 01:37:02,910
SPEAKER_1:  If it's an incredible, if it's an incredible mouth.

01:37:03,202 --> 01:37:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  No, it does not mount.

01:37:05,634 --> 01:37:06,270
SPEAKER_0:  Standing.

01:37:06,690 --> 01:37:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  If I put both hands on your neck, I'm going to go for the cross collar choke.

01:37:10,530 --> 01:37:11,774
SPEAKER_0:  after I got my hands in.

01:37:12,034 --> 01:37:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  The next step is to pull you close to me.

01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:16,245
SPEAKER_0:  So it's this, my arms used to be closed.

01:37:16,245 --> 01:37:16,766
SPEAKER_1:  But I can.

01:37:17,666 --> 01:37:19,934
SPEAKER_1:  There's a hands that could do something.

01:37:20,034 --> 01:37:21,246
SPEAKER_0:  They can come in.

01:37:21,474 --> 01:37:24,099
SPEAKER_0:  but they are very limited space between.

01:37:24,099 --> 01:37:27,099
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, yes. No, I mean to push your body away to decrease the...

01:37:27,099 --> 01:37:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  standing not if your back is against the floor.

01:37:29,826 --> 01:37:30,974
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, the argument.

01:37:31,586 --> 01:37:32,382
SPEAKER_1:  against the mount.

01:37:32,610 --> 01:37:34,270
SPEAKER_1:  is or the argument.

01:37:34,498 --> 01:37:36,926
SPEAKER_1:  for back controls being the most dominant position.

01:37:37,154 --> 01:37:40,158
SPEAKER_1:  is even though I have hands, I can't really use them effectively.

01:37:40,962 --> 01:37:42,238
SPEAKER_0:  as effect 9 demand.

01:37:43,042 --> 01:37:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  There's no space. There's no space.

01:37:45,826 --> 01:37:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  You can try.

01:37:47,266 --> 01:37:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  I mean you can squeeze your hand in, I mean there's still things that you could do.

01:37:51,714 --> 01:37:53,589
SPEAKER_0:  but they're so limited. So if you-

01:37:53,589 --> 01:37:54,366
SPEAKER_1:  You polled.

01:37:55,778 --> 01:37:56,222
SPEAKER_1:  The

01:37:56,802 --> 01:37:58,558
SPEAKER_1:  100 best competitors of all time.

01:37:58,914 --> 01:38:00,318
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think they would answer to that?

01:38:00,738 --> 01:38:02,430
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think most would agree with you?

01:38:05,218 --> 01:38:05,822
SPEAKER_0:  I don't care.

01:38:07,490 --> 01:38:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  this.

01:38:08,962 --> 01:38:10,174
SPEAKER_0:  You will show me.

01:38:11,426 --> 01:38:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  the skills.

01:38:12,482 --> 01:38:13,566
SPEAKER_0:  the ability to see.

01:38:13,730 --> 01:38:17,109
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so the perfect mount versus the perfect back control.

01:38:17,109 --> 01:38:19,454
SPEAKER_0:  question. Okay there's no question. For me.

01:38:20,386 --> 01:38:25,214
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, argue with me, like, show me. Because I'm not being stubborn, because I'm being...

01:38:25,858 --> 01:38:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  I mean... Museum of Science! Scientific! Did you say? I mean.

01:38:28,418 --> 01:38:31,006
SPEAKER_0:  So explain it to me why the back.

01:38:31,650 --> 01:38:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  it would be.

01:38:32,834 --> 01:38:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  harder.

01:38:33,602 --> 01:38:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  It would be better to your position to finish them out. If you can.

01:38:37,602 --> 01:38:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  Explain it to me why.

01:38:39,586 --> 01:38:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  I might change my mind.

01:38:41,218 --> 01:38:42,718
SPEAKER_1:  I was trying to, but uh...

01:38:44,290 --> 01:38:45,415
SPEAKER_1:  I don't have the...

01:38:45,415 --> 01:38:45,950
SPEAKER_0:  cred.

01:38:46,242 --> 01:38:49,617
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:38:49,617 --> 01:38:53,022
SPEAKER_1:  I'm like a middle school science student trying to talk to Einstein here.

01:38:53,378 --> 01:38:53,790
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

01:38:54,274 --> 01:38:56,318
SPEAKER_1:  Besides you, who do you think is the greatest?

01:38:56,706 --> 01:38:58,366
SPEAKER_1:  jiu-jitsu competitor of all time.

01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:04,254
SPEAKER_1:  Can you make the case for some of them, Marcelo, Buccecia?

01:39:05,602 --> 01:39:06,462
SPEAKER_1:  Leandro Lowe.

01:39:06,882 --> 01:39:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  I'll have to go with Bushesha.

01:39:08,706 --> 01:39:09,406
SPEAKER_0:  because look at that.

01:39:09,730 --> 01:39:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  how many titles he has.

01:39:13,474 --> 01:39:16,350
SPEAKER_0:  He has by far more than Marcelo. Marcelo stopped quite early.

01:39:17,442 --> 01:39:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  Leandro Lowe has eight.

01:39:18,850 --> 01:39:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  button.

01:39:19,970 --> 01:39:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  But Shish is better than him. What do you think makes Pachacha so good?

01:39:23,906 --> 01:39:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  He's a heavyweight that moves like a light weight.

01:39:26,626 --> 01:39:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  He moves very fast, he's very agile for his...

01:39:29,698 --> 01:39:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  size.

01:39:31,586 --> 01:39:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  So the.

01:39:33,090 --> 01:39:34,878
SPEAKER_1:  the agility combined with aggression.

01:39:36,322 --> 01:39:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  So it's very hard to control him.

01:39:37,826 --> 01:39:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  because...

01:39:38,754 --> 01:39:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  Hey Moose.

01:39:40,098 --> 01:39:40,670
SPEAKER_0:  fast.

01:39:41,442 --> 01:39:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  and he's a hundred.

01:39:43,010 --> 01:39:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  12 kilos, only 15 sometimes, or 110. I'm not sure what he's about around that.

01:39:48,290 --> 01:39:50,046
SPEAKER_0:  So 240 in pounds.

01:39:50,722 --> 01:39:51,454
SPEAKER_0:  So when you...

01:39:51,842 --> 01:39:52,798
SPEAKER_0:  when you're agile.

01:39:53,122 --> 01:39:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  240 pounds.

01:39:55,298 --> 01:39:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  That makes it.

01:39:56,162 --> 01:39:57,758
SPEAKER_0:  very hard to control you.

01:39:57,986 --> 01:40:05,310
SPEAKER_1:  What about making the case for some others? What about the little guys? What about Marcelo? If you were to make the case for him being the strongest. What makes Marcelo good?

01:40:05,954 --> 01:40:08,990
SPEAKER_0:  Muscle gas is extremely technical. I mean, I think he's.

01:40:09,602 --> 01:40:11,678
SPEAKER_0:  He's one of my favorite 2G2 fighters.

01:40:12,482 --> 01:40:14,366
SPEAKER_0:  because...

01:40:14,818 --> 01:40:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  in a technical way, I think.

01:40:16,514 --> 01:40:17,886
SPEAKER_0:  is probably one of the best.

01:40:18,402 --> 01:40:21,777
SPEAKER_1:  this raw technique in a bunch of different positions for submissions.

01:40:21,777 --> 01:40:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  He's

01:40:23,586 --> 01:40:27,070
SPEAKER_0:  He's not very powerful, you know, physically he's not very strong.

01:40:27,778 --> 01:40:31,902
SPEAKER_0:  but he can make himself very strong and his technique is very, very high level.

01:40:32,162 --> 01:40:33,694
SPEAKER_1:  Have you ever trained with them?

01:40:34,178 --> 01:40:35,134
SPEAKER_1:  Now I fought him twice.

01:40:35,362 --> 01:40:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:40:37,026 --> 01:40:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  It's much smaller than me.

01:40:39,426 --> 01:40:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  What happened in those matches? The First Fight,

01:40:41,890 --> 01:40:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  I tapped him.

01:40:43,522 --> 01:40:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  Five minutes in which submission took from the back.

01:40:47,106 --> 01:40:48,030
SPEAKER_0:  collar choke from the back.

01:40:49,314 --> 01:40:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  in the second time I've been in by points, but a very large.

01:40:53,762 --> 01:40:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  Think 12, too.

01:40:56,386 --> 01:40:57,214
SPEAKER_1:  Actually, uh...

01:40:57,954 --> 01:40:59,070
SPEAKER_1:  just to continue.

01:40:59,874 --> 01:41:00,382
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:41:01,090 --> 01:41:04,830
SPEAKER_1:  I wonder if John Donahue would agree with you about mouthing back.

01:41:05,218 --> 01:41:10,814
SPEAKER_1:  I can't wait to, this is a bear versus a lion conversation. I'm looking, there's statistics about.

01:41:11,074 --> 01:41:11,902
SPEAKER_1: ikh

01:41:12,130 --> 01:41:13,150
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not letting this go.

01:41:13,538 --> 01:41:15,166
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, there's statistics about.

01:41:16,770 --> 01:41:18,366
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, look at that, Hodger.

01:41:18,946 --> 01:41:25,950
SPEAKER_1:  What do you know looking at Hadra Gracie's statistics for most successful submissions? Choke from the back!

01:41:26,178 --> 01:41:27,198
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's the most.

01:41:27,874 --> 01:41:29,749
SPEAKER_1:  So how do you explain that Mr. Sajj?

01:41:29,749 --> 01:41:31,902
SPEAKER_0:  Because people panic when I'm out.

01:41:32,386 --> 01:41:33,598
SPEAKER_0:  They turn the back.

01:41:33,954 --> 01:41:35,079
SPEAKER_0:  I choked him out.

01:41:35,079 --> 01:41:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  connotations

01:41:36,514 --> 01:41:41,854
SPEAKER_1:  But for people it is interesting that of course this doesn't capture but this captures a lot of your major matches

01:41:42,594 --> 01:41:49,406
SPEAKER_1:  And we should say that you've submitted most of your opponents. So you rarely went on points. You usually went submissions.

01:41:50,594 --> 01:41:51,390
SPEAKER_1:  choke from back.

01:41:51,810 --> 01:41:53,758
SPEAKER_1:  is most of them then cross-joke from mouth.

01:41:54,178 --> 01:41:57,502
SPEAKER_1:  arm bars a lot too. So 18 from choke from back.

01:41:57,922 --> 01:42:00,190
SPEAKER_1:  12 cross choke, 10 arm bar.

01:42:01,026 --> 01:42:03,486
SPEAKER_1:  Five RNC rear nakedness for no G

01:42:05,090 --> 01:42:09,598
SPEAKER_0:  So in 2000, Ezekiel is very powerful. I took out his strong weapon.

01:42:09,954 --> 01:42:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:42:10,498 --> 01:42:11,230
SPEAKER_1:  Also from Mount.

01:42:11,458 --> 01:42:12,030
SPEAKER_1:  from

01:42:13,410 --> 01:42:15,486
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, that's when you can't get the one hand in.

01:42:16,034 --> 01:42:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  No, because...

01:42:17,410 --> 01:42:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  The Ezekiel most times I use against people is the...

01:42:21,954 --> 01:42:24,702
SPEAKER_0:  Is the attack dead as soon as I get to the mount?

01:42:25,314 --> 01:42:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  when they're trying to escape the open up.

01:42:27,522 --> 01:42:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  and I get them.

01:42:28,546 --> 01:42:30,366
SPEAKER_0:  It has to be at that initial.

01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:31,614
SPEAKER_0:  or timing.

01:42:31,906 --> 01:42:33,886
SPEAKER_1:  So it's not a thing you use to like bother them.

01:42:34,114 --> 01:42:35,239
SPEAKER_1:  in order to create.

01:42:35,239 --> 01:42:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  Either I get it right away or I don't bother trying much.

01:42:39,586 --> 01:42:41,822
SPEAKER_0:  because you need to keep one hand behind the head.

01:42:42,754 --> 01:42:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:42:43,682 --> 01:42:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  You're naturally on that position as soon as you mount.

01:42:47,266 --> 01:42:48,062
SPEAKER_0:  most of the times.

01:42:48,322 --> 01:42:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  And.

01:42:49,378 --> 01:42:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  The moment that you mount someone, no one accepts that. They go mounted, they're gonna explode to get out. So hold in the head.

01:42:55,042 --> 01:42:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  It gives you a better weight.

01:42:57,250 --> 01:42:59,006
SPEAKER_0:  we wait to dominate them initially.

01:42:59,554 --> 01:43:00,542
SPEAKER_0:  you know, to deal with that.

01:43:01,186 --> 01:43:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  explosion is on the beginning.

01:43:04,834 --> 01:43:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  But then you have to let go to try it.

01:43:07,362 --> 01:43:08,862
SPEAKER_0:  You'll have a very limited hold in the head.

01:43:10,530 --> 01:43:13,342
SPEAKER_1:  In terms of goats, shanji.

01:43:14,498 --> 01:43:15,998
SPEAKER_1:  I feel like he doesn't get enough credit.

01:43:16,482 --> 01:43:17,406
SPEAKER_1:  He deserves.

01:43:17,666 --> 01:43:22,686
SPEAKER_1:  He had an extremely dominant performance in competition. What about Salo and Shinji Hibero?

01:43:23,138 --> 01:43:24,830
SPEAKER_1:  What are your thoughts about what makes them?

01:43:25,058 --> 01:43:27,998
SPEAKER_1:  So good. Yeah, a bunch of tough matches with the Shange.

01:43:28,258 --> 01:43:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, eight times.

01:43:31,714 --> 01:43:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  for eight times, Shande, I fought solo once.

01:43:37,314 --> 01:43:38,174
SPEAKER_1:  What?

01:43:39,394 --> 01:43:41,118
SPEAKER_1:  I think I'm bringing up a sore point.

01:43:41,474 --> 01:43:42,206
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:43:43,458 --> 01:43:44,702
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, did Shonji tap?

01:43:44,930 --> 01:43:45,790
SPEAKER_1:  When you are...

01:43:46,370 --> 01:43:50,526
SPEAKER_1:  or did the time right out, and that was the last time you guys face each other.

01:43:50,978 --> 01:43:54,078
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, 2008. That was incredible to watch.

01:43:54,690 --> 01:43:55,262
SPEAKER_1:  Also.

01:43:56,226 --> 01:43:56,638
SPEAKER_1:  Oh.

01:43:57,634 --> 01:44:00,670
SPEAKER_1:  I think you pull guard with one minute left, working toes.

01:44:01,154 --> 01:44:06,270
SPEAKER_1:  or attacking, I mean, it's probably very tough to get anything and for people who don't know.

01:44:06,722 --> 01:44:07,614
SPEAKER_1:  Time ran out.

01:44:08,034 --> 01:44:10,590
SPEAKER_1:  You had something that looked like an arm lock.

01:44:11,362 --> 01:44:13,246
SPEAKER_1:  and Sean G.

01:44:14,242 --> 01:44:17,822
SPEAKER_1:  look like he may be tapping, but it looked like he might be just celebrating.

01:44:18,210 --> 01:44:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not sure.

01:44:22,946 --> 01:44:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not sure because...

01:44:25,602 --> 01:44:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  the Hizam.

01:44:26,850 --> 01:44:27,390
SPEAKER_0:  Just...

01:44:28,034 --> 01:44:30,046
SPEAKER_0:  just straight his arm time finish. yeah

01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:32,030
SPEAKER_0:  So I'm not sure if she was tapping.

01:44:32,834 --> 01:44:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  to let go of time.

01:44:35,074 --> 01:44:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  Time's up.

01:44:36,130 --> 01:44:37,630
SPEAKER_0:  Boy, because of the outside.

01:44:38,306 --> 01:44:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  most likely the time was up.

01:44:40,674 --> 01:44:43,614
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, and also there's a thing when you start, you realize there's only.

01:44:43,874 --> 01:44:46,782
SPEAKER_1:  32 seconds left is to kind of start celebrating

01:44:47,106 --> 01:44:50,942
SPEAKER_1:  You realize that Hodger's not gonna be able to finish this armbar.

01:44:51,394 --> 01:44:53,269
SPEAKER_1:  in the time left, so you start.

01:44:53,269 --> 01:44:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  celebrating.

01:44:54,466 --> 01:44:56,871
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's up to say the time is up.

01:44:56,871 --> 01:44:57,278
SPEAKER_1:  thumbs up.

01:44:57,858 --> 01:45:01,406
SPEAKER_1:  Anyway, what do you think? The longevity especially is impressive.

01:45:01,986 --> 01:45:03,550
SPEAKER_1:  with Sean G.

01:45:03,874 --> 01:45:05,214
SPEAKER_0:  I think he doesn't.

01:45:05,954 --> 01:45:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  credit.

01:45:06,786 --> 01:45:08,670
SPEAKER_0:  as much as he deserves because he...

01:45:08,930 --> 01:45:10,686
SPEAKER_0:  pushed his career very far.

01:45:11,394 --> 01:45:11,838
SPEAKER_0:  N.

01:45:12,546 --> 01:45:14,718
SPEAKER_0:  the last few years he was on his best.

01:45:16,642 --> 01:45:17,342
SPEAKER_0:  So his...

01:45:19,106 --> 01:45:20,414
SPEAKER_0:  if you would have stopped before.

01:45:20,834 --> 01:45:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  You know, you would...

01:45:22,338 --> 01:45:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  people would remember him on his heist.

01:45:25,314 --> 01:45:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  But he kind of.

01:45:26,210 --> 01:45:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  pushed.

01:45:28,002 --> 01:45:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  More.

01:45:28,898 --> 01:45:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  than his.

01:45:31,586 --> 01:45:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  peak, let's say.

01:45:33,570 --> 01:45:35,294
SPEAKER_1:  How hard is it for you to walk away?

01:45:35,938 --> 01:45:38,270
SPEAKER_1:  We'll talk about the journey into MMA as well.

01:45:38,658 --> 01:45:39,774
SPEAKER_1:  but you basically...

01:45:40,418 --> 01:45:42,462
SPEAKER_1:  especially with the second match against Puchesshi.

01:45:42,690 --> 01:45:43,870
SPEAKER_1:  basically walked away.

01:45:44,354 --> 01:45:44,862
SPEAKER_1:  on top.

01:45:46,466 --> 01:45:46,910
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:45:47,394 --> 01:45:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  beating arguably the greatest competitor of all time.

01:45:51,074 --> 01:45:51,646
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:45:52,034 --> 01:45:53,118
SPEAKER_1:  and just walking away.

01:45:54,434 --> 01:45:56,702
SPEAKER_0:  It wasn't that hard to be honest because...

01:45:56,994 --> 01:45:58,878
SPEAKER_0:  That was something that I was considering.

01:45:59,106 --> 01:45:59,614
SPEAKER_0:  for a while.

01:46:00,674 --> 01:46:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  because the last few years of my...

01:46:02,914 --> 01:46:03,902
SPEAKER_0:  career, let's say.

01:46:05,794 --> 01:46:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  It was fighting MMA at the same time as fighting Jiu-Jitsu, and it is very challenging to do both.

01:46:11,362 --> 01:46:11,934
SPEAKER_0:  Takaron!

01:46:12,610 --> 01:46:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  there's not another person who ever did that.

01:46:15,362 --> 01:46:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  because the training is a confliction.

01:46:18,210 --> 01:46:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  with the What You Train.

01:46:19,874 --> 01:46:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  Everybody who starts doing MMA is focused on MMA.

01:46:23,778 --> 01:46:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  the jujitsu gets worse.

01:46:26,466 --> 01:46:27,710
SPEAKER_0:  because they stopped training with the gig.

01:46:28,770 --> 01:46:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  Everybody.

01:46:30,146 --> 01:46:30,750
SPEAKER_0:  No exception.

01:46:31,906 --> 01:46:35,934
SPEAKER_0:  Was your DJ's also getting worse? No, because I made sure I kept...

01:46:36,162 --> 01:46:37,982
SPEAKER_0:  training with the gi and I kept.

01:46:38,562 --> 01:46:41,406
SPEAKER_0:  fighting at least the World Championship once a year.

01:46:41,986 --> 01:46:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  That was my goal. I'm like, I'm going to go for MMA.

01:46:44,866 --> 01:46:47,390
SPEAKER_0:  But I loved you just when I still wanna fight.

01:46:48,162 --> 01:46:49,150
SPEAKER_0:  the highest level.

01:46:49,698 --> 01:46:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  So I kept fighting once a year for a few years.

01:46:53,122 --> 01:46:53,982
SPEAKER_0:  It was a challenge.

01:46:54,594 --> 01:46:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  especially because...

01:46:57,026 --> 01:46:59,550
SPEAKER_0:  or three times when I competed at the Worlds.

01:47:00,034 --> 01:47:00,542
SPEAKER_0:  It was.

01:47:01,090 --> 01:47:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  right after I met my fight ahead.

01:47:03,554 --> 01:47:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:47:04,226 --> 01:47:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  then you know, no gear don't.

01:47:05,890 --> 01:47:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  you don't have the grips.

01:47:07,938 --> 01:47:08,798
SPEAKER_0:  So my grips.

01:47:09,122 --> 01:47:10,046
SPEAKER_0:  It made a big difference.

01:47:10,690 --> 01:47:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  on my grip so I was weaker.

01:47:12,450 --> 01:47:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  quick place.

01:47:13,602 --> 01:47:14,814
SPEAKER_0:  I failed that so.

01:47:15,170 --> 01:47:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  I knew it was like it's.

01:47:16,994 --> 01:47:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  is our necessary risk.

01:47:18,562 --> 01:47:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  because if I cannot be 100%, so what am I doing this?

01:47:22,434 --> 01:47:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  but

01:47:23,426 --> 01:47:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  I'm stubborn, I love jujitsu. That's like, I...

01:47:26,242 --> 01:47:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  Love.

01:47:27,330 --> 01:47:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  I'd introduce you.

01:47:28,994 --> 01:47:30,206
SPEAKER_0:  I never loved MMA.

01:47:30,466 --> 01:47:32,542
SPEAKER_0:  I've liked it, but I think if all graced, I wouldn't.

01:47:35,458 --> 01:47:37,534
SPEAKER_1:  So the thing you felt the most.

01:47:38,210 --> 01:47:39,454
SPEAKER_1:  is the grips.

01:47:41,442 --> 01:47:43,934
SPEAKER_1:  Cause you win a GE world championship.

01:47:44,770 --> 01:47:45,342
SPEAKER_1:  without.

01:47:45,922 --> 01:47:46,430
SPEAKER_1:  gripping.

01:47:47,522 --> 01:47:51,518
SPEAKER_1:  Like just pretending it's no game match. They get to grip you, but you don't.

01:47:52,290 --> 01:47:53,415
SPEAKER_1:  So grips are essential.

01:47:53,415 --> 01:47:59,934
SPEAKER_0:  Of course. I mean, how can you choke someone? Like if your grips are weak, your forearms will fatigue.

01:48:00,802 --> 01:48:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  and then you will have no power.

01:48:02,722 --> 01:48:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  and then you cannot do anything.

01:48:05,506 --> 01:48:07,102
SPEAKER_1:  You could still arm lock.

01:48:07,490 --> 01:48:07,966
SPEAKER_1:  executive.

01:48:08,674 --> 01:48:13,549
SPEAKER_1:  So I meant more not for the submission but for the control of the game of it. The dance.

01:48:13,549 --> 01:48:15,006
SPEAKER_0:  We two need to grip together.

01:48:15,362 --> 01:48:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  get there.

01:48:16,802 --> 01:48:17,886
SPEAKER_0:  any figures are weak.

01:48:18,690 --> 01:48:20,414
SPEAKER_1:  But you also have grips in no-gi.

01:48:20,674 --> 01:48:21,726
SPEAKER_1:  Can she use those groups?

01:48:22,754 --> 01:48:23,774
SPEAKER_1:  This is a thought experiment.

01:48:24,002 --> 01:48:26,627
SPEAKER_1:  So like, I'm trying to understand how essential I get.

01:48:26,627 --> 01:48:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  You gotta know your guy before you do it.

01:48:28,866 --> 01:48:29,278
SPEAKER_0:  They panic.

01:48:30,146 --> 01:48:30,494
SPEAKER_1:  panic.

01:48:31,202 --> 01:48:36,478
SPEAKER_1:  Everyone panics, a bear panics when they're in the water with a shark, but that doesn't mean the bear can't still win.

01:48:36,866 --> 01:48:38,718
SPEAKER_1:  when it stops panicking and relaxes.

01:48:39,426 --> 01:48:40,030
SPEAKER_1:  Not possible.

01:48:40,354 --> 01:48:41,694
SPEAKER_1:  That's another discussion.

01:48:41,954 --> 01:48:43,262
SPEAKER_1:  Can a bear beat a shark?

01:48:43,874 --> 01:48:44,606
SPEAKER_1:  in the water.

01:48:44,866 --> 01:48:45,630
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhhhhhh

01:48:46,946 --> 01:48:50,174
SPEAKER_1:  Actually, I need to put me a polar bear because they're pretty good at swimming. Okay.

01:48:50,626 --> 01:48:53,214
SPEAKER_0:  I say not possible for the no-gig guy to win.

01:48:53,506 --> 01:48:55,358
SPEAKER_1:  but the bears is a further discussion.

01:48:56,642 --> 01:49:00,702
SPEAKER_1:  What was to you the biggest difference between mixed martial arts and

01:49:01,090 --> 01:49:01,630
SPEAKER_1:  Did you see?

01:49:02,274 --> 01:49:04,702
SPEAKER_1:  What are some interesting differences, some interesting insights?

01:49:04,962 --> 01:49:07,102
SPEAKER_1:  even just about the grappling within both sports.

01:49:08,546 --> 01:49:09,310
SPEAKER_0:  the biggest difference.

01:49:09,570 --> 01:49:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  for me.

01:49:10,754 --> 01:49:12,350
SPEAKER_0:  between MMA and Jiu-Jitsu.

01:49:13,122 --> 01:49:14,494
SPEAKER_0:  is first is the speed.

01:49:15,042 --> 01:49:15,934
SPEAKER_0:  Like you did so.

01:49:16,546 --> 01:49:17,982
SPEAKER_0:  You know, like a 10-minute match.

01:49:18,466 --> 01:49:19,454
SPEAKER_0:  I can take my time.

01:49:20,002 --> 01:49:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  There's no dangers.

01:49:21,410 --> 01:49:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  the other.

01:49:22,050 --> 01:49:23,966
SPEAKER_0:  that forces me to move fast.

01:49:24,930 --> 01:49:27,358
SPEAKER_0:  MMA you have to be 100% sharp.

01:49:28,290 --> 01:49:29,182
SPEAKER_0:  in FOSS.

01:49:29,442 --> 01:49:29,758
SPEAKER_0:  from.

01:49:30,914 --> 01:49:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  first second of the fight.

01:49:32,514 --> 01:49:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  because punches are coming, you can't get knocked out anytime.

01:49:35,170 --> 01:49:35,934
SPEAKER_0:  One mistake.

01:49:36,610 --> 01:49:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  You out.

01:49:37,666 --> 01:49:38,590
SPEAKER_0:  who just don't have that.

01:49:39,394 --> 01:49:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  Bye kids.

01:49:40,450 --> 01:49:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  I don't have to worry about quick submissions.

01:49:42,498 --> 01:49:48,926
SPEAKER_0:  because it's all about the way my body's positioned, my grips, it's easy to avoid, it's easy to see it coming.

01:49:50,242 --> 01:49:55,294
SPEAKER_0:  It's like a quick submission, a surprise. It only works if you make a mistake.

01:49:55,874 --> 01:49:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  If you know.

01:49:57,282 --> 01:49:58,238
SPEAKER_0:  correct position.

01:49:59,106 --> 01:50:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  Otherwise it's impossible. It's extremely difficult.

01:50:02,402 --> 01:50:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  MMA is not.

01:50:04,194 --> 01:50:04,702
SPEAKER_0:  Amen.

01:50:04,994 --> 01:50:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  One split second mistake.

01:50:07,938 --> 01:50:09,150
SPEAKER_0:  and where the person comes.

01:50:10,786 --> 01:50:11,742
SPEAKER_0:  you have to respond.

01:50:12,354 --> 01:50:14,078
SPEAKER_0:  you have to match his bass.

01:50:14,402 --> 01:50:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, you can slow down, but it's like you're forced to respond.

01:50:18,050 --> 01:50:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  So it's much faster.

01:50:19,906 --> 01:50:21,022
SPEAKER_0:  It's a lot more.

01:50:21,410 --> 01:50:21,854
SPEAKER_0:  physical.

01:50:22,498 --> 01:50:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  a lot more.

01:50:23,906 --> 01:50:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  and you need to beat.

01:50:25,474 --> 01:50:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  physical much.

01:50:27,042 --> 01:50:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  better conditioning, faster, it's explosiveness, it's much harder.

01:50:31,746 --> 01:50:33,694
SPEAKER_1:  Is it possible in MMA to

01:50:34,722 --> 01:50:35,518
SPEAKER_1:  Calm things down.

01:50:36,002 --> 01:50:37,566
SPEAKER_0:  and let it div the change the rules here.

01:50:38,018 --> 01:50:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  5 minute rules now.

01:50:40,610 --> 01:50:41,406
SPEAKER_1:  Ah, I see.

01:50:41,922 --> 01:50:42,846
SPEAKER_1:  So like, uh.

01:50:43,234 --> 01:50:45,246
SPEAKER_1:  I just meant actually technically speaking.

01:50:45,538 --> 01:50:46,782
SPEAKER_1:  Is there a way to...

01:50:47,618 --> 01:50:51,358
SPEAKER_1:  to take out an opponent that's being exceptionally aggressive. You can clinch.

01:50:51,554 --> 01:50:54,270
SPEAKER_0:  But then he takes it down, he keeps moving.

01:50:54,594 --> 01:50:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  Something is hard to control that.

01:50:57,250 --> 01:50:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  Peace.

01:50:59,010 --> 01:51:02,366
SPEAKER_0:  You can, you don't, if you play defense, you...

01:51:02,690 --> 01:51:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  Save more energy than if you try to be the aggressor and respond.

01:51:06,370 --> 01:51:08,318
SPEAKER_1:  And even getting to the clinch is very difficult.

01:51:08,418 --> 01:51:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  date.

01:51:08,994 --> 01:51:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  You have no way to hold yourself there.

01:51:11,650 --> 01:51:14,718
SPEAKER_0:  So that was the biggest challenge for me in MMA is the speed.

01:51:14,978 --> 01:51:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  because I'm very slow.

01:51:16,546 --> 01:51:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  Starfighter.

01:51:17,762 --> 01:51:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  If you look at my matches I start very slow.

01:51:20,290 --> 01:51:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  Because if I go hard...

01:51:21,698 --> 01:51:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I fatigue.

01:51:23,202 --> 01:51:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  faster.

01:51:24,418 --> 01:51:26,782
SPEAKER_0:  So for me, that was the hardest part.

01:51:27,714 --> 01:51:29,470
SPEAKER_0:  of is to start fast.

01:51:30,178 --> 01:51:32,734
SPEAKER_1:  What about on the ground? Is there something different?

01:51:33,538 --> 01:51:34,846
SPEAKER_1:  more challenging on the ground.

01:51:35,330 --> 01:51:37,831
SPEAKER_0:  Being in the bottom, yes. This punch is good.

01:51:37,831 --> 01:51:41,581
SPEAKER_1:  How fundamentally different is GGS with punches on the ground?

01:51:41,581 --> 01:51:42,238
SPEAKER_0:  changes everything.

01:51:42,850 --> 01:51:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  Everything.

01:51:44,162 --> 01:51:45,150
SPEAKER_0:  Which parts?

01:51:45,506 --> 01:51:50,782
SPEAKER_0:  the distance that you allow your opponent to be on you, the techniques that you choose to apply.

01:51:51,522 --> 01:51:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  You know, you have to.

01:51:55,426 --> 01:51:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  Your body has to be aware of the punches and you are a lot more limited.

01:52:00,418 --> 01:52:01,543
SPEAKER_0:  on your text.

01:52:01,543 --> 01:52:05,054
SPEAKER_1:  So you're known for your closed guard. How does your closed guard have to adjust?

01:52:05,410 --> 01:52:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  How does the position of your hands have to adjust?

01:52:08,002 --> 01:52:09,127
SPEAKER_1:  when you're on the bottom of clothes.

01:52:09,127 --> 01:52:11,838
SPEAKER_0:  guard. So in the guide, especially in the close guard.

01:52:12,386 --> 01:52:15,230
SPEAKER_0:  You have to keep the person very close to you.

01:52:15,778 --> 01:52:17,022
SPEAKER_0:  or you have to kick him away.

01:52:17,986 --> 01:52:20,254
SPEAKER_0:  That's the thing, the God is either I'm hugging you.

01:52:21,474 --> 01:52:22,599
SPEAKER_0:  get away from energy.

01:52:22,599 --> 01:52:23,966
SPEAKER_1:  Jitsy or a lot to have a middle.

01:52:24,226 --> 01:52:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, there's a lot of, you can't allow the person to be.

01:52:28,994 --> 01:52:34,494
SPEAKER_1:  What about getting armlock or triangle submissions from the guard?

01:52:35,042 --> 01:52:36,606
SPEAKER_1:  Is that fundamental?

01:52:36,866 --> 01:52:37,438
SPEAKER_1:  different.

01:52:38,754 --> 01:52:39,998
SPEAKER_1:  because you don't have the middle game.

01:52:40,898 --> 01:52:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  It's much harder.

01:52:43,106 --> 01:52:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  There's barely no open guard.

01:52:45,698 --> 01:52:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  in MMA.

01:52:46,594 --> 01:52:47,038
SPEAKER_0:  toilet.

01:52:48,546 --> 01:52:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  because the open guard, there's a distance between you and him.

01:52:51,842 --> 01:52:54,494
SPEAKER_0:  There's a distance you cannot control.

01:52:55,106 --> 01:52:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  It's much harder to control that punch coming.

01:52:57,090 --> 01:52:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:52:58,210 --> 01:53:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  I have to position myself a way to block that.

01:53:01,730 --> 01:53:04,190
SPEAKER_0:  and it limited my attacks, my options of attacks.

01:53:04,418 --> 01:53:05,278
SPEAKER_1:  Is there a reason?

01:53:06,082 --> 01:53:07,070
SPEAKER_1:  Correct me if I'm wrong.

01:53:07,490 --> 01:53:09,502
SPEAKER_1:  But I don't think you do open guard much.

01:53:09,890 --> 01:53:11,582
SPEAKER_1:  in Jijutsu no Gi.

01:53:12,354 --> 01:53:13,374
SPEAKER_1:  Is there a reason for that?

01:53:14,306 --> 01:53:15,134
SPEAKER_0:  It's harder.

01:53:15,490 --> 01:53:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, that gets positive.

01:53:18,402 --> 01:53:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  Explosive person.

01:53:20,066 --> 01:53:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  because it's not when they're moving fast.

01:53:22,402 --> 01:53:23,966
SPEAKER_0:  then you have to try to slow them down.

01:53:24,194 --> 01:53:25,982
SPEAKER_1:  So you like guards that allow you to control them.

01:53:27,970 --> 01:53:29,607
SPEAKER_1:  and closed guard as they all took.

01:53:29,607 --> 01:53:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  control.

01:53:31,266 --> 01:53:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  It's not ultimate control, but close guard puts in a position that I'm attacking and you're defending.

01:53:36,866 --> 01:53:38,718
SPEAKER_0:  You cannot attack me from my clothes guard.

01:53:39,522 --> 01:53:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  I'm just a book.

01:53:40,770 --> 01:53:43,582
SPEAKER_0:  we can add that those might be one or two tags but it's like...

01:53:44,578 --> 01:53:46,814
SPEAKER_0:  very very very limited in.

01:53:47,746 --> 01:53:49,246
SPEAKER_0:  Depends who you're fighting against.

01:53:50,018 --> 01:53:54,893
SPEAKER_1:  I hate the close guard, being on top against a good close guard.

01:53:54,893 --> 01:53:57,374
SPEAKER_0:  is very no one likes this is terrible it's horrible yeah

01:53:57,634 --> 01:53:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  It's one-sided.

01:53:58,818 --> 01:54:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  So, even the God is one-sided. The person above has the advantage.

01:54:02,914 --> 01:54:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  I can be completely relaxed in my clothes guard.

01:54:05,922 --> 01:54:07,797
SPEAKER_0:  and I cannot be completely relaxed.

01:54:07,797 --> 01:54:15,678
SPEAKER_1:  the most annoying thing is, is somebody who is both good and extremely confident with a close guard. Cause they have that smug energy about them.

01:54:16,130 --> 01:54:19,646
SPEAKER_1:  They know how much unpleasant, how much work it takes to pass this.

01:54:20,258 --> 01:54:20,734
SPEAKER_1:  Anyway.

01:54:21,570 --> 01:54:24,062
SPEAKER_1:  especially people with longer legs.

01:54:25,538 --> 01:54:27,102
SPEAKER_1:  Is there something you, um...

01:54:27,586 --> 01:54:29,118
SPEAKER_1:  which he did differently in.

01:54:29,346 --> 01:54:32,382
SPEAKER_1:  how you started training at MMA in that trajectory.

01:54:32,834 --> 01:54:35,774
SPEAKER_1:  in figuring out how to train, how to get good.

01:54:36,002 --> 01:54:38,270
SPEAKER_1:  Like what have you learned about getting good at MMA?

01:54:39,266 --> 01:54:42,398
SPEAKER_1:  from having done it. If you were to start now for example.

01:54:43,714 --> 01:54:45,150
SPEAKER_0:  I think I would have to dedicate it.

01:54:46,338 --> 01:54:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't dedicate enough.

01:54:48,162 --> 01:54:49,950
SPEAKER_1:  both like literally time.

01:54:50,274 --> 01:54:52,149
SPEAKER_1:  number of training sessions

01:54:52,149 --> 01:54:55,998
SPEAKER_0:  Training ways, physical, yeah, I think a lot more the physical part of it.

01:54:56,418 --> 01:54:58,622
SPEAKER_0:  The strikes, everything from the beginning.

01:54:58,882 --> 01:54:59,294
SPEAKER_0:  It's.

01:55:00,258 --> 01:55:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  because.

01:55:02,210 --> 01:55:03,454
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I love Jiu-Jitsu.

01:55:03,746 --> 01:55:05,214
SPEAKER_0:  like it's I truly love.

01:55:05,666 --> 01:55:07,358
SPEAKER_0:  the old despects of it.

01:55:07,650 --> 01:55:08,798
SPEAKER_0:  fighting training.

01:55:09,058 --> 01:55:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the practice of...

01:55:10,498 --> 01:55:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  competition.

01:55:12,034 --> 01:55:13,310
SPEAKER_0:  I don't have that for MMA.

01:55:13,890 --> 01:55:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  So it's hard to.

01:55:14,882 --> 01:55:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  to give your heart to it, something that you don't have the passion to it.

01:55:18,402 --> 01:55:19,390
SPEAKER_0:  like Jujitsu.

01:55:19,874 --> 01:55:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I gave my heart to it.

01:55:22,018 --> 01:55:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  Like I did everything that I had to.

01:55:24,418 --> 01:55:25,694
SPEAKER_0:  MMA I never.

01:55:26,018 --> 01:55:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't do that.

01:55:28,354 --> 01:55:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  That's why it was.

01:55:31,170 --> 01:55:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  I won't say it was wrong for me to do it because...

01:55:35,682 --> 01:55:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  I don't regret doing I always

01:55:37,986 --> 01:55:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  And now looking back.

01:55:39,426 --> 01:55:41,918
SPEAKER_0:  as a kid when I decided to be.

01:55:42,754 --> 01:55:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  take Jiu Jitsu for life.

01:55:44,834 --> 01:55:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  I already knew.

01:55:46,850 --> 01:55:48,766
SPEAKER_0:  that some point I will have to do MMA.

01:55:49,250 --> 01:55:51,806
SPEAKER_0:  It's almost like that's the path of a great sea.

01:55:52,450 --> 01:55:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  you know, when you're ready.

01:55:54,370 --> 01:55:55,230
SPEAKER_0:  You go do me.

01:55:56,674 --> 01:55:58,549
SPEAKER_1:  So that was like a duty for

01:55:58,549 --> 01:55:59,614
SPEAKER_0:  versus a love.

01:55:59,906 --> 01:56:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  There was not a choice. It was like I had to.

01:56:03,074 --> 01:56:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  It's just the life I took, it will lead that way.

01:56:08,258 --> 01:56:09,726
SPEAKER_1:  Are you proud of that stuff?

01:56:09,954 --> 01:56:13,342
SPEAKER_1:  you know, go against the natural love and towards more duty.

01:56:15,170 --> 01:56:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

01:56:17,058 --> 01:56:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  I don't regret it.

01:56:18,338 --> 01:56:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  because...

01:56:19,330 --> 01:56:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  If I hadn't...

01:56:20,642 --> 01:56:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  Done it.

01:56:21,378 --> 01:56:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  I'll feel there was something missing.

01:56:24,034 --> 01:56:24,446
SPEAKER_0:  So...

01:56:24,738 --> 01:56:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  I don't regret doing that with-

01:56:26,370 --> 01:56:26,942
SPEAKER_0:  Regret.

01:56:27,554 --> 01:56:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  not doing.

01:56:29,378 --> 01:56:29,694
SPEAKER_1:  Thanks for watching!

01:56:30,178 --> 01:56:33,534
SPEAKER_1:  The tricky thing is the choice to go to MMA.

01:56:34,754 --> 01:56:37,374
SPEAKER_1:  could have compromised your ability to win against Buccecia.

01:56:38,338 --> 01:56:41,790
SPEAKER_1:  and it didn't and it's a fascinating.

01:56:42,882 --> 01:56:43,646
SPEAKER_1:  Case study.

01:56:44,066 --> 01:56:45,406
SPEAKER_1:  It still doesn't make sense to me.

01:56:45,794 --> 01:56:51,070
SPEAKER_1:  After all those years, you're able to come back and go against the best person in the world and beat him.

01:56:52,738 --> 01:56:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  And I had to.

01:56:53,826 --> 01:56:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  because

01:56:54,946 --> 01:56:56,126
SPEAKER_0:  The first fight we had.

01:56:57,026 --> 01:56:58,718
SPEAKER_0:  I have something stuck in my throat.

01:56:59,010 --> 01:56:59,902
SPEAKER_0:  for a long time.

01:57:01,410 --> 01:57:03,285
SPEAKER_1:  I had you think so you think about that.

01:57:03,285 --> 01:57:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  Oh yeah.

01:57:04,226 --> 01:57:05,694
SPEAKER_0:  I'm like, as soon as that...

01:57:05,986 --> 01:57:06,654
SPEAKER_0:  first fight.

01:57:07,266 --> 01:57:07,838
SPEAKER_0:  Finished.

01:57:08,546 --> 01:57:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  a headset.

01:57:09,698 --> 01:57:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  that got stuck in my throat that I already at that point I knew.

01:57:13,698 --> 01:57:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  I'm gonna have to fight him again.

01:57:15,522 --> 01:57:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  I knew.

01:57:17,026 --> 01:57:17,694
SPEAKER_0:  I always knew.

01:57:17,922 --> 01:57:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  There's no choice I have to.

01:57:20,802 --> 01:57:21,534
SPEAKER_1:  Oh man.

01:57:22,306 --> 01:57:24,158
SPEAKER_1:  Alright, well...

01:57:24,546 --> 01:57:28,894
SPEAKER_1:  In terms of no-gi, who do you think is the best no-gi competitor of all time?

01:57:29,474 --> 01:57:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  There's no question, you know, it's Gordon is...

01:57:33,346 --> 01:57:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's...

01:57:34,946 --> 01:57:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think it's right to say the best compared to of all time because he's still very young.

01:57:39,458 --> 01:57:41,886
SPEAKER_0:  I think that's something that it can be, I go in the end of.

01:57:42,242 --> 01:57:44,478
SPEAKER_0:  when the person... you don't want him to get lazy.

01:57:44,802 --> 01:57:49,086
SPEAKER_0:  You cannot praise someone in the middle of his career.

01:57:49,410 --> 01:57:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  So is.

01:57:50,146 --> 01:57:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  You cannot call him the best ever.

01:57:52,354 --> 01:57:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  He's 26 or 27.

01:57:54,658 --> 01:57:57,406
SPEAKER_0:  So he's great, he's very good.

01:57:58,082 --> 01:57:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  He's ahead of.

01:57:59,522 --> 01:58:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  or all of other competitors.

01:58:01,730 --> 01:58:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

01:58:03,042 --> 01:58:03,518
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:58:04,386 --> 01:58:08,062
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, he's having an amazing career, you know, he's doing amazingly well.

01:58:08,866 --> 01:58:12,190
SPEAKER_0:  So when he finished, when he finally retired.

01:58:13,122 --> 01:58:14,270
SPEAKER_0:  then you can add it with like...

01:58:15,138 --> 01:58:16,990
SPEAKER_1:  You know what? There's wisdom in that.

01:58:18,082 --> 01:58:19,294
SPEAKER_1:  It matters how you finish.

01:58:19,842 --> 01:58:20,350
SPEAKER_1:  Of course.

01:58:20,706 --> 01:58:21,630
SPEAKER_1:  It's very interesting.

01:58:23,554 --> 01:58:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  I think the Nogi is relatively new.

01:58:27,490 --> 01:58:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  that no-giz scene. That was not.

01:58:29,602 --> 01:58:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  that was not seen before.

01:58:31,554 --> 01:58:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  I think you started now.

01:58:33,154 --> 01:58:33,758
SPEAKER_0:  on his.

01:58:34,402 --> 01:58:35,742
SPEAKER_0:  generation, you know, his time.

01:58:36,034 --> 01:58:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  as before.

01:58:37,506 --> 01:58:37,854
SPEAKER_0:  like.

01:58:38,178 --> 01:58:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  When I was competing, Ogi was just ADCC.

01:58:40,866 --> 01:58:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  There's nothing else.

01:58:42,562 --> 01:58:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  every two years, and my first was only in the Emirates.

01:58:45,666 --> 01:58:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  You know, you should have.

01:58:46,626 --> 01:58:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  You had to go there to compete.

01:58:48,674 --> 01:58:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  So there was not even a scene, it was like this one tournament.

01:58:52,066 --> 01:58:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  That gives.

01:58:53,058 --> 01:58:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  lot of money too.

01:58:54,914 --> 01:58:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  you know, to compare the student fighters.

01:58:58,210 --> 01:59:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  and brings fighters from other modalities.

01:59:00,802 --> 01:59:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  in order to...

01:59:02,626 --> 01:59:03,390
SPEAKER_0:  Marker.

01:59:03,810 --> 01:59:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  Van Arsdale, you know some...

01:59:05,794 --> 01:59:06,654
SPEAKER_0:  wrestlers.

01:59:07,330 --> 01:59:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  Greco-Roman, you know.

01:59:08,898 --> 01:59:10,654
SPEAKER_0:  that can compete against each other.

01:59:12,354 --> 01:59:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  And they create that set of rules, try not to favor anyone.

01:59:16,610 --> 01:59:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  So that was it.

01:59:17,986 --> 01:59:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  so you cannot be called.

01:59:20,066 --> 01:59:22,558
SPEAKER_0:  the greatest doggy of all time if you want to have one.

01:59:22,850 --> 01:59:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  comment.

01:59:24,450 --> 01:59:25,278
SPEAKER_0:  every two years.

01:59:25,538 --> 01:59:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  Only in Amherst they have to be invited.

01:59:28,162 --> 01:59:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  But I think now...

01:59:29,570 --> 01:59:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  And how it did de-groo-

01:59:31,682 --> 01:59:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  a lot.

01:59:32,514 --> 01:59:38,590
SPEAKER_0:  Now we have so many different tournaments. Now we have a scene. We have people that only train Nogi. They're fully dedicated to Nogi.

01:59:39,362 --> 01:59:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  Then you have supervised different tournaments.

01:59:42,722 --> 01:59:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  So now it's professionally, you can do just Nogina, which before was unheard of it because you.

01:59:49,986 --> 01:59:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  you have one or two tournaments. If you cannot be called a no-gay fighter.

01:59:54,434 --> 01:59:55,198
SPEAKER_0:  Fighting one soul.

01:59:55,458 --> 01:59:56,702
SPEAKER_0:  once every two years.

01:59:57,442 --> 01:59:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  twice every two years.

01:59:59,298 --> 02:00:02,654
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, now there's entire systems that are optimized for no geek.

02:00:03,074 --> 02:00:05,758
SPEAKER_1:  that could be fundamentally different. Like what do you think about the body lock?

02:00:06,882 --> 02:00:09,982
SPEAKER_1:  like this passing with the body lock. I don't know if you...

02:00:10,338 --> 02:00:11,742
SPEAKER_1:  get an understanding of it.

02:00:13,186 --> 02:00:14,046
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's okay.

02:00:16,770 --> 02:00:19,454
SPEAKER_1:  It's a popular way to...

02:00:20,738 --> 02:00:21,246
SPEAKER_1:  What is it?

02:00:22,882 --> 02:00:24,350
SPEAKER_1:  maybe to apply.

02:00:24,802 --> 02:00:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  stay tight, very close to your opponent so he can't push great distance, he can push away.

02:00:31,522 --> 02:00:32,647
SPEAKER_0:  But somehow it's...

02:00:32,647 --> 02:00:33,758
SPEAKER_1:  shuts down.

02:00:34,274 --> 02:00:35,102
SPEAKER_1:  the hips as well.

02:00:36,898 --> 02:00:38,046
SPEAKER_1:  makes it more difficult to.

02:00:38,722 --> 02:00:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  Trap your legs.

02:00:40,290 --> 02:00:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  You see, your back is stuck on against the floor.

02:00:43,778 --> 02:00:45,822
SPEAKER_1:  Are you like scientifically?

02:00:46,658 --> 02:00:48,542
SPEAKER_1:  curious about these new developments.

02:00:48,898 --> 02:00:49,438
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think?

02:00:50,050 --> 02:00:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  Do you have answers in your head to them?

02:00:53,858 --> 02:00:54,174
SPEAKER_1:  most.

02:00:56,354 --> 02:01:01,694
SPEAKER_1:  So body lock is one interesting one. Obviously foot locks is another, and that'll mean just the foot locks, but the whole like.

02:01:01,986 --> 02:01:03,806
SPEAKER_1:  control aspect of footlocks.

02:01:05,826 --> 02:01:09,406
SPEAKER_1:  That's interesting. And there's all the interesting stuff. John is really into, uh,

02:01:12,354 --> 02:01:13,342
SPEAKER_1:  The Wrestling

02:01:13,826 --> 02:01:14,526
SPEAKER_1:  aspect.

02:01:14,946 --> 02:01:17,630
SPEAKER_1:  but not wrestling wrestling, but wrestling everywhere.

02:01:17,922 --> 02:01:19,838
SPEAKER_1:  Jiu-Jitsu at all levels of the plane.

02:01:21,282 --> 02:01:24,414
SPEAKER_1:  That's very interesting because you know, obviously DJs is not

02:01:24,930 --> 02:01:25,886
SPEAKER_1:  really been.

02:01:26,722 --> 02:01:29,854
SPEAKER_1:  you know, unlike like freestyle wrestling and so on has not been.

02:01:30,562 --> 02:01:33,726
SPEAKER_1:  like a systematic scientific rigorous exploration of wrestling.

02:01:34,050 --> 02:01:35,934
SPEAKER_1:  It's like you're on your feet and you're on the ground.

02:01:37,602 --> 02:01:38,727
SPEAKER_1:  There's a lot of

02:01:38,727 --> 02:01:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  John is academic, he tried to...

02:01:41,282 --> 02:01:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  in those.

02:01:42,562 --> 02:01:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  Numbers, mathematics, everything.

02:01:45,058 --> 02:01:46,142
SPEAKER_1:  Well you kinda are too.

02:01:46,306 --> 02:01:46,750
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

02:01:47,714 --> 02:01:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  off, I mean that.

02:01:51,010 --> 02:01:51,518
SPEAKER_0:  I am.

02:01:52,258 --> 02:01:55,134
SPEAKER_0:  because you have to understand what you're doing. There's a-

02:01:55,554 --> 02:01:57,406
SPEAKER_0:  Everything does a step by step.

02:01:58,882 --> 02:02:00,734
SPEAKER_0:  like logistic, like details.

02:02:00,962 --> 02:02:03,070
SPEAKER_0:  Every single move, there's a reason for it.

02:02:03,554 --> 02:02:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  You know, there's things around that happens.

02:02:06,786 --> 02:02:08,350
SPEAKER_0:  The more you know, the better you are.

02:02:08,578 --> 02:02:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  write them unknowledgeable.

02:02:10,626 --> 02:02:11,582
SPEAKER_0:  or whatever.

02:02:13,666 --> 02:02:16,574
SPEAKER_0:  So I think with the foot locks with the Nogi.

02:02:17,186 --> 02:02:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  Like if you look back.

02:02:20,226 --> 02:02:23,678
SPEAKER_0:  You know, if you think of, used to be seen as a really bad thing.

02:02:23,970 --> 02:02:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  attack the foot.

02:02:25,314 --> 02:02:26,526
SPEAKER_0:  It wasn't seen as a good.

02:02:27,234 --> 02:02:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  options of attack.

02:02:29,186 --> 02:02:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  Mainly.

02:02:30,498 --> 02:02:33,123
SPEAKER_1:  What is that? Not a respectable gentleman don't attack the light.

02:02:33,123 --> 02:02:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  No, because if you look back...

02:02:35,682 --> 02:02:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  you know, the time as to when they were created.

02:02:38,242 --> 02:02:40,862
SPEAKER_0:  All the rules and everything else was to simulate.

02:02:41,410 --> 02:02:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  a real fight.

02:02:42,530 --> 02:02:44,286
SPEAKER_0:  with no punches, but now I have it in a gi.

02:02:44,642 --> 02:02:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  I mean if you ask what is Jiu Jitsu?

02:02:47,330 --> 02:02:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  Like, what's the main goal of Jiu-Jitsu?

02:02:50,082 --> 02:02:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  to dominate your opponent. What's the middle of fighting?

02:02:53,186 --> 02:02:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  It's re-firing.

02:02:54,754 --> 02:02:57,182
SPEAKER_0:  It's of course submission is the ultimate goal.

02:02:58,978 --> 02:03:02,206
SPEAKER_0:  Before that, the main goal is to dominate you.

02:03:02,914 --> 02:03:03,742
SPEAKER_0:  Like we're fighting.

02:03:04,226 --> 02:03:06,622
SPEAKER_0:  I have to dominate you. And then the submission comes.

02:03:07,618 --> 02:03:08,670
SPEAKER_0:  and foot locks.

02:03:09,218 --> 02:03:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  It's, I don't require any domination on you.

02:03:12,482 --> 02:03:15,006
SPEAKER_0:  I don't need to be in a...

02:03:15,522 --> 02:03:17,406
SPEAKER_0:  dominant position to attack your foot.

02:03:17,794 --> 02:03:18,782
SPEAKER_0:  And is this.

02:03:19,074 --> 02:03:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  If I attack your foot, you're still free to knock me out.

02:03:22,594 --> 02:03:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  If your body goes down to my foot, I can still come close to you or stand up and I'll punch you.

02:03:27,618 --> 02:03:29,854
SPEAKER_0:  So it's not a good position to be in a real fight.

02:03:31,330 --> 02:03:32,542
SPEAKER_0:  to attacking the foot.

02:03:32,802 --> 02:03:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, how many times you've seen that go bad.

02:03:36,034 --> 02:03:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  that went bad in MMA fight.

02:03:38,402 --> 02:03:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  I mean of course you had...

02:03:40,034 --> 02:03:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  some sort of success with the hiruko. It's no questions.

02:03:44,354 --> 02:03:45,630
SPEAKER_0:  but how many times went wrong?

02:03:46,050 --> 02:03:47,582
SPEAKER_0:  People who are knocked out attacking the foot.

02:03:48,098 --> 02:03:50,014
SPEAKER_0:  so you can say it's the best position to be.

02:03:50,786 --> 02:03:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  It's okay to go, but it's a very high-risk position to go.

02:03:55,266 --> 02:03:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  That's why it's not in a real situation, it's not seen as a good thing.

02:03:59,234 --> 02:04:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  So when you translate that to Jiu-Jitsu when attacking the foot

02:04:02,146 --> 02:04:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  is not seen as a good thing because when you reflect that to a...

02:04:05,346 --> 02:04:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  to a real situation.

02:04:07,042 --> 02:04:08,222
SPEAKER_0:  it's not going to go down well.

02:04:09,026 --> 02:04:10,750
SPEAKER_0:  So he was always seen as a-

02:04:11,330 --> 02:04:13,150
SPEAKER_0:  as an easy way out, an easy cut.

02:04:13,570 --> 02:04:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  You're trying to do the easy path. You can't pass my guard, you can't dominate me.

02:04:17,954 --> 02:04:19,646
SPEAKER_0:  It did not try to attack my foot.

02:04:20,194 --> 02:04:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  That's why it was always seen as a.

02:04:22,370 --> 02:04:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it's not as the best.

02:04:23,938 --> 02:04:25,566
SPEAKER_0:  great submission of which went.

02:04:25,890 --> 02:04:29,854
SPEAKER_1:  But the sad side effect of that is it was completely underdeveloped.

02:04:30,018 --> 02:04:31,806
SPEAKER_0:  because of that. Exactly!

02:04:32,482 --> 02:04:33,022
SPEAKER_0:  Of course.

02:04:33,378 --> 02:04:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  So people never really develop.

02:04:35,714 --> 02:04:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  But now...

02:04:36,706 --> 02:04:40,222
SPEAKER_0:  the fighting got completely...

02:04:40,706 --> 02:04:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  Not completely, but you got some. It's not longer.

02:04:43,746 --> 02:04:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  seen us.

02:04:44,930 --> 02:04:46,878
SPEAKER_0:  you know, as a simulation of the real thing.

02:04:47,138 --> 02:04:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  Now sir.

02:04:48,066 --> 02:04:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  Now the sport.

02:04:49,282 --> 02:04:51,518
SPEAKER_0:  is only seen as a sport. For now,

02:04:51,906 --> 02:04:54,046
SPEAKER_0:  It doesn't matter if you attack my foot, you cannot punch me.

02:04:54,754 --> 02:04:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  So why is it bad now to attack the foot?

02:04:57,762 --> 02:04:59,326
SPEAKER_0:  This is not seen as a Bethune anymore.

02:04:59,554 --> 02:04:59,966
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:05:01,122 --> 02:05:02,942
SPEAKER_0:  it now he got really developed.

02:05:03,906 --> 02:05:05,022
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know, that's another...

02:05:05,954 --> 02:05:07,806
SPEAKER_1:  Bear versus shark question, but.

02:05:08,130 --> 02:05:09,214
SPEAKER_1:  You know, there is...

02:05:09,954 --> 02:05:10,462
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:05:11,618 --> 02:05:18,142
SPEAKER_1:  in a street self-defense situation, it's possible to imagine where footlocks would be effective for highly, but I guess.

02:05:18,466 --> 02:05:22,078
SPEAKER_1:  If you invest 10,000 hours, it's better to invest it in.

02:05:23,042 --> 02:05:23,614
SPEAKER_1:  Chokes.

02:05:24,322 --> 02:05:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  to dominate if I'm, you know, if I were fighting.

02:05:27,714 --> 02:05:30,782
SPEAKER_0:  It's way better for me to be on your side control on the mount.

02:05:31,042 --> 02:05:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  What I can pin you be completely safe.

02:05:33,570 --> 02:05:35,966
SPEAKER_0:  than to stay inside your legs trying to attack your foot.

02:05:37,378 --> 02:05:42,750
SPEAKER_1:  People would argue that there's a lot of very dominant controlling positions in the whole footlock game.

02:05:42,882 --> 02:05:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  It is, but it can go bad very quickly.

02:05:46,338 --> 02:05:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  There are some great ways to control someone that he cannot escape.

02:05:51,842 --> 02:05:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  but it can go bad very quickly.

02:05:54,274 --> 02:05:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  That's the thing.

02:05:57,154 --> 02:06:00,222
SPEAKER_1:  Well, even back control can go bad very quickly on the street.

02:06:01,090 --> 02:06:03,774
SPEAKER_1:  So mount, I don't know, is mount a really good?

02:06:03,970 --> 02:06:11,166
SPEAKER_0:  But then there's no good position then. There's no good position. There's no... Every position there's a risk.

02:06:12,738 --> 02:06:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  Tacking the foot is a way higher risk than...

02:06:15,138 --> 02:06:16,446
SPEAKER_0:  Psychon Show. Smile.

02:06:16,674 --> 02:06:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  back.

02:06:18,210 --> 02:06:22,142
SPEAKER_0:  As I'm saying the back is not the best way to pin someone unless...

02:06:22,754 --> 02:06:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  you underneath.

02:06:25,602 --> 02:06:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  because if you try to rotate, I can sacrifice the back and just let you put them out.

02:06:32,802 --> 02:06:33,438
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, there you go.

02:06:34,050 --> 02:06:35,454
SPEAKER_1:  W-would you prefer-

02:06:35,714 --> 02:06:38,046
SPEAKER_1:  mount or back mount where they're flattened.

02:06:38,786 --> 02:06:39,358
SPEAKER_1:  Like, uh...

02:06:40,706 --> 02:06:41,246
SPEAKER_0:  Still not.

02:06:42,050 --> 02:06:43,925
SPEAKER_0:  the the that that a

02:06:43,925 --> 02:06:44,675
SPEAKER_1:  Getcha.

02:06:44,675 --> 02:06:45,425
SPEAKER_0:  All right.

02:06:45,425 --> 02:06:46,270
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah

02:06:46,594 --> 02:06:46,942
SPEAKER_1:

02:06:47,426 --> 02:06:47,998
SPEAKER_1:

02:06:48,322 --> 02:06:53,374
SPEAKER_1:  So yeah, going back to Gordon, what do you think makes that guy so good? We were just a DCC, you got to see him.

02:06:53,602 --> 02:06:54,727
SPEAKER_1:  historically.

02:06:54,727 --> 02:06:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  double performance.

02:06:56,610 --> 02:06:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  His dedication.

02:06:58,562 --> 02:07:00,702
SPEAKER_0:  the way he trains and how much he trains.

02:07:01,474 --> 02:07:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  And of course you have to add.

02:07:03,362 --> 02:07:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  his mind, his belief.

02:07:05,890 --> 02:07:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  to really try to be.

02:07:08,578 --> 02:07:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  best or you know I don't know

02:07:10,434 --> 02:07:13,790
SPEAKER_0:  what his goals are, but I know he's tried to be better than his opponents.

02:07:14,402 --> 02:07:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  his beliefs are very strong.

02:07:16,962 --> 02:07:17,886
SPEAKER_0:  his dedication.

02:07:18,466 --> 02:07:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  He probably trains more than everybody else.

02:07:22,562 --> 02:07:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  I haven't seen first-handed, but from what I...

02:07:24,994 --> 02:07:29,758
SPEAKER_0:  I hear interviews with him and everybody else training, you know, the way everybody trains.

02:07:30,402 --> 02:07:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. OK.

02:07:31,842 --> 02:07:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  for my

02:07:33,250 --> 02:07:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  Eh.

02:07:34,018 --> 02:07:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  little knowledge I have. I bet he trains more than everybody else.

02:07:38,978 --> 02:07:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  Most important...

02:07:40,482 --> 02:07:41,086
SPEAKER_0:  How heat trained.

02:07:42,146 --> 02:07:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  And when I...

02:07:43,458 --> 02:07:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  I kinda already knew but when I heard...

02:07:45,858 --> 02:07:48,030
SPEAKER_0:  podcast with you the other day.

02:07:48,354 --> 02:07:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  John was explaining.

02:07:50,338 --> 02:07:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  preparation the training for the ADCC and that kind of

02:07:53,538 --> 02:07:54,686
SPEAKER_0:  gave me a very strong.

02:07:55,202 --> 02:07:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  idea.

02:07:56,482 --> 02:07:58,110
SPEAKER_0:  how they've been training all these years.

02:07:58,946 --> 02:08:00,254
SPEAKER_0:  So, you know, when we said...

02:08:00,994 --> 02:08:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  You have to work on your weakness, so you have no weakness.

02:08:05,026 --> 02:08:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  He trains a lot on his weakness.

02:08:07,490 --> 02:08:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  Which.

02:08:08,706 --> 02:08:09,822
SPEAKER_0:  Not everyone does that.

02:08:10,402 --> 02:08:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  You know, if you look other.

02:08:12,258 --> 02:08:15,326
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not going to name, but you know, other main schools.

02:08:15,554 --> 02:08:17,310
SPEAKER_0:  when like very strong competitors.

02:08:17,826 --> 02:08:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  Great comparatives.

02:08:19,362 --> 02:08:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  Super tough people.

02:08:21,090 --> 02:08:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  was super tough.

02:08:22,978 --> 02:08:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  Not great.

02:08:24,290 --> 02:08:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  because they train.

02:08:25,762 --> 02:08:26,814
SPEAKER_0:  They spar very hard.

02:08:27,266 --> 02:08:27,998
SPEAKER_0:  that makes them tough.

02:08:29,122 --> 02:08:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  If you want to be good, you have to work on your weakness.

02:08:32,226 --> 02:08:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  because...

02:08:33,634 --> 02:08:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  when you're spa, like we're saying, how many times you're gonna...

02:08:37,666 --> 02:08:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  practice.

02:08:39,266 --> 02:08:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  escape in a bad position, like a submission hold or a pinning position, side control, mount or...

02:08:45,218 --> 02:08:46,526
SPEAKER_0:  is very little the amount.

02:08:47,234 --> 02:08:48,382
SPEAKER_0:  you get to spend.

02:08:48,738 --> 02:08:50,814
SPEAKER_0:  on those positions if you don't start there.

02:08:52,194 --> 02:08:52,990
SPEAKER_0:  So that.

02:08:53,922 --> 02:08:55,358
SPEAKER_0:  He's very smart the way he trains.

02:08:55,586 --> 02:08:59,582
SPEAKER_1:  And part of that is also cerebral. It's not just putting yourself in those positions, but...

02:08:59,970 --> 02:09:01,662
SPEAKER_1:  talking through different ideas.

02:09:02,434 --> 02:09:03,710
SPEAKER_1:  Like they talk.

02:09:04,930 --> 02:09:06,142
SPEAKER_1:  They like experiment.

02:09:07,202 --> 02:09:08,126
SPEAKER_1:  It's very like.

02:09:08,770 --> 02:09:11,742
SPEAKER_1:  At first glance, it's like philosophical almost.

02:09:12,418 --> 02:09:17,182
SPEAKER_1:  You're trying to create systems constantly, you're trying to understand how this fits into this big picture.

02:09:17,474 --> 02:09:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  N

02:09:18,562 --> 02:09:19,966
SPEAKER_0:  and then it goes back to...

02:09:20,546 --> 02:09:22,334
SPEAKER_0:  What is jiu-jitsu? What is fighting?

02:09:23,074 --> 02:09:24,286
SPEAKER_0:  is fighting for dominance.

02:09:24,642 --> 02:09:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  you know, is fighting for their ultimate dominance positions, which is Beckham out.

02:09:29,442 --> 02:09:31,358
SPEAKER_0:  there's no others and from that you finish.

02:09:31,874 --> 02:09:33,214
SPEAKER_0:  So if you look back at his.

02:09:33,762 --> 02:09:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  And over the years, do you know of his past fights?

02:09:37,218 --> 02:09:39,550
SPEAKER_0:  before he used to mainly focus in legs.

02:09:40,258 --> 02:09:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  And over the past few years, now he's mainly focusing in.

02:09:45,186 --> 02:09:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  finishing from the mountain back.

02:09:47,426 --> 02:09:48,958
SPEAKER_0:  That's when he became really good.

02:09:50,818 --> 02:09:52,606
SPEAKER_1:  So part of that is...

02:09:52,994 --> 02:09:54,814
SPEAKER_1:  Mr. John Donahue, what do you think?

02:09:55,170 --> 02:09:58,526
SPEAKER_1:  You've, you've, you've known John for a long time. What makes that guy?

02:09:59,170 --> 02:10:00,446
SPEAKER_1:  interesting

02:10:00,866 --> 02:10:05,278
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, special and good. What have you learned about Jiu-Jitsu in life from John Donovan?

02:10:06,178 --> 02:10:07,326
SPEAKER_0:  He's super smart.

02:10:08,386 --> 02:10:09,374
SPEAKER_0:  I'm inocentric.

02:10:09,826 --> 02:10:10,846
SPEAKER_0:  and he leaves.

02:10:11,778 --> 02:10:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  through Jujitsu, he's 24-7 thinking.

02:10:15,138 --> 02:10:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  better ways to teach.

02:10:17,026 --> 02:10:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  how to make this.

02:10:18,274 --> 02:10:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  competitors better.

02:10:19,906 --> 02:10:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  And that as a coach, when you have that dedication as a coach, that it makes.

02:10:24,450 --> 02:10:26,174
SPEAKER_0:  the most difference of your athletes like.

02:10:26,818 --> 02:10:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  which other big team you have.

02:10:28,418 --> 02:10:29,918
SPEAKER_0:  that coach with that motivation.

02:10:30,914 --> 02:10:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  Audio adapter

02:10:32,706 --> 02:10:36,766
SPEAKER_0:  schools is either someone that competes that push the training like Andrey Goval.

02:10:37,602 --> 02:10:39,710
SPEAKER_0:  He's one of the competitors.

02:10:40,002 --> 02:10:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  brings the hype in everyone else, but he doesn't have.

02:10:43,362 --> 02:10:49,470
SPEAKER_0:  the time, he doesn't spend the time working individually. I mean, I'm sure he does, but it's limited because he's also a competitor.

02:10:50,690 --> 02:10:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  and you know looking.

02:10:52,738 --> 02:10:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  most of the other big schools like.

02:10:56,002 --> 02:10:57,886
SPEAKER_0:  You don't have that nowadays.

02:10:58,242 --> 02:11:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  All the leaders, the main coaches for the other big schools, they have other things, other...

02:11:03,298 --> 02:11:06,558
SPEAKER_0:  in their lives. They don't fully dedicate it to the athletes.

02:11:06,946 --> 02:11:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  John Duss.

02:11:08,322 --> 02:11:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

02:11:09,154 --> 02:11:10,750
SPEAKER_0:  look at the interview he spends.

02:11:11,266 --> 02:11:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  hours and hours a day.

02:11:12,994 --> 02:11:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  studying.

02:11:14,338 --> 02:11:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  How can I wait the system?

02:11:16,834 --> 02:11:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  you know, to make his athletes better.

02:11:19,586 --> 02:11:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  look at the results.

02:11:21,378 --> 02:11:22,334
SPEAKER_1:  I enjoy.

02:11:22,658 --> 02:11:25,214
SPEAKER_1:  is just sending back and forth. You can actually just get him.

02:11:25,858 --> 02:11:30,014
SPEAKER_1:  You control him essentially by sending interesting videos and you could just see his mind.

02:11:31,362 --> 02:11:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  He's going to do research on that. Cause I kept sending him videos of bears cause he claimed.

02:11:36,706 --> 02:11:38,270
SPEAKER_1:  that a lion

02:11:38,690 --> 02:11:39,678
SPEAKER_1:  would beat a bear.

02:11:40,290 --> 02:11:41,054
SPEAKER_1:  Because...

02:11:42,082 --> 02:11:45,662
SPEAKER_1:  I'd love to get your take on this. Okay. So the bear is much bigger.

02:11:46,178 --> 02:11:47,166
SPEAKER_1:  much stronger.

02:11:48,546 --> 02:11:49,886
SPEAKER_1:  But his take is...

02:11:50,114 --> 02:11:55,710
SPEAKER_1:  that the bears don't have experience of fighting to the death. That's not part of the culture, they're more scared.

02:11:55,970 --> 02:11:58,014
SPEAKER_1:  In fact, he keeps sending me footage.

02:11:58,370 --> 02:12:01,566
SPEAKER_1:  of like even like a small mountain lion scaring a bear away.

02:12:02,082 --> 02:12:03,870
SPEAKER_1:  because they don't want to fight.

02:12:04,706 --> 02:12:05,118
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

02:12:06,370 --> 02:12:12,638
SPEAKER_1:  So his idea is that it really matters your life experience, how much you fight, it's not necessarily the skill.

02:12:13,122 --> 02:12:16,222
SPEAKER_1:  like the dimensions, the characteristics you have.

02:12:17,378 --> 02:12:19,262
SPEAKER_1:  But then I send them, I'll show you.

02:12:20,002 --> 02:12:21,214
SPEAKER_1:  Uh uh Uh uh uh uh

02:12:22,978 --> 02:12:23,518
SPEAKER_1:  People should.

02:12:23,970 --> 02:12:24,542
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:12:25,026 --> 02:12:28,606
SPEAKER_1:  Google this, it's bears fighting of any kind.

02:12:29,250 --> 02:12:31,550
SPEAKER_1:  is pretty much the most epic thing ever.

02:12:32,770 --> 02:12:33,502
SPEAKER_1:  Here, I'll show you.

02:12:34,562 --> 02:12:36,894
SPEAKER_1:  Like look at these guys. The cardio though is interesting.

02:12:37,058 --> 02:12:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it's funny, I was going to mention that because I was...

02:12:40,194 --> 02:12:42,238
SPEAKER_0:  you know, flipping to the internet. I've Kim.

02:12:43,298 --> 02:12:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  I came.

02:12:44,738 --> 02:12:45,630
SPEAKER_0:  around that video.

02:12:45,922 --> 02:12:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  Look how big these guys are. They're not very rich but they don't buy each other.

02:12:50,530 --> 02:12:53,982
SPEAKER_0:  You think it's just play? They try to, no intimidating, because they don't want to get hurt.

02:12:54,690 --> 02:12:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  So they try to size each other up.

02:12:56,738 --> 02:12:59,230
SPEAKER_0:  You know, they've, you see the whole fighting.

02:12:59,810 --> 02:13:02,750
SPEAKER_0:  is sizing each other up. There's a lot of pushing.

02:13:03,202 --> 02:13:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  And the fur is so thick, so the cloth doesn't really damage much.

02:13:08,226 --> 02:13:08,670
SPEAKER_0:  END

02:13:08,802 --> 02:13:11,427
SPEAKER_1:  They're using the tree so maybe they, yeah.

02:13:11,427 --> 02:13:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, there is bites, but see...

02:13:14,434 --> 02:13:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  Bare little.

02:13:16,546 --> 02:13:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  So the whole time they're trying to.

02:13:19,778 --> 02:13:21,246
SPEAKER_0:  intimidate the other one like

02:13:21,954 --> 02:13:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  Winning the fight.

02:13:23,522 --> 02:13:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  by this size.

02:13:26,914 --> 02:13:28,446
SPEAKER_1:  and mostly about

02:13:29,122 --> 02:13:29,854
SPEAKER_1:  Like the way...

02:13:30,146 --> 02:13:35,134
SPEAKER_1:  drunk college kids fight, which is like some kind of display of dominance versus actual.

02:13:35,234 --> 02:13:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, they're not fighting.

02:13:36,866 --> 02:13:37,342
SPEAKER_0:  to kill.

02:13:38,754 --> 02:13:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  and.

02:13:39,458 --> 02:13:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  bear or tiger, they fight.

02:13:42,242 --> 02:13:45,438
SPEAKER_0:  to finish unless the other one runs away like the one who died.

02:13:46,402 --> 02:13:48,638
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, lines and tugs.

02:13:48,866 --> 02:13:49,374
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

02:13:49,794 --> 02:13:52,894
SPEAKER_1:  But look at the cardio, look how bad their cardio is. I wonder how.

02:13:54,050 --> 02:14:00,007
SPEAKER_1:  My favorite part is when one of them just like stands behind a tree. It says, alright.

02:14:00,007 --> 02:14:01,758
SPEAKER_0:  Hold it. Peace

02:14:03,266 --> 02:14:08,141
SPEAKER_0:  Let me catch my breath here. He's just down.

02:14:08,141 --> 02:14:09,641
SPEAKER_1:  It's like, all right, you can't.

02:14:09,641 --> 02:14:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  so

02:14:11,458 --> 02:14:17,709
SPEAKER_1:  It's like, it's the equivalent in the forest, tapping out, all right, all right, you got me.

02:14:17,709 --> 02:14:19,209
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, yeah.

02:14:19,209 --> 02:14:23,486
SPEAKER_1:  Look, they're both just shot.

02:14:24,066 --> 02:14:24,478
SPEAKER_1: ção slaves

02:14:25,538 --> 02:14:36,958
SPEAKER_1:  But see, the thing is that I was trying to make an argument for is that we get this rare footage. It's not rare. I mean, there's like hundreds of videos, but it's not millions of videos because there's a huge number of bears.

02:14:37,346 --> 02:14:40,190
SPEAKER_1:  I was trying to say that there's some badass bear we don't know about.

02:14:41,346 --> 02:14:42,782
SPEAKER_1:  Cause he just goes in there.

02:14:43,458 --> 02:14:44,766
SPEAKER_1:  It just does work.

02:14:46,050 --> 02:14:48,126
SPEAKER_1:  And we just don't know about it, cause he's...

02:14:48,962 --> 02:14:52,030
SPEAKER_1:  Like, see, the thing is, if you kill a lot of other animals...

02:14:52,386 --> 02:14:56,862
SPEAKER_1:  You probably have a territory that nobody's going to mess with you. So it's very hard to catch the, uh,

02:14:57,634 --> 02:14:58,398
SPEAKER_1:  DUMB

02:14:59,906 --> 02:15:00,254
SPEAKER_1:  like.

02:15:00,578 --> 02:15:03,326
SPEAKER_1:  The Hodge Gracie of bears, you know?

02:15:03,650 --> 02:15:07,262
SPEAKER_1:  He's just going to be sitting there doing nothing. So I don't know.

02:15:07,682 --> 02:15:08,798
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know, I feel like...

02:15:09,666 --> 02:15:19,198
SPEAKER_1:  Of course, when you corner him, John will say that if you put a bear and a lion in a cage, the bear will win if it's like, if they're forced to be to the death.

02:15:20,034 --> 02:15:20,414
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know.

02:15:20,706 --> 02:15:23,902
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, let me ask you another ridiculous thing before I ask you serious questions.

02:15:24,322 --> 02:15:27,230
SPEAKER_1:  So Joe Rogan thinks that

02:15:27,458 --> 02:15:28,254
SPEAKER_1:  A tie.

02:15:29,250 --> 02:15:29,822
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:15:30,882 --> 02:15:32,702
SPEAKER_1:  is an effective way to attack somebody.

02:15:33,058 --> 02:15:35,102
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if... I can't believe I haven't...

02:15:35,778 --> 02:15:37,918
SPEAKER_1:  In the time in Vegas, I didn't talk to you about this.

02:15:38,210 --> 02:15:42,942
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's not. Have you ever explored this as the best choker in the world?

02:15:43,458 --> 02:15:45,790
SPEAKER_1:  Have you ever explored the use? Gzeeouyck.

02:15:46,562 --> 02:15:47,742
SPEAKER_1:  Jujitsu has the jacket.

02:15:48,418 --> 02:15:49,374
SPEAKER_1:  But the tie.

02:15:50,466 --> 02:15:52,414
SPEAKER_1:  to me is a pretty shitty.

02:15:52,674 --> 02:15:57,822
SPEAKER_1:  way to choke somebody. Like intuitively it thinks like it's a good way, but it can slide around.

02:15:58,338 --> 02:15:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  It feels like...

02:15:59,714 --> 02:16:01,214
SPEAKER_1:  It feels like there's no...

02:16:01,794 --> 02:16:03,550
SPEAKER_1:  There's no way to really pin

02:16:03,906 --> 02:16:04,670
SPEAKER_1:  You need to.

02:16:05,346 --> 02:16:07,038
SPEAKER_1:  Right, so you use it the way you use a belt.

02:16:07,170 --> 02:16:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. Sense.

02:16:09,186 --> 02:16:10,750
SPEAKER_0:  But then I would guess so.

02:16:10,946 --> 02:16:11,326
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

02:16:12,322 --> 02:16:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  I don't think it's...

02:16:13,762 --> 02:16:15,934
SPEAKER_1:  And I think if it gives you...

02:16:16,354 --> 02:16:18,750
SPEAKER_1:  It actually has the reverse effect, which it gives you the...

02:16:19,746 --> 02:16:21,854
SPEAKER_1:  false sense of confidence that you can use it.

02:16:22,690 --> 02:16:24,254
SPEAKER_1:  and instead you'll just distract you.

02:16:24,514 --> 02:16:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  So he think is a stronger weight than the color.

02:16:27,458 --> 02:16:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  Or just a stronger. Stronger than the collar. The collar, yeah.

02:16:30,850 --> 02:16:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  I don't see how.

02:16:32,322 --> 02:16:33,447
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe just like.

02:16:33,447 --> 02:16:35,870
SPEAKER_1:  in a street fight scenario, right? like, umm...

02:16:36,450 --> 02:16:39,825
SPEAKER_0:  by the time you grab the tie, the guy goes punch your nose. Yeah.

02:16:39,825 --> 02:16:40,318
SPEAKER_1:  What?

02:16:40,546 --> 02:16:41,022
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

02:16:41,346 --> 02:16:46,110
SPEAKER_1:  what George St. Pierre thinks is the best use of the ties to actually like a...

02:16:46,882 --> 02:16:47,614
SPEAKER_1:  What do you call that?

02:16:48,290 --> 02:16:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  So basically to off balance them.

02:16:51,234 --> 02:16:52,359
SPEAKER_1:  Which is an interesting point, like...

02:16:52,359 --> 02:16:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, that can be used too.

02:16:54,978 --> 02:16:56,862
SPEAKER_1:  Well, you could use the jacket for the same kind of thing.

02:16:57,698 --> 02:17:00,277
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I don't know. I haven't really fully tested it.

02:17:00,277 --> 02:17:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  I'll say Jacket or tie for that perspective of balancing the person.

02:17:05,634 --> 02:17:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  It can be.

02:17:06,978 --> 02:17:09,022
SPEAKER_0:  because you have control of the person's neck.

02:17:09,378 --> 02:17:11,518
SPEAKER_0:  the collar, you know, the jacket moves.

02:17:12,002 --> 02:17:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  So, 4.

02:17:12,994 --> 02:17:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  The purpose of off-balancing the person, I would agree with George.

02:17:16,898 --> 02:17:17,726
SPEAKER_1:  See, the thing is...

02:17:18,082 --> 02:17:21,214
SPEAKER_1:  But that's the thing about martial arts, is you can say all kinds of bullshit.

02:17:22,434 --> 02:17:23,806
SPEAKER_1:  but until you really test it.

02:17:24,610 --> 02:17:25,470
SPEAKER_1:  in a

02:17:25,986 --> 02:17:28,702
SPEAKER_1:  over a period of years, the competition you won't really know.

02:17:28,994 --> 02:17:31,550
SPEAKER_1:  I think like that's where my gut says.

02:17:32,930 --> 02:17:34,782
SPEAKER_1:  Just how easily the time moves.

02:17:36,066 --> 02:17:42,174
SPEAKER_1:  My gut says the collar. There is something really powerful about the jacket. There's like the way it sits.

02:17:42,882 --> 02:17:45,406
SPEAKER_1:  I mean the fact that the arms trap it from rotating.

02:17:46,498 --> 02:17:48,190
SPEAKER_1:  Like it's a weird piece of clothing.

02:17:48,482 --> 02:17:51,582
SPEAKER_1:  It's a really dangerous piece of clothing that we put on ourselves. KC FREEBY

02:17:52,066 --> 02:17:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  Hehehe

02:17:52,674 --> 02:17:53,022
SPEAKER_1:  Like.

02:17:53,378 --> 02:17:57,438
SPEAKER_1:  And it's kind of cool that we've developed this whole martial arts system that allows you to use that to

02:17:57,986 --> 02:17:59,070
SPEAKER_1:  to do a lot of damage.

02:17:59,362 --> 02:17:59,934
SPEAKER_1:  So interesting.

02:18:00,642 --> 02:18:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  So when we're saying something that you develop over the years or practice over and over again.

02:18:05,474 --> 02:18:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  Going back to...

02:18:06,978 --> 02:18:08,574
SPEAKER_0:  the fissions of the manto back.

02:18:09,154 --> 02:18:10,206
SPEAKER_0:  by experience.

02:18:10,466 --> 02:18:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  of attacking people.

02:18:12,834 --> 02:18:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  They-

02:18:13,858 --> 02:18:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  people always had a much higher.

02:18:16,322 --> 02:18:17,438
SPEAKER_0:  chance of scaping.

02:18:18,050 --> 02:18:19,582
SPEAKER_0:  the back then for my mount.

02:18:21,314 --> 02:18:21,630
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:18:21,858 --> 02:18:25,310
SPEAKER_0:  It's, I feel if I mount and you get both my hands on your neck.

02:18:25,858 --> 02:18:27,998
SPEAKER_0:  You cannot escape. If my hands are deep.

02:18:28,706 --> 02:18:29,182
SPEAKER_0:  It's over.

02:18:29,986 --> 02:18:30,366
SPEAKER_0:  that.

02:18:30,818 --> 02:18:32,286
SPEAKER_0:  I don't remember anyone escaping.

02:18:33,026 --> 02:18:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  But I do remember if my hands are deep on you.

02:18:35,458 --> 02:18:35,934
SPEAKER_0:  color.

02:18:36,482 --> 02:18:39,857
SPEAKER_0:  or even real naked joke is still a hassle. like see ya

02:18:39,857 --> 02:18:40,382
SPEAKER_1:  clean.

02:18:40,610 --> 02:18:43,870
SPEAKER_1:  You have some data on this. Is there some aspect?

02:18:44,386 --> 02:18:50,334
SPEAKER_1:  to how your body is, the characteristics of your body that fits a particular set of techniques.

02:18:50,946 --> 02:18:52,734
SPEAKER_1:  So if we just look at your jitsu broadly.

02:18:54,050 --> 02:18:57,854
SPEAKER_1:  Do you see most techniques being able to work for most people?

02:18:58,402 --> 02:18:58,910
SPEAKER_1:  Like, um...

02:18:59,234 --> 02:19:04,510
SPEAKER_1:  What you're saying about mount versus back control, is this, is it possible for a different body type the mount is not as effective?

02:19:05,602 --> 02:19:06,622
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, of course.

02:19:08,066 --> 02:19:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  I'll see you very big people.

02:19:09,794 --> 02:19:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  They should amount.

02:19:11,362 --> 02:19:12,766
SPEAKER_0:  You don't think of yourself as big.

02:19:13,474 --> 02:19:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  Not big, I mean.

02:19:14,658 --> 02:19:15,390
SPEAKER_0:  Oh

02:19:16,578 --> 02:19:17,886
SPEAKER_0:  they should stay off the mount.

02:19:18,434 --> 02:19:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  Why is that? That's a car I treat. Mobility. It's like, I think you don't see any.

02:19:24,418 --> 02:19:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  You know, like there was a few weights, like 160 kilos, like, you know, two pounds.

02:19:29,218 --> 02:19:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, 270 pounds of a lot of fat.

02:19:33,570 --> 02:19:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  It's.

02:19:34,466 --> 02:19:36,094
SPEAKER_0:  You need a bit of mobility.

02:19:36,770 --> 02:19:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  And.

02:19:37,666 --> 02:19:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  that wouldn't.

02:19:38,594 --> 02:19:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  you will play against you, even back.

02:19:41,442 --> 02:19:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  A great moment same.

02:19:42,818 --> 02:19:44,126
SPEAKER_1:  requires mobility.

02:19:45,474 --> 02:19:48,478
SPEAKER_1:  So even though it doesn't look like you're moving very much when you're doing molly.

02:19:48,802 --> 02:19:50,014
SPEAKER_1:  that requires mobility.

02:19:50,466 --> 02:19:52,341
SPEAKER_1:  because you have to reposition and weight.

02:19:52,341 --> 02:19:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  Constantly adjusting your body.

02:19:54,850 --> 02:19:55,230
SPEAKER_1:  Alright.

02:19:55,554 --> 02:20:00,958
SPEAKER_1:  The legend goes, you got very good by training mostly with lower ranks. What was your training like?

02:20:03,650 --> 02:20:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  So when I first moved to London...

02:20:05,986 --> 02:20:07,102
SPEAKER_0:  I was 20 years old.

02:20:08,674 --> 02:20:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  I opened my school there.

02:20:11,522 --> 02:20:13,150
SPEAKER_0:  and I had nobody to train with.

02:20:14,178 --> 02:20:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  I had one guy that was.

02:20:16,386 --> 02:20:17,758
SPEAKER_0:  teaching with me a black belt.

02:20:18,210 --> 02:20:18,750
SPEAKER_0:  Me to wait.

02:20:19,842 --> 02:20:20,286
SPEAKER_0:  It was.

02:20:20,802 --> 02:20:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  Good.

02:20:23,458 --> 02:20:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  and that's it. Brawler was removed to the same.

02:20:26,562 --> 02:20:28,958
SPEAKER_0:  to move to England the same time as I did.

02:20:29,634 --> 02:20:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  But he was in Birmingham.

02:20:31,266 --> 02:20:32,894
SPEAKER_0:  So we did got together.

02:20:33,186 --> 02:20:34,430
SPEAKER_0:  you know, maybe twice a week.

02:20:34,786 --> 02:20:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  closer when we were preparing for something.

02:20:37,602 --> 02:20:39,678
SPEAKER_0:  If not, then not very often.

02:20:40,322 --> 02:20:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  as often as we could, but let's say not.

02:20:43,010 --> 02:20:43,614
SPEAKER_0:  that often.

02:20:44,418 --> 02:20:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  And I had just...

02:20:46,210 --> 02:20:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  There was no one high level, there was no one world champion in any belt to train.

02:20:52,162 --> 02:20:52,670
SPEAKER_0:  then.

02:20:53,218 --> 02:20:53,950
SPEAKER_0:  Any two.

02:20:54,370 --> 02:20:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  create a scenario.

02:20:56,130 --> 02:20:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  that simulates, that can simulate.

02:20:58,850 --> 02:21:00,382
SPEAKER_0:  you know, like a realistic.

02:21:01,506 --> 02:21:01,822
SPEAKER_0:  fighting.

02:21:02,530 --> 02:21:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  So I think on that aspect.

02:21:04,802 --> 02:21:05,822
SPEAKER_0:  You know, when people...

02:21:06,402 --> 02:21:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  set.

02:21:07,042 --> 02:21:08,254
SPEAKER_0:  You know, people ask.

02:21:08,962 --> 02:21:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  While I have such a basic aim, I think that also influences.

02:21:12,354 --> 02:21:15,518
SPEAKER_0:  me sharpen up all my skills when I move there because

02:21:16,546 --> 02:21:18,782
SPEAKER_0:  You know, when I'm, when you practice with people.

02:21:19,618 --> 02:21:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  lower level than you, you cannot.

02:21:23,010 --> 02:21:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  There's nothing to learn.

02:21:25,538 --> 02:21:25,950
SPEAKER_0:  them.

02:21:26,594 --> 02:21:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  or you can learn things in practice with them, but outside.

02:21:30,306 --> 02:21:33,470
SPEAKER_0:  very complex things on them. It is not the best.

02:21:34,594 --> 02:21:40,318
SPEAKER_0:  I sharpen up all my skills. So that's when I really improved everything that I already knew.

02:21:40,866 --> 02:21:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  way higher level.

02:21:42,114 --> 02:21:45,182
SPEAKER_1:  But how can you sharpen something if the resistance is much...

02:21:45,538 --> 02:21:46,663
SPEAKER_1:  lower level than A.

02:21:46,663 --> 02:21:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  A purple belt can make it very hard for you to skip side control. Doesn't have to be a world champion black belt.

02:21:52,642 --> 02:21:53,950
SPEAKER_0:  It's, you know, a fizz.

02:21:54,178 --> 02:21:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  when he's holding you, it can be very hard.

02:21:56,610 --> 02:21:59,230
SPEAKER_1:  What about on the attack? How do you become?

02:21:59,938 --> 02:22:03,518
SPEAKER_1:  literally by far the best person at the cross choke from mouth.

02:22:03,938 --> 02:22:05,246
SPEAKER_1:  by training with purple belts.

02:22:07,138 --> 02:22:09,630
SPEAKER_0:  sometimes football belts defense way better than black belts.

02:22:10,242 --> 02:22:16,510
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, see a lot of people listening to that would be like, that makes no sense, Hodger Gracie. How does that make any sense?

02:22:16,802 --> 02:22:17,406
SPEAKER_0:  because...

02:22:17,634 --> 02:22:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  Like a lot of the black belts, even world champions, they get to the black belt, they're really good.

02:22:22,210 --> 02:22:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  in what they do, let's say in the guard.

02:22:25,026 --> 02:22:28,670
SPEAKER_0:  you know, on top or in the bottom position, but their defense are not.

02:22:29,442 --> 02:22:31,166
SPEAKER_0:  I have very, very few people.

02:22:31,618 --> 02:22:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  high level.

02:22:32,578 --> 02:22:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  Have a very good difference.

02:22:34,114 --> 02:22:35,294
SPEAKER_0:  because you don't practice.

02:22:35,618 --> 02:22:37,854
SPEAKER_0:  Then that goes back to how you train.

02:22:38,434 --> 02:22:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  You can be very tough, very tough will make you terrible defense.

02:22:42,914 --> 02:22:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  because you're not going to practice your weakness.

02:22:45,410 --> 02:22:46,750
SPEAKER_0:  So your weakness is still going to be...

02:22:46,978 --> 02:22:47,358
SPEAKER_0:  Terrible.

02:22:47,746 --> 02:22:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  You can have the best guard in the world. Impossible to pass.

02:22:51,234 --> 02:22:53,278
SPEAKER_0:  The day people pass your guard, you do nothing.

02:22:54,050 --> 02:22:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  like

02:22:55,042 --> 02:22:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  It's your, your God is.

02:22:57,026 --> 02:22:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  High the highest level.

02:22:58,722 --> 02:23:00,542
SPEAKER_0:  but your side control difference or not.

02:23:00,866 --> 02:23:03,070
SPEAKER_0:  your mount difference or not so some

02:23:03,490 --> 02:23:04,286
SPEAKER_0:  Purple bells.

02:23:04,962 --> 02:23:11,925
SPEAKER_0:  they practice the mount way more than the black belt did. So naturally the difference is better.

02:23:11,925 --> 02:23:18,622
SPEAKER_1:  they get to experience the defensive position much, much, much more. And especially training with you, they get really good at defending.

02:23:19,202 --> 02:23:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  And then over and over again, you attack them with the same thing over and over again. They know what's coming. They will block.

02:23:24,386 --> 02:23:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  They will develop a defense over that.

02:23:27,586 --> 02:23:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  Way better than...

02:23:28,802 --> 02:23:30,910
SPEAKER_0:  most other high-level blackbirds.

02:23:31,010 --> 02:23:34,398
SPEAKER_1:  So both put yourself into really bad positions low ranks

02:23:34,658 --> 02:23:37,694
SPEAKER_1:  And just keep attacking the same way over and over and over.

02:23:38,978 --> 02:23:39,550
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

02:23:40,322 --> 02:23:42,750
SPEAKER_1:  And with that, you're able to be at the.

02:23:42,978 --> 02:23:43,870
SPEAKER_1:  top of the world.

02:23:44,386 --> 02:23:45,662
SPEAKER_1:  at the World Championships.

02:23:47,234 --> 02:23:48,190
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, can you give some?

02:23:48,546 --> 02:23:53,534
SPEAKER_1:  What was the preparation like to a world championship with lower ranks? I mean, um,

02:23:53,986 --> 02:23:57,246
SPEAKER_0:  I did a lot of boxing, a lot of conditioning.

02:23:57,666 --> 02:24:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  No, but the conditioning is a big part of it. But the one thing that helped me.

02:24:01,474 --> 02:24:02,366
SPEAKER_0:  extremely

02:24:02,914 --> 02:24:03,870
SPEAKER_0:  Living in England.

02:24:04,162 --> 02:24:04,702
SPEAKER_0:  in London.

02:24:05,282 --> 02:24:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  was 20 judo.

02:24:06,818 --> 02:24:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  I had a burrow coin in London.

02:24:08,738 --> 02:24:10,494
SPEAKER_0:  that helped me massively because

02:24:11,042 --> 02:24:14,142
SPEAKER_0:  It gave me the motivation to learn something new.

02:24:14,722 --> 02:24:16,702
SPEAKER_0:  because you know...

02:24:16,994 --> 02:24:19,326
SPEAKER_0:  by then I'd be broke why I didn't understand the post.

02:24:19,906 --> 02:24:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  I'm sure today it is too.

02:24:22,082 --> 02:24:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  but by then was even higher than it is today.

02:24:24,674 --> 02:24:27,166
SPEAKER_0:  Like there was some very high level judo guys.

02:24:27,394 --> 02:24:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  training there.

02:24:28,546 --> 02:24:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:24:29,890 --> 02:24:32,862
SPEAKER_0:  The first time I went there, my stand-up was terrible.

02:24:33,570 --> 02:24:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  compared to this.

02:24:34,978 --> 02:24:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  I mean it was bad but compared to today it was terrible.

02:24:38,210 --> 02:24:39,646
SPEAKER_0:  So getting through like a child.

02:24:41,218 --> 02:24:45,854
SPEAKER_0:  And that motivated me to keep coming back and get better.

02:24:46,850 --> 02:24:48,958
SPEAKER_0:  So that made my Jiu Jitsu much stronger.

02:24:49,730 --> 02:24:53,150
SPEAKER_0:  I became, my base got better, my top game improved.

02:24:54,050 --> 02:24:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  My pressure game improved.

02:24:56,642 --> 02:24:58,517
SPEAKER_1:  Did, uh, does Neil Adams train?

02:24:58,517 --> 02:25:02,267
SPEAKER_0:  Ray Stevens.

02:25:02,267 --> 02:25:08,267
SPEAKER_1:  Have you met Neolatos? He's the voice of Judah. I don't know if you watched the tournaments, he's incredible.

02:25:08,267 --> 02:25:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  Ray Stevenson, she's the-

02:25:10,050 --> 02:25:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  He was a silver medalist in the Olympics. He won the European. He won a lot.

02:25:14,818 --> 02:25:18,193
SPEAKER_1:  So you did some judo training. What's your favorite throw? Like a Soto, like you don't-

02:25:18,193 --> 02:25:19,693
SPEAKER_0:  I hope it kills you. That people are millimeter.

02:25:19,693 --> 02:25:20,254
SPEAKER_1:  I'll pick one.

02:25:20,674 --> 02:25:22,622
SPEAKER_1:  So that made you better at Jiu Jitsu as well.

02:25:24,674 --> 02:25:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  And back then...

02:25:26,882 --> 02:25:29,118
SPEAKER_0:  like for the first, I'll say maybe three years.

02:25:29,762 --> 02:25:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe four.

02:25:31,170 --> 02:25:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  I went to Brazil for like two months before.

02:25:33,890 --> 02:25:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  every major time.

02:25:35,266 --> 02:25:39,230
SPEAKER_0:  So I moved away from the school and I really focused.

02:25:39,842 --> 02:25:43,710
SPEAKER_0:  really well prepared with my jewelry and everything else, shopping up my skills and then

02:25:44,354 --> 02:25:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  when going to Brazil to train with like really high level people.

02:25:48,770 --> 02:25:49,086
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:25:49,730 --> 02:25:51,230
SPEAKER_0:  That way I would manage it too.

02:25:51,490 --> 02:25:52,446
SPEAKER_0:  competing the highest level.

02:25:53,122 --> 02:25:56,862
SPEAKER_1:  What advice would you give to, let's start with a complete beginner.

02:25:58,114 --> 02:25:59,358
SPEAKER_1:  So.

02:25:59,714 --> 02:26:03,998
SPEAKER_1:  You know, a bunch of people come up to me, they still wanna start doing jujitsu. What advice would you?

02:26:04,770 --> 02:26:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  Give them.

02:26:07,234 --> 02:26:10,494
SPEAKER_0:  Try to absorb as much technique as you can and try to...

02:26:10,722 --> 02:26:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  Be as relaxed as you can.

02:26:13,218 --> 02:26:13,630
SPEAKER_0:  Don't.

02:26:15,010 --> 02:26:16,926
SPEAKER_0:  you know, don't desperately try to

02:26:18,210 --> 02:26:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  fight so hard.

02:26:20,802 --> 02:26:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  like learn.

02:26:22,306 --> 02:26:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  and move slow.

02:26:24,866 --> 02:26:27,678
SPEAKER_0:  Move slow and relax. That's the hardest thing to do.

02:26:28,866 --> 02:26:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  You heard us.

02:26:30,338 --> 02:26:33,406
SPEAKER_1:  You know what I find with people, it seems like...

02:26:33,954 --> 02:26:36,350
SPEAKER_1:  It's hard to even know that you're not relaxed.

02:26:36,610 --> 02:26:38,686
SPEAKER_1:  It's like the introspection.

02:26:39,810 --> 02:26:42,206
SPEAKER_1:  They don't even know what it feels like to relax.

02:26:42,530 --> 02:26:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  Not even no date sense.

02:26:44,066 --> 02:26:52,411
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, right. They try to relax you, look at you, say, what? What do you mean, relax? I'm relaxed. Exactly. The eyes are shaking. Oh, my!

02:26:52,411 --> 02:26:53,054
SPEAKER_1:  You feel it.

02:26:53,474 --> 02:26:57,438
SPEAKER_1:  And in terms of going slow, they're like, yeah, I am going slow. No, you're not.

02:26:58,018 --> 02:26:59,358
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, yeah, there's, there's a-

02:26:59,906 --> 02:27:02,014
SPEAKER_1:  There's a grace and elegance of movement.

02:27:02,370 --> 02:27:04,318
SPEAKER_1:  that you can probably pick up from a lot of other

02:27:04,930 --> 02:27:05,534
SPEAKER_1:  disciplines.

02:27:06,050 --> 02:27:10,430
SPEAKER_1:  I like, for me, I think that came from just learning piano at a young age. This for, um...

02:27:10,978 --> 02:27:13,118
SPEAKER_1:  I think any mobility thing.

02:27:13,474 --> 02:27:16,830
SPEAKER_1:  to learn how to move efficiently, you have to know how to relax.

02:27:17,090 --> 02:27:18,494
SPEAKER_1:  It's just the fact that you can.

02:27:19,874 --> 02:27:21,886
SPEAKER_1:  body can be tense, so it could be relaxed.

02:27:22,210 --> 02:27:23,335
SPEAKER_1:  Just knowing that fact.

02:27:23,335 --> 02:27:29,525
SPEAKER_0:  Now imagine you show the stents, just think you play piano well. No, everything has to be relaxed.

02:27:29,525 --> 02:27:31,358
SPEAKER_1:  I guess some of that is mined too.

02:27:31,650 --> 02:27:33,086
SPEAKER_1:  but just knowing that and being

02:27:33,410 --> 02:27:35,070
SPEAKER_1:  software and you but see like

02:27:35,682 --> 02:27:37,118
SPEAKER_1:  Even me.

02:27:38,722 --> 02:27:40,158
SPEAKER_1:  you know, approaching a thing I'm not.

02:27:41,026 --> 02:27:42,078
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know anything about.

02:27:42,658 --> 02:27:44,542
SPEAKER_1:  being a beginner, you're going to tense up.

02:27:44,834 --> 02:27:48,510
SPEAKER_1:  And it actually takes a conscious effort to think to relax.

02:27:48,834 --> 02:27:51,454
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, that's... Massively. While learning things.

02:27:51,938 --> 02:27:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  As an adult, he's much harder than as a child. Like, he's very hard.

02:27:55,746 --> 02:27:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  and as an adult.

02:27:57,762 --> 02:28:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  It's like to get to the highest level, it's not possible.

02:28:01,346 --> 02:28:02,750
SPEAKER_0:  because you will never relax.

02:28:03,426 --> 02:28:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  the way you should.

02:28:05,442 --> 02:28:06,718
SPEAKER_1:  relax in the way that...

02:28:06,946 --> 02:28:07,582
SPEAKER_1:  you become.

02:28:07,810 --> 02:28:11,486
SPEAKER_1:  like water, but then you solidify in the right places.

02:28:12,162 --> 02:28:12,606
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

02:28:14,050 --> 02:28:14,910
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

02:28:15,394 --> 02:28:20,254
SPEAKER_1:  Is there advice you can give to an adult? So like somebody that has a job, like a hobbyist?

02:28:20,578 --> 02:28:21,703
SPEAKER_1:  like how to progress.

02:28:21,703 --> 02:28:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, train, just need to train.

02:28:25,666 --> 02:28:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  as much as you can, not.

02:28:27,522 --> 02:28:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  you know, five, seven days a week because you're going to get injured.

02:28:31,138 --> 02:28:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  Amen.

02:28:32,002 --> 02:28:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  three times a week.

02:28:33,506 --> 02:28:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  to start is the best way to, you know, to.

02:28:36,770 --> 02:28:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  to initiate your Jiu-Jitsu journey.

02:28:39,426 --> 02:28:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:28:40,162 --> 02:28:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  Practice this same thing over and over again.

02:28:42,530 --> 02:28:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  When they don't work, it's just because you're not doing well.

02:28:45,410 --> 02:28:47,678
SPEAKER_0:  not because you have to learn something else.

02:28:48,866 --> 02:28:51,678
SPEAKER_1:  Do you see some value in just picking a set of techniques that seem...

02:28:51,906 --> 02:28:53,694
SPEAKER_1:  that seem to draw your heart in.

02:28:54,146 --> 02:28:56,670
SPEAKER_1:  For example, I'll give you an example, you're gonna yell at me.

02:28:57,570 --> 02:28:58,238
SPEAKER_1:  But...

02:28:59,394 --> 02:28:59,966
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

02:29:00,610 --> 02:29:01,502
SPEAKER_1:  I never learned the-

02:29:01,730 --> 02:29:02,366
SPEAKER_1:  close guard.

02:29:03,650 --> 02:29:03,998
SPEAKER_1:  Well.

02:29:05,218 --> 02:29:06,686
SPEAKER_1:  It just never connected with me.

02:29:07,202 --> 02:29:11,710
SPEAKER_1:  You could say it's body mechanics, whatever, it doesn't matter. The point is, it's just like my heart.

02:29:12,386 --> 02:29:13,342
SPEAKER_1:  never connected with it.

02:29:13,826 --> 02:29:16,062
SPEAKER_1:  uh... you know the way just a fight to myself

02:29:16,450 --> 02:29:21,278
SPEAKER_1:  Is that felt like when you're bad, you're using the close guard, just think you could use the half guard to stall.

02:29:21,922 --> 02:29:24,766
SPEAKER_1:  So I was really drawn to the butterfly guard as a beginner.

02:29:25,154 --> 02:29:25,822
SPEAKER_1:  because I thought.

02:29:26,498 --> 02:29:28,478
SPEAKER_1:  or open card in general.

02:29:28,930 --> 02:29:29,406
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

02:29:29,762 --> 02:29:33,342
SPEAKER_1:  There's I have no options to stall, so I'm going to learn. My thinking was.

02:29:33,858 --> 02:29:35,038
SPEAKER_1:  Let me do the guard.

02:29:36,194 --> 02:29:39,902
SPEAKER_1:  Enforces me to learn and then I fell in love with the butterfly garden open garden. So on

02:29:40,290 --> 02:29:43,422
SPEAKER_1:  And I never really understood the close guard.

02:29:44,226 --> 02:29:45,534
SPEAKER_1:  And the other thinking was...

02:29:46,882 --> 02:29:51,038
SPEAKER_1:  Do I really need to understand the closed guard? Because it's always by choice that I go there.

02:29:51,714 --> 02:29:52,839
SPEAKER_1:  So I can avoid.

02:29:52,839 --> 02:29:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  I mean you can avoid...

02:29:54,114 --> 02:29:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  Anything you want.

02:29:56,450 --> 02:29:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, you don't have to do anything.

02:29:58,370 --> 02:30:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  in this life. It doesn't make you complete.

02:30:01,314 --> 02:30:02,439
SPEAKER_0:  That means you have a-

02:30:02,439 --> 02:30:03,934
SPEAKER_1:  I want to be complete as a...

02:30:04,226 --> 02:30:07,038
SPEAKER_1:  This is the question, how valuable is it to be complete?

02:30:08,034 --> 02:30:08,702
SPEAKER_1:  to get good.

02:30:11,138 --> 02:30:12,574
SPEAKER_0:  Depends how good you want to be.

02:30:13,186 --> 02:30:14,398
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, let's go.

02:30:14,754 --> 02:30:16,702
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, well, there's several questions there.

02:30:17,122 --> 02:30:20,094
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, okay, like to be the best in the world, do you need to be complete?

02:30:20,834 --> 02:30:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  Of course.

02:30:22,370 --> 02:30:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  The best in the world, of course you have to be complete.

02:30:24,834 --> 02:30:25,534
SPEAKER_0:  Otherwise you...

02:30:26,050 --> 02:30:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  Somebody's gonna be...

02:30:27,906 --> 02:30:29,031
SPEAKER_0:  Better than you, but what-

02:30:29,031 --> 02:30:34,558
SPEAKER_1:  What about like to sort of understand to defend, you have to be also good at the offense in every single position.

02:30:35,330 --> 02:30:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  Otherwise you have a weakness.

02:30:37,410 --> 02:30:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  and someone can...

02:30:39,778 --> 02:30:40,798
SPEAKER_0:  capitalizing that weakness.

02:30:41,058 --> 02:30:42,942
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, what about to be like a hobbyist?

02:30:43,362 --> 02:30:44,222
SPEAKER_1:  And you don't have to.

02:30:44,674 --> 02:30:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  in you.

02:30:45,730 --> 02:30:46,974
SPEAKER_1:  Or is it so bad?

02:30:47,490 --> 02:30:49,278
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's not bad. I mean, nothing is bad.

02:30:49,506 --> 02:30:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, if you've as a hobbyist, you start late.

02:30:52,354 --> 02:30:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it doesn't matter how.

02:30:54,402 --> 02:30:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  you're gonna get as long as you enjoy it just

02:30:57,218 --> 02:30:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  Train as much as you can.

02:30:58,914 --> 02:31:01,022
SPEAKER_0:  If it's twice a week, twice a week it is.

02:31:01,442 --> 02:31:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  You'll be limited how good you will be training twice a week, of course.

02:31:06,306 --> 02:31:07,902
SPEAKER_0:  than the guy that trains twice a day.

02:31:08,674 --> 02:31:09,406
SPEAKER_0:  and osis.

02:31:09,890 --> 02:31:11,070
SPEAKER_0:  The more train the better you get.

02:31:11,682 --> 02:31:14,307
SPEAKER_1:  that's what you have to select what you train that's what i'm asking so

02:31:14,307 --> 02:31:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, yes, but like for how long?

02:31:16,802 --> 02:31:19,454
SPEAKER_0:  like there was some point in your life that you might.

02:31:19,810 --> 02:31:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  something.

02:31:21,282 --> 02:31:27,070
SPEAKER_0:  if you like it. There's some point in your life that you might, okay, let me try close guard. You might not like it now.

02:31:27,618 --> 02:31:29,278
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe in two, three years from now.

02:31:30,018 --> 02:31:31,143
SPEAKER_0:  So don't like it.

02:31:31,143 --> 02:31:32,798
SPEAKER_1:  I kept trying it. Listen, because

02:31:33,314 --> 02:31:33,630
SPEAKER_1:  Listen.

02:31:33,954 --> 02:31:38,686
SPEAKER_1:  It's very difficult to get any respect It's hard to get to Black Belt

02:31:38,946 --> 02:31:39,774
SPEAKER_1:  and beyond.

02:31:40,226 --> 02:31:41,054
SPEAKER_1:  in Jiu Jitsu.

02:31:41,346 --> 02:31:42,878
SPEAKER_1:  at a respectable place.

02:31:43,522 --> 02:31:44,158
SPEAKER_1:  and not.

02:31:44,738 --> 02:31:47,363
SPEAKER_1:  have a good close guard.

02:31:47,363 --> 02:31:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  Then don't do it.

02:31:48,834 --> 02:31:49,342
SPEAKER_0:  is not.

02:31:49,826 --> 02:31:50,951
SPEAKER_0:  Necessary. Necessary.

02:31:50,951 --> 02:31:51,454
SPEAKER_1:  a rebel.

02:31:51,778 --> 02:31:54,334
SPEAKER_0:  No, it's not. It's I'll say because it's not.

02:31:54,850 --> 02:31:56,030
SPEAKER_0:  is not a position that...

02:31:56,994 --> 02:31:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  You under pressure.

02:31:58,178 --> 02:32:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  that if you don't, know you'll be in trouble.

02:32:00,642 --> 02:32:05,639
SPEAKER_0:  You're not going to be in trouble not to know the close guard. You're just going to go straight for open guard. I mean, there's not a problem.

02:32:05,639 --> 02:32:08,510
SPEAKER_1:  The main limitation is if you don't do a close guard a lot.

02:32:09,186 --> 02:32:10,718
SPEAKER_1:  that you don't quite.

02:32:12,802 --> 02:32:18,974
SPEAKER_1:  You don't get a full complete picture of understanding how to attack close guard when somebody puts you into a close guard when you're on top.

02:32:19,522 --> 02:32:21,397
SPEAKER_1:  So it's nice to know both sides of it, just don't...

02:32:21,397 --> 02:32:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, but...

02:32:23,106 --> 02:32:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  you can have a pretty good understanding of how to defend from the top and not having any...

02:32:28,482 --> 02:32:33,342
SPEAKER_1:  I mean some of it is also just like the length of legs and just the geometry of your body

02:32:34,402 --> 02:32:37,027
SPEAKER_1:  I'm sure Marcel Garcia has a good close guard.

02:32:37,027 --> 02:32:42,814
SPEAKER_0:  But I don't I've never seen that. That's the point I'm trying to make.

02:32:43,266 --> 02:32:45,141
SPEAKER_0:  the

02:32:45,141 --> 02:32:49,950
SPEAKER_1:  theory you can imagine it. But for hobbyists I think it's interesting to think of that like.

02:32:50,978 --> 02:32:52,606
SPEAKER_1:  Is it possible to-

02:32:55,362 --> 02:32:59,038
SPEAKER_1:  Is it possible to focus on a small set of techniques?

02:32:59,682 --> 02:33:00,958
SPEAKER_1:  that help you to develop.

02:33:01,346 --> 02:33:04,721
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, of course. Still into a good jujitsu player. Yeah, of course. S going to join us.

02:33:04,721 --> 02:33:05,918
SPEAKER_0:  Most people have this.

02:33:06,818 --> 02:33:08,254
SPEAKER_0:  in the judicial world.

02:33:08,866 --> 02:33:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  99 percent.

02:33:10,370 --> 02:33:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  Am I going to Decompete?

02:33:11,778 --> 02:33:14,686
SPEAKER_0:  Even the people that compete. What moms.

02:33:15,202 --> 02:33:15,678
SPEAKER_0:  You have.

02:33:16,034 --> 02:33:16,702
SPEAKER_0:  high level.

02:33:17,026 --> 02:33:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  compared to this.

02:33:18,562 --> 02:33:19,742
SPEAKER_0:  have no clue what Close Guard is.

02:33:20,386 --> 02:33:26,334
SPEAKER_1:  Thank you for me. No, I think you would say that most people don't have a... Coast Guard is such a...

02:33:27,138 --> 02:33:30,046
SPEAKER_1:  Such a difficult position to understand for me.

02:33:30,626 --> 02:33:32,510
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe one day we'll brainwash. Yeah.

02:33:33,314 --> 02:33:34,366
SPEAKER_1:  I felt...

02:33:34,690 --> 02:33:36,030
SPEAKER_1:  It's too easy to stall.

02:33:37,570 --> 02:33:38,878
SPEAKER_1:  uh... versus attack

02:33:39,842 --> 02:33:44,094
SPEAKER_1:  That was my main concern is like, I want to be forced in every way to.

02:33:44,546 --> 02:33:45,086
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:33:45,762 --> 02:33:48,382
SPEAKER_1:  to always be attacking, to always be moving, to always be.

02:33:48,898 --> 02:33:50,110
SPEAKER_1:  and it felt like...

02:33:50,466 --> 02:33:51,134
SPEAKER_1:  If I got...

02:33:51,362 --> 02:33:54,270
SPEAKER_1:  really good. I've seen it happen with Havgard too.

02:33:54,818 --> 02:34:00,958
SPEAKER_1:  It's like when people get really good at half guard, it just feels stally if you just look at the matches and so on.

02:34:01,346 --> 02:34:04,286
SPEAKER_1:  It's you slow things down to a thing that's not.

02:34:05,346 --> 02:34:08,062
SPEAKER_1:  You don't get reps on learning. You don't get action.

02:34:08,290 --> 02:34:09,502
SPEAKER_1:  in interesting ways.

02:34:10,082 --> 02:34:10,462
SPEAKER_1:  So.

02:34:10,946 --> 02:34:14,366
SPEAKER_1:  That was my worry, that I'll get old and fat and just sit.

02:34:14,594 --> 02:34:15,719
SPEAKER_1:  and close guard all day.

02:34:15,719 --> 02:34:16,469
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

02:34:16,469 --> 02:34:22,910
SPEAKER_1:  holding on to the white belts trying to kill me. Because it's also, I mean that's the other thing for hobbyists and for everyone.

02:34:23,874 --> 02:34:26,654
SPEAKER_1:  is to, like when you first start, I think.

02:34:27,746 --> 02:34:28,990
SPEAKER_1:  You have to relax.

02:34:29,890 --> 02:34:33,054
SPEAKER_1:  in the face of the fact that you're just getting your ass kicked non-stop.

02:34:33,570 --> 02:34:35,550
SPEAKER_1:  That can also be really tough on the ego.

02:34:35,842 --> 02:34:39,646
SPEAKER_1:  I think probably the right way to see that is you're growing as a person.

02:34:39,970 --> 02:34:41,278
SPEAKER_0:  You see that clearly.

02:34:41,922 --> 02:34:45,246
SPEAKER_0:  when they are in a bad position, let's say side mount or mount.

02:34:46,050 --> 02:34:46,910
SPEAKER_0:  Like a beginner.

02:34:47,778 --> 02:34:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  he will never relax on those positions.

02:34:50,306 --> 02:34:51,838
SPEAKER_0:  the moment that you say go.

02:34:52,418 --> 02:34:54,302
SPEAKER_0:  they like trying to...

02:34:55,234 --> 02:35:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  push you out and explode. There's no relaxation and work on the defense. Like, no.

02:35:01,154 --> 02:35:09,374
SPEAKER_0:  It's out and go until I have zero to give, until I'm exhausted, my arms cannot move.

02:35:10,594 --> 02:35:13,086
SPEAKER_1:  It's kind of fun to watch actually. What's the role of drilling?

02:35:14,626 --> 02:35:15,806
SPEAKER_1:  Do you like drilling?

02:35:16,386 --> 02:35:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  I do not like drilling but I'll tell you why.

02:35:20,130 --> 02:35:20,734
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

02:35:22,562 --> 02:35:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  fighting is mechanic.

02:35:25,602 --> 02:35:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  Right, so it's...

02:35:27,298 --> 02:35:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  It's very important to drill a move until you learn the mechanics.

02:35:31,138 --> 02:35:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  of course is important.

02:35:32,482 --> 02:35:32,798
SPEAKER_0:  If.

02:35:33,282 --> 02:35:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  someone want to teach on Armlock

02:35:35,618 --> 02:35:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  You want to practice that movement until you learn the mechanic of it, but the guy is not resisting so it's easy to apply.

02:35:43,522 --> 02:35:44,062
SPEAKER_0:  So you'll-

02:35:44,418 --> 02:35:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  Apply as many times as you have to.

02:35:47,234 --> 02:35:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  until you know the mechanics of the moves, until you can apply the mechanics.

02:35:51,202 --> 02:35:52,894
SPEAKER_0:  The moment that you know how to apply it.

02:35:53,346 --> 02:35:54,686
SPEAKER_0:  There's no more point in drilling.

02:35:55,074 --> 02:35:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  Now you have to practice.

02:35:56,674 --> 02:35:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  Now we have to practice with resistance.

02:35:59,458 --> 02:36:00,766
SPEAKER_0:  Of course you're not going to practice.

02:36:01,026 --> 02:36:01,662
SPEAKER_0:  with the guy.

02:36:01,890 --> 02:36:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  fully resisting the guy is better than you because he's not going to give you a chance to practice that move but you have to practice with resistance

02:36:08,514 --> 02:36:10,494
SPEAKER_0:  So where does drilling comes?

02:36:11,202 --> 02:36:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  that is...

02:36:12,770 --> 02:36:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  Most of the people, they flow, drill and everything. Thus, they cannot work in the same future as there ever were.

02:36:17,314 --> 02:36:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  Whatever you do.

02:36:18,498 --> 02:36:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  You conditioning your body.

02:36:20,290 --> 02:36:20,926
SPEAKER_0:  to do something.

02:36:21,698 --> 02:36:26,814
SPEAKER_0:  is that you repeat the same move over and over again, you by this conditioning to apply that move.

02:36:27,106 --> 02:36:28,030
SPEAKER_0:  or the technique.

02:36:28,994 --> 02:36:32,254
SPEAKER_0:  Drilling is not realistic because the other person is not resisting.

02:36:32,962 --> 02:36:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  you know, the flow movement or whatever. After you go beyond when you already know that.

02:36:38,210 --> 02:36:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  the mechanics.

02:36:39,874 --> 02:36:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  The drilling with no resistance is not going to teach you anything because you will never know how to apply the movement with resistance.

02:36:47,650 --> 02:36:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  So it's pointless.

02:36:49,026 --> 02:36:51,230
SPEAKER_0:  to carry on drilling after you learn the mechanics.

02:36:52,002 --> 02:36:53,534
SPEAKER_1:  See, but you're...

02:36:53,922 --> 02:36:57,310
SPEAKER_1:  making it sound easy to learn the mechanics, I would argue.

02:36:58,882 --> 02:37:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  You can drill as many times, I'm not limping.

02:37:02,402 --> 02:37:03,486
SPEAKER_0:  how much you drill. How much you drill.

02:37:03,874 --> 02:37:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  You drill as long as you had to.

02:37:06,978 --> 02:37:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  I mean it doesn't matter how long.

02:37:08,482 --> 02:37:13,790
SPEAKER_1:  The benefit of drilling, I'm just playing devil's advocate with you. The benefit of drilling is that

02:37:14,114 --> 02:37:16,702
SPEAKER_1:  you can more efficiently get a higher number of reps in.

02:37:18,050 --> 02:37:18,558
SPEAKER_1:  So.

02:37:20,130 --> 02:37:21,374
SPEAKER_1:  you're gonna gain with those reps.

02:37:21,890 --> 02:37:23,486
SPEAKER_1:  Understanding the mechanics of the movement.

02:37:23,842 --> 02:37:25,758
SPEAKER_1:  And what I would like to argue...

02:37:25,986 --> 02:37:29,662
SPEAKER_1:  is you don't necessarily need a resistance to deeply understand the mechanics of something.

02:37:29,986 --> 02:37:30,334
SPEAKER_1:  No.

02:37:31,170 --> 02:37:34,494
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know. There's some moves.

02:37:35,330 --> 02:37:36,382
SPEAKER_1:  Like, I bet you.

02:37:36,962 --> 02:37:39,998
SPEAKER_1:  You could drill your way to an incredible

02:37:40,514 --> 02:37:40,958
SPEAKER_1:  MAUT

02:37:42,050 --> 02:37:42,366
SPEAKER_1:  Like.

02:37:42,946 --> 02:37:46,142
SPEAKER_1:  Well, Ma is a good example of that. You don't really need to resit.

02:37:47,234 --> 02:37:51,390
SPEAKER_1:  I can imagine a world in which the resisting opponent is not essential.

02:37:51,682 --> 02:37:54,494
SPEAKER_1:  for developing some of the very fine details.

02:37:54,946 --> 02:37:56,222
SPEAKER_1:  of the mechanic. Friends, thanks for watching this video video end

02:37:56,322 --> 02:37:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  Because I don't know any.

02:37:57,954 --> 02:37:59,102
SPEAKER_0:  What you say, Mount.

02:37:59,426 --> 02:37:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

02:38:00,642 --> 02:38:06,846
SPEAKER_0:  What are you going to achieve by drilling with no resistance after you learn the mechanics?

02:38:07,106 --> 02:38:16,894
SPEAKER_1:  You mount. What I'm trying to tell you, the learning of the mechanics isn't a thing where you get a certificate and you're done. You're gonna learn the fine details of the way you redistribute your weight.

02:38:17,122 --> 02:38:18,494
SPEAKER_1:  You're going to learn how to move.

02:38:18,754 --> 02:38:19,879
SPEAKER_1:  Your I don't understand my

02:38:19,879 --> 02:38:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  inside a dead body.

02:38:21,986 --> 02:38:24,926
SPEAKER_0:  Like everything you do is a slow process and timing.

02:38:25,826 --> 02:38:28,286
SPEAKER_0:  you do have you have to understand moving

02:38:29,282 --> 02:38:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  It's the guy's resistance.

02:38:31,074 --> 02:38:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  Like, I'm not going to grab you and apply the movement.

02:38:34,178 --> 02:38:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  I need to grab you.

02:38:35,618 --> 02:38:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  and feel when is the right time to do.

02:38:38,370 --> 02:38:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  Like that only comes with movement.

02:38:41,794 --> 02:38:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  If you're not fully resistant...

02:38:44,418 --> 02:38:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  How would I know?

02:38:46,114 --> 02:38:47,806
SPEAKER_1:  You couldn't infer through it.

02:38:48,034 --> 02:38:48,670
SPEAKER_1:  It's like a.

02:38:49,538 --> 02:38:51,070
SPEAKER_0:  with no movement, with no resistance.

02:38:51,490 --> 02:38:54,302
SPEAKER_0:  like I'm like, there's some resistance.

02:38:54,818 --> 02:38:58,078
SPEAKER_0:  Okay. Okay. Let's say you've been drilling for a week. Yep.

02:38:58,786 --> 02:38:59,646
SPEAKER_0:  five hours a day.

02:38:59,874 --> 02:39:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  you should be an expert with the mechanics.

02:39:03,106 --> 02:39:03,870
SPEAKER_0:  But now...

02:39:04,706 --> 02:39:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  How are you gonna carry on?

02:39:06,338 --> 02:39:06,654
SPEAKER_0:  Really?

02:39:07,586 --> 02:39:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  No resistance? No. You have to. Yes. After that week.

02:39:11,362 --> 02:39:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  drilling five times five hours a day.

02:39:13,506 --> 02:39:14,494
SPEAKER_0:  the arm lock.

02:39:14,946 --> 02:39:18,814
SPEAKER_0:  you still have no clue how to apply the armlock against a resisting opponent.

02:39:19,362 --> 02:39:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  No clue zero.

02:39:20,514 --> 02:39:22,718
SPEAKER_0:  So you don't know the movement, you know the mechanic.

02:39:23,202 --> 02:39:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  Bye!

02:39:24,354 --> 02:39:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  It's like how long you have to drill and how... That doesn't matter. It's the very various of the person.

02:39:30,530 --> 02:39:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  You can do for a month.

02:39:32,034 --> 02:39:33,214
SPEAKER_0:  After that month is over...

02:39:33,730 --> 02:39:35,838
SPEAKER_0:  You should understand how the mechanic works.

02:39:36,386 --> 02:39:39,614
SPEAKER_0:  you still have no clue how to apply the movement against a resisting opponent.

02:39:40,034 --> 02:39:41,822
SPEAKER_0:  You will never ever know how.

02:39:42,146 --> 02:39:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  until you apply with a fully resisting opponent.

02:39:45,122 --> 02:39:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  That's the only way to know.

02:39:47,874 --> 02:39:49,278
SPEAKER_0:  to really learn a move.

02:39:49,410 --> 02:39:49,854
SPEAKER_1:  Yes.

02:39:50,370 --> 02:39:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  Well put, but the question is.

02:39:52,898 --> 02:40:01,790
SPEAKER_1:  Can you have a small percentage of time when you go against a resisting opponent to get the wisdom and the insight of what it takes to perform that movement and you spend the large...

02:40:02,082 --> 02:40:03,230
SPEAKER_1:  percentage of other time.

02:40:03,810 --> 02:40:05,470
SPEAKER_1:  just practicing the mechanics of it.

02:40:05,986 --> 02:40:06,878
SPEAKER_1:  So like...

02:40:09,218 --> 02:40:12,286
SPEAKER_1:  Do you need to, as you get better and better at technique.

02:40:12,674 --> 02:40:17,118
SPEAKER_1:  to basically drift away completely from drilling and more into the sparring.

02:40:17,922 --> 02:40:18,942
SPEAKER_1:  I'd like to...

02:40:19,170 --> 02:40:19,582
SPEAKER_1:  I just.

02:40:20,034 --> 02:40:24,606
SPEAKER_1:  You like drilling? No, I don't like drilling. I see. Yes, I like drilling, I would say.

02:40:24,834 --> 02:40:28,126
SPEAKER_1:  But I just see it always bothered me in the jujitsu community.

02:40:28,546 --> 02:40:32,414
SPEAKER_1:  how few people really saw the value of drawing. I've seen it in wrestling, especially in the royal.

02:40:32,770 --> 02:40:34,078
SPEAKER_1:  in the Russian style of wrestling.

02:40:34,434 --> 02:40:40,318
SPEAKER_1:  like the value of drilling. I don't necessarily mean that it's like a dead body or like a dummy or something like that.

02:40:40,546 --> 02:40:42,110
SPEAKER_1:  but just getting the reps in.

02:40:42,594 --> 02:40:44,862
SPEAKER_1:  Really focusing on the high amount of reps?

02:40:45,666 --> 02:40:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  Agreed?

02:40:46,818 --> 02:40:48,414
SPEAKER_0:  in wrestling and judo.

02:40:49,026 --> 02:40:55,550
SPEAKER_0:  I agree the drilling is very important. Initial drill a thousand times each move. Yeah, judo is a really big one for that too. It is because.

02:40:56,450 --> 02:40:57,342
SPEAKER_0:  It's...

02:40:57,666 --> 02:41:00,702
SPEAKER_0:  is the movement, the timing, you know, it's the...

02:41:00,930 --> 02:41:02,398
SPEAKER_0:  precision of the movement.

02:41:02,658 --> 02:41:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  It has to be perfectly.

02:41:04,386 --> 02:41:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  because it's one movement.

02:41:05,986 --> 02:41:09,502
SPEAKER_0:  Then you learn about the timing of the movement when you're firing.

02:41:09,890 --> 02:41:12,190
SPEAKER_0:  but during fighting you only need to know the time.

02:41:12,834 --> 02:41:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  your body movement is exactly the same when you drill.

02:41:16,066 --> 02:41:17,054
SPEAKER_1:  That's really well put, yeah.

02:41:17,282 --> 02:41:19,157
SPEAKER_1:  The mechanics is much more important there.

02:41:19,157 --> 02:41:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, but it's completely different for Jujitsu.

02:41:22,082 --> 02:41:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  because let's say from Jujutsu

02:41:24,194 --> 02:41:25,086
SPEAKER_0:  Play the AMLOC.

02:41:25,698 --> 02:41:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  For example, we use that as an example. Let's see from the close card. Let's see from my close card.

02:41:30,402 --> 02:41:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  Before I go for the armlock I need to have a set of grips.

02:41:33,698 --> 02:41:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  Let's see how you call it in your arms.

02:41:36,258 --> 02:41:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  And then...

02:41:37,058 --> 02:41:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  You know when you're drilling...

02:41:38,306 --> 02:41:40,478
SPEAKER_0:  I'm going to grab your arm, I'm going to grab your collar.

02:41:40,770 --> 02:41:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  and I'm going to drill my body until I can apply the arm lock and finish.

02:41:44,418 --> 02:41:45,790
SPEAKER_0:  I can do that a thousand times.

02:41:46,594 --> 02:41:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, now we're fighting.

02:41:47,906 --> 02:41:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  We start with the grip.

02:41:49,730 --> 02:41:53,630
SPEAKER_0:  The moment that I initiate the armlock attack, he will defend the armlock that will not work.

02:41:54,594 --> 02:41:58,046
SPEAKER_0:  So it's not the one movement that will get me to attack the arm. What is the...

02:41:58,274 --> 02:42:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  There's a combination of all those things that I need to do.

02:42:01,698 --> 02:42:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  I need to feel.

02:42:02,914 --> 02:42:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  about your weight, you know, I need to get you close to it. There's so many other things involved that I need to fill.

02:42:09,026 --> 02:42:10,526
SPEAKER_0:  that only comes with life.

02:42:10,882 --> 02:42:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  life with a fully resistant opponent.

02:42:14,338 --> 02:42:14,686
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

02:42:14,946 --> 02:42:17,854
SPEAKER_1:  So pretty quickly it has to be live.

02:42:20,002 --> 02:42:21,630
SPEAKER_0:  And then it comes...

02:42:22,306 --> 02:42:24,286
SPEAKER_0:  how you practice, how you train.

02:42:25,090 --> 02:42:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  starting on that position.

02:42:27,234 --> 02:42:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  and just saying let's go.

02:42:28,994 --> 02:42:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  and the moment that we disengage from that position, we go back.

02:42:33,122 --> 02:42:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  That's when you really learn.

02:42:34,562 --> 02:42:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  Because everything that you do wrong, you're going to go back there and you're going to try again, try again, try again. And the repetition...

02:42:41,282 --> 02:42:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  It will teach you.

02:42:42,850 --> 02:42:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  have a feeling of.

02:42:44,610 --> 02:42:45,182
SPEAKER_0:  timing.

02:42:45,442 --> 02:42:46,334
SPEAKER_0:  when to go.

02:42:46,786 --> 02:42:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  if there's other combinations which you always have.

02:42:51,074 --> 02:42:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  to go with it.

02:42:53,506 --> 02:42:59,006
SPEAKER_1:  By the way for the internet that's currently yelling at me for arguing with Haji Gracie about drilling

02:42:59,330 --> 02:43:01,598
SPEAKER_1:  That's called, you know...

02:43:02,082 --> 02:43:06,174
SPEAKER_1:  playing devil's advocate to strengthen, to explore ideas. I'm not actually arguing.

02:43:06,434 --> 02:43:06,878
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

02:43:09,090 --> 02:43:10,910
SPEAKER_1:  I forgot to ask you, uh...

02:43:11,874 --> 02:43:15,998
SPEAKER_1:  If you had to fight against the Bear, Lion, Gorilla, or Anaconda to the death.

02:43:16,770 --> 02:43:18,814
SPEAKER_1:  Which one would you choose?

02:43:20,674 --> 02:43:23,934
SPEAKER_1:  would you be able to win against any of them? Ah Ha!

02:43:24,706 --> 02:43:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  a lion?

02:43:26,242 --> 02:43:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  A tiger, a tiger, anaconda.

02:43:28,738 --> 02:43:30,206
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, uh, Gorilla too, Gorilla.

02:43:30,530 --> 02:43:31,262
SPEAKER_1:  in GoGorilla.

02:43:33,378 --> 02:43:34,814
SPEAKER_0:  I'll probably choose the anaconda.

02:43:36,418 --> 02:43:38,014
SPEAKER_0:  That's it.

02:43:38,370 --> 02:43:38,782
SPEAKER_0:  a

02:43:39,202 --> 02:43:41,470
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, you're not allowed to run away though.

02:43:41,858 --> 02:43:43,262
SPEAKER_1:  So you're in a cage.

02:43:44,866 --> 02:43:46,110
SPEAKER_1:  You have to kill.

02:43:47,618 --> 02:43:48,510
SPEAKER_0:  the studio Resistance or whatever it is, I forgot.

02:43:48,770 --> 02:43:50,590
SPEAKER_0:  I said the other one.

02:43:50,850 --> 02:44:00,382
SPEAKER_0:  I think I have no chance against any other one. Zero chance. What's with John's thing? I have a tiny little against the Anaconda.

02:44:00,578 --> 02:44:01,758
SPEAKER_1:  Just wait it out.

02:44:02,338 --> 02:44:04,254
SPEAKER_1:  You don't think it's possible to be.

02:44:05,282 --> 02:44:06,142
SPEAKER_1:  I just...

02:44:08,162 --> 02:44:09,150
SPEAKER_1:  It feels like...

02:44:09,506 --> 02:44:11,934
SPEAKER_1:  technique can do something against these animals.

02:44:12,450 --> 02:44:14,325
SPEAKER_1:  but they have so much strength, so much aggression.

02:44:14,325 --> 02:44:16,702
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the real naked choke.

02:44:17,346 --> 02:44:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  translating to Portuguese is Cue the Lion.

02:44:21,122 --> 02:44:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:44:22,114 --> 02:44:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  Everything so as a kid.

02:44:23,810 --> 02:44:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  I always...

02:44:24,962 --> 02:44:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  store.

02:44:25,954 --> 02:44:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  that made me forget behind a lion.

02:44:28,514 --> 02:44:30,206
SPEAKER_0:  the real naked choke which

02:44:30,850 --> 02:44:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  In Portuguese it's called Mata Leão.

02:44:33,410 --> 02:44:35,614
SPEAKER_0:  So, mata leomis, kill the lion.

02:44:36,258 --> 02:44:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  So I always thought that that's the only way to.

02:44:39,266 --> 02:44:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  a lion. But you know if you're fighting against a lion, you go behind and put the real naked choke.

02:44:44,322 --> 02:44:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  I think you'll put him to sleep or.

02:44:46,370 --> 02:44:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  The name Mataleon is like, kill the lion. Someone came up with the name.

02:44:51,842 --> 02:44:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  Why? Somebody must have done it.

02:44:54,338 --> 02:44:56,963
SPEAKER_0:  He was in a fight with the lion, choked him up.

02:44:56,963 --> 02:45:02,846
SPEAKER_1:  There you go. I honestly do you think or so actually yeah you you understand controlling positions

02:45:03,298 --> 02:45:04,062
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think?

02:45:04,514 --> 02:45:07,454
SPEAKER_1:  like animal like a gorilla or a lion will shake you off.

02:45:07,906 --> 02:45:10,110
SPEAKER_1:  If you had back full, you locked in.

02:45:10,498 --> 02:45:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I'll say the one that I'll have the.

02:45:13,474 --> 02:45:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  biggest chance of staying there is a lion because it's just in your body.

02:45:17,570 --> 02:45:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  He's smaller than a tiger, I'll guess.

02:45:19,778 --> 02:45:20,734
SPEAKER_0:  Think tigers are bigger?

02:45:21,474 --> 02:45:21,790
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

02:45:22,050 --> 02:45:23,902
SPEAKER_0:  So do you think they can shake you off though?

02:45:24,642 --> 02:45:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  I think I'll have a bigger chance of staying against.

02:45:28,226 --> 02:45:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  lion's pack than any other animal.

02:45:30,306 --> 02:45:31,422
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not answering the question.

02:45:31,682 --> 02:45:33,246
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think you have a chance?

02:45:34,370 --> 02:45:35,495
SPEAKER_0:  If I start on the back.

02:45:35,495 --> 02:45:37,182
SPEAKER_1:  It's the full locked in.

02:45:37,602 --> 02:45:40,977
SPEAKER_1:  full controls, let's say it's a small enough line that you can actually have a full.

02:45:40,977 --> 02:45:42,110
SPEAKER_0:  I guess so.

02:45:42,370 --> 02:45:44,286
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I would like to believe so.

02:45:45,794 --> 02:45:48,286
SPEAKER_1:  Well, like Jessica said, somebody must have been able to do it.

02:45:49,282 --> 02:45:50,782
SPEAKER_1:  throughout your journey in Jiu Jitsu.

02:45:51,042 --> 02:45:52,190
SPEAKER_1:  Have there been low points?

02:45:52,642 --> 02:45:54,878
SPEAKER_1:  I guess there have been points where you really doubted yourself.

02:45:55,746 --> 02:45:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  No.

02:45:56,802 --> 02:45:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  I've never really doubted myself this.

02:45:58,946 --> 02:46:00,318
SPEAKER_0:  Low points in defeat.

02:46:00,706 --> 02:46:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  So those are the low points.

02:46:02,466 --> 02:46:03,166
SPEAKER_0:  when I lost.

02:46:03,458 --> 02:46:04,638
SPEAKER_0:  How did you deal with the fees?

02:46:06,018 --> 02:46:09,214
SPEAKER_0:  I just went back to the gym next week and said I need to get better.

02:46:10,498 --> 02:46:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  Every time I lost, I'm like, I need to get better because I need to chuck them out.

02:46:15,426 --> 02:46:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  I need to submit them.

02:46:17,346 --> 02:46:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  because.

02:46:18,050 --> 02:46:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  win by points.

02:46:20,034 --> 02:46:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  It's as a black belt.

02:46:22,434 --> 02:46:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  I have very, very little.

02:46:24,098 --> 02:46:24,478
SPEAKER_0:  lost.

02:46:26,082 --> 02:46:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  I'll say.

02:46:27,618 --> 02:46:28,670
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I don't like to.

02:46:29,314 --> 02:46:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  Sound like a crying baby, but I'll say most.

02:46:31,842 --> 02:46:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  most of those laws.

02:46:33,410 --> 02:46:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  was very, very controversial.

02:46:35,138 --> 02:46:39,838
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it was not a dominant, clear performance. It has the ball referees and points and so on.

02:46:39,938 --> 02:46:40,734
SPEAKER_0:  Everything else.

02:46:41,090 --> 02:46:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  since I was very young.

02:46:42,658 --> 02:46:45,054
SPEAKER_0:  I always fought against my opponent and the referee.

02:46:45,570 --> 02:46:46,174
SPEAKER_0:  like it's.

02:46:46,402 --> 02:46:48,222
SPEAKER_0:  if there was ever in my whole life.

02:46:48,578 --> 02:46:49,246
SPEAKER_0:  sense of the kid.

02:46:50,114 --> 02:46:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  There was ever a doubt.

02:46:52,194 --> 02:46:54,046
SPEAKER_0:  They always go to my opponent.

02:46:54,274 --> 02:46:57,539
SPEAKER_0:  Always, always. That was just something that I had to do in my whole life.

02:46:57,539 --> 02:46:59,486
SPEAKER_1:  life. There is motivation behind.

02:46:59,938 --> 02:47:04,862
SPEAKER_1:  What led to the fact that you win most of your matches by submission or indomitance? Like are you chasing?

02:47:05,410 --> 02:47:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  because that's the only way to prove you're better.

02:47:08,578 --> 02:47:09,630
SPEAKER_0:  and I'm never...

02:47:10,626 --> 02:47:12,190
SPEAKER_0:  I never fought to win tournaments.

02:47:12,418 --> 02:47:13,374
SPEAKER_0:  That was never my goal.

02:47:13,602 --> 02:47:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  that was the consequence of me trying to be the best.

02:47:16,930 --> 02:47:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  Like I don't.

02:47:18,338 --> 02:47:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  care how many titles I have.

02:47:20,162 --> 02:47:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  I care about.

02:47:22,018 --> 02:47:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  I need to beat all my opponents and not win because...

02:47:26,914 --> 02:47:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  When is not enough?

02:47:28,514 --> 02:47:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  I have to submit them.

02:47:30,210 --> 02:47:32,382
SPEAKER_0:  That's the only way to prove I'm the best.

02:47:33,314 --> 02:47:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  submit them.

02:47:34,402 --> 02:47:36,670
SPEAKER_0:  if I win by advantage or a point.

02:47:37,410 --> 02:47:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  That means I was better than them that day. That does not mean I'm better than them.

02:47:42,818 --> 02:47:44,926
SPEAKER_0:  If they don't play, if they tap, if I...

02:47:45,378 --> 02:47:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  Take it down.

02:47:47,266 --> 02:47:49,150

SPEAKER_0:  zero questions was the best.

02:47:52,482 --> 02:47:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  Like there's nothing you can say about it.

02:47:54,722 --> 02:47:55,070

SPEAKER_0:  high level.

02:48:37,026 --> 02:48:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  Determination.

02:48:38,306 --> 02:48:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  is the most important thing.

02:48:41,282 --> 02:48:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  You need to know where you're going?

02:48:43,138 --> 02:48:43,646
SPEAKER_0:  together.

02:48:44,514 --> 02:48:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  So you need to have a go.

02:48:46,274 --> 02:48:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  Which whatever that goal is.

02:48:47,810 --> 02:48:48,126
SPEAKER_0:  like.

02:48:48,354 --> 02:48:49,918
SPEAKER_0:  you need to set the goal for yourself.

02:48:50,818 --> 02:48:51,838
SPEAKER_0:  so you know where you wanna go.

02:48:52,898 --> 02:48:55,198
SPEAKER_0:  and to have the determination to get there.

02:48:56,162 --> 02:48:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:48:58,658 --> 02:49:00,638
SPEAKER_0:  Be sure that you will fail many times.

02:49:01,058 --> 02:49:02,398
SPEAKER_0:  Like you cannot let.

02:49:02,690 --> 02:49:03,550
SPEAKER_0:  your failures.

02:49:04,226 --> 02:49:05,598

SPEAKER_0:  you will fail many times. Everybody does.

02:49:10,274 --> 02:49:11,358
SPEAKER_1:  So you said you didn't look.

02:49:11,586 --> 02:49:13,150
SPEAKER_1:  to external sources of.

02:49:14,146 --> 02:49:14,622
SPEAKER_1:  Buh.

02:49:14,946 --> 02:49:15,454
SPEAKER_1:  belief.

02:49:15,874 --> 02:49:17,118
SPEAKER_1:  You just believed in yourself.

02:49:17,826 --> 02:49:19,006
SPEAKER_1:  Is there something to that?

02:49:19,266 --> 02:49:20,062
SPEAKER_1:  Where, um...

02:49:20,834 --> 02:49:21,662
SPEAKER_1:  You have to try to...

02:49:26,242 --> 02:49:27,166
SPEAKER_1:  Be your own.

02:49:27,394 --> 02:49:28,350
SPEAKER_1:  Source of belief.

02:49:29,954 --> 02:49:34,718
SPEAKER_1:  the fire within yourself? Was that something difficult to do? Like, um...

02:49:34,818 --> 02:49:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  But that was just very natural for me.

02:49:38,082 --> 02:49:38,686
SPEAKER_0:  I said.

02:49:38,914 --> 02:49:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  You know, you can.

02:49:40,066 --> 02:49:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  Surround yourself.

02:49:41,826 --> 02:49:42,654
SPEAKER_0:  with great people.

02:49:43,586 --> 02:49:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  that is extremely important.

02:49:46,050 --> 02:49:47,678
SPEAKER_0:  Don't surround yourself with failures.

02:49:48,610 --> 02:49:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  because...

02:49:49,858 --> 02:49:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  they will.

02:49:50,882 --> 02:49:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  they're not gonna push you to.

02:49:53,730 --> 02:49:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  You know, they don't know what.

02:49:55,170 --> 02:49:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  It is.

02:49:56,354 --> 02:49:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  how to get there. I mean everybody knows but it's...

02:49:59,618 --> 02:50:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  when you surround yourself with winners.

02:50:02,146 --> 02:50:05,822
SPEAKER_0:  You know, you know what, you took them to get there. I used them as an example.

02:50:07,394 --> 02:50:12,670
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, there's a certain kind of aura to people that just achieve great things and being around them.

02:50:13,058 --> 02:50:15,038
SPEAKER_1:  But still, it's hard to find people that...

02:50:15,298 --> 02:50:17,173
SPEAKER_1:  especially at that early stage.

02:50:17,173 --> 02:50:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  any area.

02:50:19,042 --> 02:50:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  any area.

02:50:19,842 --> 02:50:20,286
SPEAKER_1:  That's right.

02:50:21,890 --> 02:50:26,174
SPEAKER_1:  greatness has a certain I think it's almost humbling just to see okay any human

02:50:26,626 --> 02:50:29,854
SPEAKER_1:  At least that's the lesson I learned. Almost any human could do it.

02:50:30,562 --> 02:50:31,134
SPEAKER_1:  could be great.

02:50:31,618 --> 02:50:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, one, I've used Muhammad Ali as a great example.

02:50:35,426 --> 02:50:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  Look at his belief.

02:50:37,250 --> 02:50:40,030
SPEAKER_0:  look at how much he believed himself before he was.

02:50:40,322 --> 02:50:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  Muhammad Ali.

02:50:41,794 --> 02:50:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  Look at the determination he had, the way, the confidence he had fighting.

02:50:46,946 --> 02:50:48,126
SPEAKER_0:  even on his loss.

02:50:49,826 --> 02:50:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  They never change you.

02:50:52,322 --> 02:50:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  not when you thought.

02:50:53,282 --> 02:50:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  former.

02:50:53,986 --> 02:50:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  George Foreman.

02:50:55,298 --> 02:50:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  not one person in the world.

02:50:57,570 --> 02:50:59,454
SPEAKER_0:  He thought he was going to win that fight by himself.

02:51:01,282 --> 02:51:02,366
SPEAKER_0:  He never doubted himself.

02:51:02,786 --> 02:51:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  Everybody else did.

02:51:04,066 --> 02:51:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  You won.

02:51:04,770 --> 02:51:05,182
SPEAKER_0:  Over.

02:51:06,754 --> 02:51:08,222
SPEAKER_0:  all odds against.

02:51:09,826 --> 02:51:14,014
SPEAKER_0:  It's, I mean, when you look at people like that, you don't have to be a boxer.

02:51:14,530 --> 02:51:14,846
SPEAKER_0:  tune.

02:51:15,330 --> 02:51:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  try to follow his example.

02:51:18,850 --> 02:51:25,470
SPEAKER_1:  But see those are like epic giant battles, but I feel like you fight the same kind of battle when you're young and your parents tell you that.

02:51:26,146 --> 02:51:29,566
SPEAKER_1:  you know, just with their whole energy that this is silly, don't be silly, don't.

02:51:29,826 --> 02:51:30,951
SPEAKER_1:  Obviously the chase.

02:51:30,951 --> 02:51:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  It's harder.

02:51:32,290 --> 02:51:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  It is harder.

02:51:35,010 --> 02:51:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  As a kid, it's harder to deal with that because...

02:51:38,178 --> 02:51:40,798
SPEAKER_0:  I mean to go against adults, special parents.

02:51:41,154 --> 02:51:42,206
SPEAKER_0:  Telling you otherwise.

02:51:42,690 --> 02:51:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  like the amount of...

02:51:45,154 --> 02:51:48,734
SPEAKER_0:  strength you need. It's gigantic. I don't even know.

02:51:48,962 --> 02:51:50,526
SPEAKER_0:  how much strength you need.

02:51:51,106 --> 02:51:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  That was not my case.

02:51:52,930 --> 02:51:53,598
SPEAKER_0:  So I can.

02:51:54,082 --> 02:51:54,846
SPEAKER_0:  Understand.

02:51:55,074 --> 02:51:59,070
SPEAKER_0:  what you have to go through with the force of your parents telling you, you know, otherwise.

02:51:59,394 --> 02:51:59,742
SPEAKER_0:  but

02:52:00,482 --> 02:52:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  It's.

02:52:01,314 --> 02:52:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  how much you want.

02:52:03,042 --> 02:52:03,518
SPEAKER_0:  It will.

02:52:04,290 --> 02:52:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  dictate.

02:52:05,122 --> 02:52:05,982
SPEAKER_0:  how far you're gonna go.

02:52:06,498 --> 02:52:08,990
SPEAKER_0:  where you're gonna go. So it's, you know, if you can.

02:52:09,282 --> 02:52:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  Breakthrough that.

02:52:10,562 --> 02:52:11,198
SPEAKER_0:  You get nowhere.

02:52:11,426 --> 02:52:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  Is that simple?

02:52:13,058 --> 02:52:19,518
SPEAKER_1:  And actually one of the really nice things the internet does that I would give advice to young people is like you can find

02:52:20,066 --> 02:52:24,190
SPEAKER_1:  even if your parents are not a source of that, your teachers, your community.

02:52:24,418 --> 02:52:30,910
SPEAKER_1:  you can find people on the internet will believe in you. It's kind of cool. It's kind of cool how the internet opens the possibility of like

02:52:31,330 --> 02:52:36,958
SPEAKER_1:  a community of like 10, 11 year olds, like building shit. I see this all the time engineering.

02:52:37,538 --> 02:52:41,374
SPEAKER_1:  They're fueled by belief. They want to, um...

02:52:42,754 --> 02:52:44,158
SPEAKER_1:  They want to be like...

02:52:44,834 --> 02:52:47,390
SPEAKER_1:  They want to create the next trillion dollar company.

02:52:47,938 --> 02:52:50,494
SPEAKER_1:  Right? There's that fire in their eyes.

02:52:50,754 --> 02:52:53,694
SPEAKER_1:  And not for the money, obviously, but to do something really impactful.

02:52:54,178 --> 02:52:57,694
SPEAKER_1:  And I think that fire is extinguished often by teachers and

02:52:58,178 --> 02:52:59,262
SPEAKER_1:  And uh...

02:52:59,906 --> 02:53:02,750
SPEAKER_1:  parents because I think the logic that parents have.

02:53:03,938 --> 02:53:04,798
SPEAKER_1:  and teachers.

02:53:05,090 --> 02:53:06,078
SPEAKER_1:  They look at a kid.

02:53:06,818 --> 02:53:07,582
SPEAKER_1:  and they don't.

02:53:07,970 --> 02:53:10,750
SPEAKER_1:  On the surface level, they don't see greatness.

02:53:11,618 --> 02:53:14,078
SPEAKER_1:  Right. They just see kind of media awkwardly.

02:53:14,978 --> 02:53:20,766
SPEAKER_1:  And so to them it's like, no, right. The world is more complicated than that. In order to get great, you have to.

02:53:21,250 --> 02:53:25,502
SPEAKER_1:  Like they somehow kind of always try to be reasonable with you.

02:53:25,826 --> 02:53:28,451
SPEAKER_1:  And in so doing extinguish the flame. That's weird.

02:53:28,451 --> 02:53:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  Thank.

02:53:29,570 --> 02:53:30,590
SPEAKER_0:  Most people afraid.

02:53:32,258 --> 02:53:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  to even try.

02:53:34,178 --> 02:53:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  or you can call them cowards for not trying.

02:53:36,386 --> 02:53:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  because...

02:53:38,082 --> 02:53:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  You are a coward for not trying, not putting yourself at risk.

02:53:43,266 --> 02:53:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  I would say.

02:53:44,450 --> 02:53:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  a big part of society.

02:53:47,074 --> 02:53:48,702
SPEAKER_0:  A cut words for never trying.

02:53:49,442 --> 02:53:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  Never Pursuing.

02:53:51,522 --> 02:53:52,350
SPEAKER_0:  what they really want.

02:53:52,770 --> 02:53:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  is so it's there is.

02:53:55,298 --> 02:53:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  you know, weight, pressure.

02:53:58,722 --> 02:54:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  everyone, most people.

02:54:00,642 --> 02:54:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of people will say around you.

02:54:03,074 --> 02:54:03,582
SPEAKER_0:  that.

02:54:03,810 --> 02:54:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  because they were afraid to try.

02:54:06,338 --> 02:54:06,974
SPEAKER_0:  They don't.

02:54:07,458 --> 02:54:09,918
SPEAKER_0:  incentivize people to do so because...

02:54:11,074 --> 02:54:15,518
SPEAKER_0:  they want everybody to be like them, because imagine if everybody around you.

02:54:16,354 --> 02:54:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  Suddenly I'm not afraid and everyone is trying and you look yourself in the mirror

02:54:20,738 --> 02:54:21,950
SPEAKER_0:  and say I was too scared.

02:54:22,242 --> 02:54:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  I've never tried.

02:54:23,522 --> 02:54:25,086
SPEAKER_0:  So you feel really bad about yourself.

02:54:25,378 --> 02:54:26,430
SPEAKER_0:  So it's easier to.

02:54:26,946 --> 02:54:31,070
SPEAKER_0:  have people around you that think exactly like you and don't understand obviously something.

02:54:31,906 --> 02:54:33,758
SPEAKER_0:  so they reflect a lot on the kids.

02:54:34,498 --> 02:54:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  It's, you know, society almost like pressed him down.

02:54:38,114 --> 02:54:39,678

SPEAKER_0:  to have a normal life.

02:54:41,730 --> 02:54:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  No more job.

02:54:43,234 --> 02:54:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  It's, you know, don't take risks because you can lose it all.

02:54:47,586 --> 02:54:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, that's the worst thing you can tell everybody.

02:54:49,922 --> 02:54:52,318

02:54:52,610 --> 02:54:53,982

SPEAKER_0:  Don't live a normal life.

02:55:18,690 --> 02:55:19,774

02:55:20,546 --> 02:55:21,278

02:55:27,746 --> 02:55:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  Until you succeed.

02:55:28,994 --> 02:55:29,918
SPEAKER_0:  and then you gonna...

02:55:30,594 --> 02:55:33,662
SPEAKER_0:  You'll be the most proud of yourself. Like it's this.

02:55:34,018 --> 02:55:35,582

02:55:38,722 --> 02:55:40,574

02:55:41,666 --> 02:55:44,670

SPEAKER_0:  Try it, you know.

02:55:47,778 --> 02:55:50,270
SPEAKER_1:  And a lot of it comes from a place of love because...

02:55:53,026 --> 02:55:55,998
SPEAKER_1:  You know, if you try and you fail, you get hurt.

02:55:57,474 --> 02:55:57,854

SPEAKER_0:  You know, and take one of those.

02:56:09,474 --> 02:56:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  Getting beat up at the gym over and over again was a good thing.

02:56:12,546 --> 02:56:15,038
SPEAKER_0:  when I was getting there and getting smashed by all the good guys.

02:56:15,330 --> 02:56:16,126
SPEAKER_0:  I think I liked it.

02:56:16,866 --> 02:56:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I hit it.

02:56:18,498 --> 02:56:22,334

02:56:22,754 --> 02:56:23,902
SPEAKER_0:  Think I'd like to get tapped.

02:56:24,706 --> 02:56:28,542
SPEAKER_0:  I'm the most one of the most competitive person you know. I hate.

02:56:28,930 --> 02:56:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  to lose.

02:56:30,210 --> 02:56:31,614

02:56:32,226 --> 02:56:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I just need to get better.

02:56:35,266 --> 02:56:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  Every single time I lost in the...

02:56:37,506 --> 02:56:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  Championship.

02:56:38,434 --> 02:56:39,102
SPEAKER_0:  I hate-

02:56:39,650 --> 02:56:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  I've never screamed, no one ever saw me screaming.

02:56:42,818 --> 02:56:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  shouting that you know I got robbed.

02:56:44,930 --> 02:56:46,750
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I should have won the referee

02:56:47,330 --> 02:56:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, boy, this is no screw me over.

02:56:49,858 --> 02:56:50,366
SPEAKER_0:  maintenance.

02:56:51,202 --> 02:56:51,710
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

SPEAKER_0:  happens.

02:56:55,266 --> 02:56:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  I need to get better.

02:56:56,706 --> 02:56:59,134
SPEAKER_0:  because I don't want to be in that position ever again.

02:56:59,554 --> 02:57:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  So when I fight, if I'm better...

02:57:02,242 --> 02:57:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  If I tapped him...

02:57:03,618 --> 02:57:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  There's no question.

02:57:04,930 --> 02:57:06,654
SPEAKER_0:  I don't need to wait for the referee to...

02:57:07,106 --> 02:57:11,678
SPEAKER_0:  decide that there's points or no points if you know his interpretation.

02:57:12,258 --> 02:57:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  That made me better.

02:57:14,178 --> 02:57:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  because I was even more determined to be better.

02:57:17,442 --> 02:57:19,870
SPEAKER_0:  In my mind, I have to tap everybody else.

02:57:20,418 --> 02:57:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  Winning is not enough.

02:57:23,138 --> 02:57:24,263
SPEAKER_0:  It's just objective.

02:57:24,263 --> 02:57:25,022
SPEAKER_1:  spectacular!

02:57:26,338 --> 02:57:27,806
SPEAKER_1:  what you learn the most from.

02:57:28,258 --> 02:57:31,646
SPEAKER_1:  is really wanting to succeed and then failing.

02:57:33,986 --> 02:57:35,294
SPEAKER_1:  and doing that often.

02:57:35,554 --> 02:57:39,838
SPEAKER_1:  That's the reality from a parent, from a teacher perspective, from anybody, from people you love.

02:57:40,482 --> 02:57:42,046
SPEAKER_1:  If they really want to do something.

02:57:42,850 --> 02:57:44,126
SPEAKER_1:  Help them do that thing.

02:57:44,578 --> 02:57:46,334
SPEAKER_1:  If you think they're gonna fail, good.

02:57:46,562 --> 02:57:49,937
SPEAKER_1:  help them do that faster so they fail faster.

02:57:49,937 --> 02:57:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  learn. The only way to succeed is failing.

02:57:52,706 --> 02:57:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  There is no other way. That's what people have to understand.

02:57:55,906 --> 02:57:56,958
SPEAKER_0:  without failing.

02:57:57,314 --> 02:57:58,526
SPEAKER_0:  There is no success.

02:58:01,570 --> 02:58:08,190
SPEAKER_1:  Since you've gotten a little softer, a little more emotionally open, what's the role of love in the human condition, Roger Gracie?

02:58:08,738 --> 02:58:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  Probably the most important thing.

02:58:11,874 --> 02:58:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  That's the basic of everything, right?

02:58:13,858 --> 02:58:14,270
SPEAKER_0:  It's.

02:58:14,690 --> 02:58:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, love brings the best of us.

02:58:17,026 --> 02:58:19,454
SPEAKER_0:  Let's see if we had more love and compassion from...

02:58:20,130 --> 02:58:20,510
SPEAKER_0:  from...

02:58:20,866 --> 02:58:21,630
SPEAKER_0:  the other person.

02:58:22,402 --> 02:58:23,934
SPEAKER_0:  I think it will be a...

02:58:24,450 --> 02:58:25,310
SPEAKER_0:  More evolve.

02:58:25,634 --> 02:58:26,174
SPEAKER_0:  species.

02:58:26,530 --> 02:58:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  world would be much better place than it is now.

02:58:28,642 --> 02:58:30,526
SPEAKER_1:  Did Franz's family help you along the way?

02:58:31,778 --> 02:58:32,190
