SPEAKER_1:  On September 16th, protests broke out in Tehran and quickly spread.

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,278

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,198
SPEAKER_1:  A mini.

00:01:11,874 --> 00:01:15,198
SPEAKER_1:  Eyewitnesses saw her beaten to death by the morality police.

00:01:15,554 --> 00:01:18,366
SPEAKER_1:  This is a heavy topic, but it's a really important topic.

00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:19,806
SPEAKER_1:  Can you explain?

00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:20,958
SPEAKER_0:  What happened?

00:01:21,634 --> 00:01:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  The protests are now in their sixth week.

00:01:26,178 --> 00:01:28,286

00:01:29,026 --> 00:01:29,758
SPEAKER_0:  occurred.

00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  who was visiting Tehran as a tourist.

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  PIKED!

00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  something very deep.

00:01:37,506 --> 00:01:42,526
SPEAKER_0:  that particularly concerned the younger generations. That is what.

00:01:43,138 --> 00:01:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  you would call the equivalent of the...

00:01:45,858 --> 00:01:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  Z generation in this country. Yes. They call themselves the hey hashtadi.

00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  in Persia.

00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  because...

00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  Iran follows the

00:01:55,394 --> 00:01:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  solar calendar of its own.

00:01:57,538 --> 00:01:59,070
SPEAKER_0:  It's an ancient story calendar.

00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:03,102
SPEAKER_0:  And the time that they were born, they were in the...

00:02:03,682 --> 00:02:06,942
SPEAKER_0:  1380s, that's what they call themselves, H-30.

00:02:07,266 --> 00:02:09,214
SPEAKER_0:  80s hashtag for the 80s.

00:02:10,146 --> 00:02:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  Well, the circumstances that surrounds the...

00:02:16,194 --> 00:02:18,974
SPEAKER_0:  unfortunate death of this young...

00:02:19,234 --> 00:02:19,838
SPEAKER_0:  Beautiful.

00:02:20,386 --> 00:02:21,630
SPEAKER_0:  a Kurdish woman.

00:02:22,178 --> 00:02:29,278
SPEAKER_0:  is really tragic. She was arrested by what is referred to as the morality police.

00:02:29,986 --> 00:02:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  morality patrol.

00:02:31,682 --> 00:02:32,286
SPEAKER_0:  called...

00:02:32,546 --> 00:02:33,854
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, the air shot

00:02:34,594 --> 00:02:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  and guidance.

00:02:36,514 --> 00:02:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  Police, that is.

00:02:38,722 --> 00:02:40,670
SPEAKER_0:  Presumably there were two women.

00:02:41,314 --> 00:02:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  fully clad that these officers serving on that force.

00:02:45,826 --> 00:02:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  and two men.

00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  and nobody exactly knows what had happened. She had been...

00:02:52,386 --> 00:02:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  Beaten up.

00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,382
SPEAKER_0:  And apparently there was no...

00:02:56,866 --> 00:02:57,278
SPEAKER_0:

00:02:58,114 --> 00:02:59,294
SPEAKER_0:  sign of any...

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  wrongdoing on her side. She was.

00:03:02,338 --> 00:03:03,550
SPEAKER_0:  fully covered.

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  uh

00:03:05,122 --> 00:03:06,494
SPEAKER_0:  It seems that...

00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:10,718
SPEAKER_0:  there was some altercation in the process.

00:03:11,426 --> 00:03:15,998
SPEAKER_0:  And the outcome was that she was unconscious.

00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:20,510
SPEAKER_0:  not necessarily when she was arrested.

00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,590
SPEAKER_0:  but in the course of the detention.

00:03:22,914 --> 00:03:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  when they take them to a center, presumably to re-educate them.

00:03:28,162 --> 00:03:28,990
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

00:03:29,538 --> 00:03:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  she apparently collapsed.

00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,934
SPEAKER_0:  and maybe my sense is that she must have had some kind of a...

00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:40,894
SPEAKER_0:  problem because of the skull being broken or something get happened.

00:03:41,378 --> 00:03:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  And she died in the hospital the next day.

00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  And that's...

00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:47,742
SPEAKER_0:  through the social media.

00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,814
SPEAKER_0:  was widely spread throughout.

00:03:51,618 --> 00:03:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  Iran and almost the next day, surprisingly, you could see this.

00:03:56,802 --> 00:03:57,694
SPEAKER_0:  Outburst.

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,958
SPEAKER_0:  of sympathy for her.

00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  People are in the streets weeping.

00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:09,374
SPEAKER_0:  because she was seen as such an innocent young woman, 22 years old.

00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:14,558
SPEAKER_0:  and the family, the mother and the father, also mourning for her.

00:04:15,554 --> 00:04:19,070
SPEAKER_0:  and being a Kurd visiting Tehran.

00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:19,646
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

00:04:20,322 --> 00:04:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  This all added up to...

00:04:22,626 --> 00:04:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  really turn her into some kind of a martyr of disguise.

00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:28,990
SPEAKER_0:  And that's what it is.

00:04:29,538 --> 00:04:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  Hell.

00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  picture.

00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  graphics that were artistically produced.

00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  based on her portrait.

00:04:39,106 --> 00:04:42,302
SPEAKER_0:  has now dominates basically as the symbol of this.

00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:43,966
SPEAKER_0:  protest movement.

00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:53,662
SPEAKER_0:  And the protest movement goes on. Everybody was thinking, or at least the authorities were thinking that is going to die out in a matter of a few days.

00:04:54,242 --> 00:04:56,990
SPEAKER_0:  but it became more intense.

00:04:57,698 --> 00:05:00,990
SPEAKER_0:  in the streets of Tehran by young women.

00:05:01,474 --> 00:05:03,038
SPEAKER_0:  Mostly probably between.

00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  I would say 17, 18 teenagers to 22, 23.

00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  or thereabouts, and then to university campuses.

00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:12,606
SPEAKER_0:  all around the country.

00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  and then even to high school.

00:05:15,906 --> 00:05:19,230
SPEAKER_0:  And that also made it a very remarkable protest movement.

00:05:19,746 --> 00:05:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  because...

00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:22,686
SPEAKER_0:  First of all, it involves the youth.

00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  and not necessarily the older generations.

00:05:26,754 --> 00:05:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  You see them around, but not as many.

00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  also

00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:34,462
SPEAKER_0:  You see men and women together, young.

00:05:35,298 --> 00:05:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  girls and boys.

00:05:37,442 --> 00:05:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  And uh...

00:05:38,658 --> 00:05:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,726
SPEAKER_0:  They are adamant.

00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:45,534
SPEAKER_0:  They are desperate in the sense of...

00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,390
SPEAKER_0:  Horn of the protest.

00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  And they are extremely courageous because they stand against the...

00:05:52,258 --> 00:05:53,630
SPEAKER_0:  our security forces.

00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  that were immediately.

00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  were sent off to the streets.

00:05:59,074 --> 00:05:59,454
SPEAKER_0:  So...

00:05:59,842 --> 00:06:01,662
SPEAKER_0:  and in full gear, that is.

00:06:02,082 --> 00:06:04,990
SPEAKER_1:  So what are the currents of pain, emotion?

00:06:05,986 --> 00:06:06,558
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:08,062
SPEAKER_1:  What is this?

00:06:08,386 --> 00:06:12,414
SPEAKER_1:  turmoil that rose to the surface that resulted in these big protests.

00:06:12,642 --> 00:06:13,630
SPEAKER_1:  What are the different?

00:06:13,986 --> 00:06:14,942
SPEAKER_1:  Feelings.

00:06:15,618 --> 00:06:21,406
SPEAKER_1:  ideas that came to the surface here that resulted in such quick scaling of this protest.

00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  Well...

00:06:22,658 --> 00:06:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  If you...

00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  Listen to the...

00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,926
SPEAKER_0:  main slogan, which is the message of this movement.

00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  It's called women.

00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  Life.

00:06:33,218 --> 00:06:33,662
SPEAKER_0:  freedom.

00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  Zan zindegi azadi.

00:06:37,826 --> 00:06:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  which is a translation of actually...

00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:46,526
SPEAKER_0:  The Kurdish equivalent, which is close to Persian being in the European language.

00:06:47,298 --> 00:06:50,110
SPEAKER_0:  and it's apparently initiated.

00:06:50,722 --> 00:06:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  First.

00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,174
SPEAKER_0:  in the Syrian Kurdistan.

00:06:54,978 --> 00:06:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  where they were fighting against the Islamic...

00:07:00,258 --> 00:07:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  Daesh.

00:07:01,378 --> 00:07:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  forces.

00:07:02,626 --> 00:07:05,822
SPEAKER_0:  because they were attacking the...

00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  Yazidis there.

00:07:08,418 --> 00:07:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  and the women being enslaved.

00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  But the message as it moved, historians are interested in this kind of thing.

00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:15,998
SPEAKER_0:  Friends

00:07:16,322 --> 00:07:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  So it has moved to Kurdistan and from Kurdistan, now being the message of this movement.

00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  Reflex.

00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:23,678
SPEAKER_0:  pretty much.

00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  Thumbs up!

00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:26,174
SPEAKER_0:  Watch.

00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  this movement is all about. Women?

00:07:29,058 --> 00:07:30,014
SPEAKER_0:  and the forefront.

00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  because of all the...

00:07:32,162 --> 00:07:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  One might say discriminations, the treatment, the humiliation.

00:07:36,674 --> 00:07:40,638
SPEAKER_0:  that this younger generation feels, well, not only the younger generations, but...

00:07:41,186 --> 00:07:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  most of the Iranian secular middle classes since 1979.

00:07:46,658 --> 00:07:48,926
SPEAKER_0:  for the past 43 years.

00:07:49,474 --> 00:07:52,670
SPEAKER_0:  And they would think that...

00:07:54,018 --> 00:07:55,230
SPEAKER_0:  They these

00:07:55,714 --> 00:07:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  All.

00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,558
SPEAKER_0:  basically symbolized or...

00:07:59,426 --> 00:08:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:08:00,386 --> 00:08:02,942
SPEAKER_0:  represented by

00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:07,006
SPEAKER_0:  the wearing the mandatory wearing of the hijab.

00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  which is at the core.

00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  of this protest.

00:08:11,586 --> 00:08:16,446
SPEAKER_0:  You see the young women, if you look at many of these clips that comes through in the past six weeks.

00:08:17,218 --> 00:08:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  Women in streets take off their mandatory.

00:08:20,802 --> 00:08:23,166
SPEAKER_0:  scarves which is a young shawl.

00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  or some kind of a head covering, that's all.

00:08:26,946 --> 00:08:29,918
SPEAKER_0:  and they throw it into the...

00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:34,654
SPEAKER_0:  bonfire in the middle of the street and they dance around it.

00:08:35,586 --> 00:08:36,926
SPEAKER_0:  and slogans.

00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  So there is a sense of complete rejection.

00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  of what this regime for 43 years... 43 years.

00:08:46,018 --> 00:08:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  have been imposing on women.

00:08:47,906 --> 00:08:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  It's not as it's sometimes been portrayed, a movement.

00:08:52,546 --> 00:08:54,366
SPEAKER_0:  against her job.

00:08:54,722 --> 00:08:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  through and through.

00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,550
SPEAKER_0:  But it basically says, you know, there has to be.

00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  The choice.

00:09:01,154 --> 00:09:03,678
SPEAKER_0:  for those who want to wear hijab and those...

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,165
SPEAKER_0:  want to remain without a job.

00:09:06,165 --> 00:09:08,415
SPEAKER_1:  Hijab is a symbol of something much deeper.

00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:09,790
SPEAKER_0:  much deeper.

00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  And actually, before we get into that, it's interesting to note.

00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  that in many of these demonstrations we see in the university campuses or in the streets.

00:09:19,298 --> 00:09:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  You see women with hijab.

00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  young women with hijabs.

00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:24,446
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't-

00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  next to those have to remove their hijab and they're...

00:09:28,706 --> 00:09:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  together basically protesting. That's the most interesting feature.

00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:36,958
SPEAKER_0:  of these demonstrations and then men and women together.

00:09:37,346 --> 00:09:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  against the segregation that the regime.

00:09:40,098 --> 00:09:42,686
SPEAKER_0:  has imposed upon them all these years.

00:09:42,978 --> 00:09:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  Now in terms of

00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  what it represents.

00:09:47,106 --> 00:09:52,990
SPEAKER_0:  As I pointed out, one is the question of the whole series of what might say civil and legal.

00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  discriminations against women.

00:09:56,642 --> 00:09:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  you are considered as a kind of a second class citizen.

00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  You depend on your men.

00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  It's a kind of f-

00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,726
SPEAKER_0:  Patriarchy.

00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  that has been institutionalized in the Islamic Republic in a very profound fashion.

00:10:12,354 --> 00:10:15,838
SPEAKER_0:  And that means that probably.

00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,782
SPEAKER_0:  in matters of divorce.

00:10:19,138 --> 00:10:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  marriage and divorce.

00:10:22,114 --> 00:10:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  in matters of custody of your children, in matters of inheritance.

00:10:26,178 --> 00:10:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  in matter of

00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  freedom of movement.

00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:30,654
SPEAKER_0:  You depend.

00:10:31,266 --> 00:10:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  on your husband, your father, your brother.

00:10:34,562 --> 00:10:35,966
SPEAKER_0:  A male member of your

00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  family, your child even.

00:10:38,978 --> 00:10:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  your son.

00:10:40,642 --> 00:10:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  could be the case.

00:10:42,306 --> 00:10:43,710
SPEAKER_0:  And because of that...

00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  Obviously a younger generation who is so...

00:10:47,746 --> 00:10:50,366
SPEAKER_0:  well informed through social media.

00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  knows about the world.

00:10:52,578 --> 00:10:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  As much as an American does, American kid does, probably sometimes more.

00:10:56,802 --> 00:10:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  They're very, very curious.

00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  It's from what I hear or sometimes that I met a few of them outside Iran.

00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  You'll see that how they this.

00:11:06,658 --> 00:11:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  a new generation is.

00:11:08,898 --> 00:11:14,270
SPEAKER_0:  completely different from what the Islamic Republic wanted to create in its social engineering.

00:11:14,498 --> 00:11:16,222
SPEAKER_0:  It's basically the failure.

00:11:16,738 --> 00:11:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  of 43 years.

00:11:18,498 --> 00:11:20,830
SPEAKER_0:  of the Islamic Republic's acts of.

00:11:21,186 --> 00:11:24,670
SPEAKER_0:  imposition of certain so-called Islamic values.

00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  on women.

00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:28,894
SPEAKER_0:  Then it's a matter of education.

00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:32,286
SPEAKER_0:  you would see that there is segregation in the schools.

00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,342
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:11:33,602 --> 00:11:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  One of the issues that now, right now, is at the heart of this demonstration is that

00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  self-services in many of the campuses of Iranian universities are segregated.

00:11:46,114 --> 00:11:47,678
SPEAKER_0:  male and female, two different.

00:11:48,098 --> 00:11:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  rooms to different doors.

00:11:50,178 --> 00:11:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  Not your f-

00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  Breaking through the walls.

00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,678
SPEAKER_0:  virtually everywhere and sit together.

00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  in order to

00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, basically...

00:11:59,234 --> 00:12:00,606
SPEAKER_0:  resist.

00:12:00,866 --> 00:12:03,582
SPEAKER_0:  the authorities who wants to

00:12:04,194 --> 00:12:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  in post segregation.

00:12:05,954 --> 00:12:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  in matters of...

00:12:08,546 --> 00:12:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  appearance in the public. Retard?

00:12:11,234 --> 00:12:14,782
SPEAKER_0:  It may seem to us as a kind of...

00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,854
SPEAKER_0:  trivial and secondary, but appearance is important.

00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  Clothing is important.

00:12:19,714 --> 00:12:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  how you would imagine yourself is important.

00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  They don't want to be.

00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  seen in the way that the authorities would like to impose upon them as this kind of an idea of a chase.

00:12:30,018 --> 00:12:31,678
SPEAKER_0:  Islamic woman who is

00:12:32,258 --> 00:12:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  Fully covered.

00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,550
SPEAKER_0:  and it's fully protected.

00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  the idea of a male member of the family protects.

00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  the female.

00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  That is.

00:12:42,882 --> 00:12:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  what you would see at the heart of this.

00:12:45,218 --> 00:12:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  I don't have a link.

00:12:47,554 --> 00:12:48,734
SPEAKER_0:  And of course...

00:12:49,122 --> 00:12:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  That goes with everything else. The second part of this message, the idea of life.

00:12:55,362 --> 00:12:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  basically means...

00:12:57,858 --> 00:13:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  if you like to use the American equivalent of this pursuit of the happiness. That's what they want.

00:13:03,426 --> 00:13:04,126
SPEAKER_0:  It was fun.

00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:05,694
SPEAKER_0:  They want music.

00:13:06,146 --> 00:13:10,686
SPEAKER_0:  They want dancing, they want to be free in the street, they want to have girl boyfriends.

00:13:11,394 --> 00:13:12,382
SPEAKER_0:  and live.

00:13:12,706 --> 00:13:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  Really?

00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:19,070
SPEAKER_0:  and don't be constantly looked by the big brother to tell them what to do.

00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,718
SPEAKER_0:  and not to do or not to do.

00:13:23,426 --> 00:13:23,934
SPEAKER_0:  So

00:13:24,226 --> 00:13:28,286
SPEAKER_0:  That is, that they share virtually with the entire.

00:13:28,994 --> 00:13:31,582
SPEAKER_0:  with the entire Iranian society as a whole.

00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:34,750
SPEAKER_0:  Although the older generations, that's a big puzzle.

00:13:35,362 --> 00:13:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  But you would see that the older generation don't, so far at least.

00:13:39,362 --> 00:13:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  Don't take part.

00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,838
SPEAKER_0:  as extensively as one might imagine.

00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  And this is.

00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  variety of reasons perhaps you can get to that.

00:13:47,938 --> 00:13:49,246
SPEAKER_0:  Later on if you like.

00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  But as far as this younger generation, they don't care. They don't listen even.

00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,126
SPEAKER_0:  as much.

00:13:56,578 --> 00:13:59,070
SPEAKER_0:  to their parents as the older generations did.

00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:03,550
SPEAKER_0:  or one might say even the nature of the relationship between the...

00:14:04,162 --> 00:14:05,534
SPEAKER_0:  parents and the

00:14:06,114 --> 00:14:07,646
SPEAKER_0:  Youth has changed.

00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,902
SPEAKER_0:  It's not the concept of, again, a patriarchy.

00:14:12,514 --> 00:14:14,942
SPEAKER_0:  that a father or even a mother.

00:14:15,714 --> 00:14:16,606
SPEAKER_0:  would tell the...

00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  No terrorist sign. What to do?

00:14:20,002 --> 00:14:22,398
SPEAKER_0:  as basically they have to negotiate.

00:14:22,914 --> 00:14:24,039
SPEAKER_0:

00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:26,078
SPEAKER_1:  of the power of authority.

00:14:26,594 --> 00:14:27,358
SPEAKER_1:  Parents.

00:14:27,746 --> 00:14:28,574
SPEAKER_1:  government.

00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:34,974
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, it's that every person can decide their own fate and there's no, uh,

00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:39,391
SPEAKER_1:  Lessening of value of the wisdom of old age and old institutes.

00:14:39,391 --> 00:14:42,238
SPEAKER_0:  Precisely that's what it is.

00:14:43,426 --> 00:14:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  they are surprisingly aware.

00:14:46,818 --> 00:14:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  that where they are as a generation. So it's a sense of pride as a-

00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  We are.

00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,982
SPEAKER_0:  different from the older generation.

00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  from your parents to compromise.

00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  and lived with the restrictions that the Islamic regime put on you.

00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:07,678
SPEAKER_0:  Your grandparents was the generation that actually involved in the revolution of 79.

00:15:08,482 --> 00:15:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  the parents, which were the middle generation.

00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:15,454
SPEAKER_0:  And these are the third generation of the revolution of 1979.

00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  And therefore the...

00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  differentiate themselves in terms of their identity from the older generation.

00:15:23,362 --> 00:15:30,046
SPEAKER_0:  That's the life part of it. One can go more and more, they want to access, and they see on social media.

00:15:30,274 --> 00:15:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  What happens in the rest of the world? Well, I'm there.

00:15:33,442 --> 00:15:35,582
SPEAKER_0:  They're much better digitally.

00:15:36,194 --> 00:15:36,926
SPEAKER_0:  skilled.

00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  than my generation, for instance.

00:15:39,618 --> 00:15:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:15:40,802 --> 00:15:41,150
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:15:41,378 --> 00:15:48,254
SPEAKER_0:  They know about all the personalities. They know about all the celebrities. They know about all the trends that goes out.

00:15:48,674 --> 00:15:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  Outside Iran.

00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:50,238
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:15:51,138 --> 00:15:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  That's the second part of this message. And then of course the third part is the word Azadi.

00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  meaning freedom or liberty.

00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  which is this long...

00:16:01,954 --> 00:16:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  standing demand of the

00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  Iranians, I would say for the whole

00:16:07,682 --> 00:16:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  century, ever since the Constitutional...

00:16:10,434 --> 00:16:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  Revolution of 1906.

00:16:12,834 --> 00:16:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  Iran has witnessed this problem.

00:16:15,746 --> 00:16:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  of a.

00:16:17,314 --> 00:16:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  authorities that usually emerged at the end of a revolution.

00:16:21,762 --> 00:16:22,846
SPEAKER_0:  narrative and

00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  basically impose its own image.

00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  on the population and the youth.

00:16:28,898 --> 00:16:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  and create authoritarian regimes of which, over the course of time...

00:16:35,138 --> 00:16:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  I would say that the Islamic Republic is the worst.

00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  in the sense that it's...

00:16:40,098 --> 00:16:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  uh... it's intrusion is not only

00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  in the political sense in the...

00:16:46,658 --> 00:16:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  for instance, banning the freedom of speech.

00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  meddling with the elections, banning political parties, all kinds of that things which are that

00:16:56,802 --> 00:16:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  political or civil freedoms

00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,630
SPEAKER_0:  but it's intrusion into the personal life of the individual.

00:17:02,338 --> 00:17:04,958
SPEAKER_0:  which is the worst kind in a sense as

00:17:05,282 --> 00:17:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  you would see that there is always an authority that basically...

00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,478
SPEAKER_0:  dominates their life or monitors their life.

00:17:13,218 --> 00:17:13,566
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  I, and they do it.

00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  in a kind of a very consistent fashion, which makes this idea.

00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  of freedom so important.

00:17:24,386 --> 00:17:26,942
SPEAKER_0:  as part of the message of this new movement.

00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:33,630
SPEAKER_0:  you would see that in today's Iran, there are no independent political parties.

00:17:34,306 --> 00:17:34,750
SPEAKER_0:  There's...

00:17:35,426 --> 00:17:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  Very little.

00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:17:38,786 --> 00:17:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  probably freedom of the press. I wouldn't say that it's entirely gone.

00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  But it's very...

00:17:45,442 --> 00:17:46,302
SPEAKER_0:  and when you are tmd alert and remember our

00:17:46,882 --> 00:17:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  There's enormous amount of propaganda machine.

00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  which dominates the entire...

00:17:52,546 --> 00:17:52,926
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:59,614
SPEAKER_0:  radio and TV system in Iran. It's completely in the hands of the government.

00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,686
SPEAKER_0:  And of course you would see this.

00:18:03,138 --> 00:18:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  variety of other tools.

00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:06,270
SPEAKER_0:  FOOL

00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  trying to indoctrinate.

00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  uh

00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:10,430
SPEAKER_0:

00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  Iranian population across the board.

00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  So that's another sign of this kind of a sense of.

00:18:17,186 --> 00:18:18,814
SPEAKER_0:  a sense of.

00:18:19,522 --> 00:18:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  being.

00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  totally.

00:18:22,306 --> 00:18:23,262
SPEAKER_0:  Left out.

00:18:23,714 --> 00:18:25,214
SPEAKER_0:  You're not belonging.

00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:26,942
SPEAKER_0:  to what's going on.

00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:27,806
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of

00:18:28,546 --> 00:18:29,054
SPEAKER_0:  Hover.

00:18:29,314 --> 00:18:31,070
SPEAKER_0:  empowerment and disempowerment.

00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:32,062
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:18:32,354 --> 00:18:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  That's the situation as far as the idea of a freedom of cancer.

00:18:37,186 --> 00:18:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  And this three.

00:18:38,594 --> 00:18:40,318
SPEAKER_0:  somewhat miraculously.

00:18:40,706 --> 00:18:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  and perhaps

00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  unintentionally.

00:18:44,194 --> 00:18:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  and the three parts of this message.

00:18:47,074 --> 00:18:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  complement each other.

00:18:50,114 --> 00:18:50,590
SPEAKER_0:  Because...

00:18:51,138 --> 00:18:53,470
SPEAKER_0:  Perhaps for the first time we see that women.

00:18:53,986 --> 00:18:55,294
SPEAKER_0:  I'm in the forefront.

00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,382
SPEAKER_0:  Offer.

00:18:57,026 --> 00:19:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  of a movement. I hesitate to say revolution because I'm not particularly happy with revolutions.

00:19:01,794 --> 00:19:02,110
SPEAKER_0: 恨

00:19:02,338 --> 00:19:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  The revolutions worldwide in Iran have always been so...

00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  miserable in terms of their outcome that we have to be careful not to use the word revolution again.

00:19:12,994 --> 00:19:15,038
SPEAKER_0:  So that's where it stands now.

00:19:15,586 --> 00:19:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  And the regime was thinking that, well, these are kids.

00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:24,094
SPEAKER_0:  they're going to go away and then of course they're completely...

00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  conspiratorially in their thinking.

00:19:28,162 --> 00:19:29,758
SPEAKER_0:  They constantly think that.

00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  These are all the...

00:19:32,354 --> 00:19:37,150
SPEAKER_0:  instigations and provocations of foreign powers. I have once also been made a Greek reference.ın

00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  the great Satan in the United States, this is Israel.

00:19:41,794 --> 00:19:45,726
SPEAKER_0:  or these are actually the supreme data sets in so many words.

00:19:46,402 --> 00:19:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  His only response so far that he had

00:19:49,826 --> 00:19:53,406
SPEAKER_0:  in the past six weeks with regard to this demonstration is that

00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  These are the children of the SAVAK, SAVAK being the security forces.

00:19:58,274 --> 00:19:59,070
SPEAKER_0:  of the show is done.

00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  43 years later.

00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:04,798
SPEAKER_0:  He claims that the children...

00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:09,118
SPEAKER_0:  16, 17 years, 20 years old.

00:20:09,826 --> 00:20:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  Kids in the street are the grandchildren or children of

00:20:14,082 --> 00:20:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  some imaginary

00:20:16,578 --> 00:20:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  survival of the short security force. So there's the idea is that.

00:20:22,114 --> 00:20:24,798
SPEAKER_1:  These protests are internal.

00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,774
SPEAKER_1:  and external.

00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,669
SPEAKER_1:  saboteurs so people trying to sabotage the government.

00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:36,373
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, and they are misled as far as they can go.

00:20:36,373 --> 00:20:40,798
SPEAKER_1:  And then there's the great state in the United States and other places are.

00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:41,790
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,166
SPEAKER_1:  Controlling.

00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,510
SPEAKER_1:  Sort of a...

00:20:44,802 --> 00:20:49,278
SPEAKER_1:  either controlling the narrative, feeding propaganda, or literally.

00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:51,294
SPEAKER_1:  sending people.

00:20:51,842 --> 00:20:54,622
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think that they have, I don't think even they have.

00:20:54,946 --> 00:20:56,606
SPEAKER_0:  that kind of imagination.

00:20:57,346 --> 00:20:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  precise to say what you have said.

00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:05,534
SPEAKER_0:  they would say that they're controlling the narrative. They basically say, no, these are agents.

00:21:05,986 --> 00:21:07,838
SPEAKER_0:  of the foreign powers.

00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  and their families are all sold out and they are basically lost their loyalties to the great Islamic.

00:21:15,362 --> 00:21:16,126
SPEAKER_0:  Republic.

00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,110
SPEAKER_0:  And therefore...

00:21:18,594 --> 00:21:22,686
SPEAKER_0:  they can be treated so brutally, they can be suppressed so brutally.

00:21:22,978 --> 00:21:25,598
SPEAKER_0:  which I haven't actually said what they're doing because.

00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  I thought perhaps.

00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  First, we should talk about who these kids are in the street.

00:21:29,954 --> 00:21:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  before we move on about the response of the government.

00:21:33,954 --> 00:21:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  But...

00:21:34,722 --> 00:21:36,766
SPEAKER_0:  One major factor.

00:21:37,282 --> 00:21:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  which seems to add to the anxiety.

00:21:40,802 --> 00:21:46,654
SPEAKER_0:  of, well, the regime is extremely anxious now because they're in a position.

00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  It shows that they don't have the lack of confidence in a sense, that they would see them.

00:21:52,162 --> 00:21:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  reacting in a very forceful way.

00:21:55,298 --> 00:21:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  because basically they don't seem to have.

00:21:58,242 --> 00:22:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  that kind of a confidence to allow this.

00:22:00,738 --> 00:22:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  this message or the movement to air.

00:22:05,026 --> 00:22:05,534
SPEAKER_0:  Be aired.

00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,286
SPEAKER_0:  But the one element which...

00:22:08,642 --> 00:22:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  corresponds to that is that there is a

00:22:11,746 --> 00:22:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  expatriate population.

00:22:13,794 --> 00:22:15,518
SPEAKER_0:  of Iranians worldwide.

00:22:16,194 --> 00:22:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  They are probably now, according to some estimates, close to 4 million, even more.

00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  Iranians abroad and they're all over the world from Australia and New Zealand.

00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  Japan.

00:22:27,938 --> 00:22:29,054
SPEAKER_0:  Western Europe.

00:22:29,954 --> 00:22:31,614
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, uh, techie.

00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  and United States and Canada.

00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:35,838
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:22:36,386 --> 00:22:41,278
SPEAKER_0:  Just to give you one example, last Saturday,

00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  There was a mass demonstration in Berlin.

00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  by the Iranians from...

00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,702
SPEAKER_0:  Germany and all over Europe.

00:22:48,962 --> 00:22:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  Western Europe.

00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  And it was at least, I think, probably the conservative estimate was about 100,000.

00:22:56,578 --> 00:22:59,102
SPEAKER_0:  So 100,000 Iranians showed up.

00:22:59,842 --> 00:23:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  in Berlin demonstrating against

00:23:02,786 --> 00:23:04,030
SPEAKER_0:  the treatment of the...

00:23:04,386 --> 00:23:06,622
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, we may need to unword.

00:23:06,914 --> 00:23:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  the movement in Iran.

00:23:08,994 --> 00:23:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  The government.

00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  I think obviously this must have been some...

00:23:14,082 --> 00:23:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  Instigation by...

00:23:15,778 --> 00:23:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  foreign powers and they want to destroy the Islamic Republic.

00:23:20,354 --> 00:23:23,902
SPEAKER_0:  And not only that, but their propaganda is kind of ridiculous.

00:23:24,418 --> 00:23:24,926
SPEAKER_0:  because...

00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  I listened actually to how they portrayed it in the newspapers. I listened to the...

00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  Iranian news.

00:23:32,226 --> 00:23:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  This is officially controlled, government-controlled news.

00:23:35,778 --> 00:23:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  And in the papers, much of the papers that are in the control of the government.

00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,478
SPEAKER_0:  One of them or actually the...

00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,910
SPEAKER_0:  the major news program.

00:23:47,394 --> 00:23:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  portrayed the demonstrations that

00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:51,518
SPEAKER_0:  10,000 people.

00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  showed up in Berlin and protested against the rising

00:23:57,826 --> 00:24:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  prices, rising rates for gas and oil.

00:24:02,082 --> 00:24:03,006
SPEAKER_0:  in Germany.

00:24:03,618 --> 00:24:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  So that's how they mislead.

00:24:05,794 --> 00:24:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  in a very rather stupid fashion because...

00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  probably 95% if not.

00:24:11,554 --> 00:24:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  100% of the Iranians.

00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:14,686
SPEAKER_0:  are listening.

00:24:15,266 --> 00:24:15,678
SPEAKER_0:  to.

00:24:16,002 --> 00:24:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  Passion speaking.

00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,038
SPEAKER_0:  Media outside Iran.

00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  It's a BBC.

00:24:21,602 --> 00:24:22,686
SPEAKER_0:  passion.

00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  There is Iran International, at least five or six of them.

00:24:27,138 --> 00:24:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  That's.

00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,534
SPEAKER_1:  probably really important to highlight that.

00:24:30,466 --> 00:24:31,262
SPEAKER_1:  Iran.

00:24:31,906 --> 00:24:35,262
SPEAKER_1:  is a very modern and tech savvy nation.

00:24:36,354 --> 00:24:38,590
SPEAKER_0:  not just the young people. Probably more than.

00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  More than I feel sometimes

00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:47,390
SPEAKER_0:  when I compare myself to what they are doing. It's 1979, the earlier years.

00:24:47,874 --> 00:24:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  for a decade or two.

00:24:50,274 --> 00:24:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  They tried in a very crude fashion to...

00:24:53,122 --> 00:24:55,070
SPEAKER_0:

00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:56,542
SPEAKER_0:  Access to.

00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  media outside Iran.

00:24:58,978 --> 00:25:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  because this is all through dishes, okay?

00:25:01,922 --> 00:25:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  And satellite dishes are everywhere. If you look at the...

00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  You know

00:25:06,658 --> 00:25:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  buildings, small houses, small...

00:25:10,274 --> 00:25:12,862
SPEAKER_0:  towns and villages in Iran. There is always a.

00:25:13,474 --> 00:25:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  dish.

00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:18,174
SPEAKER_0:  and they watch all kinds of things through this.

00:25:18,658 --> 00:25:21,790
SPEAKER_0:  and particularly because of what's happening now.

00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  They listen to all the news.

00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:25:26,146 --> 00:25:26,782
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  Broadcast from

00:25:28,738 --> 00:25:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  all this media and they're extremely active.

00:25:31,842 --> 00:25:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  There are...

00:25:33,346 --> 00:25:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  probably some of them even 24 hours or close, very extensive coverage.

00:25:39,714 --> 00:25:41,726
SPEAKER_0:  of every clip that comes through.

00:25:42,498 --> 00:25:44,606
SPEAKER_0:  So what the government is doing now...

00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  Islamic Republic.

00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  is that they restrict.

00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,310
SPEAKER_0:  the entire internet. They shut down the internet. They shut down the internet.

00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  But they cannot afford shutting the internet because much of the business, much of the...

00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  everyday life, much of the government.

00:26:01,378 --> 00:26:03,262
SPEAKER_0:  At first depends on the

00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  internet like everywhere else.

00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  And Iran is extremely...

00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:14,110
SPEAKER_0:  If I hear from many of the colleagues and friends...

00:26:14,626 --> 00:26:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

00:26:15,202 --> 00:26:17,758
SPEAKER_0:  It's like in certain respects, it's like Sweden.

00:26:18,114 --> 00:26:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  Where you go there?

00:26:19,938 --> 00:26:24,030
SPEAKER_0:  There is no more currency and for a very good reason because there is so much inflation.

00:26:24,354 --> 00:26:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  that the banknotes are...

00:26:26,914 --> 00:26:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  Worthless in SS.

00:26:28,226 --> 00:26:29,438
SPEAKER_0:  So everything is true.

00:26:29,954 --> 00:26:30,462
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

00:26:30,978 --> 00:26:32,510
SPEAKER_0:  sweeping your card.

00:26:33,186 --> 00:26:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  And that entire system is in standstill because...

00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  People cannot buy food.

00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  You go to the supermarket, that's how you would do it.

00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  You-

00:26:44,162 --> 00:26:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  You.

00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  order food to come to your house.

00:26:47,426 --> 00:26:50,142
SPEAKER_0:  which Iranians were at least the middle classes.

00:26:50,466 --> 00:26:53,278
SPEAKER_0:  more prosperous with that crisis doing all the time.

00:26:53,602 --> 00:26:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  So they...

00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  deliver everything and because of the COVID it became even more.

00:26:58,594 --> 00:27:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  and they have to pay all through this.

00:27:01,474 --> 00:27:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  system.

00:27:02,946 --> 00:27:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  So what happens is that now they're estimating that every day $50 million, the Iranian government.

00:27:09,218 --> 00:27:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  or the Iranian economy is losing because of slowing the internet.

00:27:13,314 --> 00:27:14,439
SPEAKER_0:  plus the frustration.

00:27:14,439 --> 00:27:15,166
SPEAKER_1:  is growing.

00:27:15,682 --> 00:27:16,254
SPEAKER_1:  because

00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  You can't order food.

00:27:18,978 --> 00:27:21,694
SPEAKER_0:  Among others. Right. I mean, they are-

00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:24,926
SPEAKER_0:  They are in touch with...

00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  What's up?

00:27:26,338 --> 00:27:27,998
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, every Iranian.

00:27:29,442 --> 00:27:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  virtually every run yet

00:27:31,106 --> 00:27:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  that has education and education in the sense that has gone through.

00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:42,549
SPEAKER_0:  the high schools and universities knows how to use the WhatsApp.

00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:43,838
SPEAKER_1:  big middle class.

00:27:44,098 --> 00:27:47,614
SPEAKER_1:  Like you said, secular class in Iran and there.

00:27:48,098 --> 00:27:52,542
SPEAKER_1:  There's a lot of at least capacity for, if not revolution, then.

00:27:53,218 --> 00:27:53,758
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:27:54,594 --> 00:27:56,734
SPEAKER_1:  political, ideological.

00:27:58,690 --> 00:27:59,326
SPEAKER_1:  turmoil.

00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  and a huge amount of hatred.

00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:04,734
SPEAKER_0:  So the hatred has grown. Yes, hatred of the-

00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  of the policies.

00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  of the regime.

00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  of isolation?

00:28:10,498 --> 00:28:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  That's a huge point that you hear a great deal about.

00:28:15,042 --> 00:28:19,742
SPEAKER_0:  We don't want to be isolated. We don't want to be humiliated. Iran is not about...

00:28:20,386 --> 00:28:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  this.

00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  this miserable regime.

00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  that is ruling over us.

00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  We have a great culture, so there's a sense of pride.

00:28:30,882 --> 00:28:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  in their own...

00:28:32,226 --> 00:28:34,526
SPEAKER_0:  culture some of it, you know.

00:28:35,138 --> 00:28:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  Islamic, somewhat pre-Islamic.

00:28:37,506 --> 00:28:39,646
SPEAKER_0:  So there's a huge...

00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  a sense of pride in that.

00:28:42,594 --> 00:28:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  and they see that.

00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  They cannot.

00:28:45,218 --> 00:28:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  communicate with the outside world.

00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  They want to travel.

00:28:50,082 --> 00:28:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  abroad which they do.

00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:53,790
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, for one thing...

00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  The Iranian regime never actually...

00:28:56,674 --> 00:28:58,686
SPEAKER_0:  for the majority of the population.

00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,494
SPEAKER_0:  never put restrictions. it's not like

00:29:02,818 --> 00:29:04,830
SPEAKER_0:  Where is it? Union, where you have to-

00:29:05,218 --> 00:29:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  Have it.

00:29:06,082 --> 00:29:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  used to have it.

00:29:08,034 --> 00:29:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  permission to move from one place to another.

00:29:10,786 --> 00:29:12,254
SPEAKER_0:  And then of course...

00:29:12,578 --> 00:29:12,894
SPEAKER_0:  deep.

00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  The Islamic regime since 1979 basically...

00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  I chased away or destroyed the old middle class. It's my generation basically.

00:29:22,914 --> 00:29:23,902
SPEAKER_0:  My parents, they are the shit.

00:29:24,194 --> 00:29:24,926
SPEAKER_0:  This is the D.

00:29:25,314 --> 00:29:27,454
SPEAKER_0:  secular middle class of the Pahlavi era.

00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  in the hope that they can do this social engineering and create this.

00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:32,894
SPEAKER_0:  Islamic

00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  Alright.

00:29:34,466 --> 00:29:35,902
SPEAKER_0:  society of the world.

00:29:36,866 --> 00:29:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  The bad news for them.

00:29:38,914 --> 00:29:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  was that that didn't happen.

00:29:41,442 --> 00:29:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  and that memory.

00:29:43,362 --> 00:29:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  Persistent.

00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:48,542
SPEAKER_0:  the middle class that was created since past 40 years.

00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,230
SPEAKER_0:  is much larger in size.

00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  than what it was because there was...

00:29:54,338 --> 00:29:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  Of course, the demographic revolution. That's the, that's the big.

00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  there's a very foundation of it, it's the demographic revolution.

00:30:01,922 --> 00:30:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  population in Iran, I've written an article about it actually.

00:30:05,826 --> 00:30:07,422
SPEAKER_0:  population in Iran.

00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,054
SPEAKER_0:  Rip

00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  The turn of the century, last century, that's 20th century.

00:30:13,858 --> 00:30:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  Population of Iran was about 9 million or so.

00:30:18,018 --> 00:30:19,582
SPEAKER_0:  is now 83 million.

00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,814
SPEAKER_0:  And that is.

00:30:23,074 --> 00:30:26,686
SPEAKER_0:  Since 1979, the population was 35 million.

00:30:27,394 --> 00:30:29,854
SPEAKER_0:  between the past 40 years, it's...

00:30:30,146 --> 00:30:31,070
SPEAKER_0:  Basically, double.

00:30:31,714 --> 00:30:33,342
SPEAKER_0:  So it's 83 million.

00:30:33,602 --> 00:30:34,270
SPEAKER_0:  Although...

00:30:34,946 --> 00:30:40,190
SPEAKER_0:  One of the great successes, I don't want to bore you with the details about the

00:30:40,514 --> 00:30:48,062
SPEAKER_0:  Demography, but it's important in demographics is not born. You will you can see that.

00:30:48,962 --> 00:30:50,462
SPEAKER_0:  The birth rate was very high.

00:30:50,722 --> 00:30:54,462
SPEAKER_0:  Otherwise, you wouldn't have doubled your population in a matter of four decades.

00:30:54,946 --> 00:30:56,286
SPEAKER_0:  But Iranians...

00:30:56,546 --> 00:30:58,014
SPEAKER_0:  because of the AirBan.

00:30:59,138 --> 00:31:01,758
SPEAKER_0:  shift to an urban population.

00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  because of the growth of them.

00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:04,542
SPEAKER_0:  be there for us.

00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:06,398
SPEAKER_0:  Because of the education.

00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  day.

00:31:08,674 --> 00:31:09,342
SPEAKER_0:  Basically.

00:31:09,858 --> 00:31:11,198
SPEAKER_0:  the pattern of the...

00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:14,686
SPEAKER_0:  of population growth change.

00:31:14,978 --> 00:31:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  Iran used to be...

00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:19,966
SPEAKER_0:  2.8 or 3%?

00:31:20,642 --> 00:31:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  Best rates?

00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,934
SPEAKER_0:  in around 1980s.

00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  I would say 1970s, 1980s.

00:31:27,202 --> 00:31:27,902
SPEAKER_0:  No.

00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  It is 1.1.

00:31:31,138 --> 00:31:34,974
SPEAKER_0:  and it's probably the most successful country in the...

00:31:35,362 --> 00:31:36,766
SPEAKER_0:  Middle East in terms of the

00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,174
SPEAKER_0:  population control.

00:31:38,402 --> 00:31:40,158
SPEAKER_0:  despite the government.

00:31:41,186 --> 00:31:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  a consistent.

00:31:43,394 --> 00:31:45,278
SPEAKER_0:  I attempt to try to

00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  encourage people to have more kids.

00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,006
SPEAKER_0:  middle-class refuses to do that.

00:31:51,842 --> 00:31:54,878
SPEAKER_0:  And this is middle class not only anymore in the capital.

00:31:55,746 --> 00:32:00,638
SPEAKER_0:  but this is very smaller towns and cities, places that used to be villages.

00:32:01,282 --> 00:32:02,686
SPEAKER_0:  Now you look at them, they have a-

00:32:03,106 --> 00:32:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  decent population, 50,000, 100,000.

00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  and they live an urban life and they don't want to be.

00:32:11,298 --> 00:32:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  subjected to that old pattern of agrarian society.

00:32:15,298 --> 00:32:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  when you had 10 children or 8 children.

00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:20,094
SPEAKER_0:  And of course it's a much more.

00:32:20,642 --> 00:32:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  advanced in

00:32:22,146 --> 00:32:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  terms of.

00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of

00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,166
SPEAKER_0:  health and medicine.

00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:32,094
SPEAKER_0:  so you don't lose children as they used to. The antibiotics, there's always a...

00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,654
SPEAKER_0:  kids to survive.

00:32:34,914 --> 00:32:37,886
SPEAKER_0:  And therefore, if you have 10 kids, you stick with 10 kids.

00:32:38,114 --> 00:32:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  You don't.

00:32:38,786 --> 00:32:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  end up with four as it used to be in the past.

00:32:41,506 --> 00:32:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  I'm s-

00:32:43,042 --> 00:32:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  Six of them would have died in the press.

00:32:46,018 --> 00:32:47,742
SPEAKER_0:  up to the age of five actually.

00:32:48,162 --> 00:32:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  But no, because of that...

00:32:50,338 --> 00:32:51,710
SPEAKER_0:  You see that this...

00:32:51,938 --> 00:32:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  urban population in the cities have completely different demands.

00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  And of course the education is important. That's another area of-

00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  how the social engineering.

00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  of the Islamic Republic.

00:33:05,538 --> 00:33:07,070
SPEAKER_0:  went array because

00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:09,278
SPEAKER_0:  They were thinking that, you know, the...

00:33:09,762 --> 00:33:11,422
SPEAKER_0:  growth of the population.

00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:14,558
SPEAKER_0:  the growth of the educated, higher educated.

00:33:15,074 --> 00:33:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  Middle classes in there.

00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,006
SPEAKER_0:  benefit or they could not even

00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  control it.

00:33:20,578 --> 00:33:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  in a sense.

00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:22,270
SPEAKER_0:  No!

00:33:22,498 --> 00:33:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  Iran in my time.

00:33:24,034 --> 00:33:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  Probably had.

00:33:26,818 --> 00:33:27,582
SPEAKER_0:  in the...

00:33:28,162 --> 00:33:29,470
SPEAKER_0:  1970s.

00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  probably by the time of the revolution, there are 10, 12 universities.

00:33:34,402 --> 00:33:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  And now it has

00:33:35,394 --> 00:33:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  56 universities all across the country.

00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  and there is a-

00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  something you refer to as the free university, IZAD.

00:33:44,162 --> 00:33:49,758
SPEAKER_0:  which has campuses all over the country. It has 324 campuses all around Iran.

00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:51,998
SPEAKER_0:  What does that mean?

00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:55,294
SPEAKER_0:  In many respects, this youth

00:33:56,322 --> 00:33:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  that were brought up in these families.

00:33:59,074 --> 00:34:02,398
SPEAKER_0:  even in small towns in very traditional families.

00:34:02,722 --> 00:34:06,974
SPEAKER_0:  in families that belong to that kind of a more religious.

00:34:07,618 --> 00:34:08,894
SPEAKER_0:  loyal to the...

00:34:09,666 --> 00:34:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  clergy or to the clerical classes.

00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,142
SPEAKER_0:  their children.

00:34:15,106 --> 00:34:18,302
SPEAKER_0:  can now move on, particularly women.

00:34:18,946 --> 00:34:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  because in my times it would have been...

00:34:21,314 --> 00:34:22,238
SPEAKER_0:  unheard of.

00:34:22,818 --> 00:34:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  that you would have a young woman of 18 or.

00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  17, 18, 19.

00:34:28,962 --> 00:34:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  uh, from...

00:34:30,754 --> 00:34:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  A traditional city such as, for instance, Yazd or in...

00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,174
SPEAKER_0:  South East and Iran.

00:34:39,842 --> 00:34:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  to move on elsewhere for education, as you do in this country.

00:34:44,322 --> 00:34:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

00:34:45,218 --> 00:34:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  No!

00:34:46,146 --> 00:34:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  It's completely accepted.

00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  That's.

00:34:49,314 --> 00:34:50,078
SPEAKER_0:  A woman?

00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:53,662
SPEAKER_0:  wears hijab because he's forced to wear hijab.

00:34:54,466 --> 00:34:56,382
SPEAKER_0:  to go to a university.

00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,718
SPEAKER_0:  completely on the other side of the country.

00:34:59,746 --> 00:35:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  And this movement of the population...

00:35:03,074 --> 00:35:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  not only because of the universities, but in general.

00:35:06,818 --> 00:35:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  If you now visit Iran,

00:35:09,538 --> 00:35:10,718
SPEAKER_0:  You hear?

00:35:11,074 --> 00:35:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  Accents.

00:35:12,322 --> 00:35:13,566
SPEAKER_0:  local accents.

00:35:13,826 --> 00:35:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  Provisional accents.

00:35:15,522 --> 00:35:16,510
SPEAKER_0:  all over the country.

00:35:17,346 --> 00:35:18,654
SPEAKER_0:  That is a

00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,406
SPEAKER_0:  Azerbaijani Turkish accent.

00:35:21,826 --> 00:35:22,686
SPEAKER_0:  from the north.

00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:26,686
SPEAKER_0:  the rest of the country, you can hear it in the first province in the south.

00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  and vice versa.

00:35:29,186 --> 00:35:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:35:30,306 --> 00:35:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  and Kurdish for instance, or even more marginal regions such as Sistan province.

00:35:36,546 --> 00:35:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  Ehh

00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  society stuff you know.

00:35:38,978 --> 00:35:45,534
SPEAKER_0:  which has been the subject of this recent massacre, when they actually attacked the population when demonstrating.

00:35:45,858 --> 00:35:48,446
SPEAKER_0:  and kill the fair number of at least 60 people.

00:35:50,306 --> 00:35:50,846
SPEAKER_0:  So...

00:35:51,906 --> 00:35:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  This movement of the population...

00:35:54,626 --> 00:35:55,710
SPEAKER_0:  I think this.

00:35:55,970 --> 00:36:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  The creation of a larger middle class, the better educated middle class, much better educated. Iran has-

00:36:02,722 --> 00:36:04,638
SPEAKER_0:  86%

00:36:05,058 --> 00:36:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  literacy.

00:36:07,554 --> 00:36:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  which

00:36:09,058 --> 00:36:12,926
SPEAKER_0:  I think probably, I haven't checked that, but probably is better than Turkey even.

00:36:13,634 --> 00:36:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  is probably better than anywhere else in the Middle East.

00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,270
SPEAKER_1:  And it sounds like there's a.

00:36:18,626 --> 00:36:19,998
SPEAKER_1:  that's quickly increasing.

00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:23,889
SPEAKER_1:  So because of the movement, because of the growth of the education system.

00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:25,310
SPEAKER_0:  and that's...... United States Device.

00:36:25,794 --> 00:36:27,454
SPEAKER_0:  Iran has one million

00:36:28,002 --> 00:36:28,926
SPEAKER_0:  School teachers.

00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:30,462
SPEAKER_0:  Which.

00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  may not seem as much if you're in the United States, but it's a fairly big number.

00:36:35,746 --> 00:36:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  Thank you.

00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:37,886
SPEAKER_0:  Can you linger on the massacre?

00:36:38,338 --> 00:36:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  What happened there? The-

00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:42,206
SPEAKER_0:  Sistan province is a balooch.

00:36:42,594 --> 00:36:43,806
SPEAKER_0:  ethnicity.

00:36:44,194 --> 00:36:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  of Paluch ethnicity.

00:36:45,794 --> 00:36:46,750
SPEAKER_0:  Palooch is a

00:36:47,682 --> 00:36:52,414
SPEAKER_0:  particular ethnic group in southern Iran, which is so nearer to the Shia.

00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  Majority.

00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:55,463
SPEAKER_0:  And we should say that most

00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,510
SPEAKER_1:  of Iran.

00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:59,134
SPEAKER_1:  Is she and those are

00:36:59,554 --> 00:37:01,566
SPEAKER_1:  That's a branch of Islam.

00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,655
SPEAKER_0:  She is M, yes. Let's maybe-

00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:07,486
SPEAKER_1:  We just briefly linger Shizam and Suni.

00:37:08,162 --> 00:37:13,278
SPEAKER_0:  Just let's not get into it. Yeah, let's do it. Let's do a one sentence summary.

00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,695
SPEAKER_0:  uh... and

00:37:14,695 --> 00:37:18,445
SPEAKER_1:  that maybe which is what most of Iran.

00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  The majority of the population of the Muslim world

00:37:22,082 --> 00:37:23,006
SPEAKER_0:  our sunnies.

00:37:24,066 --> 00:37:26,334
SPEAKER_0:  These are main strips if you like.

00:37:27,618 --> 00:37:30,366
SPEAKER_0:  Actually, stone now means that kind of a ministry.

00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  Can you actually linger on the-

00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,270
SPEAKER_1:  The Sunni Sunnah

00:37:35,202 --> 00:37:37,630
SPEAKER_0:  She, she, uh, she, I mean.

00:37:38,178 --> 00:37:38,782
SPEAKER_0:  party.

00:37:39,202 --> 00:37:40,158
SPEAKER_0:  Miz Dus tomar

00:37:40,386 --> 00:37:42,654
SPEAKER_0:  that belongs to a party of Ali.

00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,630
SPEAKER_0:  which goes back to the early Islamic history of...

00:37:45,922 --> 00:37:47,797
SPEAKER_0:  7th century. A minute.

00:37:47,797 --> 00:37:51,547
SPEAKER_1:  I'm almost lingering to the silly notion of pronunciation and stuff like that.

00:37:51,547 --> 00:37:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah

00:37:52,418 --> 00:37:53,543
SPEAKER_0:  the the the the

00:37:53,543 --> 00:37:56,543
SPEAKER_1:  part like what what is the extra eye

00:37:56,543 --> 00:37:57,694
SPEAKER_0:  at the end.

00:37:57,986 --> 00:37:59,742
SPEAKER_0:  She is

00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  belonging to the Shi'i community.

00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:04,574
SPEAKER_0:  She and me is a person.

00:38:04,994 --> 00:38:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  of this year.

00:38:06,146 --> 00:38:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  that belong to that community. Are you Asian?

00:38:08,482 --> 00:38:09,342
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, I'm a Shia.

00:38:09,602 --> 00:38:15,934
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, and she is the community. Community. And in English, when it was anglicized, it becomes Shiite.

00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  So if you say Shiite in today...

00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  It's perfectly acceptable.

00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:23,902
SPEAKER_0:  And of course, I myself in my writings, I always...

00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:28,734
SPEAKER_0:  switch between one and the other. one of my books is always shite.

00:38:28,962 --> 00:38:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, the book's always she.

00:38:30,946 --> 00:38:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  Ed.

00:38:31,746 --> 00:38:33,534
SPEAKER_0:  That hasn't been settled.

00:38:33,858 --> 00:38:35,390
SPEAKER_0:  But the sheep population...

00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  is the smaller compared to the Sunni population in the world. In the world. In the world. But in Iran it's the opposite.

00:38:42,786 --> 00:38:44,606
SPEAKER_0:  The Iran and Iraq

00:38:45,154 --> 00:38:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  and possibly not Lebanon.

00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  Are there three countries who...

00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  Barely.

00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I can...

00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  Lebanon have barely majority chi.

00:38:55,522 --> 00:38:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  population.

00:38:56,738 --> 00:38:57,790
SPEAKER_0:  Whereas the-

00:38:58,082 --> 00:38:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  Iran is

00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:02,526
SPEAKER_0:  large Shi'i population due to its...

00:39:02,978 --> 00:39:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  History of conversion to she's end that by itself is another story.

00:39:07,106 --> 00:39:07,902
SPEAKER_0:  But...

00:39:08,226 --> 00:39:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  in the sense that

00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:14,014
SPEAKER_0:  the way that historically it evolved.

00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:15,518
SPEAKER_0:  The center.

00:39:16,066 --> 00:39:17,118
SPEAKER_0:  became mushy.

00:39:18,114 --> 00:39:19,390
SPEAKER_0:  and the peripheries.

00:39:20,098 --> 00:39:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  remained.

00:39:21,538 --> 00:39:22,078
SPEAKER_0:  Sydney.

00:39:22,498 --> 00:39:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  So you have communities of the Baluch in the southeast.

00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  You have the curds?

00:39:28,674 --> 00:39:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  a large portion of the carrots.

00:39:31,042 --> 00:39:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  Are sir knees?

00:39:32,674 --> 00:39:38,750
SPEAKER_0:  They have she's as well. Then they have the indigenous religion of their own, at least called ah dangerous on

00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:40,222
SPEAKER_0:  which is the religion.

00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  Of indigenous to cooperative style.

00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:45,950
SPEAKER_0:  There are Turkiyamans in the northeast of Iran.

00:39:46,434 --> 00:39:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  or also

00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:50,110
SPEAKER_0:  So nice to other communities in Khorasan region.

00:39:50,498 --> 00:39:52,638
SPEAKER_0:  in the peripheries of Afghanistan.

00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  they are all Serbs.

00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  and you have some Arab

00:39:56,994 --> 00:40:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  population, Arab speaking population in the Khuzestan province.

00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  in the south-west of Iran.

00:40:02,626 --> 00:40:04,638
SPEAKER_0:  which is also all across the Persian Gulf.

00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  Is there a lot of conflict between these regions? And also.

00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:10,718
SPEAKER_1:  Like if I blindfolded you.

00:40:11,138 --> 00:40:19,135
SPEAKER_1:  and dropped you off in one of the regions. Would you quickly recognize the region? By the food, by the music, by the accents.

00:40:19,135 --> 00:40:19,870
SPEAKER_0:  So on

00:40:20,258 --> 00:40:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, the answer to your...

00:40:21,762 --> 00:40:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  lovely question, which I think, I hope it would have happened to me, is that yes?

00:40:27,522 --> 00:40:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  You would see different cultures. Yes.

00:40:30,466 --> 00:40:30,782
SPEAKER_0:  But-

00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  different food, most important, different accents.

00:40:35,746 --> 00:40:36,990
SPEAKER_0:  or different languages.

00:40:37,506 --> 00:40:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  Since they have dialects, there's Baluches and...

00:40:39,874 --> 00:40:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  different languages altogether.

00:40:42,594 --> 00:40:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  But-

00:40:43,906 --> 00:40:50,014
SPEAKER_0:  or so for that matter Kurdish, which is closer to Persian because they are Indo-European languages.

00:40:50,754 --> 00:40:51,134
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:56,254
SPEAKER_0:  But Turkish, Azeri Turkish, which is probably closer to the Turkish of Teke.

00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:00,574
SPEAKER_0:  Republic of Turkey or to the Republic of Azerbaijan in the North.

00:41:01,538 --> 00:41:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  What's there?

00:41:02,242 --> 00:41:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  They're the same.

00:41:03,138 --> 00:41:03,710
SPEAKER_0:  basically.

00:41:04,386 --> 00:41:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  Actually, if you would have looked.

00:41:06,594 --> 00:41:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  That's fascinating.

00:41:07,906 --> 00:41:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  picture.

00:41:08,738 --> 00:41:13,310
SPEAKER_0:  if you have looked at the, let's say even 19th century, early 20th century.

00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:16,830
SPEAKER_0:  linguistic map of Iran, you would have been amazed.

00:41:17,634 --> 00:41:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  in the number of dialects, in the number of languages that have survived. This is an ancient country, it's an ancient land.

00:41:25,122 --> 00:41:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  and it's a lot of mountains all around it or big deserts.

00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  So there's a sense of isolation. So you would say here and there, you see a different community.

00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  that speaks differently.

00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  All ancient.

00:41:38,722 --> 00:41:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  Traditions and languages. Yeah. And because of the great number of invasions that Iran witnessed.

00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  Over.

00:41:45,474 --> 00:41:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  more than two and a half.

00:41:47,682 --> 00:41:48,766
SPEAKER_0:  uh... millennia

00:41:49,538 --> 00:41:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  Of course, there are all kinds of cultures that were introduced into Iran. And, because of the

00:41:54,274 --> 00:41:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  Ethnicities were introduced to Iran.

00:41:57,122 --> 00:41:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  mostly coming from the north.

00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  East of Iran from

00:42:01,954 --> 00:42:03,262
SPEAKER_0:  from the...

00:42:03,906 --> 00:42:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  lowlands of Central Asia and beyond.

00:42:06,786 --> 00:42:07,390
SPEAKER_0:  I'm

00:42:07,778 --> 00:42:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  and continued into Iran proper.

00:42:10,306 --> 00:42:10,654
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:14,590
SPEAKER_0:  But now what has happened, that's my point that I wanted to make.

00:42:15,138 --> 00:42:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  century of modernity or modernization.

00:42:20,258 --> 00:42:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  has produced.

00:42:22,946 --> 00:42:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  a national culture.

00:42:25,026 --> 00:42:30,334
SPEAKER_0:  of great strength in a sense. I would say I ended my book.

00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:34,270
SPEAKER_0:  the book on Iran, Iran and Modern History.

00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:40,222
SPEAKER_0:  Basically saying that despite everything else that has created so much trouble for today's Iran

00:42:40,674 --> 00:42:43,134
SPEAKER_0:  There is a sense of a cultural.

00:42:43,938 --> 00:42:44,318
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:42:44,706 --> 00:42:45,630
SPEAKER_0:  identity.

00:42:46,178 --> 00:42:47,390
SPEAKER_0:  that is very strong.

00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,150
SPEAKER_0:  and they think.

00:42:49,922 --> 00:42:51,134
SPEAKER_0:  I can say...

00:42:51,874 --> 00:42:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  with.

00:42:52,546 --> 00:42:53,982
SPEAKER_0:  with some confidence.

00:42:54,626 --> 00:42:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  that despite this

00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  despite these regional identities that are still there and they're great and they should be celebrated.

00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  Uh

00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  This situation.

00:43:06,402 --> 00:43:07,774
SPEAKER_0:  Today if you go to...

00:43:08,098 --> 00:43:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  to Kurdistan or if you go to

00:43:12,098 --> 00:43:15,006
SPEAKER_0:  in the system, they all can speak Persian.

00:43:15,522 --> 00:43:17,694
SPEAKER_0:  They all have an education in Persia.

00:43:18,242 --> 00:43:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  So they all basically...

00:43:20,546 --> 00:43:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  are becoming part of...

00:43:22,242 --> 00:43:25,278
SPEAKER_0:  whether they like the regime in power or not.

00:43:25,986 --> 00:43:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  They have

00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:31,646
SPEAKER_0:  a sense of belonging to a culture and an identity with the center.

00:43:32,226 --> 00:43:33,342
SPEAKER_0:  And of course the idea.

00:43:33,858 --> 00:43:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  of a center versus periphery in Iran is very old.

00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:40,542
SPEAKER_0:  goes back to ancient times because

00:43:40,834 --> 00:43:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  even the name of the country.

00:43:43,106 --> 00:43:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  was the guarded domains of Iran. This is the.

00:43:45,858 --> 00:43:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  This is dude.

00:43:46,722 --> 00:43:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  Official name of Mamalek Mahrooseh of Iran

00:43:50,242 --> 00:43:51,070
SPEAKER_0:

00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  It was recognized.

00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:55,358
SPEAKER_0:  that this is not just one.

00:43:55,906 --> 00:43:56,350
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:43:56,962 --> 00:43:58,078
SPEAKER_0:  entity but is the

00:43:58,754 --> 00:44:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  It's a collection of entities like the United States of America. Exactly.

00:44:03,746 --> 00:44:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  Exactly.

00:44:04,802 --> 00:44:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  But the United States of America...

00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:13,278
SPEAKER_0:  In a sense, you can say that it was a very successful, well, it remains to be seen how successful.

00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  to be continued. To be, to, that was basically invented, created.

00:44:19,938 --> 00:44:21,694
SPEAKER_0:  you would have this sense of it.

00:44:21,954 --> 00:44:26,334
SPEAKER_0:  In the case of an old nation, which has been on the map of the world for

00:44:26,594 --> 00:44:29,118
SPEAKER_0:  3,000 years, 2,500 years.

00:44:29,378 --> 00:44:29,726
SPEAKER_0:  There's-

00:44:30,018 --> 00:44:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  This is not an exaggeration, I'm not it.

00:44:32,418 --> 00:44:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  nationalists per se.

00:44:35,554 --> 00:44:37,630
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, if you look at Persia and the map...

00:44:37,954 --> 00:44:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  of the world in ancient times is still there.

00:44:40,482 --> 00:44:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  as it is today.

00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  Very few countries in the world are like that.

00:44:44,738 --> 00:44:46,878
SPEAKER_0:  that they would have that kind of a continuity.

00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  over a course of time.

00:44:48,514 --> 00:44:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  And that's not without a reason, because there was this sense of a

00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:53,790
SPEAKER_0:  installed, we wanted closely use that rag to prevent it getting stuck

00:44:54,082 --> 00:44:55,678
SPEAKER_0:  Center versus periphery.

00:44:56,098 --> 00:44:57,118
SPEAKER_0:  that had found

00:44:57,474 --> 00:45:02,014
SPEAKER_0:  There is a huge amount of tension, but there is also a sense of belonging.

00:45:02,594 --> 00:45:05,214
SPEAKER_0:  to something and state is very much at the center of it.

00:45:05,794 --> 00:45:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  I mean.

00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:09,790
SPEAKER_0:  That's why the concept of a

00:45:10,178 --> 00:45:13,790
SPEAKER_0:  State matters for the creation, for the shaping.

00:45:14,434 --> 00:45:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  of this culture. What happened is therefore,

00:45:17,282 --> 00:45:19,294
SPEAKER_0:  You can see that today in answer to your

00:45:19,522 --> 00:45:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  point about traveling.

00:45:21,474 --> 00:45:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  Blindfolded.

00:45:23,426 --> 00:45:24,254
SPEAKER_0:  is that...

00:45:25,346 --> 00:45:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  you would be surprised to see how much.

00:45:29,282 --> 00:45:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  people share.

00:45:32,514 --> 00:45:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  and in terms of

00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:35,582
SPEAKER_0:  I just give you one anecdote.

00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  it.

00:45:36,642 --> 00:45:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  in 1960.

00:45:40,578 --> 00:45:41,086
SPEAKER_0:  8

00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:42,686
SPEAKER_0:  I believe, must have been.

00:45:43,522 --> 00:45:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  I traveled to Azerbaijan. I used to travel and actually photograph. Not blindfolded.

00:45:48,834 --> 00:45:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  Mostly. Well, yeah, not flash-poisoned. Sometimes. Not flash-poisoned, no, no, not flash-poisoned.

00:45:54,018 --> 00:45:56,030
SPEAKER_0:  So I went to a bazaar

00:45:56,482 --> 00:45:59,742
SPEAKER_0:  in the city of Ghoi, which is in the...

00:46:00,034 --> 00:46:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  northwestern Iran.

00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:04,830
SPEAKER_0:  on the border with what is today the...

00:46:05,538 --> 00:46:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  Republic of Turkey.

00:46:08,514 --> 00:46:13,662
SPEAKER_0:  And I went to the bazaar and I was interested in the kind of leather work that they produced.

00:46:14,882 --> 00:46:18,302
SPEAKER_0:  So I tried to buy some stuff and they were surprised to see that.

00:46:18,658 --> 00:46:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  how few people knew Persia.

00:46:21,986 --> 00:46:25,630
SPEAKER_0:  so they could not communicate in Persian with you.

00:46:26,114 --> 00:46:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  Either they have to.

00:46:27,394 --> 00:46:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  Ask somebody from...

00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  some other store to come and translate for you.

00:46:32,578 --> 00:46:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  This is 1968. So even though it's the official.

00:46:37,218 --> 00:46:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  language.

00:46:38,658 --> 00:46:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  Especially

00:46:40,002 --> 00:46:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  of the country, they're still.

00:46:42,146 --> 00:46:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. So what are they teaching school? So it doesn't matter.

00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  But this guy... He doesn't go to school.

00:46:48,098 --> 00:46:51,646
SPEAKER_0:  He hasn't been to the school or he was not fully exposed to it.

00:46:51,906 --> 00:46:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  And bazaars usually are very conservative places.

00:46:55,266 --> 00:46:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  It's stuck in my mind.

00:46:57,122 --> 00:46:57,694
SPEAKER_0:  No.

00:46:58,114 --> 00:46:58,526
SPEAKER_0:  in

00:46:58,818 --> 00:47:01,278
SPEAKER_0:  Recently in 2004 I was...

00:47:01,602 --> 00:47:04,126
SPEAKER_0:  traveling to the same area, not to the same city.

00:47:04,546 --> 00:47:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  but to the same area.

00:47:06,626 --> 00:47:07,134
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  I was amazed to see how the youth...

00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  as soon as they would know that you're coming from somewhere else.

00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  Opening conversation with you talking about the latest movies that was produced in the West and it's not only Hollywood. Of course there's the huge amount of

00:47:24,194 --> 00:47:26,334
SPEAKER_0:  Fascination with Hollywood and Western.

00:47:26,562 --> 00:47:28,734
SPEAKER_0:  Cinema. Cinema is a major thing.

00:47:29,282 --> 00:47:30,782
SPEAKER_0:  Filmmaking is a major thing.

00:47:31,618 --> 00:47:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  Sorry, these kids in the city of Ahar.

00:47:34,754 --> 00:47:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  They're asking me if we're having lunch.

00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  and asking me, okay, then what do you think about?

00:47:40,546 --> 00:47:41,406
SPEAKER_0:  producer.

00:47:41,634 --> 00:47:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  not producer, this director

00:47:43,714 --> 00:47:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  or that actor.

00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  American. American European as well, but mostly American.

00:47:49,314 --> 00:47:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  Were they speaking Persian? It's a complete Persian that's-

00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  I would converse with them.

00:47:54,882 --> 00:48:01,022
SPEAKER_0:  Do they speak English too? Yes, actually you would be surprised to see what percentage of the Iranian youth

00:48:01,762 --> 00:48:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  at least in big cities.

00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:07,550
SPEAKER_0:  are fascinated with learning language and for a reason.

00:48:07,906 --> 00:48:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  because they think that's the way to get access.

00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  either on social media or eventually leave Iran.

00:48:13,922 --> 00:48:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  Unfortunately.

00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:48:16,482 --> 00:48:20,702
SPEAKER_0:  And because they don't see a future for themselves in the country, either you have to be.

00:48:20,994 --> 00:48:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  part of this.

00:48:22,914 --> 00:48:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  part of this regime.

00:48:25,122 --> 00:48:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  or if you hate them and you don't like the way of their life.

00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:31,102
SPEAKER_0:  You look up outside.

00:48:31,746 --> 00:48:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  I was having drivers to drive me around the country, in the cities around Tehran.

00:48:37,698 --> 00:48:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  And the guy was young, extremely...

00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  well-educated, well-dressed. We would have looked at him, we could have found him in any street.

00:48:46,754 --> 00:48:48,350
SPEAKER_0:  any country in the Western world.

00:48:48,834 --> 00:48:52,382
SPEAKER_0:  and his major concern knowing that I'm from outside.

00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  Major concern is, well, tell me which would be a better place for me to go.

00:48:58,146 --> 00:49:00,574
SPEAKER_0:  So what's wrong with the place that you're in right now?

00:49:01,026 --> 00:49:03,710
SPEAKER_0:  You are in your own country, you speak your own language.

00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:04,830
SPEAKER_0:  So good.

00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:09,150
SPEAKER_0:  I have to have a better future. This has no future for me.

00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:11,486
SPEAKER_0:  Well, it's really interesting because.

00:49:11,906 --> 00:49:14,366
SPEAKER_1:  the thing I feel about the protests right now.

00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:17,918
SPEAKER_1:  is there's a large number of people.

00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:19,294
SPEAKER_0:  that.

00:49:19,554 --> 00:49:20,679
SPEAKER_0:  instead of giving into sin.

00:49:20,679 --> 00:49:21,214
SPEAKER_1:

00:49:21,922 --> 00:49:22,526
SPEAKER_1:  about

00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:25,045
SPEAKER_1:  You know, this government is no good.

00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:25,726
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:49:26,114 --> 00:49:27,239
SPEAKER_0:  they're actually getting

00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  this like.

00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:49:29,122 --> 00:49:30,014
SPEAKER_0:  energy.

00:49:30,242 --> 00:49:32,117
SPEAKER_0:  this desire to forever.

00:49:32,117 --> 00:49:32,702
SPEAKER_1:  evolution.

00:49:34,466 --> 00:49:40,350
SPEAKER_1:  in the sort of non-violent, in the democratic sense of that. Let's.

00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:47,230
SPEAKER_1:  Let's actually find the ideas. Let's build a great nation here. This is a great nation. This is my nation. Let's build something great here.

00:49:47,394 --> 00:49:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  Well...

00:49:48,578 --> 00:49:51,070
SPEAKER_0:  That's my hope. That's the outside. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:49:51,554 --> 00:49:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  That's what I'm hoping for. I share your-

00:49:54,594 --> 00:49:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

00:49:55,682 --> 00:49:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  aspiration.

00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  but I'm fearing that.

00:49:58,818 --> 00:50:00,638
SPEAKER_0:  I hope it's not a wishful thinking.

00:50:01,698 --> 00:50:03,166
SPEAKER_0:  certainly that's what they want.

00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  Certainly that's what they want to create.

00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:09,822
SPEAKER_0:  But the historian always tells you from...

00:50:10,082 --> 00:50:11,198
SPEAKER_0:  Where they start?

00:50:11,778 --> 00:50:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  to where they finish.

00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  there is going to be a huge...

00:50:15,906 --> 00:50:16,798
SPEAKER_0:  Kinda fake.

00:50:17,762 --> 00:50:18,302
SPEAKER_0:  change.

00:50:18,946 --> 00:50:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  And in this.

00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  particular case.

00:50:22,082 --> 00:50:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  I wouldn't be...

00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  I would very much hope that it's not going to be a revolution like the 1979 Islamic revolution.

00:50:30,274 --> 00:50:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  and I have my hopes.

00:50:32,034 --> 00:50:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  And that's it.

00:50:33,122 --> 00:50:36,414
SPEAKER_0:  For one thing, this is a revolution that doesn't have a leader.

00:50:37,186 --> 00:50:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  and it seems that they're comfortable with that.

00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  at least so far, because we are six weeks of this.

00:50:45,346 --> 00:50:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  And I hope it's not going to be actually a revolution, as I pointed out.

00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:51,998
SPEAKER_0:  I hope it's going to be more of a...

00:50:53,058 --> 00:50:55,102
SPEAKER_0:  sense of trying to come.

00:50:56,098 --> 00:50:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  to some compromise.

00:50:58,466 --> 00:51:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  and gradually moved.

00:51:00,642 --> 00:51:03,454
SPEAKER_0:  to a change rather than a collapse of this.

00:51:04,642 --> 00:51:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  regime and replacement with what?

00:51:07,746 --> 00:51:08,871
SPEAKER_0:  So the anxiety of the...

00:51:08,871 --> 00:51:10,078
SPEAKER_1:  regime you hope.

00:51:10,338 --> 00:51:11,486
SPEAKER_1:  will turn into.

00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:14,942
SPEAKER_1:  a kind of realization that you have to.

00:51:15,554 --> 00:51:20,030
SPEAKER_1:  You have to modernize, you have to make progress, you actually have to make certain compromises.

00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:20,670
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:24,145
SPEAKER_1:  or constitutional changes, all this kind of stuff. So the basic.

00:51:24,145 --> 00:51:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

00:51:24,738 --> 00:51:26,878
SPEAKER_1:  a process of government and

00:51:26,978 --> 00:51:27,646
SPEAKER_0:  lawmaking.

00:51:28,386 --> 00:51:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  The problem is...

00:51:30,498 --> 00:51:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  that they say we have it all.

00:51:32,674 --> 00:51:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

00:51:33,602 --> 00:51:37,150
SPEAKER_0:  We have our parliament, we have our constitution, we have our

00:51:37,442 --> 00:51:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  elections, which has all been, of course.

00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:41,054
SPEAKER_0:  FAKE

00:51:41,442 --> 00:51:43,422
SPEAKER_0:  But they claim they have all of that.

00:51:44,098 --> 00:51:47,582
SPEAKER_0:  But the problem for them is that...

00:51:48,514 --> 00:51:49,470
SPEAKER_0:  day

00:51:51,202 --> 00:51:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  try to superimpose.

00:51:53,858 --> 00:51:56,286
SPEAKER_0:  a certain ideology.

00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,358
SPEAKER_0:  Like all other ideological

00:51:59,682 --> 00:52:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:52:00,482 --> 00:52:01,886
SPEAKER_0:  autocracies or...

00:52:02,338 --> 00:52:04,030
SPEAKER_0:  or tarqueas as in this case.

00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:06,622
SPEAKER_0:  that tend to dominate.

00:52:08,066 --> 00:52:08,670
SPEAKER_0:  all this.

00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:11,070
SPEAKER_0:  institution buildings that

00:52:11,618 --> 00:52:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  They have a date.

00:52:13,122 --> 00:52:15,582
SPEAKER_0:  They constantly claim we have this, we have that.

00:52:16,226 --> 00:52:18,782
SPEAKER_0:  And of course it's a generational thing.

00:52:20,034 --> 00:52:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  the upper echelons.

00:52:21,762 --> 00:52:22,686
SPEAKER_0:  of this.

00:52:23,138 --> 00:52:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  regime.

00:52:24,898 --> 00:52:25,310
SPEAKER_0:  or

00:52:25,602 --> 00:52:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  mostly older people.

00:52:27,906 --> 00:52:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  Tappent!

00:52:29,218 --> 00:52:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  They are crazy.

00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:35,550
SPEAKER_0:  that are afraid of the fact that they may lose their control.

00:52:36,098 --> 00:52:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  over their whole system that is sophisticated, huge.

00:52:39,938 --> 00:52:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  System of government.

00:52:41,698 --> 00:52:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:52:42,914 --> 00:52:46,174
SPEAKER_0:  They rely on certain tools of control.

00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  which is the Revolutionary Guards.

00:52:49,858 --> 00:52:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  and other.

00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:52,350
SPEAKER_0:  other

00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:54,046
SPEAKER_0:  institutions.

00:52:54,466 --> 00:52:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  that are loyal to.

00:52:56,226 --> 00:52:57,022
SPEAKER_0:  to this date.

00:52:57,954 --> 00:53:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  and they spend enormous amount of...

00:53:00,738 --> 00:53:02,750
SPEAKER_0:  funds that is available to them.

00:53:03,106 --> 00:53:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  at least before the sanctions.

00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  but even during the sanctions they still have.

00:53:07,554 --> 00:53:08,062
SPEAKER_0:  Enough.

00:53:08,482 --> 00:53:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  funds to do so.

00:53:10,242 --> 00:53:12,446
SPEAKER_0:  and in order to remain in power.

00:53:13,026 --> 00:53:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  And they are extremely ruthless in that regard.

00:53:16,674 --> 00:53:17,886
SPEAKER_0:  This is nuts.

00:53:18,466 --> 00:53:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  and nice Islamic

00:53:20,578 --> 00:53:21,406
SPEAKER_0:  Fatherly.

00:53:22,274 --> 00:53:22,878
SPEAKER_0:  Regime

00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  This is a regime that's

00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:27,646
SPEAKER_0:  I would see easily in it.

00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

00:53:29,282 --> 00:53:30,750
SPEAKER_0:  clear signs of fascism.

00:53:32,098 --> 00:53:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  Clear, Sansif.

00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  the state control and

00:53:36,514 --> 00:53:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  pay any price to stay in power.

00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  So even violence. Extreme violence.

00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  to return to the massacre.

00:53:43,074 --> 00:53:47,454
SPEAKER_1:  What were the uses of violence to suppress protests?

00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:54,046
SPEAKER_0:  Well, yes, it was actually quite remarkable to see that from the first or the second day of the protest.

00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  You see out in the streets this riot police.

00:53:59,842 --> 00:54:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  which comes out in large numbers.

00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  Fully geared up.

00:54:06,882 --> 00:54:09,022
SPEAKER_0:  Their appearance are rather terrifying.

00:54:09,314 --> 00:54:12,990
SPEAKER_0:  like any other riot police, probably more than any other riot police.

00:54:13,986 --> 00:54:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  they're violent.

00:54:16,674 --> 00:54:23,326
SPEAKER_0:  They stand in the streets when the students are demonstrating, even in smaller numbers.

00:54:23,778 --> 00:54:25,278
SPEAKER_0:  Because before I go to that, I should...

00:54:25,538 --> 00:54:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  point this point, this ought to...

00:54:28,034 --> 00:54:28,926
SPEAKER_0:  you as well.

00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  That's.

00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  that these demonstrations are not.

00:54:33,762 --> 00:54:38,078
SPEAKER_0:  large ones in one place. You don't see 100,000 people in...

00:54:38,338 --> 00:54:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  in one place.

00:54:39,906 --> 00:54:41,598
SPEAKER_0:  But you see in every neighborhood.

00:54:41,858 --> 00:54:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  couple of thousand of kids are.

00:54:44,962 --> 00:54:46,110
SPEAKER_0:  demonstrating.

00:54:46,402 --> 00:54:48,277
SPEAKER_0:  all over Iran

00:54:48,277 --> 00:54:49,027
SPEAKER_1:  all over the world.

00:54:49,027 --> 00:54:50,494
SPEAKER_0:  in different parts.

00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  Actually.

00:54:52,866 --> 00:54:55,710
SPEAKER_0:  during the demonstrations three weeks ago.

00:54:56,322 --> 00:54:59,294
SPEAKER_0:  They, as I said, they had people in...

00:55:00,162 --> 00:55:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  Sydney, Australia, New Zealand, Tokyo.

00:55:03,682 --> 00:55:05,557
SPEAKER_0:  all over the world all protests

00:55:05,557 --> 00:55:07,454
SPEAKER_1:  sing high gas prices, it's funny.

00:55:08,578 --> 00:55:09,118
SPEAKER_0:  Everywhere.

00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:10,718
SPEAKER_0:  Everywhere.

00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  to the extent that they could be ignored, nothing but if they could not be ignored. And it's actually...

00:55:18,722 --> 00:55:25,982
SPEAKER_0:  quite remarkable that this is very embarrassing to them. But somehow they think that this propaganda machine of them is working.

00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:28,414
SPEAKER_1:  I'll say you think they don't have a good even sense.

00:55:28,866 --> 00:55:31,491
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, so there's an incompetence within the problem.

00:55:31,491 --> 00:55:35,326
SPEAKER_0:  Yes it is. There is an incompetence across the board.

00:55:35,618 --> 00:55:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, despite all of this massive...

00:55:39,266 --> 00:55:40,126
SPEAKER_0:  Government.

00:55:40,578 --> 00:55:43,966
SPEAKER_0:  administration or whatever you would call it, all these various

00:55:44,514 --> 00:55:45,630
SPEAKER_0:  components of it.

00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  The easy sense of...

00:55:47,522 --> 00:55:50,494
SPEAKER_0:  there's a sense of inefficiency and incompetence.

00:55:50,978 --> 00:55:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  that is associated with in every action that you see.

00:55:54,114 --> 00:55:55,134
SPEAKER_0:  Even in their

00:55:55,746 --> 00:55:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  suppression of this street movement.

00:55:58,562 --> 00:56:00,670
SPEAKER_0:  But in answer to that question...

00:56:00,994 --> 00:56:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  you would see that they're

00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  This.

00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  Riot police.

00:56:06,178 --> 00:56:07,134
SPEAKER_0:  uh, very-

00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  it's quite obvious that they were trained for the purpose.

00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:11,710
SPEAKER_0:  So this.

00:56:12,002 --> 00:56:13,982
SPEAKER_0:  their appearance, everything. This is just...

00:56:14,498 --> 00:56:15,518
SPEAKER_0:  Regular.

00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:19,038
SPEAKER_0:  army forces or soldiers, conscripts.

00:56:19,362 --> 00:56:19,742
SPEAKER_0:  They are.

00:56:20,066 --> 00:56:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  professional.

00:56:21,346 --> 00:56:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  forces.

00:56:22,338 --> 00:56:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  and they come.

00:56:23,522 --> 00:56:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  not only on foot number.

00:56:27,682 --> 00:56:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  but they come on motorbikes.

00:56:29,538 --> 00:56:32,350
SPEAKER_0:  So you would see any of these demonstrations there.

00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:35,838
SPEAKER_0:  10, 12, 15, 20 motorbikes.

00:56:36,898 --> 00:56:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  with two passengers, one in front riding, one in the back.

00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:42,654
SPEAKER_0:  Fully.

00:56:42,882 --> 00:56:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  equipped with the button.

00:56:44,642 --> 00:56:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  with paint guns, with pellet guns, and with bullets.

00:56:50,434 --> 00:56:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  So that's me.

00:56:52,066 --> 00:56:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  FOODY!

00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  equipped.

00:56:53,986 --> 00:56:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  and they are terrifying, they go through the...

00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  demonstrations that hit.

00:56:58,146 --> 00:56:59,038
SPEAKER_0:  and with people.

00:56:59,746 --> 00:57:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:57:00,514 --> 00:57:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  and then the errors.

00:57:03,042 --> 00:57:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  and then you see behind the first line.

00:57:06,242 --> 00:57:10,430
SPEAKER_0:  of these riot police, you would see all this latest.

00:57:11,522 --> 00:57:13,278
SPEAKER_0:  models of this.

00:57:14,242 --> 00:57:15,134
SPEAKER_0:  special

00:57:15,394 --> 00:57:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  uh... uh... armored trucks

00:57:18,626 --> 00:57:19,070
SPEAKER_0:  FOOL

00:57:19,874 --> 00:57:22,526
SPEAKER_0:  moving to the demonstrations and

00:57:22,978 --> 00:57:25,278
SPEAKER_0:  arresting people, throwing them into.

00:57:25,698 --> 00:57:27,678
SPEAKER_0:  this and then behind that

00:57:28,034 --> 00:57:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  water.

00:57:28,738 --> 00:57:30,206
SPEAKER_0:  water cannons.

00:57:30,946 --> 00:57:31,358
SPEAKER_0:  You see?

00:57:32,098 --> 00:57:35,134
SPEAKER_0:  I was looking at that and I was like, okay, this is Tehran, probably.

00:57:35,714 --> 00:57:39,710
SPEAKER_0:  they have this. But then you look at the smallest cities, they still have the same thing.

00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  So all over the country.

00:57:42,306 --> 00:57:45,854
SPEAKER_0:  One thing that they had managed to produce extensively...

00:57:46,402 --> 00:57:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  irrespective of the fact that whether they are.

00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  effective or not, but you see them everywhere.

00:57:51,906 --> 00:57:52,894
SPEAKER_0:  See you soon, cheers!

00:57:53,314 --> 00:57:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  that how afraid this regime is.

00:57:56,226 --> 00:57:57,351
SPEAKER_0:  But that also shows that.

00:57:57,351 --> 00:57:59,038
SPEAKER_1:  that there's an infrastructure.

00:58:00,514 --> 00:58:02,462
SPEAKER_1:  that can implement violence at scale.

00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  Very much so.

00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:05,534
SPEAKER_0:  and it's.

00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:09,150
SPEAKER_0:  probably part and parcel of this regime from day one.

00:58:10,498 --> 00:58:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  D

00:58:11,458 --> 00:58:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  number of prisons that they have.

00:58:13,634 --> 00:58:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  according to...

00:58:15,906 --> 00:58:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  Perhaps an exaggerated version.

00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  They said that about 12...

00:58:20,994 --> 00:58:21,950
SPEAKER_0:  thousand

00:58:22,338 --> 00:58:23,166
SPEAKER_0:  or so.

00:58:23,842 --> 00:58:24,478
SPEAKER_0:  Arrested.

00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  That's all for now.

00:58:25,698 --> 00:58:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  Cheers!

SPEAKER_0:  They are.

00:58:39,522 --> 00:58:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

00:58:47,906 --> 00:58:50,462
SPEAKER_0:  disturbing when you see these scenes.

00:58:51,842 --> 00:58:53,717
SPEAKER_1:  So there's a lot of this is on video.

00:58:53,717 --> 00:58:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  Everything is on video. Everybody has a camera.

00:58:58,402 --> 00:58:59,038
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:00,990
SPEAKER_0:  and everybody sends.

00:59:01,442 --> 00:59:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  to major.

00:59:03,138 --> 00:59:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  news outlets outside Iran.

00:59:06,178 --> 00:59:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  and they immediately showed every night, if you look at BBC Persia.

00:59:11,042 --> 00:59:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  or Iran International, I think it is six of them actually.

00:59:16,578 --> 00:59:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  all over the earth in England, they are in Deutsche Welle in Germany.

00:59:21,506 --> 00:59:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  which has a particular interest in the Iranian.

00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:27,582
SPEAKER_0:  BBC World Service and so forth in London.

00:59:28,386 --> 00:59:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  and voice of America, Persian here in this country.

00:59:31,938 --> 00:59:35,902
SPEAKER_0:  There is another one, Radio Fadda, which is also funded by...

00:59:36,162 --> 00:59:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  the American government.

00:59:38,498 --> 00:59:39,422
SPEAKER_0:  Also...

00:59:39,714 --> 00:59:41,726
SPEAKER_0:  fully covers all of these events.

00:59:42,274 --> 00:59:42,910
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  There is no way that these people can.

00:59:46,466 --> 00:59:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  that you can miss what's going on in the streets.

00:59:50,178 --> 00:59:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  of this.

00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:51,710
SPEAKER_0:  demonstrations.

00:59:51,938 --> 00:59:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  and the scenes of beating up women.

00:59:55,714 --> 00:59:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  which in Iranian culture, as I presume in most cultures.

01:00:00,706 --> 01:00:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  There is a certain sanctity that you don't attack women.

01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  What they do?

01:00:06,306 --> 01:00:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  And this is an Islamic regime.

01:00:08,514 --> 01:00:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  that supposedly have to have a certain...

01:00:11,138 --> 01:00:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  sense of...

01:00:12,546 --> 01:00:13,278
SPEAKER_0:  Concern

01:00:14,114 --> 01:00:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:00:15,266 --> 01:00:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  Well, like that.

01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:17,278
SPEAKER_1:  protection.

01:00:18,082 --> 01:00:20,766
SPEAKER_1:  Like a deep respect for women.

01:00:21,954 --> 01:00:25,342
SPEAKER_1:  grounded in a tradition of protecting them.

01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:28,862
SPEAKER_1:  instead this kind of idea that was instilled in law.

01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:30,375
SPEAKER_1:  has turned into a deep dis-

01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  disrespect of women.

01:00:32,066 --> 01:00:32,798
SPEAKER_0:  Exactly.

01:00:33,122 --> 01:00:34,110
SPEAKER_0:  or fear.

01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:35,550
SPEAKER_0:  that these

01:00:36,034 --> 01:00:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  Women are not.

01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  any longer the girls that we thought we are.

01:00:41,634 --> 01:00:44,259
SPEAKER_0:  bringing up in this society.

01:00:44,259 --> 01:00:46,974
SPEAKER_1:  you losing your power will be these women.

01:00:47,554 --> 01:00:48,766
SPEAKER_0:  That's the fear. Ya.

01:00:49,282 --> 01:00:50,718
SPEAKER_0:  And you see, of course...

01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  This government.

01:00:52,642 --> 01:00:53,406
SPEAKER_0:  Don't have it.

01:00:54,146 --> 01:00:56,350
SPEAKER_0:  support base. I mean, it would be...

01:00:56,898 --> 01:01:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  totally wrong to think that the Islamic Republic has not created its own power base.

01:01:02,562 --> 01:01:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  It does.

01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:04,958
SPEAKER_0:  But it's-

01:01:05,314 --> 01:01:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  Probably if...

01:01:06,402 --> 01:01:08,830
SPEAKER_0:  There is no way, there are no statistics that we can...

01:01:09,442 --> 01:01:10,750
SPEAKER_0:  what I'm not aware of.

01:01:11,106 --> 01:01:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  Any statistics that I can give you in numbers, what's the percentage of support for the regime?

01:01:16,386 --> 01:01:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  In it all.

01:01:17,474 --> 01:01:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  But-

01:01:18,114 --> 01:01:22,654
SPEAKER_0:  Quite frankly, I don't think it's more than probably 10% of the population.

01:01:22,882 --> 01:01:24,222
SPEAKER_0:  Be very generous.

01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  I would be surprised if it's that low.

01:01:26,306 --> 01:01:27,294
SPEAKER_1:  I would say.

01:01:27,522 --> 01:01:29,246
SPEAKER_1:  So if my understanding because.

01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:30,558
SPEAKER_1:  I've been very...

01:01:31,138 --> 01:01:35,550
SPEAKER_1:  deeply paying attention to the war in Ukraine, to Ukraine, to Russia.

01:01:36,898 --> 01:01:38,846
SPEAKER_1:  and uh to

01:01:39,074 --> 01:01:40,199
SPEAKER_1:  support in Russia.

01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  for Putin.

01:01:41,122 --> 01:01:41,438
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

01:01:41,922 --> 01:01:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

01:01:42,882 --> 01:01:44,510
SPEAKER_1:  without knowing the details.

01:01:45,186 --> 01:01:45,694
SPEAKER_1:  without.

01:01:46,178 --> 01:01:48,990
SPEAKER_1:  even considering the effects of propaganda and stuff like that.

01:01:49,378 --> 01:01:52,446
SPEAKER_1:  is there's probably a large number of people in Iran that...

01:01:53,794 --> 01:01:57,950
SPEAKER_1:  don't see this as a battle of human rights, but see it as a battle of human rights.

01:01:58,722 --> 01:02:01,054
SPEAKER_1:  uh, conservatism, like tradition.

01:02:01,698 --> 01:02:04,318
SPEAKER_1:  versus modernization and they value tradition.

01:02:05,218 --> 01:02:08,542
SPEAKER_1:  that what they fear from the throwing away of the hijab.

01:02:09,218 --> 01:02:09,886
SPEAKER_1:  is not

01:02:10,146 --> 01:02:12,478
SPEAKER_1:  The loss of power and the.

01:02:12,802 --> 01:02:15,038
SPEAKER_1:  women getting human rights, what they fear.

01:02:15,266 --> 01:02:19,198
SPEAKER_1:  Is this the same stuff you feel you see an apportion saying kids these days.

01:02:19,458 --> 01:02:20,574
SPEAKER_1:  Have no respect.

01:02:21,474 --> 01:02:25,127
SPEAKER_1:  basically that there's a large number of Iranians that probably.

01:02:25,127 --> 01:02:25,877
SPEAKER_0:  value

01:02:25,877 --> 01:02:27,070
SPEAKER_1:  value tradition.

01:02:27,874 --> 01:02:30,430
SPEAKER_1:  and the beauty of the culture.

01:02:31,042 --> 01:02:32,734
SPEAKER_1:  And like they're they fear that.

01:02:32,994 --> 01:02:33,630
SPEAKER_1:  Kids.

01:02:34,114 --> 01:02:35,358
SPEAKER_1:  with their internet.

01:02:35,906 --> 01:02:39,902
SPEAKER_1:  and their videos and their revolution will throw away everything that made this country.

01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:42,526
SPEAKER_1:  hold together for millennia.

01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:48,958
SPEAKER_0:  Yes and no, I would agree with you in the sense that probably like everywhere else in the world.

01:02:49,282 --> 01:02:52,766
SPEAKER_0:  This is a generational thing, you know, every generation thinks.

01:02:53,378 --> 01:02:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  differently about the younger generation. No doubt.

01:02:56,578 --> 01:02:57,982
SPEAKER_0:  and in Iran is the same.

01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  But there is another factor here is involved. Those that you would consider them as traditional.

01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  no longer seem to have their loyalties to this regime. this

01:03:12,034 --> 01:03:12,926
SPEAKER_0:  meaning that...

01:03:13,346 --> 01:03:14,302
SPEAKER_0:  They diss.

01:03:15,714 --> 01:03:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  they consider as a brutal regime.

01:03:19,106 --> 01:03:22,110
SPEAKER_0:  that is prepared to kill children in the streets.

01:03:22,754 --> 01:03:25,214
SPEAKER_0:  and does a lot of...

01:03:25,570 --> 01:03:26,526
SPEAKER_0:  Things wrong.

01:03:27,074 --> 01:03:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  Of course, it tries to take care of the...

01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  It's on Power Base.

01:03:32,546 --> 01:03:36,030
SPEAKER_0:  There's a very strong sense of if you start here.

01:03:36,258 --> 01:03:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  There's a very strong sense in this regime.

01:03:38,946 --> 01:03:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  that there are people that is theirs.

01:03:41,634 --> 01:03:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  and their

01:03:42,594 --> 01:03:43,582
SPEAKER_0:  Adkin is thicker

01:03:44,002 --> 01:03:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  not theirs.

01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:48,062
SPEAKER_0:  There's a word for it in Persian, they call it Khodi.

01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  One of us.

01:03:49,634 --> 01:03:50,014
SPEAKER_0:  Okay?

01:03:50,434 --> 01:03:51,559
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, so it's the...

01:03:51,559 --> 01:03:53,059
SPEAKER_1:  Well, that's very for sure.

01:03:53,059 --> 01:03:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, yes, all for that matter.

01:03:58,242 --> 01:04:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  Soviet Union, if you were a member of the party.

01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:07,422
SPEAKER_0:  and your children would have received this special kind of treatment yourself.

01:04:08,194 --> 01:04:08,542
SPEAKER_0:  uh

01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:10,238
SPEAKER_0:  This

01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:13,022
SPEAKER_0:  sense of us versus them.

01:04:14,594 --> 01:04:14,942
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:04:15,586 --> 01:04:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  for a while worked.

01:04:17,602 --> 01:04:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  because the younger people coming from the countryside to the cities.

01:04:22,978 --> 01:04:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  certain fact, certain sector of them would have found.

01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  with our fund protection and support.

01:04:30,978 --> 01:04:32,094
SPEAKER_0:  from the government.

01:04:32,354 --> 01:04:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  they

01:04:33,474 --> 01:04:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  They wanted.

01:04:34,594 --> 01:04:38,014
SPEAKER_0:  to belong to something and the mosques and the mornings.

01:04:38,658 --> 01:04:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  uh, uh, morning associations in the

01:04:41,762 --> 01:04:43,518
SPEAKER_0:  neighborhoods and so forth.

01:04:43,906 --> 01:04:45,918
SPEAKER_0:  would have given them. There is a I.

01:04:46,498 --> 01:04:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  term for it, it's called Basijji.

01:04:49,186 --> 01:04:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  those have been recruited.

01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:53,214
SPEAKER_0:  by this state.

01:04:53,762 --> 01:04:55,070
SPEAKER_0:  and this is the youth.

01:04:55,938 --> 01:04:56,958
SPEAKER_0:  kind of...

01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:59,710
SPEAKER_0:  vigilante if you like that.

01:05:00,066 --> 01:05:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  that you can see them also in these demonstrations.

01:05:03,234 --> 01:05:03,550
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:05:03,938 --> 01:05:05,310
SPEAKER_0:  Sometimes thugs.

01:05:05,538 --> 01:05:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  They're called the Siv...

01:05:07,234 --> 01:05:08,062
SPEAKER_0:  Civil Cloth

01:05:08,578 --> 01:05:12,446
SPEAKER_0:  So the people that comes to these demonstrations that start beating up.

01:05:13,282 --> 01:05:14,302
SPEAKER_0:  this young people.

01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  and they are not in...

01:05:17,058 --> 01:05:20,062
SPEAKER_0:  in security police.

01:05:20,706 --> 01:05:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  uniforms, but they are just regular clothes.

01:05:25,538 --> 01:05:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  These people...

01:05:27,522 --> 01:05:29,630
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, they still support.

01:05:29,986 --> 01:05:31,294
SPEAKER_0:  And it's the benefit.

01:05:31,618 --> 01:05:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  because they get jobs.

01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:34,238
SPEAKER_0:  They get.

01:05:34,658 --> 01:05:36,030
SPEAKER_0:  the privileges.

01:05:36,674 --> 01:05:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  And these are very important for a

01:05:39,138 --> 01:05:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  for a state.

01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:44,926
SPEAKER_0:  that basically monopolizes

01:05:45,186 --> 01:05:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  most of the resources.

01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  You see?

01:05:47,938 --> 01:05:48,542
SPEAKER_0:  Even beef.

01:05:48,898 --> 01:05:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  even during the sanction, let alone before the sanction.

01:05:53,154 --> 01:05:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  The oil revenue off your arm.

01:05:55,202 --> 01:05:57,694
SPEAKER_0:  which is the major source of the state government.

01:05:57,922 --> 01:05:59,454
SPEAKER_0:  was the monopoly of the state.

01:05:59,810 --> 01:06:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  It was monopoly of the state during the Pahlavi era.

01:06:02,466 --> 01:06:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  from this start.

01:06:03,362 --> 01:06:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  basic.

01:06:04,802 --> 01:06:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  So what does that mean?

01:06:06,338 --> 01:06:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  That means that...

01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:13,566
SPEAKER_0:  the regime in power is no longer particularly accountable to the majority population.

01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:14,558
SPEAKER_0:  because them.

01:06:14,978 --> 01:06:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  It extracts wealth from underground.

01:06:18,882 --> 01:06:22,846
SPEAKER_0:  and it uses it for its own purposes, in order to make it more powerful.

01:06:23,426 --> 01:06:25,246
SPEAKER_0:  in order to make it more repressive.

01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:27,902
SPEAKER_0:  That's what it is, the regime today.

01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:28,670
SPEAKER_0:  So it's-

01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:30,782
SPEAKER_0:  feeds a small

01:06:31,202 --> 01:06:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  or I wouldn't say but a fair number of its own supporters.

01:06:35,874 --> 01:06:39,646
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, the revolutionary guard in Iran is probably about...

01:06:40,194 --> 01:06:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  350,000 or something like that is a very big force.

01:06:44,994 --> 01:06:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  and this is not the regular army.

01:06:47,298 --> 01:06:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  the Revolutionary Guards.

01:06:49,314 --> 01:06:51,939
SPEAKER_0:  are independent from the, from the evolution.

01:06:51,939 --> 01:06:52,350
SPEAKER_1:  guard.

01:06:53,122 --> 01:06:54,247
SPEAKER_1:  is armed forces.

01:06:54,247 --> 01:06:55,134
SPEAKER_0:  controlled by the state.

01:06:55,874 --> 01:06:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, the same as the army.

01:06:58,082 --> 01:06:59,486
SPEAKER_0:  but these are more.

01:06:59,714 --> 01:07:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  ideologically.

01:07:02,274 --> 01:07:03,678
SPEAKER_0:  hide up with this state.

01:07:04,194 --> 01:07:05,118
SPEAKER_1:  And they're also.

01:07:05,826 --> 01:07:07,646
SPEAKER_1:  In-facing, internal-facing.

01:07:08,162 --> 01:07:11,537
SPEAKER_1:  What's their purpose? What's their stated? What's the stated purpose of

01:07:11,537 --> 01:07:13,374
SPEAKER_0:  Well for day one...

01:07:13,698 --> 01:07:15,806
SPEAKER_0:  when the revolution succeeded.

01:07:16,322 --> 01:07:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  The Islamic regime in power.

01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:19,966
SPEAKER_0:  was wonderful.

01:07:20,194 --> 01:07:22,302
SPEAKER_0:  to all kinds of forces of opposition.

01:07:22,722 --> 01:07:25,598
SPEAKER_0:  within iran itself and the revolution

01:07:25,826 --> 01:07:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, that's the Revolutionary Guards and they drop...

01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  was to try to.

01:07:31,106 --> 01:07:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  Make sure that the regime stays in power.

01:07:33,922 --> 01:07:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  And of course, over the course of 40 years, they became more powerful.

01:07:38,978 --> 01:07:41,662
SPEAKER_0:  more organized, better funded.

01:07:42,338 --> 01:07:43,390
SPEAKER_0:  Better trained?

01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  Well, at least we think they're better trained, but we don't know because the level of...

01:07:49,122 --> 01:07:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  Incompetence perhaps can be seen.

01:07:51,554 --> 01:07:53,246
SPEAKER_0:  through the Ranked file as well.

01:07:53,698 --> 01:07:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  But...

01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  you know, they developed their own.

01:07:57,506 --> 01:07:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  uh, in this military industry, I mean.

01:08:00,354 --> 01:08:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  those

01:08:01,730 --> 01:08:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  drones that you see now.

01:08:05,058 --> 01:08:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  Putin's regime are throwing

01:08:07,522 --> 01:08:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  on Ukrainians.

01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  for Ukrainians.

01:08:10,978 --> 01:08:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  Those are all built by the Revolutionary Guards, by the military industry under the control.

01:08:16,898 --> 01:08:18,110
SPEAKER_0:  After the revolution, you guys.

01:08:18,370 --> 01:08:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  and like.

01:08:19,522 --> 01:08:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  similar regimes in the Middle East at least.

01:08:23,202 --> 01:08:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  These are military industrial complexes. You can find them in Egypt, of course, which is very powerful, very traditional.

01:08:30,818 --> 01:08:32,862
SPEAKER_0:  has been in power and still is in power.

01:08:33,634 --> 01:08:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  You find him in Pakistan?

01:08:35,426 --> 01:08:35,870
SPEAKER_0:  Which is it.

01:08:36,226 --> 01:08:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  is extremely powerful.

01:08:38,434 --> 01:08:39,166
SPEAKER_0:  and they can...

01:08:40,002 --> 01:08:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  change the prime minister's.

01:08:42,946 --> 01:08:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  as they did in the case of the last one.

01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:08:47,010 --> 01:08:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  You can find them.

01:08:48,802 --> 01:08:49,150
SPEAKER_0:  Uh

01:08:49,378 --> 01:08:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  Probably.

01:08:50,562 --> 01:08:53,822
SPEAKER_0:  in Myanmar is the same phenomenon.

01:08:54,498 --> 01:08:54,846
SPEAKER_0:  uh

01:08:55,106 --> 01:08:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  And I can, if you look around, you can find quite a number of them.

01:08:58,978 --> 01:09:01,790
SPEAKER_0:  And the Revolutionary Guard is equivalent of that.

01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:04,094
SPEAKER_0:  This is a powerful...

01:09:04,802 --> 01:09:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:09:05,762 --> 01:09:08,222
SPEAKER_0:  establishment force.

01:09:08,642 --> 01:09:12,382
SPEAKER_0:  which militarily is powerful, industrially is powerful.

01:09:12,834 --> 01:09:13,630
SPEAKER_0:  And...

01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  since the start of the revolution.

01:09:17,154 --> 01:09:19,070
SPEAKER_0:  They have been given projects.

01:09:19,586 --> 01:09:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  So you want to be dams?

01:09:21,474 --> 01:09:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  which they did a major disaster, environmental disaster.

01:09:26,114 --> 01:09:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  They built.

01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  hundred and something dams all across the country.

01:09:30,498 --> 01:09:32,510
SPEAKER_0:  This is the revolutionary guard who does it.

01:09:33,666 --> 01:09:35,870
SPEAKER_0:  So they have all kinds of...

01:09:36,514 --> 01:09:42,526
SPEAKER_0:  tentacles all around the country controlling various things. And because it's their job.

01:09:42,818 --> 01:09:44,798
SPEAKER_1:  and they have power, they have prestige.

01:09:45,602 --> 01:09:47,102
SPEAKER_0:  there's a huge incentive to.

01:09:47,490 --> 01:09:48,030
SPEAKER_0:  Join them.

01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:50,165
SPEAKER_0:  to join them and to stay so like

01:09:50,165 --> 01:09:50,590
SPEAKER_1:  They.

01:09:51,042 --> 01:09:53,534
SPEAKER_1:  you know, when they're having dinner at home with their families.

01:09:54,402 --> 01:09:56,894
SPEAKER_1:  There's not an incentive to, uh...

01:09:57,730 --> 01:10:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  to join the protests sort of. Well...

01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:01,822
SPEAKER_0:  That is the point.

01:10:02,306 --> 01:10:03,358
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

01:10:03,778 --> 01:10:06,558
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, the evolution, you guys, may be extreme.

01:10:07,042 --> 01:10:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  but many of the people who depend on this state for their support.

01:10:13,218 --> 01:10:15,134
SPEAKER_0:  Now the younger generation are...

01:10:16,098 --> 01:10:17,310
SPEAKER_0:  telling their parents.

01:10:17,730 --> 01:10:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  You were wrong.

01:10:19,554 --> 01:10:22,302
SPEAKER_0:  you don't provide for us, this society, this-

01:10:22,882 --> 01:10:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  State does not provide what we want.

01:10:25,282 --> 01:10:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  So there is a descent.

01:10:27,586 --> 01:10:28,894
SPEAKER_0:  within the family.

01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  It seems to me. I hope it's not a wishful thinking.

01:10:32,482 --> 01:10:33,534
SPEAKER_0:  You know, there is a...

01:10:33,954 --> 01:10:36,734
SPEAKER_0:  Kind of a joke going around. You see this.

01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  A tabard guy is the Kledji, bearded, traditional.

01:10:42,018 --> 01:10:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  click or appear as.

01:10:44,162 --> 01:10:45,182
SPEAKER_0:  When you see them...

01:10:46,882 --> 01:10:48,062
SPEAKER_0:  Talking about women.

01:10:49,282 --> 01:10:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  They are very of course.

01:10:51,170 --> 01:10:52,894
SPEAKER_0:  politically incorrect.

01:10:53,346 --> 01:10:55,678
SPEAKER_0:  very looking down towards women.

01:10:56,482 --> 01:10:59,038
SPEAKER_0:  As I said, they have to be.

01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:03,262
SPEAKER_0:  Inside they have to be protected, they have not to be seen.

01:11:03,778 --> 01:11:04,350
SPEAKER_0:  and so forth.

01:11:04,738 --> 01:11:06,846
SPEAKER_0:  What if they have a young person?

01:11:07,778 --> 01:11:09,854
SPEAKER_0:  young daughter in their family.

01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  You see that there...

01:11:12,514 --> 01:11:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:15,006
SPEAKER_0:  discourse changes.

01:11:15,554 --> 01:11:17,118
SPEAKER_0:  they no longer

01:11:17,442 --> 01:11:20,830
SPEAKER_0:  seem to be referring to women as second class citizens.

01:11:22,178 --> 01:11:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  So that's very important. That's precisely that point, that when you have this younger generation,

01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:32,510
SPEAKER_0:  no matter how privileged they are, and many of them are privileged.

01:11:33,218 --> 01:11:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  And there is also...

01:11:35,554 --> 01:11:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  the regime has created its own.

01:11:39,906 --> 01:11:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  uh, privilege class.

01:11:42,754 --> 01:11:44,862
SPEAKER_0:  that are not necessarily.

01:11:46,242 --> 01:11:48,254
SPEAKER_0:  directly paid by the regime.

01:11:48,482 --> 01:11:49,758
SPEAKER_0:  what they benefit from.

01:11:50,402 --> 01:11:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  Contractors!

01:11:52,322 --> 01:11:53,982
SPEAKER_0:  certain professions

01:11:54,434 --> 01:11:54,878
SPEAKER_0:  That's.

01:11:55,522 --> 01:11:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  that benefit from

01:11:57,442 --> 01:11:59,006
SPEAKER_0:  what this state provides for them.

01:11:59,362 --> 01:12:00,382
SPEAKER_0:  And Iran is a...

01:12:01,122 --> 01:12:06,494
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, the past 40 years, you can see Iran has developed in terms of material culture.

01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  Remarkably.

01:12:09,282 --> 01:12:10,046
SPEAKER_0:  Iran has

01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  good communication, as roads.

01:12:13,602 --> 01:12:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  all over the place it's not like a

01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  It's more like, I don't know whether you have ever visited Turkey, for instance.

01:12:22,498 --> 01:12:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  In certain respects, even...

01:12:24,354 --> 01:12:26,782
SPEAKER_0:  more advanced than Turkey but it's closer

01:12:27,362 --> 01:12:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  to that rather than if you travel. I don't want to bring.

01:12:30,882 --> 01:12:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  particular names in North Africa.

01:12:34,018 --> 01:12:38,718
SPEAKER_0:  or parts of the Middle East or other parts of the Islamic world. It's much, much different.

01:12:40,066 --> 01:12:41,662
SPEAKER_0:  So in this respect...

01:12:42,082 --> 01:12:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  You would see...

01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  certain contrast or paradoxes here.

01:12:48,258 --> 01:12:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  On the second respect, there is the...

01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:51,006
SPEAKER_0:  Growth.

01:12:52,322 --> 01:12:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  and there is urbanization, there is modern economy.

01:12:56,642 --> 01:12:59,422
SPEAKER_0:  On the other hand, you see this superimposed...

01:13:00,226 --> 01:13:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  ideological doctrinal.

01:13:03,298 --> 01:13:04,542
SPEAKER_0:  aspect that

01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:07,422
SPEAKER_0:  has driven the regime over all these years.

01:13:08,226 --> 01:13:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  and they cannot get rid of it.

01:13:10,466 --> 01:13:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  They cannot, in this respect, they cannot modernize themselves. They think that they are.

01:13:16,162 --> 01:13:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  already.

01:13:17,218 --> 01:13:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  Perfect.

01:13:18,306 --> 01:13:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  In ideological sense, this is the best solution for the world.

01:13:22,082 --> 01:13:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  not only for Iran, but for the Muslim world and for the world as a whole.

01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  We are Anti-Imperialist

01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:30,750
SPEAKER_0:  We have managed to survive.

01:13:31,362 --> 01:13:34,462
SPEAKER_0:  either under sanctions, this is all part of the rhetoric.

01:13:35,202 --> 01:13:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  But of course at a huge expense.

01:13:38,562 --> 01:13:41,086
SPEAKER_0:  the huge expense for their own population.

01:13:41,602 --> 01:13:42,174
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:13:42,594 --> 01:13:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  The point that you have raised is the fact that

01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  be now witness.

01:13:47,906 --> 01:13:48,734
SPEAKER_0:  There is a

01:13:50,018 --> 01:13:52,926
SPEAKER_0:  not only a generation gap between the youth.

01:13:53,890 --> 01:13:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  and their parents.

01:13:56,194 --> 01:13:57,214
SPEAKER_0:  But there is...

01:13:57,602 --> 01:13:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

01:13:58,370 --> 01:14:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  break in a sense from

01:14:00,802 --> 01:14:02,494
SPEAKER_0:  the older generations.

01:14:03,554 --> 01:14:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  and they are very distinctly the youth.

01:14:06,818 --> 01:14:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  that has a different

01:14:08,546 --> 01:14:09,694
SPEAKER_0:  view of the world.

01:14:10,466 --> 01:14:10,878
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:11,742
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:14:12,002 --> 01:14:15,326
SPEAKER_0:  does not want to compromise. Whether they would be able to.

01:14:15,938 --> 01:14:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  Succeed or not remains to be seen.

01:14:18,690 --> 01:14:21,182
SPEAKER_0:  whether this regime is going to suppress it.

01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:22,014
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe.

01:14:22,978 --> 01:14:23,422
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:24,446
SPEAKER_0:  But it's...

01:14:24,674 --> 01:14:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  Actually...

01:14:26,818 --> 01:14:31,678
SPEAKER_0:  brought to surface many of aspects of the weaknesses of this regime.

01:14:32,930 --> 01:14:36,862
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I hear from a lot of people that are in these protests now and so.

01:14:37,346 --> 01:14:40,254
SPEAKER_1:  My love goes to them and stay strong.

01:14:40,770 --> 01:14:41,630
SPEAKER_1:  I guess.

01:14:42,498 --> 01:14:45,982
SPEAKER_1:  It's inspiring to see people fighting for those things.

01:14:47,842 --> 01:14:50,942
SPEAKER_1:  Women, life and freedom, especially freedom. Yes.

01:14:51,554 --> 01:14:57,406
SPEAKER_1:  because that can only lead to a good thing in the longterm at least. And if possible to.

01:14:57,634 --> 01:14:59,838
SPEAKER_1:  avoid a violent revolution.

01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:02,846
SPEAKER_1:  Of course that is something that...

01:15:03,458 --> 01:15:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  we all want to see.

01:15:05,218 --> 01:15:09,438
SPEAKER_1:  Before we return to the present, let's jump around. Let's go to the past.

01:15:09,762 --> 01:15:11,582
SPEAKER_1:  We met in 1979.

01:15:12,482 --> 01:15:14,206
SPEAKER_1:  What happened in 1979?

01:15:15,394 --> 01:15:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  Well, in 1979...

01:15:18,274 --> 01:15:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  There was...

01:15:20,194 --> 01:15:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  a revolution that eventually came to be known as the Islamic Revolution and even up to this day.

01:15:26,626 --> 01:15:34,686
SPEAKER_0:  many of the observers or those who have strong views that would not like to refer to it as an Islamic revolution or even a revolution.

01:15:35,842 --> 01:15:36,158
SPEAKER_0:

01:15:36,386 --> 01:15:43,710
SPEAKER_0:  because the nature of it in the earlier stages of it started really probably around 1977, it took two years.

01:15:44,834 --> 01:15:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  was much more...

01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  all embracing. It was not...

01:15:49,314 --> 01:15:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  Islamic

01:15:50,402 --> 01:15:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  in a particular fashion or at all in a sense.

01:15:54,498 --> 01:15:58,686
SPEAKER_0:  It started with a kind of a very liberal Democrat.

01:15:59,714 --> 01:16:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:16:00,546 --> 01:16:01,342
SPEAKER_0:  agenda.

01:16:02,722 --> 01:16:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  which required, which demanded mostly.

01:16:07,234 --> 01:16:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  by people.

01:16:09,026 --> 01:16:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  who were the veterans of the older generations of Iranians.

01:16:13,026 --> 01:16:14,782
SPEAKER_0:  liberal nationalists, that's fair.

01:16:15,298 --> 01:16:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  Left out.

01:16:16,386 --> 01:16:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  in the Pahlavi period.

01:16:19,330 --> 01:16:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  of the Shah.

01:16:21,378 --> 01:16:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  became increasingly

01:16:23,842 --> 01:16:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:16:24,514 --> 01:16:25,598
SPEAKER_0:  authoritarian.

01:16:26,818 --> 01:16:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  Increasing the...

01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:29,854
SPEAKER_0:  Suppressive.

01:16:30,882 --> 01:16:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  And therefore...

01:16:33,538 --> 01:16:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  Basically.

01:16:34,946 --> 01:16:36,446
SPEAKER_0:  leaving no space.

01:16:36,706 --> 01:16:38,302
SPEAKER_0:  political space.

01:16:38,978 --> 01:16:41,822
SPEAKER_0:  open for any kind of a give and take.

01:16:42,626 --> 01:16:50,631
SPEAKER_0:  any kind of a conversation or participation. That was in the 70s. 70s, 70s, particularly in the 70s. Can we actually even like?

01:16:50,631 --> 01:16:51,390
SPEAKER_1:  Just do a...

01:16:51,970 --> 01:16:53,214
SPEAKER_1:  A world wind.

01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:56,542
SPEAKER_1:  review from 1906.

01:16:57,026 --> 01:16:58,151
SPEAKER_1:  in 1979.

01:16:58,151 --> 01:16:59,102
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, sure.

01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:01,342
SPEAKER_0:  In 1906, there was...

01:17:01,890 --> 01:17:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  A period, actually, as you might know, the first decade or so.

01:17:06,786 --> 01:17:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  of the 20th century witnessed numerous...

01:17:11,362 --> 01:17:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  what we refer to as constitutional revolutions, including Russia 1905.

01:17:16,738 --> 01:17:17,758
SPEAKER_0:  The first revolution.

01:17:18,722 --> 01:17:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  including the Chinese Revolution in 19,looking back at value, just the rest of the dragon is

01:17:23,394 --> 01:17:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  the Young Text revolution in 1908.

01:17:26,146 --> 01:17:28,771
SPEAKER_0:  the Iranian Revolution in 1906. do understand

01:17:28,771 --> 01:17:29,374
SPEAKER_1:  why.

01:17:29,954 --> 01:17:31,358
SPEAKER_1:  The synchronicity of all of it.

01:17:31,714 --> 01:17:34,339
SPEAKER_1:  Why in so many different places, very different cultures, very.

01:17:34,339 --> 01:17:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  Very different cultures, but all of them in a sense were coming out of...

01:17:40,002 --> 01:17:43,806
SPEAKER_0:  the regimes that became...

01:17:44,258 --> 01:17:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  progressively.

01:17:47,426 --> 01:17:48,030
SPEAKER_0:  powerful.

01:17:48,866 --> 01:17:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  without having any kind of a legal system.

01:17:52,578 --> 01:17:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  that would protect the individual vis-a-vis the state.

01:17:55,682 --> 01:17:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  So the idea of law.

01:17:57,954 --> 01:18:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  and the Constitution according to which

01:18:00,610 --> 01:18:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  there should be a certain...

01:18:02,402 --> 01:18:03,166
SPEAKER_0:  protection.

01:18:03,682 --> 01:18:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  or certain civil society.

01:18:05,826 --> 01:18:07,701
SPEAKER_0:  became very common. Yeah, but I wonder what

01:18:07,701 --> 01:18:08,414
SPEAKER_1:  war that...

01:18:08,930 --> 01:18:12,382
SPEAKER_1:  Because that's been that way for a very, very long time.

01:18:12,802 --> 01:18:14,142
SPEAKER_1:  And so I wonder...

01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  You know, it's funny.

01:18:17,346 --> 01:18:18,078
SPEAKER_1:  certain

01:18:18,914 --> 01:18:20,039
SPEAKER_1:  ideas just there.

01:18:20,039 --> 01:18:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  time comes. Exactly, it's like 1848.

01:18:23,458 --> 01:18:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  when you would see that there is a whole range of revolutions.

01:18:26,786 --> 01:18:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  across Europe.

01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  or you would see for instance

01:18:31,202 --> 01:18:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  the Arab Spring, you see all these revolutions in the Arab world, which unfortunately...

01:18:36,674 --> 01:18:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  Nearly all of them failed.

01:18:38,786 --> 01:18:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  So yes, these are.

01:18:40,354 --> 01:18:42,206
SPEAKER_0:  very contagious ideas that...

01:18:42,594 --> 01:18:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  Moves across.

01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  frontiers from one culture to another.

01:18:46,754 --> 01:18:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  And I presume we can add to that there are two elements.

01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:52,414
SPEAKER_0:  which one can say there is positive.

01:18:53,058 --> 01:18:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  greater communication, there is a greater sense of it.

01:18:56,034 --> 01:18:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  World economy.

01:18:57,378 --> 01:19:01,790
SPEAKER_0:  and the 10th of the century witnessed the first decade of the century witnessed

01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:03,070
SPEAKER_0:  appeared of

01:19:03,362 --> 01:19:03,870
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:19:04,194 --> 01:19:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  volatility.

01:19:05,730 --> 01:19:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  particularly in

01:19:07,266 --> 01:19:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  in

01:19:08,418 --> 01:19:08,990
SPEAKER_0:  currency.

01:19:09,794 --> 01:19:12,990
SPEAKER_0:  so many of the countries of the world, particularly non-West.

01:19:14,434 --> 01:19:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  suffered.

01:19:15,778 --> 01:19:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  in and particularly the businesses suffer.

01:19:20,738 --> 01:19:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  and not surprisingly, the business class were in the forefront.

01:19:26,274 --> 01:19:28,798
SPEAKER_0:  of many of these constitutional movements.

01:19:29,218 --> 01:19:30,910
SPEAKER_0:  requiring this state.

01:19:32,258 --> 01:19:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  Give.

01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:33,630
SPEAKER_0:  day.

01:19:33,954 --> 01:19:34,270
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:19:34,626 --> 01:19:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  Kind of it.

01:19:35,906 --> 01:19:37,982
SPEAKER_0:  created the right kind of institutions.

01:19:38,562 --> 01:19:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  to listen to their voices.

01:19:40,898 --> 01:19:43,070
SPEAKER_0:  to their concerns and the creation of...

01:19:43,586 --> 01:19:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  democratic system, parliamentary and...

01:19:46,626 --> 01:19:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  system in which there would be a representation.

01:19:49,922 --> 01:19:53,310
SPEAKER_0:  popular representation, proper elections and so forth.

01:19:53,762 --> 01:19:54,878
SPEAKER_0:  and constitutions.

01:19:55,234 --> 01:19:57,118
SPEAKER_0:  And this very much is a kind of him.

01:19:58,018 --> 01:19:59,070
SPEAKER_0:  French IDFT.

01:19:59,522 --> 01:20:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  Constitution going back all the way perhaps to...

01:20:02,402 --> 01:20:05,598
SPEAKER_0:  1789 Revolution, Montesquieu.

01:20:06,146 --> 01:20:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  all this kind of philosophy.

01:20:08,418 --> 01:20:09,854
SPEAKER_0:  I have very greatly.

01:20:10,082 --> 01:20:12,446
SPEAKER_0:  appreciated, particularly if right system.

01:20:12,770 --> 01:20:14,910
SPEAKER_1:  So what were the ideas in the 1906?

01:20:15,266 --> 01:20:16,391
SPEAKER_1:  Iranian Constitution.

01:20:16,391 --> 01:20:17,182
SPEAKER_0:  They

01:20:17,474 --> 01:20:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  Precisely the same.

01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  demanding creation of a legal system with division of power.

01:20:24,866 --> 01:20:25,982
SPEAKER_0:  between the three.

01:20:26,722 --> 01:20:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  executive.

01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  legislative and the judiciary.

01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:33,598
SPEAKER_0:  Not unlike the American system.

01:20:34,338 --> 01:20:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

01:20:35,714 --> 01:20:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  they requested.

01:20:38,274 --> 01:20:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  Basically a certain

01:20:40,738 --> 01:20:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  a public space to be created between the two sources of power.

01:20:45,570 --> 01:20:46,302
SPEAKER_0:  The state.

01:20:46,594 --> 01:20:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  which had this.

01:20:48,034 --> 01:20:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  kind of control.

01:20:49,794 --> 01:20:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  Over the...

01:20:51,554 --> 01:20:57,726
SPEAKER_0:  if you like, the secular aspect of life in the society and the religious establishment that had it.

01:20:58,466 --> 01:21:00,414
SPEAKER_0:  full control over the

01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  religious aspects and both of them from the perspective of the

01:21:05,218 --> 01:21:08,670
SPEAKER_0:  and constitutionally this considered as repressive.

01:21:09,314 --> 01:21:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  And therefore there has to be a new space open between these two.

01:21:13,634 --> 01:21:16,222
SPEAKER_0:  And that was the idea of a constitutional revolution.

01:21:16,610 --> 01:21:16,926
SPEAKER_0:  Wait.

01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  By its very nature, it was an idea of modernity.

01:21:20,770 --> 01:21:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  They wanted a modern society.

01:21:22,946 --> 01:21:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  They wanted better material.

01:21:25,346 --> 01:21:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  life.

01:21:26,434 --> 01:21:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  They wanted more representation.

01:21:29,698 --> 01:21:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  successful.

01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  The Christusian Revolution.

01:21:32,866 --> 01:21:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  As I always would say is the most...

01:21:34,722 --> 01:21:35,742
SPEAKER_0:  much more of it.

01:21:36,034 --> 01:21:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  Innocent revolution.

01:21:37,890 --> 01:21:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  is a revolution that did not particularly have much violence in it.

01:21:42,338 --> 01:21:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  contrary to many other revolutions.

01:21:45,282 --> 01:21:47,774
SPEAKER_0:  It did not have a centralized leadership.

01:21:48,386 --> 01:21:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  per se. That's why actually I'm getting...

01:21:51,138 --> 01:21:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, besides the...

01:21:52,802 --> 01:21:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  practices.

01:21:53,730 --> 01:21:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  I'm getting a lot of...

01:21:55,106 --> 01:21:57,342
SPEAKER_0:  request for interviews to compare.

01:21:57,826 --> 01:22:00,638
SPEAKER_0:  what's happening now with the Revolution of 1906.

01:22:01,154 --> 01:22:03,518
SPEAKER_0:  1909. Are there any echoes?

01:22:03,970 --> 01:22:05,726
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, yes, there are, there are.

01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:08,702
SPEAKER_0:  because that was a movement that started without...

01:22:09,314 --> 01:22:09,854
SPEAKER_0:  Ayy

01:22:10,082 --> 01:22:11,422
SPEAKER_0:  With that a

01:22:11,746 --> 01:22:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  centralized leadership.

01:22:14,274 --> 01:22:16,126
SPEAKER_0:  What actually values to voice this?

01:22:16,674 --> 01:22:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  that emerged in various...

01:22:19,074 --> 01:22:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  among the merchants.

01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  or the businessman in the economic community.

01:22:24,482 --> 01:22:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  Among the...

01:22:26,114 --> 01:22:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  representatives who came to the first parliament.

01:22:29,410 --> 01:22:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  Depressed?

01:22:30,914 --> 01:22:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  the new generation of the.

01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:34,686
SPEAKER_0:  privilege aristocracy.

01:22:35,618 --> 01:22:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  who were educated and...

01:22:38,530 --> 01:22:40,222
SPEAKER_0:  believed in the Constitutional.

01:22:40,610 --> 01:22:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  Values?

01:22:41,698 --> 01:22:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  All of these voices emerged at the same time, and somehow...

01:22:45,634 --> 01:22:46,910
SPEAKER_0:  They managed to.

01:22:47,746 --> 01:22:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

01:22:49,218 --> 01:22:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  coexist.

01:22:51,010 --> 01:22:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  in the first.

01:22:52,354 --> 01:22:53,246
SPEAKER_0:  and the second.

01:22:53,538 --> 01:22:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:22:54,818 --> 01:22:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  of parliaments that were created.

01:22:58,082 --> 01:22:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  between 1905 and 1906.

01:23:00,034 --> 01:23:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  6 and 19.

01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:03,166
SPEAKER_0:  10 or 1911.

01:23:04,002 --> 01:23:06,270
SPEAKER_0:  but they all face huge problems.

01:23:07,458 --> 01:23:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  in the sense that

01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  Iran was in a dire economic situation. This is before the days of the discovery of oil.

01:23:15,042 --> 01:23:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  which actually coincides with the disc. There are two important coincidences.

01:23:20,002 --> 01:23:22,942
SPEAKER_0:  One is that oil was discovered in the South.

01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  in 1909.

01:23:25,794 --> 01:23:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  during the course of the constitutional revolution.

01:23:28,866 --> 01:23:31,358
SPEAKER_0:  Second is that in 1907...

01:23:32,066 --> 01:23:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  the two great powers of the time.

01:23:34,594 --> 01:23:35,550
SPEAKER_0:  Russian Empire.

01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  and the British Empire.

01:23:37,826 --> 01:23:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  who always honored Iran as being a buffer state between them.

01:23:42,402 --> 01:23:44,926
SPEAKER_0:  because they didn't want to get too close to one another.

01:23:46,050 --> 01:23:48,158
SPEAKER_0:  basically came to an agreement.

01:23:48,418 --> 01:23:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  facing the fear.

01:23:50,210 --> 01:23:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  of the rise of the German Empire.

01:23:52,386 --> 01:23:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  So...

01:23:53,666 --> 01:23:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  This is the period of Entente, as you might know in European history.

01:23:57,538 --> 01:24:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  whereby the French, the British and the Russians.

01:24:02,082 --> 01:24:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  all create a...

01:24:04,610 --> 01:24:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  Alliance.

01:24:06,434 --> 01:24:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  ultimately leads to the first world war.

01:24:09,122 --> 01:24:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  against Germany.

01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:11,518
SPEAKER_1:  And at the same time...

01:24:11,746 --> 01:24:13,342
SPEAKER_1:  the discovery of oil that.

01:24:13,826 --> 01:24:19,838
SPEAKER_1:  the oil industry being a very powerful defining factor of the 20th century for Iraq. Exactly.

01:24:20,418 --> 01:24:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  source of a lot of money.

01:24:22,178 --> 01:24:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  lot of money but not all of it in the hands of the Iranians only one fifth of it

01:24:27,522 --> 01:24:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  by way of royalties came to Iran. Much of it went to the Anglo-

01:24:32,450 --> 01:24:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  person

01:24:33,826 --> 01:24:37,470
SPEAKER_0:  oil company which they actually discovered the oil in the...

01:24:37,730 --> 01:24:38,270
SPEAKER_0:  province.

01:24:38,594 --> 01:24:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  going to buy at MSU alliance. That saves money and COVID. And I will all the most cash I canions that what rolled was momentum he did it. Is this a former beta option you also we also did Michelle Luis for the USA and Australia plenty.

01:24:40,386 --> 01:24:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  Southwest of Iran.

01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:44,926
SPEAKER_0:  raise the major oil industries today right now.

01:24:45,794 --> 01:24:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

01:24:47,362 --> 01:24:49,822
SPEAKER_0:  This business is extremely profitable.

01:24:50,466 --> 01:24:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  enterprise for that company and for the British government. It's actually purchased by the British government.

01:24:56,354 --> 01:24:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  Churchill Purchase.

01:24:57,890 --> 01:24:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  Anglo-Iranian oil company.

01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  for the British government.

01:25:01,698 --> 01:25:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  So it was not anymore a private company.

01:25:04,258 --> 01:25:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  It was the British.

01:25:05,634 --> 01:25:06,942
SPEAKER_0:  interest as a matter of fact.

01:25:07,426 --> 01:25:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  And in the course of the 20th century, although it helped the modernization in Iran,

01:25:12,226 --> 01:25:13,918
SPEAKER_0:  but it also helps the creation.

01:25:14,594 --> 01:25:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  often more authoritative.

01:25:16,482 --> 01:25:17,470
SPEAKER_0:

01:25:17,858 --> 01:25:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  strong state if you like to call it.

01:25:20,930 --> 01:25:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  that 19th century Iran never had that kind of a power.

01:25:24,866 --> 01:25:26,526
SPEAKER_0:  Never had that kind of resources.

01:25:26,978 --> 01:25:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  Is it 20th century? even dead?

01:25:29,634 --> 01:25:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  One fifth.

01:25:30,914 --> 01:25:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  of the income.

01:25:32,226 --> 01:25:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  That's a rich day, right? Kerling & Estate

01:25:34,562 --> 01:25:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  gave it a greater power.

01:25:36,162 --> 01:25:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  That's another

01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:38,142
SPEAKER_1:  coincidence.

01:25:38,978 --> 01:25:42,942
SPEAKER_1:  So yes, yes, you could say the oil was one of the catalysts.

01:25:43,650 --> 01:25:45,214
SPEAKER_1:  for absolute power.

01:25:46,370 --> 01:25:47,678
SPEAKER_1:  The 20th century saw.

01:25:47,970 --> 01:25:49,246
SPEAKER_1:  quite a few countries.

01:25:50,498 --> 01:25:54,910
SPEAKER_1:  um, have dictators with power unlike anything else in human history.

01:25:55,106 --> 01:25:55,486
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

01:25:56,066 --> 01:25:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  That's weird too.

01:25:57,634 --> 01:25:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  Precisely.

01:25:59,138 --> 01:26:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  And you know, you can name them from the beginning of the century with people like...

01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:07,678
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, Lenin, Stalin.

01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  Of course, Hitler even...

01:26:10,658 --> 01:26:12,414
SPEAKER_0:  Mao, of course.

01:26:12,674 --> 01:26:19,870
SPEAKER_0:  You can name them and probably as I would say, is the last of them is Khomeini in that century, that you would see this strong man.

01:26:20,642 --> 01:26:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  with a sense of either artificial or real.

01:26:26,594 --> 01:26:28,734
SPEAKER_0:  sense of so-called charisma.

01:26:29,666 --> 01:26:30,558
SPEAKER_0:  And with this.

01:26:30,786 --> 01:26:31,294
SPEAKER_0:  total.

01:26:31,778 --> 01:26:32,798
SPEAKER_0:  Power over.

01:26:33,218 --> 01:26:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  the regime that they create.

01:26:35,842 --> 01:26:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  and some of them do nicer.

01:26:38,754 --> 01:26:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  He didn't have much of an oil resources in Egypt.

01:26:42,114 --> 01:26:44,222
SPEAKER_0:  but he was also one of these strong men.

01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:46,302
SPEAKER_0:  in the 20th century.

01:26:46,946 --> 01:26:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  loved by some, hated by others.

01:26:49,730 --> 01:26:50,110
SPEAKER_0:  Oh.

01:26:50,370 --> 01:26:50,750
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:26:51,010 --> 01:26:54,622
SPEAKER_0:  it necessarily does not tie up to.

01:26:55,522 --> 01:26:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  uh... it too

01:26:56,994 --> 01:27:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  economic resources underground. But in the Iranian case, unfortunately it did.

01:27:03,810 --> 01:27:04,574
SPEAKER_0:  And it was a

01:27:05,282 --> 01:27:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  It was more than, it created more than one issue for Iran.

01:27:10,466 --> 01:27:12,382
SPEAKER_0:  It's created a strong state.

01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  which is the Pahlavi state from 1920.

01:27:15,394 --> 01:27:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  One onward.

01:27:17,090 --> 01:27:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  Because in 1921...

01:27:18,946 --> 01:27:20,670
SPEAKER_0:  at the end of the First World War.

01:27:21,154 --> 01:27:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  Iran was in it.

01:27:22,658 --> 01:27:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  almost a state of total bankruptcy.

01:27:25,794 --> 01:27:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  And.

01:27:26,946 --> 01:27:27,806
SPEAKER_0:  The British

01:27:28,450 --> 01:27:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  had a

01:27:29,698 --> 01:27:35,326
SPEAKER_0:  desire to try to bring Iran to the system that they created in the Middle East in the post-war era.

01:27:35,682 --> 01:27:36,766
SPEAKER_0:  the mandate system.

01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:38,814
SPEAKER_0:  Palestine, Iraq.

01:27:39,362 --> 01:27:40,126
SPEAKER_0:  And then of course.

01:27:40,546 --> 01:27:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  French Bandit of Lebanon and Syria, all of this.

01:27:43,778 --> 01:27:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  And Iran was separate because Iran was an independent country. It wasn't part of the Ottoman Empire.

01:27:48,610 --> 01:27:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  that collapse.

01:27:50,434 --> 01:27:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  So they had to somehow handle it.

01:27:53,922 --> 01:27:56,126
SPEAKER_0:  and what they tried to do didn't work.

01:27:57,378 --> 01:27:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  As a result...

01:27:59,426 --> 01:28:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  partly.

01:28:00,386 --> 01:28:02,718
SPEAKER_0:  domestic, partly international issues.

01:28:03,266 --> 01:28:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  wrote about the regime.

01:28:05,314 --> 01:28:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  which is headed by...

01:28:07,778 --> 01:28:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  the founder of the Pahlavi dynasty, Reza Shah.

01:28:10,946 --> 01:28:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, the first.

01:28:12,322 --> 01:28:14,398
SPEAKER_0:  military officer called Reza Khan.

01:28:14,882 --> 01:28:17,598
SPEAKER_0:  actually a military officer of the Cossack forces.

01:28:18,114 --> 01:28:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  And the Cossack forces was the...

01:28:20,066 --> 01:28:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  that was created in the 19th century model of the...

01:28:23,458 --> 01:28:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  Russian Kossacks.

01:28:25,026 --> 01:28:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  when

01:28:25,858 --> 01:28:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  day.

01:28:26,498 --> 01:28:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  ruler in the 19th century visited.

01:28:29,282 --> 01:28:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  Russia

01:28:30,498 --> 01:28:31,902
SPEAKER_0:  as in a royal tour.

01:28:32,354 --> 01:28:34,526
SPEAKER_0:  and the desire should degrade.

01:28:35,714 --> 01:28:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  Cossack forces said I like this.

01:28:38,498 --> 01:28:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  and he created one for himself.

01:28:40,674 --> 01:28:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  with Russian officers, actually.

01:28:43,202 --> 01:28:45,726
SPEAKER_0:  So the Russian officers served in Iran from Iran.

01:28:46,626 --> 01:28:50,750
SPEAKER_0:  1880s up to the revolution of 1917, the collapse of the...

01:28:50,978 --> 01:28:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  So many revolutions.

01:28:53,314 --> 01:28:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  So many revolutions.

01:28:54,626 --> 01:28:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  and Razorshop was an

01:28:56,194 --> 01:28:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  Officer in that.

01:28:57,538 --> 01:28:58,206
SPEAKER_0:  There's a Han.

01:28:58,818 --> 01:28:59,966
SPEAKER_0:  Was an officer in that force.

01:29:00,290 --> 01:29:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  And he created a new monarchy for reasons that we need not to go to it.

01:29:04,226 --> 01:29:08,830
SPEAKER_0:  and this is called the Pahlavi regime. The Pahlavi regime was a modernizing regime.

01:29:10,914 --> 01:29:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  That's.

01:29:12,354 --> 01:29:13,054
SPEAKER_0:

01:29:13,282 --> 01:29:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  In effect.

01:29:15,682 --> 01:29:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  fulfilled many of the ambitions.

01:29:18,626 --> 01:29:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  of the Constitution, many of the aspirations of the Constitutional Revolution.

01:29:22,402 --> 01:29:23,806
SPEAKER_0:  better communication.

01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  secular education.

01:29:27,714 --> 01:29:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  uh

01:29:28,578 --> 01:29:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  centralized states, centralized army.

01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:32,894
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:29:33,346 --> 01:29:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  better contact with the outside world.

01:29:37,154 --> 01:29:40,734
SPEAKER_0:  greater urbanization. That's what a modern state is all about.

01:29:42,658 --> 01:29:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  And in that regard, in a sense for the

01:29:45,186 --> 01:29:47,934
SPEAKER_0:  first 20 years up to the Second World War.

01:29:48,290 --> 01:29:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  was successful.

01:29:50,434 --> 01:29:53,790
SPEAKER_0:  despite and more significant of all

01:29:54,178 --> 01:29:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  It managed to keep the

01:29:56,482 --> 01:29:59,742
SPEAKER_0:  European powers, which was always interfering in the...

01:30:00,386 --> 01:30:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  Local Affairs of Iran

01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:03,390
SPEAKER_0:  in an arm-leg.

01:30:03,842 --> 01:30:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  So they were there.

01:30:05,570 --> 01:30:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  in an arm length.

01:30:07,714 --> 01:30:09,214
SPEAKER_0:  but they were also...

01:30:09,666 --> 01:30:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  respecting the power of the state.

01:30:13,634 --> 01:30:14,334
SPEAKER_0:  Part of the.

01:30:14,562 --> 01:30:15,454
SPEAKER_0:  Pala Vista.

01:30:16,130 --> 01:30:19,838
SPEAKER_0:  During the second world war, the same phenomenon.

01:30:20,674 --> 01:30:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  as earlier interference led to the occupation of Iran by the

01:30:26,722 --> 01:30:27,710
SPEAKER_0:  Allied Forces.

01:30:28,354 --> 01:30:30,878
SPEAKER_0:  the British from the South, the Russians from the North.

01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  This is Red Army.

01:30:33,378 --> 01:30:34,750
SPEAKER_0:  They took over Iran.

01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:38,750
SPEAKER_0:  And of course they said, yes, from 1941.

01:30:39,202 --> 01:30:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  up to 1945.

01:30:41,410 --> 01:30:42,814
SPEAKER_0:  And of course, when the...

01:30:43,874 --> 01:30:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  when the Red Army...

01:30:45,314 --> 01:30:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  refuse to.

01:30:47,714 --> 01:30:50,750
SPEAKER_0:  withdrew from Iranian Azerbaijan.

01:30:51,490 --> 01:30:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  And with some.

01:30:54,498 --> 01:30:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  thought of possible.

01:30:56,162 --> 01:30:57,182
SPEAKER_0:  annexation.

01:30:57,634 --> 01:30:58,078
SPEAKER_0:  Oh.

01:30:58,754 --> 01:30:59,614
SPEAKER_0:  That province.

01:31:00,066 --> 01:31:01,502
SPEAKER_0:  That was a big issue.

01:31:02,082 --> 01:31:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  in the post-war Iran.

01:31:03,554 --> 01:31:07,774
SPEAKER_0:  So after 1945. Yes, 1945 to 1946.

01:31:08,322 --> 01:31:09,342
SPEAKER_0:  There was a big...

01:31:10,050 --> 01:31:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  Soviet Union getting greedy. Yes, but eventually they agree.

01:31:13,634 --> 01:31:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  Eventually, Stalin agreed to leave.

01:31:16,482 --> 01:31:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  the Azerbaijan province in the hope that it would get some

01:31:20,066 --> 01:31:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  concessions from Iran, which in the oil of the

01:31:23,554 --> 01:31:24,446
SPEAKER_0:  Caspian Era.

01:31:24,930 --> 01:31:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  area.

01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  which didn't work and it's a different story altogether.

01:31:29,474 --> 01:31:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  What happened is that...

01:31:31,842 --> 01:31:33,982
SPEAKER_0:  in the post-war era.

01:31:34,690 --> 01:31:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  between amazing

01:31:37,186 --> 01:31:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  445.

01:31:39,010 --> 01:31:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  and 1953.

01:31:41,570 --> 01:31:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  is a period of...

01:31:43,938 --> 01:31:44,542
SPEAKER_0:  greater.

01:31:44,898 --> 01:31:45,246
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:31:45,986 --> 01:31:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  Democratization.

01:31:47,426 --> 01:31:47,934
SPEAKER_0:  What's that?

01:31:48,642 --> 01:31:51,614
SPEAKER_0:  Reza Shah's dictatorship, basically.

01:31:53,186 --> 01:31:53,950
SPEAKER_0:  disappeared.

01:31:54,722 --> 01:31:58,110
SPEAKER_0:  And this is where you would see political parties, free press.

01:31:58,882 --> 01:32:00,670
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of chaotic really.

01:32:01,282 --> 01:32:04,657
SPEAKER_0:  as democracies often are. For something.

01:32:04,657 --> 01:32:06,157
SPEAKER_1:  like was it was it official?

01:32:06,157 --> 01:32:07,102
SPEAKER_0:  a democracy.

01:32:07,362 --> 01:32:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

01:32:08,034 --> 01:32:09,854
SPEAKER_0:  It was a democracy. It was our elections.

01:32:10,242 --> 01:32:12,862
SPEAKER_0:  There were elections, yes, of course. Yes, of course.

01:32:13,282 --> 01:32:14,014
SPEAKER_0:  and the world.

01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  Very diverse.

01:32:16,258 --> 01:32:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  political tendencies.

01:32:18,146 --> 01:32:18,878
SPEAKER_0:  came to do.

01:32:19,106 --> 01:32:19,582
SPEAKER_0:  Picture.

01:32:20,002 --> 01:32:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  including the two-party of Iran, which is Communist Party of Iran.

01:32:23,874 --> 01:32:26,110
SPEAKER_0:  This Communist Party of Iran is probably the biggest.

01:32:26,786 --> 01:32:27,998
SPEAKER_0:  Communist Party.

01:32:28,546 --> 01:32:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  of the whole of the Middle East.

01:32:30,274 --> 01:32:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  and one of the biggest in the world actually.

01:32:32,802 --> 01:32:33,534
SPEAKER_0:  at that time.

01:32:34,018 --> 01:32:36,643
SPEAKER_1:  Did the Soviet Union have a significant influence?

01:32:36,643 --> 01:32:37,630
SPEAKER_0:  Of course.

01:32:37,858 --> 01:32:39,646
SPEAKER_0:  We're basically following.

01:32:40,098 --> 01:32:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  Or this one.

01:32:41,282 --> 01:32:45,278
SPEAKER_0:  although they deny it, but in reality that's the case.

01:32:45,794 --> 01:32:46,110
SPEAKER_0:  But.

01:32:46,402 --> 01:32:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  What happened? They were seen by the Americans during the Cold War.

01:32:50,754 --> 01:32:51,230
SPEAKER_0:  That's it.

01:32:52,066 --> 01:32:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  as a threat.

01:32:53,890 --> 01:32:57,278
SPEAKER_0:  And Iran was going through a period of...

01:32:57,762 --> 01:33:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  demanding nationalization of its oil resources. That's a very important episode with Mossadegh.

01:33:03,138 --> 01:33:05,022
SPEAKER_0:  whom you might have heard about his name.

01:33:05,474 --> 01:33:08,286
SPEAKER_0:  Dr. Mohammad Musadegh was the prime minister.

01:33:08,706 --> 01:33:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  and the National Charismatic Leader.

01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  from 19.

01:33:13,186 --> 01:33:17,342
SPEAKER_0:  1951 to 1953, prior to that it was a famous parliament area.

01:33:17,794 --> 01:33:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  But this period was the prime minister, if you don't.

01:33:20,482 --> 01:33:20,862
SPEAKER_0:  until Arnoldin doesn't make Going Out link video right there.

01:33:21,474 --> 01:33:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  nationalize the Iranian oil industry, and the British didn't like it at all.

01:33:26,370 --> 01:33:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  and eventually resulted in a famous coup.

01:33:30,978 --> 01:33:31,422
SPEAKER_0:  which.

01:33:31,714 --> 01:33:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  at least partly was supported.

01:33:34,402 --> 01:33:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  by the funding.

01:33:36,866 --> 01:33:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  and by the...

01:33:38,306 --> 01:33:39,518
SPEAKER_0:  Moral support.

01:33:40,034 --> 01:33:40,862
SPEAKER_0:  of the

01:33:41,314 --> 01:33:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  the British and the Americans, particularly by the Americans.

01:33:44,578 --> 01:33:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  It was always.

01:33:46,114 --> 01:33:50,238
SPEAKER_0:  seen as one of the earliest and the most successful.

01:33:50,626 --> 01:33:53,502
SPEAKER_0:  CIA operations during the Cold War.

01:33:54,018 --> 01:33:58,334
SPEAKER_0:  So CIA had something to do with it? Yes, of course. That's one of the earliest operations of the CIA.

01:33:58,562 --> 01:33:59,102
SPEAKER_0:  Wait a minute.

01:33:59,234 --> 01:34:03,359
SPEAKER_1:  What was, yes of course, what was the, what was the...

01:34:03,359 --> 01:34:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  doing. CIA, this is the time at the post-war era. In the 50s. In the 50s, 40s and 50s.

01:34:11,074 --> 01:34:12,318
SPEAKER_0:  The British Empire...

01:34:12,802 --> 01:34:13,694
SPEAKER_0:  which was...

01:34:14,434 --> 01:34:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  really the major superpower of the region after the collapse of the Tzari Empire.

01:34:20,706 --> 01:34:21,854
SPEAKER_0:  Gradually.

01:34:22,338 --> 01:34:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  took the second.

01:34:24,034 --> 01:34:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  See ya.

01:34:25,378 --> 01:34:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  to the Americans who were the...

01:34:27,682 --> 01:34:29,854
SPEAKER_0:  newcomers and the great powers and the...

01:34:30,210 --> 01:34:32,094
SPEAKER_0:  victors of the Second World War.

01:34:32,834 --> 01:34:35,454
SPEAKER_0:  And the Mekans viewed Iran as an important...

01:34:36,418 --> 01:34:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:34:37,442 --> 01:34:39,774
SPEAKER_0:  as an important country.

01:34:40,226 --> 01:34:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  since it has the largest

01:34:43,362 --> 01:34:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  common borders with the Soviet Union.

01:34:46,850 --> 01:34:47,966
SPEAKER_0:  And it was.

01:34:48,546 --> 01:34:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  I did the start.

01:34:50,146 --> 01:34:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  was the Persian Gulf, which at the time...

01:34:52,706 --> 01:34:53,822
SPEAKER_0:  was the greatest.

01:34:54,370 --> 01:34:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  I

01:34:55,266 --> 01:34:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  supplier of

01:34:57,730 --> 01:34:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  oil

01:34:59,074 --> 01:35:00,030
SPEAKER_0:  to the outside world.

01:35:00,738 --> 01:35:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  And therefore the Americans had a particular interest in Iran.

01:35:05,762 --> 01:35:09,918
SPEAKER_0:  And in the earlier stages, their interest was in the interest of the Iranian government.

01:35:10,178 --> 01:35:11,070
SPEAKER_0:  Because they want it.

01:35:11,650 --> 01:35:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  to get rid of.

01:35:13,122 --> 01:35:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  Booth.

01:35:14,370 --> 01:35:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  the Soviet Union which made a return.

01:35:18,210 --> 01:35:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  in the post war era.

01:35:20,290 --> 01:35:22,302
SPEAKER_0:  and of course the British that were...

01:35:22,530 --> 01:35:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  gradually withdrawing.

01:35:24,130 --> 01:35:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  from me.

01:35:25,058 --> 01:35:25,598
SPEAKER_0:  Bye-bye.

01:35:26,018 --> 01:35:30,942
SPEAKER_0:  They had full control over the Anglo-Iranian oil company. They changed the name.

01:35:31,394 --> 01:35:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  to angle Iranian oil company.

01:35:33,794 --> 01:35:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  When the name of the country officially changed from Persia to Iran.

01:35:38,082 --> 01:35:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  in the West.

01:35:39,490 --> 01:35:39,902
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:35:40,322 --> 01:35:40,798
SPEAKER_0:  D-

01:35:41,058 --> 01:35:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  Name of the company, Chase.

01:35:42,914 --> 01:35:43,390
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:35:43,650 --> 01:35:47,422
SPEAKER_0:  They got into a huge dispute with the government.

01:35:47,810 --> 01:35:49,822
SPEAKER_0:  that eventually led to the...

01:35:50,498 --> 01:35:53,822
SPEAKER_0:  of 1953, which eventually created a...

01:35:54,498 --> 01:35:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  Very.

01:35:55,938 --> 01:35:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, very.

01:35:57,634 --> 01:35:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  distressful memory.

01:35:59,874 --> 01:36:02,494
SPEAKER_0:  in the minds of many of the Iranian nationalists.

01:36:03,202 --> 01:36:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  that this was the betrayal of the great powers.

01:36:06,146 --> 01:36:07,742
SPEAKER_0:  the British and Americans.

01:36:08,194 --> 01:36:09,982
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, CIA played a part.

01:36:10,370 --> 01:36:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  because I feared.

01:36:12,738 --> 01:36:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  contrary to the British that they were afraid of their.

01:36:15,458 --> 01:36:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  and oil in Iran.

01:36:17,506 --> 01:36:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  The CIA was afraid of the...

01:36:20,322 --> 01:36:21,694
SPEAKER_0:  Soviet penetration.

01:36:22,274 --> 01:36:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  in.

01:36:23,106 --> 01:36:23,966
SPEAKER_0:  in the start.

01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  and particularly because it was very powerful.

01:36:27,074 --> 01:36:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  for the very powerful communist party to the party of Iran.

01:36:31,650 --> 01:36:32,286
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:36:32,802 --> 01:36:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  day.

01:36:34,338 --> 01:36:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  gradually shifted between the Truman administration and Eisenhower administration. These are early days of the CIA.

01:36:41,058 --> 01:36:42,238
SPEAKER_0:  And then

01:36:42,690 --> 01:36:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  they actually did.

01:36:44,290 --> 01:36:45,278
SPEAKER_0:  Participate.

01:36:45,890 --> 01:36:47,902
SPEAKER_0:  to set their agents.

01:36:48,226 --> 01:36:50,238
SPEAKER_0:  There's a long story to that.

01:36:50,754 --> 01:36:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  and it eventually resulted in a successful coup.

01:36:54,882 --> 01:36:57,022
SPEAKER_0:  that removed Musaddegh from power

01:36:57,186 --> 01:37:02,270
SPEAKER_1:  What's the United States interest here? Why are they using CIA? Are they trying to make sure...

01:37:03,394 --> 01:37:05,269
SPEAKER_1:  there's not too much centralization of power.

01:37:05,269 --> 01:37:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  in this region.

01:37:06,370 --> 01:37:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  They were afraid of the fact that the...

01:37:09,474 --> 01:37:11,070
SPEAKER_0:  that of the Soviet Union.

01:37:11,554 --> 01:37:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  and during the Cold War, that was their concern.

01:37:14,338 --> 01:37:15,463
SPEAKER_0:

01:37:15,463 --> 01:37:21,463
SPEAKER_1:  They actually almost want to protect Iran and its own sovereign processes from influence of Awad al-Nusra.

01:37:21,463 --> 01:37:22,206
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

01:37:22,658 --> 01:37:24,030
SPEAKER_0:  Because they were afraid of the fact.

01:37:24,962 --> 01:37:25,310
SPEAKER_0:  If

01:37:25,698 --> 01:37:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  Eat on.

01:37:26,562 --> 01:37:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  or at least this is part of the.

01:37:28,706 --> 01:37:30,974
SPEAKER_0:  I'm simplifying a very complex picture.

01:37:31,490 --> 01:37:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  P poisoned?

01:37:32,546 --> 01:37:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  but the Americans basically.

01:37:34,658 --> 01:37:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  We're thinking that if Iran is going to be lost.

01:37:38,210 --> 01:37:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  to Soviet influence.

01:37:41,314 --> 01:37:46,750
SPEAKER_0:  then eventually basically all the oil resources in the Persian Gulf are going to be threatened.

01:37:48,066 --> 01:37:49,278
SPEAKER_0:  and this would...

01:37:49,826 --> 01:37:51,134
SPEAKER_0:  Basically is the...

01:37:51,554 --> 01:37:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  National Security of...

01:37:53,282 --> 01:37:56,286
SPEAKER_0:  the United States and all of the Western Allies.

01:37:56,802 --> 01:37:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  European allies.

01:37:58,466 --> 01:37:59,422
SPEAKER_0:  So in a sense.

01:37:59,938 --> 01:38:03,710
SPEAKER_0:  This was the long arm of the CIA to try to...

01:38:05,314 --> 01:38:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  try to make sure that that's not going to happen.

01:38:07,938 --> 01:38:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  And then of course they were persuaded by the British.

01:38:11,106 --> 01:38:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  This is the old hand.

01:38:12,962 --> 01:38:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  We've been in Iran since the beginning of the...

01:38:15,554 --> 01:38:18,878
SPEAKER_0:  Nineteenth century they always had relations with Iran and so forth.

01:38:20,098 --> 01:38:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  they gradually replace.

01:38:22,978 --> 01:38:27,198
SPEAKER_0:  And of course, I don't want to give them this kind of a satanic.

01:38:27,554 --> 01:38:29,054
SPEAKER_0:  view that the making of a zip.

01:38:29,602 --> 01:38:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  bad influence because they had also some very good influences in Iraq.

01:38:33,890 --> 01:38:35,966
SPEAKER_0:  but this particular episode.

01:38:36,482 --> 01:38:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  somehow.

01:38:38,210 --> 01:38:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  Shit.

01:38:39,394 --> 01:38:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  Dark Light.

01:38:41,090 --> 01:38:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  on the American presence and was used and abused.

01:38:44,738 --> 01:38:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  time and again particularly the revolution.

01:38:47,522 --> 01:38:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  1979.

01:38:49,282 --> 01:38:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  Was this great Satan idea that Khomeini created?

01:38:53,026 --> 01:38:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  basically was based on the fact is.

01:38:55,202 --> 01:38:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  1953.

01:38:57,122 --> 01:38:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  You were responsible for the downfall of

01:39:00,034 --> 01:39:01,630
SPEAKER_0:  a national government in Iran.

01:39:02,114 --> 01:39:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  which as a matter of fact, he had no respect for it.

01:39:04,898 --> 01:39:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  how many had no respect for it.

01:39:07,490 --> 01:39:10,046
SPEAKER_0:  secular, national, liberals.

01:39:10,402 --> 01:39:12,382
SPEAKER_0:  including Mohammed Moussaadeh.

01:39:12,674 --> 01:39:14,206
SPEAKER_0:  but he was using it as a...

01:39:15,074 --> 01:39:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  as a rhetorical tool.

01:39:17,090 --> 01:39:18,142
SPEAKER_0:  for his own purposes.

01:39:18,594 --> 01:39:19,966
SPEAKER_0:  But what happened is that

01:39:20,674 --> 01:39:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  after 1953.

01:39:24,002 --> 01:39:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  We see again the rise of

01:39:26,818 --> 01:39:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  authoritarian.

01:39:28,546 --> 01:39:30,046
SPEAKER_0:  Muhammad Reza Shah is.

01:39:30,370 --> 01:39:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  power.

01:39:31,778 --> 01:39:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  And then he is, that's the Shah? That's the Shah. That's Bin Nawaz Shah. This is son of Reza Shah.

01:39:37,794 --> 01:39:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  And uh...

01:39:38,594 --> 01:39:39,719
SPEAKER_1:  Technically what is

01:39:39,719 --> 01:39:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  shot!

01:39:40,994 --> 01:39:43,806
SPEAKER_0:  Shahi is an old term in Persian.

01:39:44,450 --> 01:39:47,774
SPEAKER_0:  that comes from a pre-Islamic Persian of

01:39:48,354 --> 01:39:50,229
SPEAKER_0:  ancient times in the context of the

01:39:50,229 --> 01:39:52,606
SPEAKER_1:  democracy should be seen as like a

01:39:52,962 --> 01:39:54,366
SPEAKER_1:  Supreme Leader, King.

01:39:54,850 --> 01:39:57,758
SPEAKER_0:  is the head of the executive power.

01:39:58,338 --> 01:40:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  according to the constitution of nineteen or six all that's in the constitution the actual term show as a place in the constitution but the to Tris or okay using

01:40:06,690 --> 01:40:08,565
SPEAKER_0:  but the Shah is a very old term.

01:40:08,565 --> 01:40:12,315
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's almost like a monarchic term like a like a

01:40:12,315 --> 01:40:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  King.

01:40:12,994 --> 01:40:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it is actually is a term.

01:40:15,330 --> 01:40:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  peculiar to Iran.

01:40:16,962 --> 01:40:18,174
SPEAKER_0:  I've written about it somewhere.

01:40:18,754 --> 01:40:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  What?

01:40:19,490 --> 01:40:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  because the term that the Western word in the ancient times has been rex.

01:40:24,386 --> 01:40:25,822
SPEAKER_0:  for royalty and the king.

01:40:26,658 --> 01:40:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  in the Eastern world in

01:40:28,802 --> 01:40:32,382
SPEAKER_0:  India is Raj, is the same origin, the same root.

01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:35,550
SPEAKER_0:  Iran never shared that. They had the idea of a-

01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  We'll see.

01:40:36,962 --> 01:40:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  Rex and Raj, I don't want to get into too much of etymology, but this is an interesting one.

01:40:42,306 --> 01:40:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. Both means the one that opens the road.

01:40:46,978 --> 01:40:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  for

01:40:48,322 --> 01:40:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  basically enforcer of religion.

01:40:50,818 --> 01:40:51,358
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

01:40:52,130 --> 01:40:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  Um, in, vidare

01:40:54,786 --> 01:40:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  of the right religion.

01:40:56,610 --> 01:40:58,526
SPEAKER_0:  Cause Rex and Raj both have the

01:40:59,106 --> 01:41:01,278
SPEAKER_0:  After a small logical little

01:41:01,506 --> 01:41:02,750
SPEAKER_0:  origin of

01:41:03,298 --> 01:41:04,190
SPEAKER_0:  Right

01:41:04,770 --> 01:41:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  You see? And right means the right religion.

01:41:07,266 --> 01:41:08,894
SPEAKER_0:  Basically. There's some.

01:41:09,122 --> 01:41:13,822
SPEAKER_1:  much beautiful language here. I'm just looking at the Persian constitution in 1906.

01:41:14,274 --> 01:41:17,342
SPEAKER_1:  and it says it's the constitution of the sublime.

01:41:17,634 --> 01:41:18,974
SPEAKER_1:  state of Persia.

01:41:19,394 --> 01:41:20,702
SPEAKER_1:  Pajar Iran.

01:41:20,930 --> 01:41:21,758
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, just.

01:41:22,050 --> 01:41:24,675
SPEAKER_1:  Just the extra adjectives on top of this stuff is.

01:41:24,675 --> 01:41:27,358
SPEAKER_0:  beautiful. Yeah, because that was actually

01:41:27,938 --> 01:41:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  The change that came about, I don't want to go too much into it.

01:41:32,098 --> 01:41:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  It was called, as I pointed out before, the guarded domains of Iran. Yes. They changed that to the sublime state of Iran.

01:41:40,034 --> 01:41:41,438
SPEAKER_0:  Unique as you should ever be.

01:41:41,826 --> 01:41:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  Because

01:41:43,010 --> 01:41:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  wanted to give a greater sense of centrality of this state.

01:41:46,978 --> 01:41:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  and sublime was the term used.

01:41:49,794 --> 01:41:52,894
SPEAKER_1:  What permeates all of this is a poetic.

01:41:53,442 --> 01:41:54,567
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, there is a history.

01:41:54,567 --> 01:41:58,317
SPEAKER_0:  of poetry to the culture, which is fascinating.

01:41:58,317 --> 01:42:04,094
SPEAKER_1:  So I mean it's I of course I don't speak the language, but even in Russian there's also

01:42:05,474 --> 01:42:06,558
SPEAKER_1:  A music.

01:42:07,490 --> 01:42:15,358
SPEAKER_1:  to the soul of the people that represents itself, that presents itself in the form of poetry and literature in the way that it doesn't in the...

01:42:15,586 --> 01:42:18,343
SPEAKER_1:  in the English speaking world. I don't know what that is. There's

01:42:18,343 --> 01:42:18,782
SPEAKER_0:  um

01:42:19,106 --> 01:42:21,214
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, this is a romantic site.

01:42:22,786 --> 01:42:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I agree with you.

01:42:24,066 --> 01:42:29,310
SPEAKER_0:  In Iran, of course, you know, there's a time of the constitutional revolution, there's a time of great poetry.

01:42:30,658 --> 01:42:31,614
SPEAKER_0:  This kind of a...

01:42:31,906 --> 01:42:33,918
SPEAKER_0:  patriotic.

01:42:34,594 --> 01:42:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  sentiments that comes through.

01:42:37,154 --> 01:42:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  poetry plays a very important part.

01:42:40,034 --> 01:42:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

01:42:40,610 --> 01:42:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  Of course.

01:42:41,890 --> 01:42:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  These days poetry has...

01:42:43,842 --> 01:42:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  kind of decline.

01:42:46,242 --> 01:42:51,838
SPEAKER_0:  and instead you see the visual image that is at the center. That's why cinema is so important.

01:42:52,098 --> 01:42:53,726
SPEAKER_0:  kids these days with their TikTok.

01:42:54,722 --> 01:42:56,990
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, let me finish this about the...

01:42:57,218 --> 01:42:58,686
SPEAKER_0:  Period of my madresa show.

01:42:59,202 --> 01:42:59,742
SPEAKER_0:  EEE

01:43:00,194 --> 01:43:03,038
SPEAKER_0:  built up because she received the greater.

01:43:03,650 --> 01:43:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  Income.

01:43:05,186 --> 01:43:05,598
SPEAKER_0:  from

01:43:06,242 --> 01:43:11,678
SPEAKER_0:  the oil revenue and it built up a very strong state with a strong security force.

01:43:12,514 --> 01:43:13,310
SPEAKER_0:  It's strange.

01:43:13,538 --> 01:43:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  security apparatus, which is this SAVAK.

01:43:16,770 --> 01:43:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  Is there?

01:43:17,730 --> 01:43:20,094
SPEAKER_0:  which is an acronym for the

01:43:20,450 --> 01:43:23,166
SPEAKER_0:  security force in security organization.

01:43:24,002 --> 01:43:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:43:24,962 --> 01:43:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  She of course...

01:43:26,146 --> 01:43:30,942
SPEAKER_0:  unfortunately in the 1960s and 70s, particularly 1970s.

01:43:31,650 --> 01:43:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  basically suppress the voices.

01:43:34,594 --> 01:43:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  of or possibility of any kind of a mass.

01:43:38,530 --> 01:43:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  participation in the political.

01:43:41,378 --> 01:43:41,982
SPEAKER_0:  process.

01:43:42,402 --> 01:43:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  It became very much an authoritarian regime with its own technocrats.

01:43:47,394 --> 01:43:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  very much a modernist.

01:43:49,826 --> 01:43:50,846
SPEAKER_0:  vision of

01:43:51,074 --> 01:43:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  off off off

01:43:52,738 --> 01:43:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  Iran's future.

01:43:54,242 --> 01:43:57,886
SPEAKER_0:  and almost kind of messianic that he was hoping that Iran...

01:43:58,338 --> 01:44:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  in a decade would become the fifth.

01:44:00,706 --> 01:44:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  most powerful state in the world.

01:44:03,170 --> 01:44:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  and the riches, as you would have said.

01:44:05,954 --> 01:44:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  the gates of the great civilization.

01:44:08,802 --> 01:44:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  very much in the mind.

01:44:11,650 --> 01:44:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  at this image of ancient Iran of the Achaemenid Empire.

01:44:15,522 --> 01:44:19,678
SPEAKER_0:  And we want to go back to that greatness of the Achaemenid Empire somewhat.

01:44:20,226 --> 01:44:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  Rather naïve.

01:44:22,434 --> 01:44:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  and very nationalistic in a crude fashion.

01:44:25,794 --> 01:44:27,070
SPEAKER_0:  And what happened is that...

01:44:27,426 --> 01:44:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  As a result, there was built up some kind of a resistance.

01:44:31,490 --> 01:44:33,854
SPEAKER_0:  from the intellectuals, from the left.

01:44:34,306 --> 01:44:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  eventually resulting in a kind of a protest movement, as I said by 1977.

01:44:42,562 --> 01:44:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  then of course the question that comes to mind and they probably...

01:44:46,786 --> 01:44:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  you would like to know about.

01:44:49,602 --> 01:44:53,246
SPEAKER_0:  is the fact that white becomes religious, white become Islamic.

01:44:53,730 --> 01:44:54,334
SPEAKER_0:  If it's the-

01:44:54,658 --> 01:44:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  popular.

01:44:56,162 --> 01:44:56,702
SPEAKER_0:  you know.

01:44:57,090 --> 01:44:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  National is liberal.

01:44:59,234 --> 01:45:01,278
SPEAKER_0:  tendency of opening up the

01:45:01,794 --> 01:45:04,894
SPEAKER_0:  political space.

01:45:05,538 --> 01:45:09,342
SPEAKER_0:  and allowing greater participation going back to the constitution.

01:45:10,146 --> 01:45:12,414
SPEAKER_0:  of 1906, 1907.

01:45:12,898 --> 01:45:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  why it's all of a sudden it becomes Khomeini, where the sea comes from.

01:45:18,466 --> 01:45:21,950
SPEAKER_0:  The reason for that, at least in a concise fashion.

01:45:22,498 --> 01:45:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  is the...

01:45:24,322 --> 01:45:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  fact that in one area.

01:45:27,426 --> 01:45:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  That's.

01:45:28,834 --> 01:45:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  after the greater suppression of all the other voices remained.

01:45:34,594 --> 01:45:36,254
SPEAKER_0:  Open was religion.

01:45:37,122 --> 01:45:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  Masks.

01:45:39,426 --> 01:45:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  The mullahs and the

01:45:41,314 --> 01:45:41,982
SPEAKER_0:  full pet.

01:45:43,202 --> 01:45:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  and the message that gradually shifted.

01:45:48,386 --> 01:45:53,598
SPEAKER_0:  from the old traditional message of the Sharia of Islam.

01:45:54,242 --> 01:45:57,726
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, all the rules and regulations of how one has to live.

01:45:58,594 --> 01:46:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  into something very political.

01:46:00,994 --> 01:46:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  and not only political.

01:46:03,106 --> 01:46:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  but also radical politics.

01:46:06,786 --> 01:46:07,358
SPEAKER_0:  Soap.

01:46:09,058 --> 01:46:14,366
SPEAKER_0:  in the whole period from the Constitutional Revolution to the Revolution of 1979.

01:46:15,138 --> 01:46:19,646
SPEAKER_0:  Basically, the religious establishment gradually was pushed to the opposition.

01:46:19,938 --> 01:46:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  They were not originated, very conservative.

01:46:22,722 --> 01:46:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  support us. update.

01:46:24,578 --> 01:46:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  as the Catholic Church, for instance.

01:46:26,690 --> 01:46:27,742
SPEAKER_0:  was supported of.

01:46:28,034 --> 01:46:29,182
SPEAKER_0:  Majority of the.

01:46:29,730 --> 01:46:30,590
SPEAKER_0:  I said Italian.

01:46:30,978 --> 01:46:32,286
SPEAKER_0:  governments around the world.

01:46:34,050 --> 01:46:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  But the politicization...

01:46:36,930 --> 01:46:38,750
SPEAKER_0:  was the result of isolation.

01:46:39,618 --> 01:46:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  because they were left out of the...

01:46:41,538 --> 01:46:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  system.

01:46:42,530 --> 01:46:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  And while in isolation

01:46:44,610 --> 01:46:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  They did not.

01:46:46,530 --> 01:46:48,254
SPEAKER_0:  They were not successful.

01:46:49,154 --> 01:46:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  in

01:46:50,626 --> 01:46:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  trying to reform themselves.

01:46:52,834 --> 01:46:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  to try to become.

01:46:54,690 --> 01:46:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  to try to find answers to many of the questions of modern times.

01:46:58,754 --> 01:46:59,902
SPEAKER_0:  What happens to women?

01:47:00,162 --> 01:47:01,662
SPEAKER_0:  What happens to civil rights?

01:47:01,954 --> 01:47:02,974
SPEAKER_0:  What happens to...

01:47:03,202 --> 01:47:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  civil society.

01:47:05,026 --> 01:47:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  How?

01:47:06,370 --> 01:47:09,374
SPEAKER_0:  modern law and individual

01:47:09,762 --> 01:47:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  freedoms have to be.

01:47:11,618 --> 01:47:13,493
SPEAKER_0:  defined in Islamic terms.

01:47:13,493 --> 01:47:15,743
SPEAKER_1:  how to separate religion and.

01:47:15,743 --> 01:47:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  state or how to separate religion and state.

01:47:19,010 --> 01:47:20,734
SPEAKER_0:  These issues were never addressed.

01:47:21,986 --> 01:47:23,422
SPEAKER_0:  What happened is that

01:47:23,778 --> 01:47:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  there was this bypass through political.

01:47:27,618 --> 01:47:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  Islam.

01:47:28,770 --> 01:47:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:47:29,858 --> 01:47:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  revolutionary Islam as it gradually they learned, you know.

01:47:34,370 --> 01:47:34,686
SPEAKER_0:  that.

01:47:34,914 --> 01:47:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  This is the bypass, bypass to power basically.

01:47:37,538 --> 01:47:38,942
SPEAKER_0:  to become again.

01:47:39,394 --> 01:47:44,542
SPEAKER_0:  a voice in the society and eventually a prominent voice and eventually monolithic.

01:47:44,802 --> 01:47:45,214
SPEAKER_0:  voice.

01:47:45,570 --> 01:47:48,510
SPEAKER_0:  in the society. That's the process that led to the

01:47:48,930 --> 01:47:51,262
SPEAKER_0:  into the revolution of 1979.

01:47:51,714 --> 01:47:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  Basically, this period.

01:47:54,114 --> 01:47:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  greater attention was paid to religion, even among the secular middle classes.

01:48:00,066 --> 01:48:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  who were alienated.

01:48:03,138 --> 01:48:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  for a very long time because of this.

01:48:06,050 --> 01:48:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  extensive modernization of the Pahlavi period.

01:48:09,538 --> 01:48:12,478
SPEAKER_0:  They didn't have a sense of that old...

01:48:13,026 --> 01:48:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  Molus with deterbents.

01:48:15,362 --> 01:48:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  but they became, they had a kind of aura.

01:48:18,626 --> 01:48:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  in this period, yes, they are those who remain.

01:48:22,114 --> 01:48:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  and not corrupted.

01:48:24,546 --> 01:48:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  They are the people who...

01:48:26,850 --> 01:48:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  basically went against the

01:48:29,058 --> 01:48:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  suppression of the Pahlavi regime.

01:48:31,362 --> 01:48:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  and Khomeini became a leader, a symbol of them.

01:48:35,010 --> 01:48:37,374
SPEAKER_0:  Nobody ever thought in the earlier stages.

01:48:38,146 --> 01:48:38,718
SPEAKER_0:  and bonk

01:48:38,978 --> 01:48:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  This very excited.

01:48:40,738 --> 01:48:42,686
SPEAKER_0:  Multitudes that came to the streets.

01:48:43,106 --> 01:48:44,926
SPEAKER_0:  of the Iranian cities.

01:48:45,346 --> 01:48:46,654
SPEAKER_0:  in 1979.

01:48:47,138 --> 01:48:48,734
SPEAKER_0:  or 1978 actually.

01:48:49,538 --> 01:48:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  Really thought that this

01:48:52,130 --> 01:48:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  This old model is in its 70s.

01:48:55,458 --> 01:48:58,526
SPEAKER_0:  that all of a sudden has appeared from Najaf.

01:48:59,426 --> 01:49:02,206
SPEAKER_0:  through Paris to Tehran.

01:49:02,786 --> 01:49:07,742
SPEAKER_0:  is going to take over and create a autocracy, a religious.

01:49:08,066 --> 01:49:09,191
SPEAKER_0:  authoring the

01:49:09,191 --> 01:49:11,710

SPEAKER_1:  Who you just you just mentioned a few.

01:49:14,722 --> 01:49:16,862
SPEAKER_1:  disparate facts about the man.

01:49:18,018 --> 01:49:27,102
SPEAKER_1:  He was the person that took power in 1979, the supreme leader of Iran. Some you mentioned something about Paris, something about being in the seventies. I guess.

01:49:27,234 --> 01:49:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  what should we know about the guy

01:49:28,898 --> 01:49:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  Ayatollah Khomeini

01:49:30,786 --> 01:49:35,646
SPEAKER_0:  who eventually was known as Imam Khomeini. He was kind of promoted to a...

01:49:36,130 --> 01:49:38,005
SPEAKER_0:  even more sublime position.

01:49:38,005 --> 01:49:40,446
SPEAKER_1:  Can we, just a million tangents.

01:49:40,898 --> 01:49:42,430

SPEAKER_0:  What do these terms mean? Well Ayatollah means the-

01:49:48,066 --> 01:49:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  Sign of God.

01:49:49,730 --> 01:49:50,046
SPEAKER_0:  Uh huh.

01:49:51,330 --> 01:49:53,214
SPEAKER_0:  in the course of the 19th century.

01:49:53,570 --> 01:49:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  or early 20th century.

01:49:55,842 --> 01:49:59,422
SPEAKER_0:  as the religious establishment gradually lost its.

01:50:00,546 --> 01:50:05,118
SPEAKER_0:  greater presence in the society and its prominent places in society.

01:50:05,410 --> 01:50:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  they had some kind of inflation in titles.

01:50:08,546 --> 01:50:16,830
SPEAKER_0:  So they gave themselves more grand titles. Yeah, more adjectives. More adjectives, more grand titles such as Ayatollah.

01:50:17,378 --> 01:50:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  that became.

01:50:18,690 --> 01:50:20,926
SPEAKER_0:  a kind of a highest rank

01:50:21,346 --> 01:50:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  of the religious hierarchy.

01:50:23,618 --> 01:50:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  which incidentally was in unofficial hierarchy.

01:50:27,586 --> 01:50:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  It was not.

01:50:28,546 --> 01:50:29,630
SPEAKER_0:  It's not like the-

01:50:29,890 --> 01:50:32,286
SPEAKER_0:  like Catholic church that you have.

01:50:32,770 --> 01:50:34,462
SPEAKER_0:  you know, bishops and you know.

01:50:34,754 --> 01:50:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  further off.

01:50:35,778 --> 01:50:37,662
SPEAKER_0:  It was very unofficial, Mother.

01:50:38,146 --> 01:50:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  and he was an ayatullah.

01:50:39,938 --> 01:50:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  was eventually recognized as an ayatollah.

01:50:43,298 --> 01:50:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  He wasn't the first AYATOL?

01:50:45,762 --> 01:50:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  No, no, no, not at all. The ayatollahs were before him.

01:50:48,930 --> 01:50:50,750
SPEAKER_0:  ever since the beginning of the century.

01:50:51,234 --> 01:50:51,614
SPEAKER_0:  What?

01:50:52,162 --> 01:50:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  he was eventually recognized as an ayatollah.

01:50:56,194 --> 01:50:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:50:56,930 --> 01:50:58,814
SPEAKER_0:  if I want to start it this way.

01:50:59,586 --> 01:51:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  Ayatollah Khomeini was born in 1900.

01:51:03,202 --> 01:51:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:51:03,874 --> 01:51:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  In a sense, all this

01:51:05,762 --> 01:51:07,006
SPEAKER_0:  Tremendous.

01:51:07,906 --> 01:51:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  change that Iran witnessed in the course of the...

01:51:11,522 --> 01:51:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  20th century.

01:51:14,370 --> 01:51:15,646
SPEAKER_0:  was in a sense.

01:51:16,194 --> 01:51:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  materializing this person.

01:51:19,010 --> 01:51:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  He become.

01:51:20,482 --> 01:51:20,830
SPEAKER_0:  Eh.

01:51:21,058 --> 01:51:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  Mullah of a lower rank

01:51:23,650 --> 01:51:24,478
SPEAKER_0:  went to the...

01:51:24,770 --> 01:51:27,486
SPEAKER_0:  traditional madrasas to the traditional...

01:51:28,162 --> 01:51:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  centers for the education.

01:51:31,234 --> 01:51:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  of these seminarians.

01:51:33,826 --> 01:51:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  never had a secular education.

01:51:37,954 --> 01:51:38,718
SPEAKER_0:  Hard every.

01:51:39,042 --> 01:51:43,390
SPEAKER_0:  complex Islamic education on this one hand jurisprudence on the other hand

01:51:43,842 --> 01:51:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  probably a little bit of Islamic philosophy.

01:51:46,562 --> 01:51:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  Mysticism which is un-

01:51:48,386 --> 01:51:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  Usual for the...

01:51:50,338 --> 01:51:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  yours for the

01:51:52,002 --> 01:51:52,798
SPEAKER_0:  I'm 40.

01:51:53,154 --> 01:51:54,686
SPEAKER_0:  faqih as they call them.

01:51:55,426 --> 01:51:57,758
SPEAKER_0:  these religious scholars or...

01:51:58,402 --> 01:52:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  or legal scholars of Islam.

01:52:01,218 --> 01:52:02,526
SPEAKER_0:  and then he...

01:52:03,170 --> 01:52:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  in the 1960s.

01:52:06,242 --> 01:52:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  when

01:52:07,586 --> 01:52:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  He was residing in Tehran.

01:52:10,082 --> 01:52:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:52:10,818 --> 01:52:12,926
SPEAKER_0:  gradually becoming more important.

01:52:13,698 --> 01:52:14,494
SPEAKER_0:  He became.

01:52:14,946 --> 01:52:17,310
SPEAKER_0:  a voice of opposition against the Shah.

01:52:18,178 --> 01:52:20,254
SPEAKER_0:  and the reason for opposition.

01:52:20,898 --> 01:52:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  in the early 1960s.

01:52:24,642 --> 01:52:26,430
SPEAKER_0:  was the fact that the shark...

01:52:27,266 --> 01:52:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  carried through a series of

01:52:30,306 --> 01:52:32,190
SPEAKER_0:  extensive

01:52:32,674 --> 01:52:34,398
SPEAKER_0:  modernization policies.

01:52:34,690 --> 01:52:37,470
SPEAKER_0:  of which the most important was the land reform.

01:52:38,786 --> 01:52:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  So in effect, the land distribution.

01:52:41,858 --> 01:52:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  that took place.

01:52:43,202 --> 01:52:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  in the early 60s.

01:52:45,282 --> 01:52:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  removed or weakened greatly that class of landowners.

01:52:50,178 --> 01:52:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  from the ancient, from the...

01:52:51,938 --> 01:52:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  Nineteenth Century.

01:52:53,698 --> 01:52:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:52:54,946 --> 01:52:55,486
SPEAKER_0:  BEE

01:52:55,746 --> 01:52:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

01:52:56,290 --> 01:52:58,078
SPEAKER_0:  Khomeini saw himself.

01:52:58,402 --> 01:53:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  as a voice of death.

01:53:00,546 --> 01:53:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  old class.

01:53:02,210 --> 01:53:02,718
SPEAKER_0:  That's.

01:53:03,298 --> 01:53:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:53:04,450 --> 01:53:08,958
SPEAKER_0:  felt that actually declared that this land redistribution is.

01:53:09,346 --> 01:53:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  un-Islamic, according to the Islamic law.

01:53:12,994 --> 01:53:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  Property is honored.

01:53:18,274 --> 01:53:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  and you cannot just...

01:53:20,418 --> 01:53:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  No matter how.

01:53:22,210 --> 01:53:24,446
SPEAKER_0:  much and how large are these?

01:53:24,962 --> 01:53:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  a state that the landowning class has, the government has no right to redistribute it.

01:53:29,954 --> 01:53:32,542
SPEAKER_0:  even among the peasants. it day but Lup Coming

01:53:33,186 --> 01:53:35,134
SPEAKER_0:  people who are...

01:53:35,650 --> 01:53:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  filling the line.

01:53:37,154 --> 01:53:40,798
SPEAKER_0:  So that was a major issue. Share also give them.

01:53:41,602 --> 01:53:42,526
SPEAKER_0: ...D

01:53:43,074 --> 01:53:44,286
SPEAKER_0:  right of...

01:53:45,314 --> 01:53:45,918
SPEAKER_0:  Vote.

01:53:46,594 --> 01:53:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  to women.

01:53:49,026 --> 01:53:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  And that also.

01:53:50,626 --> 01:53:51,646
SPEAKER_0:  He objected.

01:53:51,906 --> 01:53:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  So is that women?

01:53:53,250 --> 01:53:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  Don't have it right.

01:53:54,530 --> 01:53:57,182
SPEAKER_1:  Can we just linger on the Islamic law?

01:53:58,146 --> 01:53:59,870
SPEAKER_1:  How firm and clear.

01:54:00,802 --> 01:54:04,510
SPEAKER_1:  is the Islamic law that he was representing and embodying.

01:54:04,930 --> 01:54:06,174
SPEAKER_1:  Is this, uh...

01:54:06,818 --> 01:54:08,693
SPEAKER_1:  Codify. Yes, it's a good one.

01:54:08,693 --> 01:54:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  term.

01:54:09,346 --> 01:54:09,822
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:54:10,114 --> 01:54:11,614
SPEAKER_0:  That's another issue.

01:54:11,874 --> 01:54:14,238
SPEAKER_0:  Not only the hierarchy was unofficial.

01:54:15,042 --> 01:54:16,350
SPEAKER_0:  and informal.

01:54:16,898 --> 01:54:17,694
SPEAKER_0:  But hold still.

01:54:18,466 --> 01:54:18,878
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:54:19,106 --> 01:54:21,630
SPEAKER_0:  Islamic law, particularly Shi'i law.

01:54:23,106 --> 01:54:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  did not have any...

01:54:27,906 --> 01:54:29,406
SPEAKER_0:  a codified system.

01:54:30,114 --> 01:54:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  because these religious authorities always resisted.

01:54:34,818 --> 01:54:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  Becoming under a

01:54:36,898 --> 01:54:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  umbrella.

01:54:38,690 --> 01:54:41,182
SPEAKER_0:  of a more codified system of.

01:54:41,666 --> 01:54:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  Islamic law.

01:54:42,850 --> 01:54:46,110
SPEAKER_0:  because they were outside the state in a sense. Simple

01:54:46,722 --> 01:54:50,590
SPEAKER_0:  Civil law was in the hand of the religious establishment. They had their own courts.

01:54:50,882 --> 01:54:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  independent of the state.

01:54:52,930 --> 01:54:57,214
SPEAKER_0:  But other matters of legal matters was in the hand of the government. There was a-

01:54:57,666 --> 01:54:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  kind of in.

01:54:58,658 --> 01:55:03,742
SPEAKER_0:  the facto division between these two institutions, state versus the religious establishment.

01:55:04,770 --> 01:55:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  Therefore it was not codified.

01:55:06,978 --> 01:55:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  so he could declare that this is unofficial.

01:55:10,274 --> 01:55:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  I'll say illegal according to the Islamic law.

01:55:13,730 --> 01:55:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  that you distributed land to the peasants.

01:55:17,186 --> 01:55:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  and another mujtahid or another religious society.

01:55:20,610 --> 01:55:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  would say no, no, it's perfectly fine, because he would have it.

01:55:24,098 --> 01:55:25,598
SPEAKER_0:  different reading of the law.

01:55:26,242 --> 01:55:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:55:26,786 --> 01:55:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  That being in mind that

01:55:28,418 --> 01:55:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  adds to the complexity of the picture.

01:55:30,786 --> 01:55:32,862
SPEAKER_0:  He in the 1960s, free.

01:55:33,218 --> 01:55:34,238
SPEAKER_0:  There was a period.

01:55:34,594 --> 01:55:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  of uprising of the supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini.

01:55:38,754 --> 01:55:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  That was a turning point in a sense to try to.

01:55:44,066 --> 01:55:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  politicize the religious.

01:55:46,466 --> 01:55:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  supporters of Ayatollah, who were loyal to Ayatollah Khomeini.

01:55:50,914 --> 01:55:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  and in a sense.

01:55:52,322 --> 01:55:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  all the community of.

01:55:54,114 --> 01:55:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  more religiously orientated against.

01:55:57,026 --> 01:55:58,014
SPEAKER_0:  the secular.

01:55:58,306 --> 01:55:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  policies of the show.

01:55:59,874 --> 01:56:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  and against of course

01:56:01,698 --> 01:56:02,590
SPEAKER_0:  dictatorship.

01:56:02,850 --> 01:56:03,390
SPEAKER_0:  Off the shelf.

01:56:04,002 --> 01:56:05,127
SPEAKER_0:  So that's where the religious...

01:56:05,127 --> 01:56:06,627
SPEAKER_1:  became a political party.

01:56:06,627 --> 01:56:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  In 1963, the first...

01:56:08,706 --> 01:56:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  moment is the huge uprising.

01:56:10,818 --> 01:56:12,574
SPEAKER_0:  And the government suppressed it.

01:56:13,570 --> 01:56:14,270
SPEAKER_0:  But then...

01:56:14,850 --> 01:56:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  suppression. Yes.

01:56:16,610 --> 01:56:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  would start to build. goal field.

01:56:19,170 --> 01:56:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  and he was sent to exile.

01:56:21,698 --> 01:56:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  He went to Najaf, which is this great center in southern.

01:56:24,898 --> 01:56:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  So became a martyr on top of this. At the martyr.

01:56:28,482 --> 01:56:31,102
SPEAKER_0:  He was probably even forgotten, to some extent.

01:56:32,098 --> 01:56:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  but not, it was forgotten for the...

01:56:35,522 --> 01:56:36,734
SPEAKER_0:  for the secular.

01:56:37,570 --> 01:56:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  middle class.

01:56:39,202 --> 01:56:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  What not?

01:56:40,578 --> 01:56:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  to those supporters of his.

01:56:42,786 --> 01:56:43,710
SPEAKER_0:  who were paying him.

01:56:44,386 --> 01:56:47,742
SPEAKER_0:  their dues because in Islam you would pay dues.

01:56:48,386 --> 01:56:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  to religious leaders.

01:56:50,178 --> 01:56:52,510
SPEAKER_0:  You know, there's religious views and aahms.

01:56:53,058 --> 01:56:54,494
SPEAKER_0:  that you put pay to the...

01:56:54,786 --> 01:56:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  Click our authorities.

01:56:56,514 --> 01:57:00,318
SPEAKER_0:  and they redistribute them among their own students and so forth.

01:57:00,578 --> 01:57:03,966
SPEAKER_0:  So they built actually a network of loyalty based on this.

01:57:04,642 --> 01:57:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  donations.

01:57:06,114 --> 01:57:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  And these donations.

01:57:08,418 --> 01:57:10,718
SPEAKER_0:  That's received by a total of how many was very

01:57:11,138 --> 01:57:13,150
SPEAKER_0:  effectively through his network.

01:57:13,474 --> 01:57:14,782
SPEAKER_0:  was distributed.

01:57:15,266 --> 01:57:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  You guys.

01:57:16,290 --> 01:57:17,598
SPEAKER_0:  in exile at Sardar.

01:57:19,650 --> 01:57:22,238
SPEAKER_0:  The 1977, 1978.

01:57:23,074 --> 01:57:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  when the situation

01:57:25,122 --> 01:57:27,838
SPEAKER_0:  changed and there was a little bit of opening.

01:57:28,546 --> 01:57:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  in the political climate.

01:57:32,258 --> 01:57:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  Then you saw that Ayatollah Khomeini...

01:57:35,938 --> 01:57:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  start sending.

01:57:37,506 --> 01:57:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  cassette messages.

01:57:39,394 --> 01:57:41,086
SPEAKER_0:  That was his mean of communication.

01:57:41,730 --> 01:57:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  was sending cassettes and cassettes were sent through

01:57:44,610 --> 01:57:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  the country by his...

01:57:46,690 --> 01:57:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  Network.

01:57:48,226 --> 01:57:51,454
SPEAKER_0:  So all declarations and saying first.

01:57:52,162 --> 01:57:56,478
SPEAKER_0:  that we would like to see a greater democratization.

01:57:57,090 --> 01:57:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  and the Shah has to...

01:57:59,202 --> 01:58:00,414
SPEAKER_0:  Abide by...

01:58:00,802 --> 01:58:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  the Constitution of 1907.

01:58:04,098 --> 01:58:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  this is a constitution, this is a democratic system and so forth. was he charismatic?

01:58:09,058 --> 01:58:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  Well it depends who would call.

01:58:11,074 --> 01:58:13,918
SPEAKER_0:  What do you call charismatic? The long beard it was

01:58:14,306 --> 01:58:14,846
SPEAKER_0:  Kind of.

01:58:15,234 --> 01:58:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  Oh YAS

01:58:16,610 --> 01:58:17,982
SPEAKER_0:  interban and the

01:58:18,274 --> 01:58:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  gown which was

01:58:19,970 --> 01:58:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  a very unusual leadership.

01:58:23,298 --> 01:58:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  For-

01:58:24,002 --> 01:58:25,086
SPEAKER_0:  people who were.

01:58:25,346 --> 01:58:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  much more accustomed to the civilian clothing or to the equipment.

01:58:29,954 --> 01:58:32,126
SPEAKER_0:  of the Shah's military uniforms.

01:58:32,386 --> 01:58:34,261
SPEAKER_0:  that you used to wear.

01:58:34,261 --> 01:58:34,718
SPEAKER_1:  like.

01:58:35,010 --> 01:58:39,230
SPEAKER_1:  He is a man that was able to take power to become popular, Yeah, good.

01:58:39,522 --> 01:58:39,902
SPEAKER_1:  Sorry.

01:58:40,194 --> 01:58:40,606
SPEAKER_0:  I

01:58:40,866 --> 01:58:41,758
SPEAKER_1:  I would like

01:58:42,018 --> 01:58:46,878
SPEAKER_1:  Is it the ideas, is it an accident, or is it the man himself, the charisma?

01:58:47,138 --> 01:58:51,358
SPEAKER_1:  or something about the man that led to this particular person.

01:58:52,130 --> 01:58:53,502
SPEAKER_1:  basically changing.

01:58:54,178 --> 01:58:56,286
SPEAKER_1:  the tide of history in this part of the world.

01:58:56,770 --> 01:58:57,895
SPEAKER_1:  in a way that...

01:58:57,895 --> 01:59:00,254
SPEAKER_0:  unexpected.

01:59:00,770 --> 01:59:02,686
SPEAKER_0:  or was it just the beard?

01:59:03,842 --> 01:59:06,270
SPEAKER_0:  No, I think though it's beyond the app era.

01:59:06,722 --> 01:59:09,246
SPEAKER_0:  Appearance is greatly helps, as you know.

01:59:09,570 --> 01:59:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

01:59:10,050 --> 01:59:12,958
SPEAKER_1:  In the 20th century, appearance is helpful.

01:59:13,282 --> 01:59:15,157
SPEAKER_1:  pictures for propaganda from us.

01:59:15,157 --> 01:59:16,670
SPEAKER_0:  That's an important factor.

01:59:17,282 --> 01:59:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  and he was an

01:59:18,978 --> 01:59:20,190
SPEAKER_0:  Kind of it.

01:59:20,610 --> 01:59:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  Adamant.

01:59:22,850 --> 01:59:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:59:23,682 --> 01:59:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  very...

01:59:25,698 --> 01:59:26,430
SPEAKER_0:  severe

01:59:28,450 --> 01:59:29,854
SPEAKER_0:  in his own positions.

01:59:31,842 --> 01:59:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  could appear very uncompromising.

01:59:35,778 --> 01:59:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  and he had this sense of.

01:59:38,178 --> 01:59:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  Confidence, self confidence.

01:59:40,802 --> 01:59:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  that virtually everybody else lacked.

01:59:44,898 --> 01:59:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:59:46,786 --> 01:59:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  He was a man of opportunity.

01:59:50,498 --> 01:59:52,446
SPEAKER_0:  As soon as you would see that...

01:59:53,538 --> 01:59:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  a chance and opportunity would open up.

01:59:56,770 --> 01:59:57,214
SPEAKER_0:  He would.

01:59:57,826 --> 01:59:58,622
SPEAKER_0:  Jump on it.

02:00:00,034 --> 02:00:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  And that's what he did basically.

02:00:02,114 --> 02:00:04,318
SPEAKER_0:  as more the political space.

02:00:04,610 --> 02:00:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  opened.

02:00:05,794 --> 02:00:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  the weaknesses of the Shah's government became more evident.

02:00:09,858 --> 02:00:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  his indecision became more evident.

02:00:13,410 --> 02:00:14,718
SPEAKER_0:  his lack of-

02:00:15,042 --> 02:00:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  confidence became more evident.

02:00:17,634 --> 02:00:20,958
SPEAKER_0:  Khomeini managed to move further into the center.

02:00:21,442 --> 02:00:22,206
SPEAKER_0:  After movement.

02:00:22,562 --> 02:00:25,150
SPEAKER_0:  because he was the only

02:00:25,538 --> 02:00:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  Authority.

02:00:27,042 --> 02:00:28,670
SPEAKER_0:  that had this network.

02:00:29,122 --> 02:00:30,014
SPEAKER_0:  of support.

02:00:30,370 --> 02:00:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  through the masks.

02:00:31,778 --> 02:00:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  through the people.

02:00:33,410 --> 02:00:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  who paid.

02:00:34,914 --> 02:00:35,870
SPEAKER_0:  homage to him.

02:00:36,706 --> 02:00:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  who followed him because there's a sense of following.

02:00:40,226 --> 02:00:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  of the religious leader in Shiza.

02:00:43,266 --> 02:00:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  You are a follower of this authority.

02:00:45,634 --> 02:00:46,750
SPEAKER_0:  follower of that exercise.

02:00:47,618 --> 02:00:48,222
SPEAKER_0:  and his

02:00:48,770 --> 02:00:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  basically created.

02:00:52,290 --> 02:00:55,166
SPEAKER_0:  an environment in which people...

02:00:55,906 --> 02:00:59,134
SPEAKER_0:  looked upon him as a kind of a messianic figure.

02:01:00,706 --> 02:01:02,974
SPEAKER_0:  that came to save Iran.

02:01:03,778 --> 02:01:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  from what they considered at the time.

02:01:06,626 --> 02:01:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  the problems of...

02:01:08,642 --> 02:01:09,054
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:01:09,282 --> 02:01:11,422
SPEAKER_0:  dictatorship under the show.

02:01:12,546 --> 02:01:13,671
SPEAKER_0:  So there's not a suspic-

02:01:13,671 --> 02:01:16,671
SPEAKER_1:  about Islamic law being the primary law of the land.

02:01:16,671 --> 02:01:17,182
SPEAKER_0:  tattoo.

02:01:17,570 --> 02:01:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  people had very little sense.

02:01:20,002 --> 02:01:22,142
SPEAKER_0:  That's what Islamic law is all about.

02:01:22,530 --> 02:01:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  because the secular education.

02:01:24,834 --> 02:01:27,390
SPEAKER_0:  has left that into the old...

02:01:27,874 --> 02:01:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  religious schools, this is not something that...

02:01:30,594 --> 02:01:34,270
SPEAKER_0:  ordinary educated Iranian who go to the universities.

02:01:34,818 --> 02:01:40,126
SPEAKER_0:  is going to learn. Therefore, there is a sense of idealization that there is something great there.

02:01:40,610 --> 02:01:41,086
SPEAKER_0:  That is good.

02:01:41,314 --> 02:01:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  and there were quite a number of intellectuals.

02:01:45,154 --> 02:01:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  who also view this.

02:01:47,650 --> 02:01:48,926
SPEAKER_0:  kind of an idea.

02:01:49,538 --> 02:01:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  they would refer to as West Toxication. That is.

02:01:53,474 --> 02:01:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  this.

02:01:54,210 --> 02:01:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  Civilization of the West.

02:01:56,898 --> 02:01:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  that has brought with it.

02:01:59,682 --> 02:02:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  all the modernity that we see around ourselves.

02:02:03,106 --> 02:02:03,966
SPEAKER_0:  has its

02:02:04,802 --> 02:02:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  enormous sinister features into it.

02:02:07,970 --> 02:02:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  and it has taken away from us our authenticity.

02:02:12,930 --> 02:02:15,678
SPEAKER_0:  That was the thing, that there is something authentic.

02:02:16,002 --> 02:02:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  that should be protected.

02:02:18,018 --> 02:02:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  And therefore...

02:02:19,362 --> 02:02:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  a man in that kind of a garb and appearance.

02:02:23,618 --> 02:02:25,534
SPEAKER_0:  seemed as a source.

02:02:26,434 --> 02:02:29,406
SPEAKER_0:  for return to this originality.

02:02:29,858 --> 02:02:33,182
SPEAKER_0:  of their own culture, authenticity of their own culture.

02:02:33,602 --> 02:02:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  anti-perfectly.

02:02:35,874 --> 02:02:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  Uh

02:02:36,834 --> 02:02:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  took advantage of that. That is Khomeini.

02:02:41,154 --> 02:02:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  Pre-CAD, want to take your feet?

02:02:42,626 --> 02:02:43,966
SPEAKER_0:  and the circular around it.

02:02:44,482 --> 02:02:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  at the expense of everybody else.

02:02:47,138 --> 02:02:51,646
SPEAKER_0:  which he managed in the course of 1979 to 1989.

02:02:52,066 --> 02:02:52,446
SPEAKER_0:  Which is-

02:02:52,706 --> 02:02:53,822
SPEAKER_0:  passed away, died.

02:02:54,210 --> 02:02:56,478
SPEAKER_0:  in the 10 years during this period.

02:02:56,962 --> 02:02:59,102
SPEAKER_0:  managed to basically transform.

02:03:01,250 --> 02:03:02,878
SPEAKER_0:  the Iranian society.

02:03:03,522 --> 02:03:04,542
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, two-

02:03:04,802 --> 02:03:07,678
SPEAKER_0:  create institutions of the Islamic Republic.

02:03:09,538 --> 02:03:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  and to acquire himself the position of the guardian.

02:03:14,434 --> 02:03:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  Juris.

02:03:15,842 --> 02:03:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  That was something completely new, it didn't ever exist.

02:03:19,650 --> 02:03:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  before.

02:03:20,738 --> 02:03:21,950
SPEAKER_0:  As a matter of fact...

02:03:22,466 --> 02:03:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  As you might know...

02:03:24,866 --> 02:03:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  The model of government.

02:03:26,786 --> 02:03:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  that a religious establishment takes over the state.

02:03:31,298 --> 02:03:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  is unprecedented.

02:03:33,314 --> 02:03:35,390
SPEAKER_0:  throughout the course of Iranian history.

02:03:35,682 --> 02:03:38,078
SPEAKER_0:  throughout the course of the Islamic history, I would say.

02:03:38,786 --> 02:03:40,606
SPEAKER_0:  This is the first example.

02:03:41,250 --> 02:03:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  and probably the only example.

02:03:44,066 --> 02:03:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  Of a-

02:03:45,378 --> 02:03:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  of a regime?

02:03:47,618 --> 02:03:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  that religious establishment that has always in the course of Iranian history.

02:03:52,802 --> 02:03:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  ever since I would say probably at least 16th century, if not earlier.

02:03:57,602 --> 02:03:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  has been always.

02:04:00,258 --> 02:04:01,790
SPEAKER_0:  separate from this state.

02:04:03,170 --> 02:04:04,126
SPEAKER_0:  and always

02:04:04,642 --> 02:04:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  kind of collaborating with this state with the certain tensions in between the two of them.

02:04:10,050 --> 02:04:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  David to.

02:04:11,394 --> 02:04:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  basically as they would call themselves, the two...

02:04:14,338 --> 02:04:16,702
SPEAKER_0:  pillars of stability in the society.

02:04:18,050 --> 02:04:22,526
SPEAKER_0:  That situation changed. For the first time, the religious establishment took over.

02:04:23,362 --> 02:04:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  the power of this state.

02:04:25,314 --> 02:04:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  and that's at the core.

02:04:27,362 --> 02:04:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  of what we see today as a major issue.

02:04:31,106 --> 02:04:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  for Iranian society.

02:04:33,218 --> 02:04:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  because

02:04:34,434 --> 02:04:38,014
SPEAKER_0:  These are basically that old balance between the

02:04:38,402 --> 02:04:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  Religion.

02:04:39,362 --> 02:04:41,886
SPEAKER_0:  and the state which was kind of a de facto.

02:04:42,786 --> 02:04:45,854
SPEAKER_0:  separation of the authorities of the two.

02:04:46,690 --> 02:04:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  has been violated and now you have in power.

02:04:51,138 --> 02:04:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  It's y'all.

02:04:52,258 --> 02:04:53,982
SPEAKER_0:  Theocracy in effect.

02:04:54,594 --> 02:04:56,478
SPEAKER_0:  which of course only in the set I did.

02:04:57,090 --> 02:05:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  and in its appearance is theocracy deep down.

02:05:00,450 --> 02:05:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  It's a-

02:05:01,762 --> 02:05:04,254
SPEAKER_0:  in my opinion, is a brutal fascist regime.

02:05:04,898 --> 02:05:07,710
SPEAKER_0:  that it stays in power, but it has the appearance.

02:05:08,258 --> 02:05:09,982
SPEAKER_0:  of religion into it.

02:05:10,562 --> 02:05:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  So this is really the story of the revolution.

02:05:13,954 --> 02:05:15,678
SPEAKER_0:  And as a result of that...

02:05:16,130 --> 02:05:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  The Iranian middle class has greatly suffered. It's not without reason that you see 4 million Iranians abroad.

02:05:23,138 --> 02:05:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  because.

02:05:23,714 --> 02:05:26,334
SPEAKER_0:  basically the emergence of this new power.

02:05:26,978 --> 02:05:27,998
SPEAKER_0:  Gradually.

02:05:29,122 --> 02:05:30,910
SPEAKER_0:  isolated.

02:05:31,202 --> 02:05:31,614
SPEAKER_0:  All.

02:05:31,906 --> 02:05:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  marginalized the secular middle class.

02:05:35,266 --> 02:05:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  who could not survive under that regime.

02:05:38,402 --> 02:05:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  and gradually moved out.

02:05:41,346 --> 02:05:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  uh, uh, in the course of perhaps 30, 40 years up to now, Iran has.

02:05:47,362 --> 02:05:50,590
SPEAKER_0:  The largest, I think I'm right to say so.

02:05:51,138 --> 02:05:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  has the largest brain drain.

02:05:53,506 --> 02:05:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  in any country in the world.

02:05:56,482 --> 02:05:57,182
SPEAKER_0:  population.

02:05:57,314 --> 02:05:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  So fascinating that...

02:05:59,778 --> 02:06:00,446
SPEAKER_1:  How much of a...

02:06:00,930 --> 02:06:02,622
SPEAKER_1:  weird quirk of history is it?

02:06:02,850 --> 02:06:03,614
SPEAKER_1:  that

02:06:04,226 --> 02:06:04,670
SPEAKER_1:  on.

02:06:05,410 --> 02:06:06,622
SPEAKER_1:  that religion

02:06:07,458 --> 02:06:09,022
SPEAKER_1:  would take hold in a country.

02:06:09,634 --> 02:06:11,902
SPEAKER_1:  Like, does it have to do with the individual?

02:06:12,610 --> 02:06:13,694
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like...

02:06:14,434 --> 02:06:17,086
SPEAKER_1:  if we re ran the 20th century.

02:06:18,050 --> 02:06:19,902
SPEAKER_1:  uh... a thousand times

02:06:20,898 --> 02:06:25,214
SPEAKER_1:  when we get the 79 revolution resulting in.

02:06:25,858 --> 02:06:27,166
SPEAKER_1:  Islamic law like

02:06:27,810 --> 02:06:28,446
SPEAKER_1:  less than.

02:06:29,346 --> 02:06:32,981
SPEAKER_1:  you know, 1% of the time it feels like, or no, which, which percent.

02:06:32,981 --> 02:06:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I think it has something to do.

02:06:37,826 --> 02:06:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  with the very complex nature.

02:06:41,378 --> 02:06:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  off.

02:06:42,114 --> 02:06:43,838
SPEAKER_0:  how Iran evolved.

02:06:44,674 --> 02:06:48,446
SPEAKER_0:  over a long period of time, since the 16th century. That's why.

02:06:49,154 --> 02:06:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  If I-

02:06:50,146 --> 02:06:50,494
SPEAKER_0:  would.

02:06:50,914 --> 02:06:53,182
SPEAKER_0:  for a moment talk about what I have written.

02:06:53,506 --> 02:06:54,494
SPEAKER_0:  I've written a book.

02:06:55,042 --> 02:06:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  That's called

02:06:56,066 --> 02:07:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  Iran and modern history, and it does not start in the 20th century.

02:07:00,610 --> 02:07:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  It starts in the 16th century.

02:07:02,818 --> 02:07:03,262
SPEAKER_0:  Because it

02:07:03,650 --> 02:07:07,326
SPEAKER_0:  That's what I've argued, that this complex process

02:07:07,746 --> 02:07:11,646
SPEAKER_0:  that at the end of the day resulted in what we see around us today.

02:07:12,418 --> 02:07:16,543
SPEAKER_0:  is something that was in making for a very long time. Religion was a big.

02:07:16,543 --> 02:07:18,718
SPEAKER_1:  part of it. She and

02:07:19,202 --> 02:07:26,590
SPEAKER_1:  the Messiah complex, the longing for this great vision of a great nation.

02:07:27,042 --> 02:07:28,670
SPEAKER_1:  that somehow is a

02:07:30,306 --> 02:07:31,518
SPEAKER_1:  sublime nation.

02:07:32,034 --> 02:07:33,374
SPEAKER_1:  That can only be...

02:07:34,338 --> 02:07:35,582
SPEAKER_1:  Fully sublime.

02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:37,255
SPEAKER_1:

02:07:37,255 --> 02:07:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  religion.

02:07:38,306 --> 02:07:42,846
SPEAKER_0:  or at the time it was thought that is true religion. Ever since then,

02:07:43,522 --> 02:07:48,958
SPEAKER_0:  It's disillusionment with that image, or at least a process of disillusionment.

02:07:49,346 --> 02:07:51,518
SPEAKER_0:  The outcome of it is what we see today.

02:07:52,098 --> 02:07:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  Basically.

02:07:53,282 --> 02:07:57,214
SPEAKER_0:  That process of 40 years is a process of readjusting.

02:07:57,506 --> 02:07:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  to the realities of the world.

02:07:59,746 --> 02:08:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  That.

02:08:00,386 --> 02:08:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  that great moment of.

02:08:02,978 --> 02:08:04,126
SPEAKER_0:  Romantic.

02:08:04,418 --> 02:08:07,902
SPEAKER_0:  success of a revolution, like most revolutions of course.

02:08:08,514 --> 02:08:11,486
SPEAKER_0:  that is going to change Iran and bring this

02:08:11,906 --> 02:08:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  kind of a moment of greatness.

02:08:13,762 --> 02:08:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  led into this great disappointment. It's a movement of the great disappointment in a sense.

02:08:19,458 --> 02:08:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  Like most messianic movements, by the way, messianic movements in general are...

02:08:23,842 --> 02:08:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  always leading into great disappointments.

02:08:26,530 --> 02:08:26,878
SPEAKER_0:  But...

02:08:27,138 --> 02:08:29,886
SPEAKER_0:  What I have here that perhaps...

02:08:30,178 --> 02:08:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  should be added to it.

02:08:32,130 --> 02:08:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  That's.

02:08:32,834 --> 02:08:35,422
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, it was a peculiarity.

02:08:35,970 --> 02:08:36,990
SPEAKER_0:  Of Iran?

02:08:37,730 --> 02:08:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  as a society that had to experience.

02:08:42,178 --> 02:08:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  this eventual.

02:08:44,738 --> 02:08:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  Encounter

02:08:46,178 --> 02:08:47,742
SPEAKER_0:  between religion and state.

02:08:48,354 --> 02:08:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  That's something to do with the nature of Shiza. That's just one point that should be pointed out.

02:08:54,242 --> 02:08:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  Most of Sunni Islam don't have that kind of, I say most because there is something there.

02:09:00,098 --> 02:09:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  What?

02:09:00,674 --> 02:09:05,022
SPEAKER_0:  Sony Islam in general does not have that kind of an aspiration.

02:09:05,538 --> 02:09:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  for the coming of a messianic.

02:09:08,866 --> 02:09:10,686
SPEAKER_0:  a leader.

02:09:12,642 --> 02:09:13,758
SPEAKER_0:  She's M.D.O.S.

02:09:15,170 --> 02:09:17,406
SPEAKER_0:  She's, I mean, it's very shaping.

02:09:18,146 --> 02:09:19,998
SPEAKER_0:  Particularly the way that it was.

02:09:20,290 --> 02:09:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  set up in Iran.

02:09:22,754 --> 02:09:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  was.

02:09:23,522 --> 02:09:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  a religion that has always this element of expectation to it.

02:09:28,898 --> 02:09:30,334
SPEAKER_0:  for the coming of this.

02:09:31,138 --> 02:09:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  Messianic leader.

02:09:33,058 --> 02:09:33,662
SPEAKER_0:  Of course.

02:09:34,114 --> 02:09:35,902
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, between practices.

02:09:36,194 --> 02:09:37,854
SPEAKER_0:  All societies look for

02:09:38,818 --> 02:09:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  messianic leaders and just look around us.

02:09:42,626 --> 02:09:44,542
SPEAKER_1:  but some societies more than others.

02:09:45,186 --> 02:09:47,742
SPEAKER_1:  There's certain culture, it might have to do with the room.

02:09:48,258 --> 02:09:50,910
SPEAKER_1:  of the romantic poetry that we mentioned earlier.

02:09:51,522 --> 02:09:52,318
SPEAKER_1:  I mean...

02:09:52,706 --> 02:09:53,598
SPEAKER_1:  Surely.

02:09:53,858 --> 02:09:58,174
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, not to draw too many parallels, but the Soviet Union, there is romanticism too.

02:09:58,370 --> 02:09:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  UGH!

02:09:59,106 --> 02:10:01,214
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I don't know. Yeah.

02:10:02,018 --> 02:10:03,390
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe idealism?

02:10:04,450 --> 02:10:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  a sense of a savior.

02:10:06,498 --> 02:10:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

02:10:07,234 --> 02:10:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  Who would?

02:10:08,866 --> 02:10:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  who would bring you...

02:10:10,594 --> 02:10:12,414
SPEAKER_0:  out of the misery that you're in.

02:10:13,442 --> 02:10:14,142
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:10:14,530 --> 02:10:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  and air.

02:10:15,330 --> 02:10:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  always looking for it.

02:10:17,890 --> 02:10:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  full.

02:10:18,658 --> 02:10:19,742
SPEAKER_0:  A third party.

02:10:20,578 --> 02:10:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  to solve your...

02:10:21,954 --> 02:10:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  issues. That's why probably...

02:10:25,250 --> 02:10:25,726
SPEAKER_0:  this.

02:10:26,018 --> 02:10:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  Movement has a

02:10:28,130 --> 02:10:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  particularly significant because it probably doesn't look for it.

02:10:32,482 --> 02:10:36,094
SPEAKER_0:  Although I was talking to my brother who is a historian also.

02:10:36,674 --> 02:10:40,638
SPEAKER_0:  And he was saying perhaps the Messiah of this movement is that Mahsa Amin.

02:10:41,250 --> 02:10:43,134
SPEAKER_0:  the 22 year old girl.

02:10:43,970 --> 02:10:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  That was...

02:10:45,186 --> 02:10:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  killed.

02:10:45,922 --> 02:10:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  7th of March it Messiah.

02:10:48,322 --> 02:10:48,766
SPEAKER_0:  Who is-

02:10:49,186 --> 02:10:51,358
SPEAKER_0:  now leading a movement which...

02:10:51,746 --> 02:10:53,822
SPEAKER_0:  no longer has that.

02:10:54,402 --> 02:10:55,550
SPEAKER_0:  charismatic.

02:10:55,906 --> 02:10:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  Leadership with it.

02:10:57,954 --> 02:10:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, I would say that...

02:11:00,642 --> 02:11:04,702
SPEAKER_0:  Iran has been the birthplace, if I might say that.

02:11:05,378 --> 02:11:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  of

02:11:06,178 --> 02:11:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  Messiaenich.

02:11:07,650 --> 02:11:08,830
SPEAKER_0:  aspirations.

02:11:09,474 --> 02:11:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  Going back to the ancient.

02:11:11,298 --> 02:11:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  Zoroastrianism, which is the...

02:11:13,346 --> 02:11:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  Really, the whole system that you...

02:11:16,258 --> 02:11:20,414
SPEAKER_0:  see in major religions, at least so-called Western religions.

02:11:21,058 --> 02:11:22,942
SPEAKER_0:  It's Abrahamic religions.

02:11:24,002 --> 02:11:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  is.

02:11:25,410 --> 02:11:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  HALIL

02:11:26,434 --> 02:11:27,902
SPEAKER_0:  or perhaps influence.

02:11:28,258 --> 02:11:29,406
SPEAKER_0:  by Zoroastrianism.

02:11:29,794 --> 02:11:31,358
SPEAKER_0:  in which there is an idea of.

02:11:31,778 --> 02:11:32,094
SPEAKER_0:  out.

02:11:32,578 --> 02:11:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  this world and the other world is hereafter.

02:11:35,426 --> 02:11:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  There is an idea of a judgment at the end of the time.

02:11:40,418 --> 02:11:43,614
SPEAKER_0:  and there is a concept that there is a moment of justice.

02:11:44,194 --> 02:11:45,150
SPEAKER_0:  that it's going to.

02:11:45,762 --> 02:11:46,110
SPEAKER_0:  Come.

02:11:46,498 --> 02:11:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  with the rise of air.

02:11:47,938 --> 02:11:48,734
SPEAKER_0:  religious.

02:11:48,962 --> 02:11:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  or a

02:11:49,890 --> 02:11:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  charismatic figure.

02:11:51,394 --> 02:11:53,630
SPEAKER_0:  So it's a very old phenomenon in Iran.

02:11:53,954 --> 02:11:54,622
SPEAKER_0:  Very old.

02:11:54,978 --> 02:11:57,342
SPEAKER_0:  and it's time and the game repeated itself.

02:11:57,730 --> 02:12:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  in the course of its history, but never as powerfully.

02:12:01,762 --> 02:12:03,742
SPEAKER_0:  as it happened in 1979.

02:12:04,098 --> 02:12:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  and never in the form of

02:12:07,522 --> 02:12:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  authority from within the religious establishment.

02:12:10,594 --> 02:12:11,934
SPEAKER_0:  It was always the...

02:12:12,482 --> 02:12:14,398
SPEAKER_0:  descent movements that were

02:12:15,490 --> 02:12:15,998
SPEAKER_0:  kind of.

02:12:16,514 --> 02:12:19,582
SPEAKER_0:  Antinomian, they were against the authority of the...

02:12:20,034 --> 02:12:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  a religious establishment.

02:12:22,050 --> 02:12:23,966
SPEAKER_0:  That changed in the 20th century.

02:12:24,866 --> 02:12:25,182
SPEAKER_0:  but...

02:12:25,506 --> 02:12:28,894
SPEAKER_1:  The revolution in 1979, that change is still with us today.

02:12:29,410 --> 02:12:32,190
SPEAKER_1:  What, can we just linger on the...

02:12:33,058 --> 02:12:34,846
SPEAKER_1:  Are there some practical?

02:12:37,826 --> 02:12:40,062
SPEAKER_1:  games of power that occurred.

02:12:40,930 --> 02:12:45,374
SPEAKER_1:  You know, in the way that Stalin took power and held power in the early days.

02:12:45,890 --> 02:12:47,454
SPEAKER_1:  Is there something like this?

02:12:47,842 --> 02:12:56,926
SPEAKER_1:  in terms of the establishment of the revolutionary guard and all those kinds of stuff. Yes. So it's the, the man, say on a figure that has some support from the people, but brother,

02:12:57,538 --> 02:13:00,094
SPEAKER_1:  Does he have to crush his enemies in competition?

02:13:01,378 --> 02:13:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  It certainly did.

02:13:03,970 --> 02:13:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  Probably nuts.

02:13:05,570 --> 02:13:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  Certainly not as brutal.

02:13:07,714 --> 02:13:08,894
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of the...

02:13:09,218 --> 02:13:09,918
SPEAKER_0:  victims.

02:13:10,498 --> 02:13:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  as you would see in Soviet Union under Stalin.

02:13:15,298 --> 02:13:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  Bloodshit.

02:13:16,546 --> 02:13:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  or deep.

02:13:18,594 --> 02:13:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  destruction of the population was far greater.

02:13:22,562 --> 02:13:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  than what you would find in

02:13:25,090 --> 02:13:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  Iran of the Islamic Republic.

02:13:27,074 --> 02:13:27,838
SPEAKER_0:  uncomfortable.

02:13:29,154 --> 02:13:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  Perhaps I would find a greater parallel with Mao Zedong.

02:13:33,698 --> 02:13:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:13:35,554 --> 02:13:39,678
SPEAKER_0:  particularly because China has a very strong messianic tradition.

02:13:40,674 --> 02:13:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  since the ancient times. So they have something.

02:13:43,202 --> 02:13:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  and mow it.

02:13:44,290 --> 02:13:46,334
SPEAKER_0:  appeared as the kind of a messianic figure.

02:13:48,066 --> 02:13:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  There I can see...

02:13:49,954 --> 02:13:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  there is a parallel but also

02:13:52,802 --> 02:13:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  You can see with any other authoritarian regime with a

02:13:56,290 --> 02:13:57,438
SPEAKER_0:  Messiaenig 4.

02:13:57,698 --> 02:14:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  at the head of it, that it destroys all the other forces.

02:14:01,794 --> 02:14:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  So during the course of the first 10 years of the...

02:14:04,930 --> 02:14:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  Islamic revolution.

02:14:06,882 --> 02:14:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  It destroyed the liberal

02:14:08,642 --> 02:14:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  Nationalists.

02:14:10,274 --> 02:14:11,070
SPEAKER_0:  secular

02:14:11,810 --> 02:14:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  It's destroyed.

02:14:14,018 --> 02:14:14,494
SPEAKER_0:  D.

02:14:14,946 --> 02:14:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  Guerrilla movements.

02:14:16,738 --> 02:14:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  Some of them Islamic, some of them Marxist.

02:14:19,906 --> 02:14:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  who turned into political parties or tendencies.

02:14:23,778 --> 02:14:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  in the course of the post-revolution in 1979.

02:14:26,882 --> 02:14:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  They were completely destroyed.

02:14:29,314 --> 02:14:30,974
SPEAKER_0:  and in a very brutal fashion.

02:14:31,970 --> 02:14:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  and their

02:14:34,658 --> 02:14:38,686
SPEAKER_0:  opposition even within the religious establishment, because it wasn't it.

02:14:39,010 --> 02:14:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  uniform. There were many different

02:14:41,890 --> 02:14:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  tendencies.

02:14:42,978 --> 02:14:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  those that will.

02:14:44,578 --> 02:14:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  close to the authority of Ayatollah Khomeini.

02:14:47,554 --> 02:14:51,134
SPEAKER_0:  or now Imam Khomeini, meaning almost a sacred.

02:14:51,970 --> 02:14:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  religious figure.

02:14:53,474 --> 02:14:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  Above.

02:14:55,010 --> 02:14:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  the level of a religious authority.

02:14:58,274 --> 02:14:59,422
SPEAKER_0:  He's a saint.

02:14:59,906 --> 02:15:00,734
SPEAKER_0:  Kind of a figure.

02:15:01,282 --> 02:15:04,318
SPEAKER_0:  Shizm has this idea of Imams. They were.

02:15:04,866 --> 02:15:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  11 of them, the 12th.

02:15:06,722 --> 02:15:07,838
SPEAKER_0:  is hidden.

02:15:08,098 --> 02:15:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  and would come back at the end of the time. In NAV, thank heads,姜生, Coin British, Ethan Forstner and Carsten Reuven.

02:15:12,770 --> 02:15:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  So the title that was always used for them only.

02:15:17,090 --> 02:15:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  in Sheezer.

02:15:18,498 --> 02:15:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  never used for any other person.

02:15:21,602 --> 02:15:22,942
SPEAKER_0:  He is the first person.

02:15:23,490 --> 02:15:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  in the revolution of 1979.

02:15:25,826 --> 02:15:27,326
SPEAKER_0:

02:15:27,778 --> 02:15:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  The beauty of a mom.

02:15:30,786 --> 02:15:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  but the term deputy gradually disappeared and he became Imam Khomeini

02:15:35,330 --> 02:15:38,311
SPEAKER_0:  That's his official title. I love human

02:15:38,311 --> 02:15:39,326
SPEAKER_1:  being so much.

02:15:40,002 --> 02:15:41,118
SPEAKER_1:  It's so beautiful.

02:15:41,666 --> 02:15:44,862
SPEAKER_1:  These titles that we give each other, it's...

02:15:45,250 --> 02:15:50,110
SPEAKER_0:  But it's marvelous to observe. You love it because you haven't been under that system. No, I...

02:15:50,594 --> 02:15:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  I love it in the way.

02:15:52,354 --> 02:15:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  I love it in the very dark.

02:15:54,050 --> 02:15:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  It's dark vacation!

02:15:55,586 --> 02:15:56,510
SPEAKER_1:  kind of way.

02:15:57,186 --> 02:15:59,966
SPEAKER_1:  it caricatures itself. It's almost...

02:16:00,610 --> 02:16:02,686
SPEAKER_1:  funny in its absurdity.

02:16:03,138 --> 02:16:07,070
SPEAKER_1:  if not for the evil that it has led to in human history.

02:16:07,650 --> 02:16:09,982
SPEAKER_0:  But also the fact that it's a mani-

02:16:10,434 --> 02:16:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  It's in fact fulfillment.

02:16:13,122 --> 02:16:14,686
SPEAKER_0:  in a kind of completely

02:16:15,618 --> 02:16:16,446
SPEAKER_0:  Um, eh.

02:16:16,706 --> 02:16:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  Unintended fashion.

02:16:18,370 --> 02:16:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  is a fulfillment of that.

02:16:20,418 --> 02:16:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  idea of a Messiah that they've been fighting for.

02:16:23,074 --> 02:16:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  This Imam, which is in Ahida for a thousand years.

02:16:26,818 --> 02:16:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  is here and not here.

02:16:29,282 --> 02:16:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:16:29,826 --> 02:16:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  Therefore,

02:16:30,786 --> 02:16:31,582
SPEAKER_0:  Khomeini

02:16:32,098 --> 02:16:34,814
SPEAKER_0:  would have in effect fulfilled those.

02:16:35,106 --> 02:16:36,030
SPEAKER_0:  anticipations.

02:16:36,354 --> 02:16:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  But beyond that, I just give you one example I know that you may have other concerns.

02:16:42,178 --> 02:16:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  When I say elimination.

02:16:44,706 --> 02:16:46,494
SPEAKER_0:  At the end of the Iran-Iraq war

02:16:47,394 --> 02:16:48,062
SPEAKER_0:  Bye-D!

02:16:48,290 --> 02:16:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  direct order of Ayatollah Khomeini, a fatwa that he wrote.

02:16:53,026 --> 02:16:53,790
SPEAKER_0:  group of

02:16:54,050 --> 02:16:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  prisoners.

02:16:57,122 --> 02:16:58,622
SPEAKER_0:  could belong to...

02:16:59,138 --> 02:17:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  variety of

02:17:00,514 --> 02:17:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  I...

02:17:02,050 --> 02:17:03,966
SPEAKER_0:  political parties, the left.

02:17:04,226 --> 02:17:05,406
SPEAKER_0:  He just left.

02:17:06,594 --> 02:17:07,614
SPEAKER_0:  majority of them.

02:17:08,386 --> 02:17:11,838
SPEAKER_0:  the Marxists left and the religious left.

02:17:12,642 --> 02:17:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  in a matter of a few weeks.

02:17:15,138 --> 02:17:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  or perhaps a few months I'm not actually quite sure about it.

02:17:18,466 --> 02:17:19,038
SPEAKER_0:  time spy.

02:17:19,938 --> 02:17:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  in a series of these were people who have already been tried.

02:17:24,834 --> 02:17:26,110
SPEAKER_0:  and they were given...

02:17:26,466 --> 02:17:27,710
SPEAKER_0:  sentences.

02:17:28,482 --> 02:17:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  They were brought back.

02:17:30,658 --> 02:17:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  before the...

02:17:31,970 --> 02:17:32,350
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:17:33,090 --> 02:17:35,646
SPEAKER_0:  summary trials of three judges.

02:17:36,034 --> 02:17:38,014
SPEAKER_0:  or more, three, four of them.

02:17:38,594 --> 02:17:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  One of them is

02:17:40,130 --> 02:17:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  now.

02:17:41,410 --> 02:17:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  day.

02:17:43,234 --> 02:17:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  a new president of the Islamic Republic, Raisi.

02:17:47,874 --> 02:17:51,806
SPEAKER_0:  And if we give them a quick summary sentences.

02:17:52,034 --> 02:17:52,766
SPEAKER_0:  Which meant...

02:17:53,378 --> 02:17:54,270
SPEAKER_0:  execution.

02:17:55,010 --> 02:17:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  So something between probably 6 to 8 thousand.

02:17:59,298 --> 02:18:02,334
SPEAKER_0:  were executed in a matter of a month or two months.

02:18:02,914 --> 02:18:03,742
SPEAKER_0:  Something like that.

02:18:04,802 --> 02:18:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  Mostly in Tehran, but also in provinces.

02:18:08,322 --> 02:18:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  And that remained an extreme.

02:18:10,818 --> 02:18:12,510
SPEAKER_0:  extraordinary trauma.

02:18:13,570 --> 02:18:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  for the families.

02:18:14,978 --> 02:18:17,758
SPEAKER_0:  for those who had these kids, they're all young.

02:18:18,242 --> 02:18:18,750
SPEAKER_0:  All young.

02:18:20,482 --> 02:18:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  So this remains very much.

02:18:23,394 --> 02:18:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  Ehh

02:18:24,770 --> 02:18:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  kind of a...

02:18:26,242 --> 02:18:28,414
SPEAKER_0:  original scene of the Islamic Republic.

02:18:28,962 --> 02:18:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  that cannot get rid of.

02:18:31,042 --> 02:18:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  and it's in people's memories.

02:18:33,250 --> 02:18:33,662
SPEAKER_0:  day.

02:18:33,890 --> 02:18:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  didn't allow them even the families.

02:18:37,346 --> 02:18:38,718
SPEAKER_0:  to go and mourn.

02:18:39,458 --> 02:18:40,222
SPEAKER_0:  They're dead.

02:18:40,802 --> 02:18:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  in an official symmetry which they created for them.

02:18:44,770 --> 02:18:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  Now the latest thing is...

02:18:46,690 --> 02:18:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  That's it.

02:18:47,362 --> 02:18:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  They put a huge...

02:18:49,090 --> 02:18:52,446
SPEAKER_0:  concrete wall around it so nobody would be able to get into it.

02:18:53,218 --> 02:18:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:18:53,858 --> 02:18:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  This is all part of this extra

02:18:56,258 --> 02:18:58,078
SPEAKER_0:  extraordinary level of

02:18:59,138 --> 02:19:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  level of.

02:19:00,834 --> 02:19:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  atrocity.

02:19:02,722 --> 02:19:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  brutality that you see that the regime claimed.

02:19:06,690 --> 02:19:10,526
SPEAKER_0:  that it comes with the morality of religion and Islam.

02:19:11,106 --> 02:19:13,694
SPEAKER_0:  to bring back the justice and

02:19:14,306 --> 02:19:16,670
SPEAKER_0:  and be more...

02:19:18,850 --> 02:19:19,678
SPEAKER_0:  in SS.

02:19:20,194 --> 02:19:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  Kind to people.

02:19:21,602 --> 02:19:22,334
SPEAKER_0:  Ended up.

02:19:23,106 --> 02:19:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  with what it is in the memory of.

02:19:25,314 --> 02:19:27,189
SPEAKER_0:  many of the people in Iran.

02:19:27,189 --> 02:19:27,939
SPEAKER_1:  balanced ah Раз, Hazy place

02:19:27,939 --> 02:19:29,726
SPEAKER_0:  That's very much so.

02:19:29,954 --> 02:19:31,422
SPEAKER_0:  destroying minorities.

02:19:31,714 --> 02:19:32,894
SPEAKER_0:  Bahá'ís one of them.

02:19:34,146 --> 02:19:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  Hundreds of Baha'is were without any reason, without any involvement.

02:19:38,850 --> 02:19:39,934
SPEAKER_0:  We picked up and...

02:19:40,610 --> 02:19:41,982
SPEAKER_0:  I

02:19:42,242 --> 02:19:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  executed, the properties were taken over.

02:19:45,314 --> 02:19:47,582
SPEAKER_0:  Their rights were taken away from them.

02:19:47,970 --> 02:19:49,150
SPEAKER_0:  even up to this day.

02:19:49,666 --> 02:19:50,494
SPEAKER_0:  This is the largest.

02:19:50,818 --> 02:19:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  by the very religious minority in Iran.

02:19:53,442 --> 02:19:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:19:54,498 --> 02:19:57,214
SPEAKER_0:  you would see that in many areas.

02:19:57,890 --> 02:19:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  This is him.

02:19:59,234 --> 02:20:00,542
SPEAKER_0:  acts very much as an

02:20:01,026 --> 02:20:04,254
SPEAKER_0:  beyond authoritarianism, it's a kind of really fascistic regime.

02:20:06,306 --> 02:20:06,974
SPEAKER_0:  So...

02:20:07,426 --> 02:20:08,094
SPEAKER_1:  How many?

02:20:08,578 --> 02:20:10,366
SPEAKER_1:  held power for 10 years.

02:20:11,906 --> 02:20:14,462
SPEAKER_1:  and then took power the next supreme.

02:20:15,618 --> 02:20:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  Alright.

02:20:16,418 --> 02:20:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  LEADER!

02:20:17,218 --> 02:20:20,382
SPEAKER_1:  who is still the leader today for over 30 years.

02:20:20,674 --> 02:20:21,278
SPEAKER_1:  Who is he?

02:20:22,146 --> 02:20:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  Well, he was one of the... This is Ali Khamenei.

02:20:26,594 --> 02:20:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  I told her.

02:20:27,554 --> 02:20:35,294
SPEAKER_0:  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Imam one day perhaps? No, well, they hesitated to use the term Imam for him.

02:20:36,386 --> 02:20:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  But in any other respect, he was given all of that adulation. Yes.

02:20:41,090 --> 02:20:44,222
SPEAKER_0:  that they did to Khomeini. He is the guardian jurist.

02:20:44,514 --> 02:20:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  That's what's important.

02:20:46,434 --> 02:20:50,078
SPEAKER_0:  because the guardian jurist in the constitution of the Islamic Republic.

02:20:50,434 --> 02:20:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  is an authority that is above the state.

02:20:54,146 --> 02:20:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  He is not.

02:20:55,938 --> 02:20:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  Elected.

02:20:57,250 --> 02:20:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  quote unquote because

02:20:59,554 --> 02:21:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  This is a...

02:21:00,674 --> 02:21:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  divine authority.

02:21:02,562 --> 02:21:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  although he has been designated by the group of deterrent.

02:21:06,530 --> 02:21:07,774
SPEAKER_0:  more less like himself.

02:21:08,674 --> 02:21:09,822
SPEAKER_0:  And Russian Fire Italian FunSome

02:21:10,818 --> 02:21:14,206
SPEAKER_0:  He has the full power over all.

02:21:15,042 --> 02:21:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, ehh...

02:21:17,026 --> 02:21:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  institutions of the state.

02:21:19,682 --> 02:21:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  The army.

02:21:21,506 --> 02:21:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  The, uh...

02:21:22,882 --> 02:21:23,678
SPEAKER_0:  Media.

02:21:24,450 --> 02:21:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  the economy.

02:21:27,170 --> 02:21:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  every aspect of the acts that you show.

02:21:30,978 --> 02:21:34,353
SPEAKER_0:  He acts like this authoritarian authority. Did that gradually develop?

02:21:34,353 --> 02:21:36,603
SPEAKER_1:  or was that very early on? well

02:21:36,603 --> 02:21:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  That's part of the constitution of the Islamic Republic.

02:21:40,770 --> 02:21:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  The first constitution

02:21:43,490 --> 02:21:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:21:44,450 --> 02:21:46,654
SPEAKER_0:  the first draft of the Constitution.

02:21:47,106 --> 02:21:48,702
SPEAKER_0:  did not have the authority.

02:21:49,154 --> 02:21:52,638
SPEAKER_0:  of the guardian juries. But then it was added.

02:21:53,026 --> 02:21:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

02:21:54,018 --> 02:21:55,893
SPEAKER_0:  How many anti-supporters?

02:21:55,893 --> 02:21:59,166
SPEAKER_1:  Is there actual in the constitution any limits to his power?

02:22:01,346 --> 02:22:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

02:22:02,370 --> 02:22:05,726
SPEAKER_0:  There is a council of the experts, so to say.

02:22:06,690 --> 02:22:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  That's.

02:22:07,618 --> 02:22:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  would

02:22:09,762 --> 02:22:12,862
SPEAKER_0:  would remove him from power, I think theoretically.

02:22:13,698 --> 02:22:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  What's that?

02:22:14,626 --> 02:22:15,646
SPEAKER_0:  There is so much.

02:22:16,290 --> 02:22:22,665
SPEAKER_0:  restrictions to that that I don't think it would have ever happened in reality in this case at least but in terms

02:22:22,665 --> 02:22:27,294
SPEAKER_1:  of executive to make decisions and all that kind of stuff. Does he need to check with anybody?

02:22:29,922 --> 02:22:31,166
SPEAKER_0:  He does check.

02:22:32,642 --> 02:22:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  He's done.

02:22:33,570 --> 02:22:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  advisors, but he's, he doesn't have any.

02:22:37,058 --> 02:22:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  He doesn't have any constitutional...

02:22:40,802 --> 02:22:42,526
SPEAKER_0:  obligation to check.

02:22:42,978 --> 02:22:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  on the decisions that he's making.

02:22:45,506 --> 02:22:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:22:46,402 --> 02:22:48,638
SPEAKER_1:  That's the supreme leader, but there's been.

02:22:48,866 --> 02:22:49,726
SPEAKER_0:  Presidents.

02:22:50,338 --> 02:22:50,750
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

02:22:51,170 --> 02:22:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  And what's the role of the president? The president in a sense is the executive power.

02:22:57,698 --> 02:22:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  under

02:22:59,170 --> 02:23:00,830
SPEAKER_0:  the Islamic Republic.

02:23:01,250 --> 02:23:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  Death.

02:23:01,954 --> 02:23:03,454
SPEAKER_0:  Three heads of-

02:23:04,322 --> 02:23:05,118
SPEAKER_0:  powers.

02:23:06,498 --> 02:23:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  This is it.

02:23:07,426 --> 02:23:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  President.

02:23:08,674 --> 02:23:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  that presumably has the executive power.

02:23:12,290 --> 02:23:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  There is the head of the...

02:23:14,338 --> 02:23:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  Judiciary.

02:23:16,162 --> 02:23:17,246
SPEAKER_0:  and there is the...

02:23:17,922 --> 02:23:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  ahead of the...

02:23:20,002 --> 02:23:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  the Speaker of the Parliament.

02:23:22,370 --> 02:23:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  Much less.

02:23:23,746 --> 02:23:24,990
SPEAKER_0:  Islamic by the way.

02:23:25,570 --> 02:23:26,686
SPEAKER_0:  which is the...

02:23:27,074 --> 02:23:27,454
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:23:27,842 --> 02:23:30,782
SPEAKER_0:  the legislative. Comp pole tries De»

02:23:31,650 --> 02:23:33,150
SPEAKER_0:

02:23:33,442 --> 02:23:34,398
SPEAKER_0:  and executive.

02:23:35,042 --> 02:23:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  that he see who is not the president.

02:23:38,370 --> 02:23:38,942
SPEAKER_0:  is the-

02:23:39,458 --> 02:23:41,182
SPEAKER_0:  head of the executive.

02:23:41,538 --> 02:23:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  Above them.

02:23:43,458 --> 02:23:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  is the supreme leader.

02:23:45,218 --> 02:23:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  or the guardian jurist.

02:23:47,362 --> 02:23:47,902
SPEAKER_0:  Cue.

02:23:48,098 --> 02:23:49,918
SPEAKER_1:  Give me some insight because I...

02:23:50,274 --> 02:23:51,166
SPEAKER_1:  especially

02:23:52,898 --> 02:23:57,982
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not exactly sure why, but, uh, the president, uh, Madinah John.

02:23:59,106 --> 02:23:59,614
SPEAKER_1:  this.

02:24:00,034 --> 02:24:00,830
SPEAKER_1:  somebody I'm

02:24:01,922 --> 02:24:04,894
SPEAKER_1:  Is an American really familiar with why is that exactly?

02:24:05,634 --> 02:24:06,558
SPEAKER_1:  Why was?

02:24:07,170 --> 02:24:10,462
SPEAKER_1:  Why was the president the public-facing person?

02:24:11,010 --> 02:24:13,246
SPEAKER_1:  to the world versus the supreme leader.

02:24:13,698 --> 02:24:19,207
SPEAKER_1:  Is that just an accident of a particular human's involved or is this by design?

02:24:19,207 --> 02:24:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  because the Supreme Leader tries to keep himself out of.

02:24:23,746 --> 02:24:27,166
SPEAKER_0:  issues of everyday politics supposedly.

02:24:27,810 --> 02:24:30,782
SPEAKER_0:  but therefore he is not coming to the United Nations.

02:24:31,394 --> 02:24:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  to give a speech during the.

02:24:33,762 --> 02:24:34,814
SPEAKER_0:  session.

02:24:35,394 --> 02:24:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  But

02:24:37,026 --> 02:24:40,190
SPEAKER_0:  Mr. Ahmadinej Jatoo at the time was the president.

02:24:41,090 --> 02:24:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:24:42,018 --> 02:24:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  Wood.

02:24:43,234 --> 02:24:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  come and make outrageous statements.

02:24:46,242 --> 02:24:49,617
SPEAKER_0:  That's why you probably know something about it. So all of them make-

02:24:49,617 --> 02:24:51,117
SPEAKER_1:  public statements but yet a pr-

02:24:51,117 --> 02:24:52,894
SPEAKER_0:  Clivity for outrageous things

02:24:54,882 --> 02:24:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  She does!

02:24:56,322 --> 02:24:59,710
SPEAKER_0:  all kinds of things, it makes all kinds of statements.

02:25:00,130 --> 02:25:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  But he is.

02:25:01,730 --> 02:25:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  somewhat above the everyday politics in theory.

02:25:06,274 --> 02:25:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  But of course he's...

02:25:07,586 --> 02:25:08,830
SPEAKER_0:  Fully gold strings.

02:25:09,186 --> 02:25:11,646
SPEAKER_0:  without doubt in every respect.

02:25:12,354 --> 02:25:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:25:12,962 --> 02:25:14,014
SPEAKER_0:  It seems that

02:25:14,370 --> 02:25:17,342
SPEAKER_0:  You were asked, I thought you were going to ask me this question.

02:25:17,858 --> 02:25:19,294
SPEAKER_0:  almost without.

02:25:19,746 --> 02:25:21,438
SPEAKER_0:  an exception.

02:25:22,594 --> 02:25:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  since the inception of the Islamic Republic in 1979.

02:25:27,682 --> 02:25:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  up to the last of the presidents of the Islamic Republic, Rouhani.

02:25:32,418 --> 02:25:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  before the

02:25:33,410 --> 02:25:34,110
SPEAKER_0:  guy that is.

02:25:34,530 --> 02:25:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  last year or a year and a half ago.

02:25:37,378 --> 02:25:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  was in a four-year lecture.

02:25:40,386 --> 02:25:40,734
SPEAKER_0:  Alright.

02:25:41,058 --> 02:25:43,966
SPEAKER_0:  got into the position of the president.

02:25:45,058 --> 02:25:46,110
SPEAKER_0:  All of them.

02:25:46,338 --> 02:25:47,358
SPEAKER_0:  in the long list.

02:25:48,162 --> 02:25:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  All of them eventually fell.

02:25:50,818 --> 02:25:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  uh art

02:25:52,066 --> 02:25:52,894
SPEAKER_0:  with the regime.

02:25:53,602 --> 02:25:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  Mm-hmm.

02:25:54,690 --> 02:25:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  So there is no president.

02:25:57,314 --> 02:26:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  except perhaps to some extent Rohani, but we'll wait and see what's going to happen to him.

02:26:02,658 --> 02:26:05,726
SPEAKER_0:  But prior to him, all of them, including Ahmadinejad.

02:26:06,530 --> 02:26:10,631
SPEAKER_0:  fell out with the regime, with the current regime in Iran. Who's ruhan?

02:26:10,631 --> 02:26:12,131
SPEAKER_1:  He was officially president for 8-

02:26:12,131 --> 02:26:14,686
SPEAKER_0:  years? Yeah, prior to the EC.

02:26:15,138 --> 02:26:16,263
SPEAKER_0:  Ibrahim A.C. cars that

02:26:16,263 --> 02:26:19,263
SPEAKER_1:  221 the your what you're saying is a phony election

02:26:19,263 --> 02:26:26,046
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, it's a phony election. What's the interesting thing about what happened? Because the process of actually...

02:26:27,074 --> 02:26:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  Candidacy.

02:26:28,962 --> 02:26:32,382
SPEAKER_0:  for presidency is completely controlled.

02:26:33,250 --> 02:26:33,950
SPEAKER_0:  YA

02:26:34,274 --> 02:26:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  a cancer that is under the control of the...

02:26:37,794 --> 02:26:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  a supreme leader.

02:26:40,290 --> 02:26:40,606
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:26:41,090 --> 02:26:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  They have to.

02:26:43,170 --> 02:26:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  Approve!

02:26:44,450 --> 02:26:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  Who is going to be the candidate?

02:26:47,010 --> 02:26:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  So not everybody can enter and say, I would like to be a candidate.

02:26:52,130 --> 02:26:54,755
SPEAKER_1:  So did Rohani fall out of favor?

02:26:54,755 --> 02:26:56,606
SPEAKER_0:  Well, he is.

02:26:57,154 --> 02:26:58,718
SPEAKER_0:  Kind of out of favor now.

02:26:59,394 --> 02:27:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  because he was more moderate than this most recent regime.

02:27:04,066 --> 02:27:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  But the point is that...

02:27:07,234 --> 02:27:08,766
SPEAKER_0:  If you look, this is something.

02:27:09,250 --> 02:27:10,238
SPEAKER_0:  Almost.

02:27:10,818 --> 02:27:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  institution...

02:27:12,642 --> 02:27:14,270
SPEAKER_0:  constitutional to the regime.

02:27:14,882 --> 02:27:18,750
SPEAKER_0:  This is a regime that rejects all of the executive powers.

02:27:19,714 --> 02:27:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  Because it's...

02:27:21,090 --> 02:27:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  because the division between the

02:27:23,522 --> 02:27:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  Supreme Authority.

02:27:25,122 --> 02:27:27,070
SPEAKER_0:  as the place of his supreme authority.

02:27:27,522 --> 02:27:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  versus the presidency.

02:27:29,794 --> 02:27:30,206
SPEAKER_0:  has

02:27:31,106 --> 02:27:32,094
SPEAKER_0:  problematic.

02:27:33,122 --> 02:27:33,438
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

02:27:33,890 --> 02:27:35,806
SPEAKER_0:  It is as if there would be a...

02:27:36,706 --> 02:27:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  a supreme

02:27:38,274 --> 02:27:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  leader in the United States above all these three.

02:27:41,922 --> 02:27:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  sources of power.

02:27:43,810 --> 02:27:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  That's the kind of an e-

02:27:45,410 --> 02:27:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  view that we can see in today's era.

02:27:48,130 --> 02:27:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  And of course he is at the...

02:27:49,634 --> 02:27:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  Focus.

02:27:50,786 --> 02:27:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  of all the criticism that he receives.

02:27:53,506 --> 02:27:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  from the

02:27:54,402 --> 02:27:55,998
SPEAKER_0:  demonstrators in today's...

02:27:56,450 --> 02:27:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  Eat on.

02:27:59,298 --> 02:27:59,934
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:28:00,354 --> 02:28:01,822
SPEAKER_1:  On top of all this.

02:28:02,946 --> 02:28:06,654
SPEAKER_1:  Recently and throughout the last several years US and Iran

02:28:07,522 --> 02:28:10,430
SPEAKER_1:  are in the midst of nuclear deal negotiations.

02:28:10,882 --> 02:28:12,094
SPEAKER_1:  This is another part.

02:28:12,546 --> 02:28:13,854
SPEAKER_1:  of the story of Iran.

02:28:14,946 --> 02:28:17,598
SPEAKER_1:  is the development of nuclear weapons.

02:28:18,978 --> 02:28:19,966
SPEAKER_1:  nuclear program.

02:28:20,514 --> 02:28:26,139
SPEAKER_1:  They're looking to restore the nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA.

02:28:26,139 --> 02:28:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  day.

02:28:27,138 --> 02:28:28,222
SPEAKER_1:  What is the history?

02:28:29,250 --> 02:28:30,078
SPEAKER_1:  the present.

02:28:30,338 --> 02:28:34,494
SPEAKER_1:  and the future of these negotiations over nuclear weapons.

02:28:34,722 --> 02:28:36,286
SPEAKER_1:  What is interesting to you in this?

02:28:36,546 --> 02:28:40,670
SPEAKER_1:  full context from the 16th century of the messianic.

02:28:41,186 --> 02:28:41,950
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhh...

02:28:42,210 --> 02:28:43,358
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, journey.

02:28:43,714 --> 02:28:44,158
SPEAKER_1:  out

02:28:44,482 --> 02:28:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  What's interesting to you here?

02:28:46,050 --> 02:28:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  You can argue.

02:28:47,906 --> 02:28:48,350
SPEAKER_0:  That's it.

02:28:48,866 --> 02:28:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  for a long time even under the shaw.

02:28:51,426 --> 02:28:52,670
SPEAKER_0:  but much more.

02:28:53,346 --> 02:28:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  expressively.

02:28:54,882 --> 02:28:55,230
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:28:56,034 --> 02:28:59,710
SPEAKER_0:  decisively under the Islamic Republic. That was it.

02:29:00,514 --> 02:29:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  determination to...

02:29:03,010 --> 02:29:04,030
SPEAKER_0:  Have a...

02:29:04,290 --> 02:29:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  Nuclear.

02:29:06,370 --> 02:29:06,974
SPEAKER_0:  Power.

02:29:07,266 --> 02:29:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  nuclear weapon.

02:29:08,770 --> 02:29:09,822
SPEAKER_0:  In a sense.

02:29:10,210 --> 02:29:12,158
SPEAKER_0:  I think the bottom line of...

02:29:12,674 --> 02:29:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  all the negotiations, everything else is that Iran...

02:29:16,578 --> 02:29:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  of the Islamic Republic had the tendency of...

02:29:20,386 --> 02:29:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  having its own nuclear weapon.

02:29:23,266 --> 02:29:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  Reason for that.

02:29:24,866 --> 02:29:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  is that Iran was subject of.

02:29:28,226 --> 02:29:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  nearly nine years, eight and a half years of...

02:29:31,906 --> 02:29:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  Iran-Iraq war.

02:29:34,274 --> 02:29:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  then

02:29:35,586 --> 02:29:35,934
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:29:36,514 --> 02:29:37,854
SPEAKER_0:  not only run face.

02:29:38,242 --> 02:29:41,406
SPEAKER_0:  an aggressor Iraq that actually attacked

02:29:41,986 --> 02:29:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  Iran at a very critical time at the very beginning of the Iranian Revolution.

02:29:47,650 --> 02:29:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  But the fact that...

02:29:49,378 --> 02:29:51,070
SPEAKER_0:  Iran felt kind of it.

02:29:51,522 --> 02:29:53,214
SPEAKER_0:  a helpless.

02:29:53,698 --> 02:29:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  in the course of this war.

02:29:56,546 --> 02:30:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  and has to make great sacrifices actually, which supported the Islamic regime.

02:30:01,762 --> 02:30:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  consolidated.

02:30:03,714 --> 02:30:04,638
SPEAKER_0:  Islamic regime.

02:30:04,930 --> 02:30:06,014
SPEAKER_0:  because of this war.

02:30:06,818 --> 02:30:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:30:07,714 --> 02:30:09,118
SPEAKER_0:  most of the time.

02:30:10,178 --> 02:30:10,558
SPEAKER_0:  Uh

02:30:10,786 --> 02:30:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  There.

02:30:11,682 --> 02:30:14,270
SPEAKER_0:  support of the United States was behind.

02:30:15,170 --> 02:30:16,510
SPEAKER_0:  Iraq v. Iran

02:30:17,986 --> 02:30:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  and Iran felt that it's been.

02:30:21,250 --> 02:30:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  isolated and has to...

02:30:23,874 --> 02:30:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  protect itself.

02:30:25,186 --> 02:30:27,390
SPEAKER_0:  So there is some argument.

02:30:28,354 --> 02:30:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  for.

02:30:29,698 --> 02:30:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  having nuclear capabilities.

02:30:33,090 --> 02:30:34,526
SPEAKER_0:  But in reality...

02:30:35,234 --> 02:30:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  This has resulted in a completely mindless

02:30:39,458 --> 02:30:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  Crazy.

02:30:41,730 --> 02:30:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  Wasteful.

02:30:43,778 --> 02:30:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  attempt on the side of the Iranian

02:30:45,954 --> 02:30:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  Regime.

02:30:47,490 --> 02:30:50,110
SPEAKER_0:  to try to develop a nuclear power.

02:30:51,074 --> 02:30:55,102
SPEAKER_0:  and therefore the rest of the world, particularly in this region,

02:30:55,746 --> 02:30:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  They're very worried.

02:30:57,378 --> 02:30:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  that if Iran would get access.

02:31:00,610 --> 02:31:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  a nuclear weapon.

02:31:02,434 --> 02:31:05,150
SPEAKER_0:  then the entire region of the Persian Gulf.

02:31:06,146 --> 02:31:06,814
SPEAKER_0:  might

02:31:07,106 --> 02:31:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  particularly Saudi Arabia, possibly Turkey.

02:31:10,978 --> 02:31:14,014
SPEAKER_0:  possibly Egypt, all of them may require.

02:31:14,914 --> 02:31:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  may demand to have also nuclear weapons, given the fact that Pakistan...

02:31:20,770 --> 02:31:22,590
SPEAKER_0:  and India has already have it.

02:31:23,874 --> 02:31:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  So there was a determined attempt, as you might know.

02:31:27,874 --> 02:31:33,214
SPEAKER_0:  on the side of the Western communities or now gradually world communities to try to...

02:31:33,986 --> 02:31:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  as much as possible to control Iran.

02:31:37,634 --> 02:31:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  from getting access.

02:31:39,650 --> 02:31:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  to a nuclear capability.

02:31:42,114 --> 02:31:45,246
SPEAKER_0:  or actually limit Iran's nuclear capabilities.

02:31:45,730 --> 02:31:47,934
SPEAKER_0:  to what was defined usually.

02:31:48,194 --> 02:31:49,918
SPEAKER_0:  in a euphemism as a

02:31:50,178 --> 02:31:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  peaceful fashion.

02:31:51,810 --> 02:31:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

02:31:53,122 --> 02:31:54,878
SPEAKER_0:  That being said...

02:31:55,394 --> 02:31:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  There was also Israel.

02:31:59,042 --> 02:32:02,206
SPEAKER_0:  which viewed the Islamic Republic as a...

02:32:02,530 --> 02:32:03,486
SPEAKER_0:  Arch Enemy.

02:32:05,282 --> 02:32:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  And some of it might be due to the Israelis own.

02:32:10,018 --> 02:32:11,326
SPEAKER_0:  exaggeration

02:32:11,906 --> 02:32:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  off

02:32:12,706 --> 02:32:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  Iran's

02:32:14,018 --> 02:32:14,494
SPEAKER_0:  threat.

02:32:15,106 --> 02:32:17,886
SPEAKER_0:  And some of it is because Iran has developed.

02:32:18,242 --> 02:32:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  a fairly strong military.

02:32:20,450 --> 02:32:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  as we see today.

02:32:23,362 --> 02:32:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  and as such

02:32:25,250 --> 02:32:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  this attempt to try to

02:32:27,138 --> 02:32:28,286
SPEAKER_0:  prevent E-DARN.

02:32:29,154 --> 02:32:31,294
SPEAKER_0:  from ever getting access to them.

02:32:31,650 --> 02:32:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  nuclear.

02:32:32,898 --> 02:32:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:32:33,986 --> 02:32:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  with it.

02:32:35,010 --> 02:32:38,174
SPEAKER_0:  which resulted as you might know in this massive.

02:32:39,106 --> 02:32:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  sanctions that were imposed upon Iran.

02:32:43,618 --> 02:32:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  ever since the beginning of the revolution in 1979.

02:32:47,842 --> 02:32:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  and of course more intensively.

02:32:50,690 --> 02:32:53,630
SPEAKER_0:  since 2015, 2016.

02:32:53,890 --> 02:32:56,254
SPEAKER_0:  Even prior to that, probably a little bit earlier.

02:32:57,666 --> 02:33:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  This agreement, the nuclear agreement was supposed to...

02:33:03,266 --> 02:33:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  control or monitor.

02:33:05,890 --> 02:33:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  Iranian Nuclear Industry

02:33:08,802 --> 02:33:09,822
SPEAKER_0:  or nuclear.

02:33:10,210 --> 02:33:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:33:11,298 --> 02:33:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  set up.

02:33:13,442 --> 02:33:16,190
SPEAKER_0:  in exchange for removing the sanctions.

02:33:17,634 --> 02:33:22,206
SPEAKER_0:  But this never worked, as a matter of fact, in a very successful...

02:33:22,594 --> 02:33:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  Satisfactory.

02:33:24,962 --> 02:33:28,542
SPEAKER_0:  a way for the Iranians or for the Americans.

02:33:28,866 --> 02:33:30,014
SPEAKER_0:  particularly under

02:33:30,434 --> 02:33:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  Trump administration, which I think foolishly.

02:33:34,498 --> 02:33:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  decided to scrap.

02:33:37,154 --> 02:33:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  day.

02:33:37,858 --> 02:33:41,182
SPEAKER_0:  agreement that was reached under President Obama.

02:33:41,922 --> 02:33:43,038
SPEAKER_0:  Like many other.

02:33:43,490 --> 02:33:46,206
SPEAKER_0:  policies that was implemented under

02:33:46,466 --> 02:33:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  Trump administration.

02:33:48,034 --> 02:33:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  This created a major problem.

02:33:50,146 --> 02:33:51,454
SPEAKER_0:  that is hard to...

02:33:52,130 --> 02:33:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  under Biden how to try to

02:33:55,490 --> 02:33:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  come up with an

02:33:57,570 --> 02:33:58,110
SPEAKER_0:  New.

02:33:58,882 --> 02:33:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  Nuclear

02:34:00,034 --> 02:34:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  agreement with Iran.

02:34:02,370 --> 02:34:03,582
SPEAKER_0:  In this process,

02:34:03,874 --> 02:34:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  Since 2016.

02:34:06,882 --> 02:34:09,694
SPEAKER_0:  where the United States withdrew from the agreement.

02:34:10,434 --> 02:34:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  Iran felt

02:34:11,746 --> 02:34:13,310
SPEAKER_0:  comfortable to try to.

02:34:13,954 --> 02:34:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  Goob.

02:34:14,946 --> 02:34:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  and do whatever they want.

02:34:16,834 --> 02:34:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  without any kind of monitor.

02:34:19,170 --> 02:34:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  being monitored by the international community.

02:34:23,330 --> 02:34:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  And that's the situation now.

02:34:25,474 --> 02:34:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  We don't know.

02:34:26,658 --> 02:34:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  whether Iran is really

02:34:28,706 --> 02:34:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  Sincere.

02:34:30,114 --> 02:34:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  under the present regime.

02:34:33,346 --> 02:34:34,814
SPEAKER_0:  to negotiate a deal.

02:34:35,394 --> 02:34:37,662
SPEAKER_0:  We don't know that it was the United States.

02:34:39,458 --> 02:34:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  willing to do so.

02:34:41,346 --> 02:34:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:34:42,434 --> 02:34:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  It seems that now...

02:34:45,026 --> 02:34:48,766
SPEAKER_0:  What is happening in terms of the protests in the Iranian streets?

02:34:49,282 --> 02:34:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  makes it even harder.

02:34:52,578 --> 02:34:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  in

02:34:53,314 --> 02:34:54,686
SPEAKER_0:  a public eye.

02:34:55,298 --> 02:34:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  to try to negotiate a deal.

02:34:58,210 --> 02:34:59,006
SPEAKER_0:  with Eron.

02:34:59,682 --> 02:35:02,526
SPEAKER_0:  because that means in the minds of many.

02:35:03,554 --> 02:35:05,598
SPEAKER_0:  and with some justification.

02:35:06,690 --> 02:35:07,454
SPEAKER_0:  That's...

02:35:07,938 --> 02:35:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:35:09,474 --> 02:35:09,886
SPEAKER_0:  If

02:35:10,626 --> 02:35:15,838
SPEAKER_0:  the nuclear agreement would result in the removal of many of these sanctions.

02:35:16,418 --> 02:35:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  millions.

02:35:17,890 --> 02:35:18,814
SPEAKER_0:  billions.

02:35:19,938 --> 02:35:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  as the result of the removal of the sanctions and

02:35:24,098 --> 02:35:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  Iran's ability to sell it.

02:35:26,338 --> 02:35:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  It's oil in the international market without any restrictions.

02:35:31,650 --> 02:35:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  means

02:35:33,154 --> 02:35:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  that the Iranian government is going to become even more.

02:35:37,346 --> 02:35:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  powerful

02:35:38,658 --> 02:35:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  more financially secure in order to suppress its own people.

02:35:43,522 --> 02:35:45,278
SPEAKER_0:  So that's the agreement that goes.

02:35:45,858 --> 02:35:46,654
SPEAKER_0:  against

02:35:47,746 --> 02:35:48,958
SPEAKER_0:  coming to terms.

02:35:49,378 --> 02:35:51,294
SPEAKER_0:  With, uh, with, uh,

02:35:51,586 --> 02:35:53,726
SPEAKER_0:  Iran. But the problem is

02:35:54,178 --> 02:35:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  that there is no...

02:35:56,322 --> 02:35:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  clear alternative, even I'm not particularly personally favorable.

02:36:00,706 --> 02:36:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  for this agreement to be.

02:36:02,754 --> 02:36:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  to be ratified.

02:36:05,378 --> 02:36:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  But the alternative is very difficult. There is no way to try to see.

02:36:10,146 --> 02:36:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  What can be done?

02:36:14,210 --> 02:36:15,335
SPEAKER_0:  geopolitics.

02:36:15,335 --> 02:36:17,310
SPEAKER_1:  where every alternative is terrible.

02:36:19,138 --> 02:36:20,350
SPEAKER_1:  Let me ask you...

02:36:20,994 --> 02:36:21,534
SPEAKER_1:  about

02:36:22,242 --> 02:36:26,622
SPEAKER_1:  one of the most complex geopolitical situations in history.

02:36:27,554 --> 02:36:28,062
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:36:28,578 --> 02:36:32,414
SPEAKER_1:  One aspect of it is the Cold War between Iran and Israel.

02:36:33,026 --> 02:36:36,414
SPEAKER_1:  The bigger picture of it is sometimes referred to as a.

02:36:37,090 --> 02:36:39,102
SPEAKER_1:  Israel-Palestine conflict.

02:36:41,186 --> 02:36:42,270
SPEAKER_1:  What are all...

02:36:43,010 --> 02:36:43,870
SPEAKER_1:  parties.

02:36:44,482 --> 02:36:45,918
SPEAKER_1:  nations involved.

02:36:46,402 --> 02:36:49,726
SPEAKER_1:  What are the interests that are involved? What's the rhetoric?

02:36:50,754 --> 02:36:51,326
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:36:51,970 --> 02:36:52,606
SPEAKER_1:  Can you?

02:36:53,090 --> 02:36:56,574
SPEAKER_1:  understand, make the case for each side of this conflict.

02:36:58,786 --> 02:37:01,790
SPEAKER_0:  You're opening a new can of worms that it takes.

02:37:02,306 --> 02:37:03,678
SPEAKER_0:  another three hours.

02:37:05,346 --> 02:37:07,390
SPEAKER_0:  conversation. Just three hours.

02:37:07,650 --> 02:37:08,222
SPEAKER_0:  at least.

02:37:08,642 --> 02:37:11,774
SPEAKER_0:  But what I can tell you is this.

02:37:14,210 --> 02:37:16,798
SPEAKER_0:  Iran prior to 1979.

02:37:17,954 --> 02:37:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  viewed itself under the shower.

02:37:20,418 --> 02:37:22,078
SPEAKER_0:  as a kind of a...

02:37:24,034 --> 02:37:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  if not supported by Israel.

02:37:26,626 --> 02:37:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  was in very good terms with Israel.

02:37:29,410 --> 02:37:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  They had an embassy in Iran, an unofficial embassy in Iran.

02:37:33,570 --> 02:37:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  that's it in projects that...

02:37:35,618 --> 02:37:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  helping with the agriculture and so forth in Iraq.

02:37:39,458 --> 02:37:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  But since 1979...

02:37:42,786 --> 02:37:44,478
SPEAKER_0:  that completely.

02:37:45,186 --> 02:37:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  reverse.

02:37:46,946 --> 02:37:50,558
SPEAKER_0:  Part of it is that the issue of the Palestinian...

02:37:50,882 --> 02:37:51,518
SPEAKER_0:  fly.

02:37:52,354 --> 02:37:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  remained very much at the heart.

02:37:55,298 --> 02:37:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  of.

02:37:56,834 --> 02:37:59,934
SPEAKER_0:  the revolutionary Iranians would see that.

02:38:01,314 --> 02:38:03,454
SPEAKER_0:  part of the United States.

02:38:03,938 --> 02:38:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  is to support.

02:38:05,218 --> 02:38:07,358
SPEAKER_0:  part of the United States guilt.

02:38:08,162 --> 02:38:08,830
SPEAKER_0:  SIN

02:38:09,634 --> 02:38:11,326
SPEAKER_0:  is to support Israel.

02:38:12,514 --> 02:38:13,630
SPEAKER_0:  vis-à-vis.

02:38:14,498 --> 02:38:16,126
SPEAKER_0:  It's very suppressive.

02:38:17,026 --> 02:38:18,110
SPEAKER_0:  very...

02:38:19,426 --> 02:38:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  Oppressive.

02:38:21,474 --> 02:38:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  treatment of the

02:38:23,874 --> 02:38:24,926
SPEAKER_0:  Palestinians?

02:38:25,410 --> 02:38:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  completely illegal taking over.

02:38:28,514 --> 02:38:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  of the territories which is not theirs since 1967.

02:38:33,858 --> 02:38:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  and therefore it is upon the Iranian regime, the Iranian Islamic Republic,

02:38:40,034 --> 02:38:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  to support the cause of the Palestinians.

02:38:43,490 --> 02:38:45,278
SPEAKER_0:  This came about at the time

02:38:46,530 --> 02:38:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  When?

02:38:48,162 --> 02:38:53,246
SPEAKER_0:  the rest of the support for the Palestinians, including Arab nationalism.

02:38:54,082 --> 02:38:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  Basically.

02:38:56,546 --> 02:38:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  reach this stage of bankruptcy.

02:39:00,034 --> 02:39:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, much of the regimes of the Arab world either are now coming to terms with Israel.

02:39:05,538 --> 02:39:10,654
SPEAKER_0:  or in one way or another because of their own contingencies, because of their own.

02:39:11,618 --> 02:39:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  concerns and interests.

02:39:14,082 --> 02:39:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  R

02:39:14,946 --> 02:39:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  really nearly accepting.

02:39:17,666 --> 02:39:19,230
SPEAKER_0:  Israel in the

02:39:19,874 --> 02:39:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  in the region.

02:39:21,314 --> 02:39:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  Now, that old husk of...

02:39:24,418 --> 02:39:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  rhetorically supporting the Palestinians.

02:39:27,554 --> 02:39:29,438
SPEAKER_0:  for the Islamic Republic.

02:39:30,594 --> 02:39:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  that sees itself as the champion of the Palestinians now.

02:39:34,594 --> 02:39:36,254
SPEAKER_0:  We thought as a matter of fact.

02:39:36,802 --> 02:39:40,638
SPEAKER_0:  having either the support of the Iranian people behind him. If you ask.

02:39:41,346 --> 02:39:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  Tomorrow there would be...

02:39:43,042 --> 02:39:43,966
SPEAKER_0:  A pole or a-

02:39:44,322 --> 02:39:45,214
SPEAKER_0:  referendum.

02:39:45,794 --> 02:39:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  I would doubt that.

02:39:48,706 --> 02:39:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  80% of the Iranian people would approve of the policies.

02:39:52,834 --> 02:39:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  of the Islamic Republic vis-a-vis the issue of Palestine.

02:39:56,962 --> 02:39:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  uh

02:39:58,050 --> 02:40:01,086
SPEAKER_0:  nor the Palestinians themselves because they're...

02:40:02,082 --> 02:40:04,798
SPEAKER_0:  Islamic Republic is only supporting those...

02:40:05,154 --> 02:40:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  factions within the

02:40:06,818 --> 02:40:07,742
SPEAKER_0:  Palestinian.

02:40:08,258 --> 02:40:12,254
SPEAKER_0: ... movement which are Islamic, quote unquote.

02:40:12,546 --> 02:40:15,838
SPEAKER_0:  And even within that, there is problems with Hamas.

02:40:16,258 --> 02:40:16,670
SPEAKER_0:

02:40:17,730 --> 02:40:19,070
SPEAKER_0:  But nevertheless...

02:40:19,522 --> 02:40:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  It's.

02:40:20,258 --> 02:40:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  for the Islamic Republic some kind of a

02:40:23,106 --> 02:40:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  propaganda tool.

02:40:25,026 --> 02:40:27,454
SPEAKER_0:  to be able to use it for its own sake.

02:40:28,290 --> 02:40:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  and claim that.

02:40:30,082 --> 02:40:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  Oh.

02:40:30,850 --> 02:40:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  We are the champions of the Palestinian people.

02:40:34,242 --> 02:40:35,390
SPEAKER_0:  What did they have?

02:40:35,938 --> 02:40:37,054
SPEAKER_0:  a solution.

02:40:37,890 --> 02:40:40,894
SPEAKER_0:  If you look at the rhetoric, if you listen to the rhetoric.

02:40:41,378 --> 02:40:43,070
SPEAKER_0:  It's the destruction of the...

02:40:43,938 --> 02:40:45,182
SPEAKER_0:  State of Israel.

02:40:46,082 --> 02:40:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  And that's...

02:40:48,322 --> 02:40:48,734
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:40:49,186 --> 02:40:53,950
SPEAKER_0:  it seems to me creates a certain anxiety in the minds of the...

02:40:54,466 --> 02:40:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  Israelis, Israeli population, and Israeli government.

02:40:58,882 --> 02:41:00,574
SPEAKER_0:  particularly those...

02:41:00,962 --> 02:41:02,206
SPEAKER_0:  who are now in power.

02:41:02,626 --> 02:41:04,574
SPEAKER_0:  not an Yahoo the liquid

02:41:05,218 --> 02:41:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  and more kind of a right wing.

02:41:08,130 --> 02:41:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  politics of

02:41:09,890 --> 02:41:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  Polity of...

02:41:11,746 --> 02:41:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  Today's Israel.

02:41:14,498 --> 02:41:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  That being said...

02:41:16,258 --> 02:41:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  I think also the Israelis...

02:41:19,170 --> 02:41:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  try to

02:41:20,546 --> 02:41:22,526
SPEAKER_0:  get an extra mileage out of.

02:41:23,778 --> 02:41:24,158
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

02:41:24,450 --> 02:41:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  threat of Iran.

02:41:26,114 --> 02:41:26,974
SPEAKER_0:  quote unquote.

02:41:27,810 --> 02:41:28,894
SPEAKER_0:  in order to...

02:41:29,826 --> 02:41:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  present themselves.

02:41:32,354 --> 02:41:33,982
SPEAKER_0:  a rightful to.

02:41:34,402 --> 02:41:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  for terms of security and whatever.

02:41:37,186 --> 02:41:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  else.

02:41:38,594 --> 02:41:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  the way that they're treating the Palestinians, which I think is extremely unjust.

02:41:43,394 --> 02:41:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's extremely unwise.

02:41:46,210 --> 02:41:47,422
SPEAKER_0:  for Israel.

02:41:48,226 --> 02:41:52,414
SPEAKER_0:  carry on with these policies as they did since 1967 at least.

02:41:53,122 --> 02:41:55,070
SPEAKER_0:  and not to try to come to terms with it.

02:41:55,298 --> 02:41:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  Of course, there's a huge amount of

02:41:57,634 --> 02:41:59,198
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not denying that at all.

02:41:59,618 --> 02:42:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  the huge amount of

02:42:02,178 --> 02:42:02,526
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

02:42:03,298 --> 02:42:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  failures.

02:42:05,474 --> 02:42:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  Mistakes.

02:42:07,842 --> 02:42:11,486
SPEAKER_0:  and stupidity on the side of the Palestinian leadership.

02:42:12,322 --> 02:42:13,854
SPEAKER_0:  in various stages.

02:42:14,498 --> 02:42:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  not to try to.

02:42:16,290 --> 02:42:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  Make a deal.

02:42:17,954 --> 02:42:20,190
SPEAKER_0:  or try to come to terms in some...

02:42:20,834 --> 02:42:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  uh... fashion

02:42:22,050 --> 02:42:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  But it's a very complex picture, and it's rather unfair to the Palestinians.

02:42:27,938 --> 02:42:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  to accuse them.

02:42:29,474 --> 02:42:30,366
SPEAKER_0:  For nuts.

02:42:30,786 --> 02:42:33,662
SPEAKER_0:  coming to terms with Israel under a very...

02:42:33,986 --> 02:42:35,710
SPEAKER_0:  on even circumstances.

02:42:36,098 --> 02:42:39,102
SPEAKER_0:  when they are not in a position to try.

02:42:39,490 --> 02:42:40,862
SPEAKER_0:  to make a fair deal.

02:42:41,154 --> 02:42:43,070
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of the territories.

02:42:43,970 --> 02:42:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  or in terms of their security in future vis-a-vis Israel.

02:42:48,322 --> 02:42:50,366
SPEAKER_1:  So I think there is, as you probably know.

02:42:51,010 --> 02:42:52,574
SPEAKER_1:  quite a lot of people that would.

02:42:53,314 --> 02:42:55,646
SPEAKER_1:  have a different perspective than you just stated.

02:42:56,066 --> 02:42:57,086
SPEAKER_1:  in terms of

02:42:59,330 --> 02:43:01,918
SPEAKER_1:  you know, taking the perspective of Israel.

02:43:02,402 --> 02:43:04,318
SPEAKER_1:  in characterizing the situation.

02:43:04,930 --> 02:43:07,358
SPEAKER_1:  Can you steal Man Neck at their side?

02:43:07,714 --> 02:43:09,374
SPEAKER_1:  Can you still man Israel's side?

02:43:09,730 --> 02:43:10,430
SPEAKER_1:  that they're

02:43:10,978 --> 02:43:12,702
SPEAKER_1:  trying to be a sovereign nation.

02:43:13,122 --> 02:43:14,654
SPEAKER_1:  trying to protect themselves.

02:43:14,946 --> 02:43:16,030
SPEAKER_1:  against threats.

02:43:16,642 --> 02:43:17,662
SPEAKER_1:  Ultimately...

02:43:18,818 --> 02:43:23,614
SPEAKER_1:  wanting to create a place of safety, a place where people can pursue.

02:43:24,418 --> 02:43:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  all the things that you want to pursue in life, including.

02:43:28,706 --> 02:43:29,918
SPEAKER_1:  for most happiness.

02:43:30,882 --> 02:43:32,094
SPEAKER_0:  I tend to agree with you.

02:43:32,962 --> 02:43:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  and they have all the respect for the fact that...

02:43:36,706 --> 02:43:41,150
SPEAKER_0:  Israel would like to create security and happiness for its own people.

02:43:42,210 --> 02:43:45,022
SPEAKER_0:  But there are two arguments. One is a moral argument.

02:43:45,922 --> 02:43:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  to my mind as a historian.

02:43:48,994 --> 02:43:49,342
SPEAKER_0:  E-

02:43:49,602 --> 02:43:50,046
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:43:50,850 --> 02:43:51,518
SPEAKER_0:  Jews.

02:43:52,066 --> 02:43:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  across around the world.

02:43:53,986 --> 02:43:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  for all through their history suffered.

02:43:57,090 --> 02:43:59,038
SPEAKER_0:  And this is a history of suffering.

02:43:59,426 --> 02:44:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  There is a memory of some.

02:44:01,922 --> 02:44:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  and I find it enormously difficult to believe.

02:44:05,506 --> 02:44:06,494
SPEAKER_0:  Detonation.

02:44:07,074 --> 02:44:09,406
SPEAKER_0:  That's the product of so much.

02:44:10,690 --> 02:44:11,070
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:44:11,874 --> 02:44:13,918
SPEAKER_0:  sacrifice, suffering.

02:44:14,466 --> 02:44:15,454
SPEAKER_0:  Loss of life.

02:44:17,154 --> 02:44:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  and variety of...

02:44:19,778 --> 02:44:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  Holocaust.

02:44:21,122 --> 02:44:21,950
SPEAKER_0:  Above all.

02:44:23,138 --> 02:44:23,550
SPEAKER_0:  would be.

02:44:24,002 --> 02:44:25,694
SPEAKER_0:  find itself in a position.

02:44:26,018 --> 02:44:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  not to give the proper justice.

02:44:28,930 --> 02:44:31,102
SPEAKER_0:  to a people who could be their neighbors.

02:44:32,706 --> 02:44:33,182
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:44:33,570 --> 02:44:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  That's.

02:44:34,338 --> 02:44:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  is a moral argument which I cannot believe.

02:44:37,762 --> 02:44:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  under any circumstances can be accepted.

02:44:40,706 --> 02:44:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  Second.

02:44:42,114 --> 02:44:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  in real terms.

02:44:44,450 --> 02:44:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  What do you want to, you want to commit a genocide?

02:44:47,874 --> 02:44:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  you have a population there.

02:44:50,466 --> 02:44:52,382
SPEAKER_0:  that you have to come to terms with it.

02:44:52,834 --> 02:44:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  and you cannot just postpone as they did.

02:44:56,834 --> 02:45:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  667 they are postponing and hoping that it goes away.

02:45:01,122 --> 02:45:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  Somehow.

02:45:03,650 --> 02:45:04,734
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think it's going to.

02:45:07,170 --> 02:45:07,550
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:45:07,906 --> 02:45:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  and it's going to...

02:45:09,058 --> 02:45:10,558
SPEAKER_0:  get worse rather than better.

02:45:11,522 --> 02:45:12,647
SPEAKER_0:  It's a long nuance.

02:45:12,647 --> 02:45:14,974
SPEAKER_1:  discussion and I look forward to having it.

02:45:15,714 --> 02:45:17,598
SPEAKER_1:  So just leave it.

02:45:18,338 --> 02:45:19,038
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:45:19,426 --> 02:45:20,638
SPEAKER_1:  there for the moment.

02:45:22,370 --> 02:45:23,774
SPEAKER_1:  But it is.

02:45:26,338 --> 02:45:28,382
SPEAKER_1:  stressful place in the world.

02:45:29,058 --> 02:45:30,462
SPEAKER_1:  where the rhetoric

02:45:30,978 --> 02:45:31,678
SPEAKER_1:  is

02:45:31,938 --> 02:45:32,862
SPEAKER_1:  existential.

02:45:33,154 --> 02:45:33,982
SPEAKER_1:  We're on.

02:45:34,690 --> 02:45:37,342
SPEAKER_1:  It makes claims that it wants to wipe.

02:45:38,370 --> 02:45:41,662
SPEAKER_1:  a country off the face of the earth is just the level.

02:45:42,338 --> 02:45:42,686
SPEAKER_1:  of

02:45:43,010 --> 02:45:46,622
SPEAKER_1:  of intensity of rhetoric is unlike anywhere else in the world.

02:45:46,818 --> 02:45:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  and extremely dangerous.

02:45:48,738 --> 02:45:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  and in-

02:45:49,282 --> 02:45:50,878
SPEAKER_1:  in both directions so one

02:45:51,618 --> 02:45:52,670
SPEAKER_1:  The real danger?

02:45:53,282 --> 02:45:56,030
SPEAKER_1:  of the rhetoric actually being acted upon.

02:45:56,994 --> 02:45:58,622
SPEAKER_1:  and then the extreme.

02:45:59,618 --> 02:46:00,862
SPEAKER_1:  political parties.

02:46:01,186 --> 02:46:02,590
SPEAKER_1:  using the rhetoric.

02:46:03,170 --> 02:46:04,414
SPEAKER_1:  to justify.

02:46:05,186 --> 02:46:07,102
SPEAKER_1:  even a greater escalation.

02:46:07,970 --> 02:46:08,350
SPEAKER_1:  So.

02:46:08,674 --> 02:46:10,974
SPEAKER_1:  If Iran is...

02:46:11,234 --> 02:46:12,766
SPEAKER_1:  saying that this is

02:46:13,154 --> 02:46:13,662
SPEAKER_0:  It's...

02:46:13,794 --> 02:46:15,902
SPEAKER_1:  saying that they want to wipe up.

02:46:16,258 --> 02:46:17,726
SPEAKER_1:  Israel off the face of the earth.

02:46:18,402 --> 02:46:20,638
SPEAKER_1:  that justifies any response.

02:46:21,570 --> 02:46:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  On the other side. On the other side.

02:46:23,970 --> 02:46:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  Of course, I tend to agree with you fully.

02:46:26,498 --> 02:46:29,854
SPEAKER_0:  And unfortunately, this is a very critical situation that...

02:46:30,658 --> 02:46:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  this region is facing, Iran in particular.

02:46:35,170 --> 02:46:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  I would say that...

02:46:38,562 --> 02:46:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  I hope that in the minds of the...

02:46:41,986 --> 02:46:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  people of Israel.

02:46:44,482 --> 02:46:45,150
SPEAKER_0:  There is.

02:46:45,666 --> 02:46:46,334
SPEAKER_0:  Eyyy

02:46:46,786 --> 02:46:47,390
SPEAKER_0:  Enough.

02:46:47,842 --> 02:46:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  or

02:46:48,802 --> 02:46:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  common sense to realize that.

02:46:51,970 --> 02:46:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  Probably escalation on the Israeli side is not in the favor of anybody.

02:46:57,698 --> 02:46:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  try to

02:46:58,722 --> 02:47:00,958
SPEAKER_0:  Let the Iranians to go on with their...

02:47:01,794 --> 02:47:03,358
SPEAKER_0:  Empty rhetoric.

02:47:04,194 --> 02:47:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  as they do.

02:47:05,282 --> 02:47:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  so far.

02:47:06,242 --> 02:47:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  But...

02:47:07,522 --> 02:47:08,798
SPEAKER_0:  at the same time.

02:47:09,442 --> 02:47:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  I cannot deny the fact that

02:47:12,226 --> 02:47:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

02:47:12,898 --> 02:47:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  There is a danger on the side of this regime.

02:47:16,450 --> 02:47:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  and what it says.

02:47:18,114 --> 02:47:20,510
SPEAKER_0:  It cannot be denied. Nobody can justify that.

02:47:21,794 --> 02:47:22,142
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

02:47:22,626 --> 02:47:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  particularly because the Iranian population is not behind this.

02:47:26,850 --> 02:47:27,358
SPEAKER_0:  Regime.

02:47:28,034 --> 02:47:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  certainly in the case of the Palestinians.

02:47:30,626 --> 02:47:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  or for that matter it's not Palestine.

02:47:33,218 --> 02:47:35,134
SPEAKER_0:  is the...

02:47:35,714 --> 02:47:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  the Islamic Republic's involvement in Lebanon with Hezbollah.

02:47:40,546 --> 02:47:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  It's the Islamic Republic's.

02:47:42,434 --> 02:47:45,246
SPEAKER_0:  involvement in Syria with Bashar Assad.

02:47:45,890 --> 02:47:49,758
SPEAKER_0:  its involvement in other parts of the world, perhaps even Yemen.

02:47:50,882 --> 02:47:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  that all of them creates extra-territorial

02:47:56,098 --> 02:47:59,710
SPEAKER_0:  responsibilities or interventions.

02:48:00,290 --> 02:48:02,206
SPEAKER_0:  unnecessary interventions.

02:48:03,394 --> 02:48:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  that ultimately is not in favor of.

02:48:06,786 --> 02:48:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  best.

02:48:07,650 --> 02:48:09,310
SPEAKER_0:  interests of the Iranian people.

02:48:09,890 --> 02:48:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  or Iran as a country.

02:48:11,650 --> 02:48:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  Iran has never been involved in this kind of politics before.

02:48:16,002 --> 02:48:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  of the Islamic Republic.

02:48:17,762 --> 02:48:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  So in this sense.

02:48:19,010 --> 02:48:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  The Iranian regime, it seems to me...

02:48:22,210 --> 02:48:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  by going to the extreme try to create for itself.

02:48:27,010 --> 02:48:27,838
SPEAKER_0:  Aye-Yap.

02:48:28,610 --> 02:48:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  Peace.

02:48:31,266 --> 02:48:34,238
SPEAKER_0:  that it did not have or did not deserve to have.

02:48:35,106 --> 02:48:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  within the politics of the region. It says okay.

02:48:38,306 --> 02:48:39,710
SPEAKER_0:  in other words

02:48:40,066 --> 02:48:42,078
SPEAKER_0:  that has become part of the

02:48:42,850 --> 02:48:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  Cool.

02:48:43,650 --> 02:48:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  kind of an instrument.

02:48:45,922 --> 02:48:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  for if you like to call it some kind of an expansionism.

02:48:49,858 --> 02:48:51,294
SPEAKER_0:  of the regime.

02:48:51,938 --> 02:48:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  in parts of the world where it can see.

02:48:56,002 --> 02:48:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  there is a possibility.

02:48:58,338 --> 02:48:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  Poor.

02:48:59,298 --> 02:49:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  its presence for its expansion.

02:49:02,178 --> 02:49:03,102
SPEAKER_0:  Of course

02:49:03,394 --> 02:49:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  Historically speaking.

02:49:05,570 --> 02:49:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  Iran

02:49:06,786 --> 02:49:08,798
SPEAKER_0:  ever since the 15th century.

02:49:09,026 --> 02:49:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  I think that's the earliest example I can see.

02:49:12,482 --> 02:49:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  in early modern times.

02:49:14,754 --> 02:49:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  has always a tendency of moving in the direction.

02:49:18,722 --> 02:49:20,638
SPEAKER_0:  of not only what is today the

02:49:21,314 --> 02:49:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  in the state of Iraq.

02:49:23,234 --> 02:49:26,046
SPEAKER_0:  but further into the eastern coast of Mediterranean.

02:49:26,690 --> 02:49:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  So that's a long term ambition.

02:49:29,506 --> 02:49:31,102
SPEAKER_0:  that has been in the

02:49:31,490 --> 02:49:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  cards as far as.

02:49:33,570 --> 02:49:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  Iran as a strategic unit is concerned.

02:49:37,058 --> 02:49:37,374
SPEAKER_0:  What?

02:49:37,666 --> 02:49:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  by no means justified and by no means

02:49:40,962 --> 02:49:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  could be a reasonable...

02:49:43,138 --> 02:49:45,630
SPEAKER_0:  could be a sane policy of a...

02:49:46,050 --> 02:49:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  nation.

02:49:47,042 --> 02:49:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  State as today's Iran.

02:49:50,082 --> 02:49:50,462
SPEAKER_0:  What?

02:49:51,074 --> 02:49:52,670
SPEAKER_0:  The second point is that.

02:49:53,122 --> 02:49:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  Also,

02:49:56,482 --> 02:49:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  Regimes are always victims of their own rhetoric.

02:50:00,674 --> 02:50:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  So it's.

02:50:02,498 --> 02:50:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  Once you...

02:50:04,002 --> 02:50:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  Keep.

02:50:04,738 --> 02:50:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  repeating something.

02:50:07,106 --> 02:50:09,406
SPEAKER_0:  then you become more and more committed to it.

02:50:10,306 --> 02:50:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  and it cannot remain anymore in the level of a rhetoric. You have to do something about it.

02:50:16,002 --> 02:50:16,446
SPEAKER_0:  See you soon.

02:50:16,674 --> 02:50:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  some compelling pressure.

02:50:19,490 --> 02:50:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  to try to...

02:50:21,058 --> 02:50:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  to materialize.

02:50:24,226 --> 02:50:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  what you've been saying in your rhetoric.

02:50:27,010 --> 02:50:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  and that is even extremely more dangerous.

02:50:30,466 --> 02:50:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  as far as Iran is concerned.

02:50:33,730 --> 02:50:38,782
SPEAKER_0:  and it brings it to some unholy alliances.

02:50:39,810 --> 02:50:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  that today we are witnessing.

02:50:42,242 --> 02:50:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  Iran is getting involved. Even more dangerous.

02:50:45,762 --> 02:50:47,102
SPEAKER_0:  than this rhetoric.

02:50:47,778 --> 02:50:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of the

02:50:50,754 --> 02:50:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  vis-à-vis Israel.

02:50:52,258 --> 02:50:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  is its involvement with Russia and to some extent with China.

02:50:57,570 --> 02:50:59,445
SPEAKER_0:  which we can talk about.

02:50:59,445 --> 02:51:00,190
SPEAKER_1:  about the meeting.

02:51:00,802 --> 02:51:03,550
SPEAKER_1:  between Harmony and Vladimir Putin in July.

02:51:04,834 --> 02:51:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  What's that alliance? What's that partnership?

02:51:08,546 --> 02:51:12,670
SPEAKER_1:  Is it surface level geopolitics? Is there a deep growing connection?

02:51:14,690 --> 02:51:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  I cannot see the difference between geopolitics and these deep connections. I see this one and the same.

02:51:20,994 --> 02:51:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  Why?

02:51:22,434 --> 02:51:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  because I think the experience...

02:51:25,730 --> 02:51:27,486
SPEAKER_0:  of 40 years of...

02:51:29,218 --> 02:51:30,622
SPEAKER_0:  distancing from the West.

02:51:31,714 --> 02:51:33,182
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of the Islamic Republic.

02:51:34,850 --> 02:51:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  and the fact that there is a...

02:51:38,722 --> 02:51:40,798
SPEAKER_0:  self-life to imperial.

02:51:41,410 --> 02:51:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  presence.

02:51:42,722 --> 02:51:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  for any empire anywhere in the world.

02:51:46,466 --> 02:51:46,878
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:51:47,458 --> 02:51:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  after the terrible experience of...

02:51:50,722 --> 02:51:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  of the United States in

02:51:53,666 --> 02:51:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  uh, E-Doc.

02:51:55,714 --> 02:51:56,382
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:51:56,674 --> 02:51:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  in.

02:51:57,474 --> 02:51:58,398
SPEAKER_0:  AFRANISTAN

02:51:59,490 --> 02:52:02,206
SPEAKER_0:  pretty much like the British Empire.

02:52:02,626 --> 02:52:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  that after the Suez experience in 56.

02:52:06,018 --> 02:52:07,774
SPEAKER_0:  decided to withdraw from

02:52:08,578 --> 02:52:11,262
SPEAKER_0:  East of Suez.

02:52:12,898 --> 02:52:16,190
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe there is a moment here that we are witnessing.

02:52:16,450 --> 02:52:17,406
SPEAKER_0:  or it may come.

02:52:18,626 --> 02:52:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  that a great power like the United States sees in its benefit.

02:52:22,978 --> 02:52:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  not to get too much involved into nitty-gritty things.

02:52:26,530 --> 02:52:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  in other parts of the world.

02:52:28,386 --> 02:52:30,558
SPEAKER_0:  that it's not its immediate concept.

02:52:32,322 --> 02:52:33,950
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that's.

02:52:35,362 --> 02:52:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  Part of the reason, not the entire reason.

02:52:38,306 --> 02:52:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  Part of the reason why we see the emergence of a new

02:52:43,330 --> 02:52:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  geopolitical.

02:52:45,826 --> 02:52:46,910
SPEAKER_0:  environment.

02:52:47,522 --> 02:52:48,926
SPEAKER_0:  in this part of the world.

02:52:49,602 --> 02:52:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  of which China

02:52:52,450 --> 02:52:53,246
SPEAKER_0:  Russia?

02:52:54,530 --> 02:52:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  possibly Iran, possibly Turkey.

02:52:57,282 --> 02:52:58,558
SPEAKER_0:  Possibly both of them.

02:52:59,042 --> 02:53:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  are going to be part.

02:53:01,602 --> 02:53:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  Perhaps Saudis also.

02:53:03,586 --> 02:53:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  But.

02:53:04,674 --> 02:53:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  I-

02:53:05,282 --> 02:53:06,622
SPEAKER_0:  Dota the Saudis.

02:53:07,042 --> 02:53:09,918
SPEAKER_0:  under the present circumstances, although we've witnessed.

02:53:10,338 --> 02:53:12,190
SPEAKER_0:  some remarkable issue.

02:53:13,378 --> 02:53:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  course of the past few weeks.

02:53:15,426 --> 02:53:16,606
SPEAKER_0:  Where the Saudis?

02:53:16,994 --> 02:53:18,462
SPEAKER_0:  giving assurances to.

02:53:18,850 --> 02:53:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  American administration and then shifting.

02:53:21,826 --> 02:53:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  and getting along with.

02:53:23,618 --> 02:53:24,094
SPEAKER_0:  put in.

02:53:24,898 --> 02:53:27,678
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of the oil production, I think it's more than.

02:53:28,514 --> 02:53:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  and it's not only them.

02:53:30,178 --> 02:53:32,286
SPEAKER_0:  but also the Emirates are doing the same thing.

02:53:32,898 --> 02:53:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  So what does that tell us? And that's another-

02:53:35,874 --> 02:53:40,670
SPEAKER_1:  Many our conversation about the world industry in Iran and the.

02:53:41,090 --> 02:53:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  the whole region in emerging.

02:53:43,618 --> 02:53:45,150
SPEAKER_0:  this kind of a world.

02:53:45,890 --> 02:53:49,726
SPEAKER_0:  which was perhaps even 10 years ago unimaginable.

02:53:50,434 --> 02:53:52,798
SPEAKER_0:  that you see now a great power.

02:53:53,314 --> 02:53:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  China

02:53:54,562 --> 02:53:55,198
SPEAKER_0:  That's it.

02:53:55,522 --> 02:53:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  going to remain.

02:53:57,346 --> 02:53:58,974
SPEAKER_0:  from what we see around us.

02:53:59,522 --> 02:54:00,574
SPEAKER_0:  as a great power.

02:54:01,826 --> 02:54:02,366
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:54:02,594 --> 02:54:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  Russia

02:54:04,034 --> 02:54:05,534
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, adventurous?

02:54:06,498 --> 02:54:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  Foolish.

02:54:07,554 --> 02:54:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  but nevertheless would remain.

02:54:10,562 --> 02:54:10,878
SPEAKER_0:  Oh.

02:54:11,266 --> 02:54:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  Criminal, I would say, as far as the...

02:54:14,242 --> 02:54:14,686
SPEAKER_0:  It's.

02:54:14,978 --> 02:54:15,934
SPEAKER_0:  behavior in

02:54:16,162 --> 02:54:17,022
SPEAKER_0:  Ukraine.

02:54:17,890 --> 02:54:18,814
SPEAKER_0:  But actually...

02:54:19,234 --> 02:54:22,718
SPEAKER_0:  It's a rogue nation that attracts another rogue nation.

02:54:23,106 --> 02:54:23,934
SPEAKER_0:  So, Eid on.

02:54:24,578 --> 02:54:25,534
SPEAKER_0:  finds itself.

02:54:25,922 --> 02:54:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  No!

02:54:26,882 --> 02:54:29,630
SPEAKER_0:  in a greater place of security.

02:54:30,178 --> 02:54:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  in alliance with Russia.

02:54:32,514 --> 02:54:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  in the hope

02:54:33,666 --> 02:54:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  that this would give.

02:54:35,106 --> 02:54:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  Eat on.

02:54:36,098 --> 02:54:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  a greater security in this part of the world.

02:54:39,810 --> 02:54:40,734
SPEAKER_0:  whether this is...

02:54:41,250 --> 02:54:42,238
SPEAKER_0:  whether this is...

02:54:42,786 --> 02:54:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  realistic or illusion.

02:54:46,818 --> 02:54:51,646
SPEAKER_0:  I think remains to be seen. I think Iran-China relation makes more sense.

02:54:53,186 --> 02:54:53,662
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:54:53,954 --> 02:54:58,046
SPEAKER_0:  Although, if you ask ordinary Iranians, they don't like it.

02:54:58,914 --> 02:55:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  They would tell, why should we be?

02:55:01,954 --> 02:55:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  Hide up.

02:55:03,426 --> 02:55:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  with.

02:55:04,130 --> 02:55:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  with China.

02:55:06,594 --> 02:55:07,678
SPEAKER_0:  as the only

02:55:08,130 --> 02:55:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

02:55:09,346 --> 02:55:12,318
SPEAKER_0:  straight party with America because of the IT.

02:55:12,738 --> 02:55:15,390
SPEAKER_0:  foolish isolations that you have created for us.

02:55:15,714 --> 02:55:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  because of all the sanctions that you have created for us.

02:55:18,850 --> 02:55:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  Islamic Republic.

02:55:21,026 --> 02:55:21,406
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:55:21,666 --> 02:55:24,062
SPEAKER_0:  In a sense, it's a very difficult question.

02:55:24,450 --> 02:55:27,646
SPEAKER_0:  to answer, probably Iranians also like to be more at the other camp.

02:55:28,610 --> 02:55:31,678
SPEAKER_0:  But what happens is that in real term.

02:55:32,610 --> 02:55:34,558
SPEAKER_0:  What surprises me most?

02:55:35,458 --> 02:55:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  is not this other is.

02:55:38,050 --> 02:55:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  China but it's

02:55:39,522 --> 02:55:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  kind of becoming.

02:55:41,762 --> 02:55:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  a lucky or...

02:55:43,618 --> 02:55:44,798
SPEAKER_0:  subservient.

02:55:45,762 --> 02:55:47,774
SPEAKER_0:  to Putin's regime.

02:55:48,322 --> 02:55:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  in Russia.

02:55:51,074 --> 02:55:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  since if you look at it.

02:55:53,346 --> 02:55:54,046
SPEAKER_0:  Iran

02:55:55,266 --> 02:55:59,230
SPEAKER_0:  ever since at least the 19th century, not going further back.

02:56:00,034 --> 02:56:01,886
SPEAKER_0:  The beginning of the 19th century.

02:56:02,338 --> 02:56:04,958
SPEAKER_0:  always viewed Russia as the greatest threat.

02:56:05,858 --> 02:56:07,454
SPEAKER_0:  strategically.

02:56:07,938 --> 02:56:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  because it was sitting right at the top of Iran.

02:56:10,914 --> 02:56:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  was.

02:56:12,546 --> 02:56:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  It was...

02:56:14,402 --> 02:56:14,814
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

02:56:15,362 --> 02:56:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  infinitely more powerful than Iran.

02:56:17,986 --> 02:56:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  has ever been.

02:56:20,610 --> 02:56:22,110
SPEAKER_0:  and it runs for two

02:56:22,434 --> 02:56:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  rounds of war at the beginning of the century.

02:56:25,666 --> 02:56:27,486
SPEAKER_0:  Lost the entire Caucasus.

02:56:28,386 --> 02:56:29,406
SPEAKER_0:  To Russia.

02:56:29,954 --> 02:56:31,198
SPEAKER_0:  and learned its lesson.

02:56:32,802 --> 02:56:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  That's.

02:56:34,562 --> 02:56:36,670
SPEAKER_0:  You have to be mindful of Russia.

02:56:37,858 --> 02:56:40,798
SPEAKER_0:  and you have to keep it as an arm's length.

02:56:41,474 --> 02:56:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  And that's what was Iran's policy throughout the...

02:56:45,218 --> 02:56:46,910
SPEAKER_0:  course of the 20th century.

02:56:47,362 --> 02:56:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  19th and 20th century.

02:56:49,762 --> 02:56:51,614
SPEAKER_0:  up to what we see now.

02:56:52,098 --> 02:56:52,990
SPEAKER_0:  around us.

02:56:53,410 --> 02:56:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  which is a very strange situation.

02:56:56,002 --> 02:56:56,350
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:56:56,962 --> 02:56:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  What?

02:56:57,602 --> 02:56:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  Weather

02:56:59,330 --> 02:57:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  Balance has changed.

02:57:02,530 --> 02:57:03,518
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of

02:57:04,578 --> 02:57:05,182
SPEAKER_0:  If this...

02:57:05,570 --> 02:57:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  if Russia is purchasing weapons from...

02:57:09,634 --> 02:57:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  from Iran, which was unheard of.

02:57:13,186 --> 02:57:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  and means that there is a...

02:57:15,266 --> 02:57:15,934
SPEAKER_0:  new

02:57:16,866 --> 02:57:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  Balance is emerging, a new relationship is emerging.

02:57:21,346 --> 02:57:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  perhaps remains to be seen.

02:57:24,098 --> 02:57:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  But...

02:57:24,770 --> 02:57:25,086
SPEAKER_0:  uh

02:57:26,146 --> 02:57:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  If you look at the historical precedence.

02:57:29,634 --> 02:57:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  it would have been enormously

02:57:32,034 --> 02:57:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  on voice.

02:57:33,858 --> 02:57:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  to.

02:57:35,074 --> 02:57:36,830
SPEAKER_0:  be an ally of.

02:57:37,634 --> 02:57:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  Russia given its long history of aggression in Iran.

02:57:41,986 --> 02:57:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  Russians

02:57:43,906 --> 02:57:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  Part of the reason why it's actually Iran

02:57:47,362 --> 02:57:50,462
SPEAKER_0:  allied itself with the British Empire.

02:57:51,170 --> 02:57:53,598
SPEAKER_0:  was the fact that it was so much afraid of the...

02:57:54,018 --> 02:57:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  Russian Expansion.

02:57:56,482 --> 02:57:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:57:57,282 --> 02:57:58,334
SPEAKER_0:  As such.

02:57:58,882 --> 02:58:01,758
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know what's going to be the future of this relationship.

02:58:02,466 --> 02:58:03,591
SPEAKER_0:  There is a big.

02:58:03,591 --> 02:58:09,662
SPEAKER_1:  big disconnect between governments and the people. And I think ultimately,

02:58:10,146 --> 02:58:16,478
SPEAKER_1:  I have faith that there's a love across the different cultures, across the different religions.

02:58:16,866 --> 02:58:17,950
SPEAKER_1:  amongst the people.

02:58:18,434 --> 02:58:23,294
SPEAKER_1:  and the governments are the source of the division and the conflict and the wars and all the geopolitics.

02:58:23,714 --> 02:58:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  that is in part grounded in the battle for resources and all that kind of stuff.

02:58:28,738 --> 02:58:30,750
SPEAKER_1:  Nevertheless, this is the world we live in.

02:58:31,298 --> 02:58:33,982
SPEAKER_1:  So you looked at the modern history of Iran.

02:58:34,402 --> 02:58:35,870
SPEAKER_1:  the past few centuries.

02:58:36,386 --> 02:58:38,494
SPEAKER_1:  if you look into the future of this region.

02:58:39,458 --> 02:58:42,206
SPEAKER_1:  Now you kind of implied that a historian...

02:58:42,882 --> 02:58:44,254
SPEAKER_1:  has a bit of a cynical.

02:58:44,738 --> 02:58:45,150
SPEAKER_1:  view.

02:58:46,882 --> 02:58:49,982
SPEAKER_1:  of protests and things like this.

02:58:50,722 --> 02:58:51,358
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:58:51,778 --> 02:58:56,030
SPEAKER_1:  that are fueled, at least in the minds of young people, with hope.

02:58:57,090 --> 02:58:58,846
SPEAKER_1:  if you were to just for a while.

02:58:59,234 --> 02:59:01,502
SPEAKER_1:  Have a bit of hope in your heart and your mind.

02:59:01,762 --> 02:59:05,214
SPEAKER_1:  What is a hopeful future for the next 10, 20, 30 years of a...

02:59:05,730 --> 02:59:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not cynical.

02:59:07,970 --> 02:59:09,342
SPEAKER_0:  I'm trying to be realistic.

02:59:10,178 --> 02:59:14,206
SPEAKER_0:  And I actually may be critical, but I have great hopes.

02:59:15,522 --> 02:59:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  in

02:59:16,802 --> 02:59:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  Iran's future for a variety of reasons.

02:59:19,970 --> 02:59:22,974
SPEAKER_0:  I actually did write an article only if...

02:59:23,330 --> 02:59:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  The last version of it is going to go out today.

02:59:26,946 --> 02:59:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:59:27,586 --> 02:59:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  in which the title of it is the...

02:59:30,466 --> 02:59:33,214
SPEAKER_0:  time of fear and women of hope.

02:59:34,338 --> 02:59:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  which in a sense is this whole

02:59:36,578 --> 02:59:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  coverage but.

02:59:38,434 --> 02:59:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  What this?

02:59:39,330 --> 02:59:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  movement means.

02:59:41,090 --> 02:59:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  that we see today.

02:59:43,010 --> 02:59:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  Keep in May Fizzle.

02:59:45,058 --> 02:59:46,302
SPEAKER_0:  in a few weeks time.

02:59:46,690 --> 02:59:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  or it may just go on and create a new...

02:59:50,626 --> 02:59:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  dynamics in Iranian society.

02:59:53,410 --> 02:59:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  that would hopefully.

02:59:55,394 --> 02:59:56,126
SPEAKER_0:  Results.

02:59:56,962 --> 02:59:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  in a

02:59:57,698 --> 03:00:00,734
SPEAKER_0:  peaceful process of greater

03:00:01,506 --> 03:00:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  accommodation and the greater tolerance.

03:00:06,018 --> 03:00:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  Uh

03:00:06,658 --> 03:00:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  within the Iranian society and with the outside world.

03:00:10,978 --> 03:00:13,854
SPEAKER_0:  And I think the majority of the Iranian people...

03:00:14,210 --> 03:00:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  Don't want tension.

03:00:17,026 --> 03:00:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  Don't fund confrontation.

03:00:19,874 --> 03:00:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  Don't want.

03:00:21,090 --> 03:00:22,110
SPEAKER_0:  crisis.

03:00:23,842 --> 03:00:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  day if

03:00:25,538 --> 03:00:27,166
SPEAKER_0:  40 years they have suffered.

03:00:28,066 --> 03:00:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  from.

03:00:29,122 --> 03:00:33,022
SPEAKER_0:  a regime that have dictated an ideology that it's...

03:00:33,890 --> 03:00:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  regressive.

03:00:36,354 --> 03:00:36,926
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:00:37,186 --> 03:00:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  impractical.

03:00:38,914 --> 03:00:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  They want to go back to a life.

03:00:41,474 --> 03:00:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  in which they don't.

03:00:43,266 --> 03:00:47,390
SPEAKER_0:  they don't really create trouble for their neighbors or for the world.

03:00:49,058 --> 03:00:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  And therefore

03:00:50,210 --> 03:00:51,230
SPEAKER_0:  I would see if.

03:00:51,618 --> 03:00:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  Better future for you.

03:00:53,410 --> 03:00:53,982
SPEAKER_0:  That's for-

03:00:55,106 --> 03:00:55,966
SPEAKER_0:  One reason.

03:00:56,194 --> 03:00:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  strategically.

03:00:58,274 --> 03:01:01,278
SPEAKER_0:  or geopolitically, maybe in Iran's...

03:01:02,114 --> 03:01:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  advantage in a peaceful fashion.

03:01:05,218 --> 03:01:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  negotiate.

03:01:07,074 --> 03:01:09,246
SPEAKER_0:  as it's the fate of all the nations.

03:01:09,698 --> 03:01:10,526
SPEAKER_0:  rather than

03:01:10,786 --> 03:01:11,934
SPEAKER_0:  commit itself.

03:01:12,226 --> 03:01:12,574
SPEAKER_0:  or

03:01:13,314 --> 03:01:15,646
SPEAKER_0:  sworn to a particular

03:01:16,322 --> 03:01:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:01:16,994 --> 03:01:17,662

03:01:18,338 --> 03:01:19,262
SPEAKER_0:  policy.

03:01:20,162 --> 03:01:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  So, this give and take as the nature of politics is art of possible.

03:01:24,930 --> 03:01:25,822
SPEAKER_0:  as it been said.

03:01:26,818 --> 03:01:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  So probably Iran is going to be hopefully move in that direction.

03:01:32,098 --> 03:01:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  I think there is a generational thing. That's the third reason.

03:01:37,090 --> 03:01:38,846
SPEAKER_0:  no matter how much

03:01:40,226 --> 03:01:41,438
SPEAKER_0:  Islamic Republic.

03:01:41,826 --> 03:01:42,558
SPEAKER_0:

03:01:43,490 --> 03:01:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  to Islamize the Iranian society in its own image.

03:01:48,802 --> 03:01:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  of

03:01:49,890 --> 03:01:51,614
SPEAKER_0:  kind of radical.

03:01:52,258 --> 03:01:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  ideological indoctrination.

03:01:54,978 --> 03:01:55,998
SPEAKER_0:  It has failed.

SPEAKER_0:  It has failed up.

03:01:58,882 --> 03:01:59,422
SPEAKER_0:  to...

03:02:00,418 --> 03:02:02,974
SPEAKER_0:  what we see today in the Iranian streets.

03:02:04,162 --> 03:02:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  and the Iranian population said no to it.

03:02:08,258 --> 03:02:09,278
SPEAKER_0:  And I think...

03:02:10,018 --> 03:02:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  if there would have been and there very much hope there will be.

03:02:13,730 --> 03:02:15,294
SPEAKER_0:  a possibility for a...

03:02:16,066 --> 03:02:18,622

SPEAKER_0:  their views out.

03:02:24,706 --> 03:02:26,814
SPEAKER_0:  Iranians are not on this side of

03:02:27,426 --> 03:02:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  moving in the

03:02:28,962 --> 03:02:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  extreme directions.

03:02:31,266 --> 03:02:33,182

03:02:33,858 --> 03:02:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  Accommodation.

03:02:35,266 --> 03:02:38,078
SPEAKER_0:  and the greater interest in the outside world.

SPEAKER_0:  and

03:02:40,322 --> 03:02:44,382

03:02:44,834 --> 03:02:48,798

03:02:49,026 --> 03:02:49,470
SPEAKER_0:  from the.

03:02:50,018 --> 03:02:51,518

03:02:56,674 --> 03:03:01,534

03:03:05,890 --> 03:03:08,286

03:03:31,138 --> 03:03:34,974

03:03:49,922 --> 03:03:52,414
SPEAKER_0:  There are moments of despair.

03:03:52,770 --> 03:03:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  and there are moments that you would think that...

03:03:56,770 --> 03:03:57,598
SPEAKER_0:  There is no hope.

03:03:57,922 --> 03:03:58,430

03:04:00,066 --> 03:04:00,414
SPEAKER_0:  but.

03:04:00,738 --> 03:04:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  but then again something

03:04:03,586 --> 03:04:05,534
SPEAKER_0:  triggers and you see...

03:04:05,890 --> 03:04:08,062
SPEAKER_0:  hundred thousand people in the streets of

03:04:08,898 --> 03:04:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  Berlin

03:04:10,082 --> 03:04:10,462

SPEAKER_0:  that are hoping for a better future for Iran.

03:04:14,530 --> 03:04:17,598
SPEAKER_0:  and I very much hope it eventually emerges even

03:04:17,858 --> 03:04:20,318

03:04:20,994 --> 03:04:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  very strong leadership.

03:04:22,626 --> 03:04:24,126

03:04:48,642 --> 03:04:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  as I've said in the start of my book.

03:04:51,362 --> 03:04:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  I say it's the history of a nation which has learned a huge amount from...

03:04:56,386 --> 03:04:58,558
SPEAKER_0:  from the outside world by force of...

03:04:58,882 --> 03:04:59,742
SPEAKER_0:  It's geography.

03:05:00,290 --> 03:05:03,934
SPEAKER_0:  It was always located somewhere that people would invade. Yeah.

03:05:04,162 --> 03:05:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  or come for trade or...

03:05:06,562 --> 03:05:10,174
SPEAKER_0:  something happened to it that is diffused culture.

03:05:10,626 --> 03:05:11,838
SPEAKER_0:  continue to...

03:05:12,194 --> 03:05:15,326
SPEAKER_0:  and they were not afraid of learning or adopting.

03:05:15,618 --> 03:05:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  as they do right now today.

03:05:18,146 --> 03:05:20,926
SPEAKER_0:  This is a very different society.

03:05:21,218 --> 03:05:25,214
