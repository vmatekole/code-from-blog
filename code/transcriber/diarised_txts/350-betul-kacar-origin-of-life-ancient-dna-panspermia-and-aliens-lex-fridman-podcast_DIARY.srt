00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:09,054
SPEAKER_0:  You can study chemistry, you can study physics, you can study geology anywhere in the universe, but this is the only place you can study biology. This is the only place to be a biologist.

00:00:09,474 --> 00:00:09,886
SPEAKER_0:  That's it.

00:00:10,626 --> 00:00:18,878
SPEAKER_0:  So definitely something very fundamental happened here and you cannot take biology out of the equation if you want to understand how that vast chemistry space

00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,542
SPEAKER_0:  of that general.

00:00:21,378 --> 00:00:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  sequence space.

00:00:22,818 --> 00:00:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  got narrowed down to what is available.

00:00:26,562 --> 00:00:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  or what is used by life.

00:00:28,674 --> 00:00:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  you need to understand the rules of selection. And that's when evolution and biology comes into play.

00:00:36,482 --> 00:00:39,294
SPEAKER_1:  The following is a conversation with Batoo Kachar.

00:00:39,714 --> 00:00:42,046
SPEAKER_1:  an astrobiologist at University of Wisconsin.

00:00:42,402 --> 00:00:42,974
SPEAKER_1:  studying.

00:00:43,234 --> 00:00:46,014
SPEAKER_1:  the essential biological attributes of life.

00:00:46,882 --> 00:00:52,254
SPEAKER_1:  This is the Lex Friedman podcast, support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description. 0

00:00:52,578 --> 00:00:53,278
SPEAKER_1:  Dear friends,

00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,526
SPEAKER_1:  Here's the tool.

00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:55,582
SPEAKER_1:  Kachar.

00:00:56,738 --> 00:01:04,574
SPEAKER_1:  What is the phylogenetic tree or the evolutionary tree of life? What can we learn by running it back and studying ancient gene sequences as you have?

00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:05,534
SPEAKER_0:  I think...

00:01:06,114 --> 00:01:07,326
SPEAKER_0:  Phyrogenetic trees.

00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  could be one of the most.

00:01:10,146 --> 00:01:14,270
SPEAKER_0:  romantic and beautiful notions that can come out of biology.

00:01:14,786 --> 00:01:21,406
SPEAKER_0:  It shows us a way to depict the connectedness of life and all living beings with one another.

00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  itself is an ever evolving notion.

00:01:26,306 --> 00:01:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  biologists like.

00:01:27,874 --> 00:01:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  visualizations. They like these.

00:01:30,114 --> 00:01:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  graphics, these diagrams and tree of life is one of them.

00:01:33,122 --> 00:01:35,870
SPEAKER_1:  So the tree starts at a common ancestor.

00:01:36,546 --> 00:01:41,182
SPEAKER_0:  It's actually the other way around. It starts from the-

00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  the branches, it starts from the tip of the branch.

00:01:44,322 --> 00:01:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  actually, and then further, depending on what you collected.

00:01:50,082 --> 00:01:56,350
SPEAKER_0:  to build the tree. So depending on the branches, depending on what's on the tip of the branch, I will explain what I mean.

00:01:56,802 --> 00:02:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  the root will be determined by what is really sitting on the tip of the branch of the tree.

00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:06,846
SPEAKER_1:  So we could study the leaves of the tree by looking at what we have today and then start to reverse engineer, start to...

00:02:07,202 --> 00:02:10,577
SPEAKER_1:  move back in time to try to understand what the rest of the tree, what the roots.

00:02:10,577 --> 00:02:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  Exactly. So the tree itself, by just taking a few steps back and looking at the entire tree itself.

00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:17,246
SPEAKER_0:

00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  give you an idea about the connectedness.

00:02:20,226 --> 00:02:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  the relatedness of the organisms or whatever, again, you use to create your tree.

00:02:25,122 --> 00:02:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  different ways.

00:02:26,434 --> 00:02:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  but in this case, I'm imagining.

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,014
SPEAKER_0:  entire

00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,358
SPEAKER_0:  diversity of.

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  life today is sitting on the tips of the branches of this tree.

00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  and we look at.

00:02:39,106 --> 00:02:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  biologists look at the tree itself.

00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  We like to think of it as the topology of the tree to understand when certain...

00:02:48,098 --> 00:02:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  organisms or their ancestry may have.

00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:51,518
SPEAKER_0:  merged.

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  over time.

00:02:53,442 --> 00:02:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  depending on the tools you use.

00:02:56,482 --> 00:02:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  You might.

00:02:57,538 --> 00:02:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  Use this.

00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  to then reconstruct the ancestors as well.

00:03:01,986 --> 00:03:06,590
SPEAKER_1:  And so what are the different ways to do the reconstruction? So you can do that at the gene level.

00:03:07,682 --> 00:03:09,150
SPEAKER_1:  or you could do it.

00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,998
SPEAKER_1:  at the higher complex biology level.

00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:13,566
SPEAKER_1:  Right, so what...

00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,966
SPEAKER_1:  In which way have you approached this?

00:03:16,386 --> 00:03:17,406
SPEAKER_1:  this fascinating problem.

00:03:17,538 --> 00:03:20,734
SPEAKER_0:  We approached it in every way we can. So it's the gene.

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  could be protein, the product of the gene.

00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,990
SPEAKER_0:  or species.

00:03:25,602 --> 00:03:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  or could be even groups of species.

00:03:28,514 --> 00:03:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  It will depend, totally depends on what you want to do with your tree. If you want to understand certain...

00:03:34,466 --> 00:03:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  past events whether an organism exchanged a certain DNA with another one along the course of evolution?

00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:43,710
SPEAKER_0:  You can build your tree accordingly.

00:03:43,938 --> 00:03:50,238
SPEAKER_0:  if you rather use the tree to reconstruct or resurrect ancient DNA which is what we do

00:03:50,658 --> 00:03:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  then you

00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:57,022
SPEAKER_0:  In our case, for instance, we do both gene protein and species because we want to compare.

00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,110
SPEAKER_0:  the tree.

00:03:59,266 --> 00:04:00,734
SPEAKER_0:  that we create using these different.

00:04:00,962 --> 00:04:01,758
SPEAKER_0:  information.

00:04:02,498 --> 00:04:05,086
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, well, let me ask you the ridiculous question then. Answer in the next video...

00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:06,814
SPEAKER_1:  How realistic is Jurassic Park?

00:04:07,234 --> 00:04:12,094
SPEAKER_1:  Can we study the genes of ancient organisms and can we bring the...

00:04:12,482 --> 00:04:17,886
SPEAKER_1:  those ancient organisms back. So the reason I ask that kind of ridiculous sounding question is because I guess the sounds come from the

00:04:18,498 --> 00:04:21,374
SPEAKER_1:  maybe gives us context of what we can and can't do.

00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,070
SPEAKER_1:  by looking back in time.

00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, sold.

00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:29,054
SPEAKER_0:  dinosaurs or all these mammals in, at least for us is.

00:04:30,498 --> 00:04:36,675
SPEAKER_0:  The exciting thing already happened by the time we hit to larger organisms or to eukaryotes.

00:04:36,675 --> 00:04:38,925
SPEAKER_1:  See you, the fun stuff is before we got to the mail.

00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  The fun stuff is what people think is boring, I think. The phase that's, well, at least two different times in the geologic history. One is the...

00:04:47,778 --> 00:04:48,702
SPEAKER_0:  First life.

00:04:48,962 --> 00:04:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  Oh.

00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  past origin of life, how did first life look like?

00:04:53,634 --> 00:04:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  And the second is why do we think that

00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  over certain periods of geologic time.

00:05:00,354 --> 00:05:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  no significant innovation happened to the degree of leaving no record behind.

00:05:05,698 --> 00:05:07,486
SPEAKER_1:  So what do we not have a record of?

00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:11,070
SPEAKER_1:  Which part? Is it the fun stuff to you?

00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:16,446
SPEAKER_1:  is after the origin of life, which we'll talk about, after the origin of life, there's single cell organisms.

00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:22,878
SPEAKER_1:  the whole thing with the photosynthesis, the whole thing with the eukaryotes and multicell organisms.

00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,558
SPEAKER_1:  What else is the fun stuff? The whole oxygen thing?

00:05:27,106 --> 00:05:29,598
SPEAKER_1:  which mixes in with the origin of life.

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:34,846
SPEAKER_1:  There's a bunch of different inventions all that have to do with this primitive kind of looking organisms

00:05:35,522 --> 00:05:38,014
SPEAKER_1:  that we don't have a good record of.

00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  So I will tell you the more interesting things for us.

00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  One is the origin of life or what happened.

00:05:45,922 --> 00:05:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  Following.

00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  the emergence of life. How did the first cells look like?

00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  and then pretty much anything.

00:05:52,994 --> 00:05:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  that we think shaped

00:05:55,138 --> 00:06:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  the environment and was shaped by the environment in a way that impacted the entire planet.

00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:03,742
SPEAKER_0:  that enabled you and I to have this conversation.

00:06:04,482 --> 00:06:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  We have very little understanding of the biological innovations that took place in the past of this planet.

00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  We work with a very limited set of

00:06:15,746 --> 00:06:19,134
SPEAKER_0:  I don't want to even say data because they are fossil records.

00:06:19,554 --> 00:06:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  So let's say in prints.

00:06:21,442 --> 00:06:23,166
SPEAKER_0:  either that comes from the rock.

00:06:23,394 --> 00:06:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  in the rock record itself.

00:06:25,378 --> 00:06:26,334
SPEAKER_0:  or

00:06:26,562 --> 00:06:27,838
SPEAKER_0:  what I just described.

00:06:28,226 --> 00:06:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  these trees that we create and whatever we can infer about the past. So we have two distinct ways.

00:06:35,202 --> 00:06:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  that comes from geology and biology, and they each have their limitations.

00:06:40,578 --> 00:06:46,174
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so right. So there's an interplay. The geology gives you that little bit of data.

00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,342
SPEAKER_1:  and then the biology.

00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:50,782
SPEAKER_1:  Gezu.

00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,070
SPEAKER_1:  that little bit of kind of constraints in the materials you get to work with to infer.

00:06:55,618 --> 00:07:00,926
SPEAKER_1:  how does this result in the kind of data that we're seeing? And now we can have this through the fog.

00:07:01,442 --> 00:07:04,638
SPEAKER_1:  we can see, we can look back hundreds of millions of years.

00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:07,518
SPEAKER_1:  couple of billion years and try to infer.

00:07:07,714 --> 00:07:17,406
SPEAKER_0:  Even further, and I like that you said fog. It is pretty foggy. What we're doing, and it gets foggier and foggier the more you, the further you try to see into the past.

00:07:17,954 --> 00:07:19,582
SPEAKER_0:  biology is.

00:07:19,938 --> 00:07:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  You basically study with

00:07:21,602 --> 00:07:22,974
SPEAKER_0:  study the survivors.

00:07:23,522 --> 00:07:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  broadly speaking, and you're trying to...

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  pitch, sort of put together their history based on whatever you can recover today.

00:07:30,434 --> 00:07:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  What makes biology fascinating?

00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  Also...

00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  Let it rip.

00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  B- B-

00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  it erased its own history in a way, right?

00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  So you work with this four billion year product, that's genome, that's the DNA.

00:07:43,234 --> 00:07:46,302
SPEAKER_0:  It's great. It's a very dynamic, ever evolving.

00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:48,030
SPEAKER_0:  chemical thing.

00:07:48,898 --> 00:07:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  And so you will get some information, but...

00:07:51,394 --> 00:07:52,350
SPEAKER_0:  You're not gonna get.

00:07:53,058 --> 00:07:55,070
SPEAKER_0:  much unless you know where to look.

00:07:55,906 --> 00:07:56,702
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:07:57,474 --> 00:07:59,550
SPEAKER_0:  because it is responding to the environment.

00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,358
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so what we have, that's fascinating.

00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:05,438
SPEAKER_1:  What we have is the survivors.

00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:06,750
SPEAKER_1:  the successful.

00:08:07,906 --> 00:08:12,094
SPEAKER_1:  successful organisms, even the primitive ones, even the bacteria we have today.

00:08:12,386 --> 00:08:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  So bacteria is not primitive and we... Sorry

00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,095
SPEAKER_1:  Sorry to offend the bacteria.

00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  We should be very grateful to Bakteria.

00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  great great ancestors.

00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  I like this quote by Douglas Adams, humans don't.

00:08:26,818 --> 00:08:30,750
SPEAKER_0:  like their ancestors, they rarely invite them over for dinner.

00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  But bacteria is in your dinner. Bacteria is in your gut. Bacteria is helping you along the way. So we do invite them for dinner. Well, they'd get themselves invited in a way.

00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  And...

00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,910
SPEAKER_0:  So we and they're definitely older.

00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:47,966
SPEAKER_0:  And definitely very sophisticated, very resilient.

00:08:48,354 --> 00:08:54,462
SPEAKER_0:  than anything else. As someone working at the, as a bacteriologist, I feel like I need to do.

00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,206
SPEAKER_0:  Defend them in this case because they don't get much shout out.

00:08:58,562 --> 00:08:59,687
SPEAKER_0:  Let me think about life.

00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:04,510
SPEAKER_1:  So you do study bacteria, so which organism gives you hints that are alive today that give you

00:09:06,082 --> 00:09:10,622
SPEAKER_1:  hints about what ancient organisms were like, and what they ate.

00:09:11,138 --> 00:09:12,318
SPEAKER_1:  or just a renal lab.

00:09:12,546 --> 00:09:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  We study a variety of different bacteria depending on the questions that we ask. We engineer bacteria.

00:09:18,946 --> 00:09:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  So ideally we want to work with bacteria that we can engineer.

00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:25,950
SPEAKER_0:  seldom we developed the tools to engineer them.

00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  And it depends on the question that we are interested in. If we are interested in connecting the biology and geology.

00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  to understand the early life and

00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  fundamental innovations across billions of years.

00:09:40,642 --> 00:09:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  there are really good candidates like cyanobacteria.

00:09:43,618 --> 00:09:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  So we use cyanobacteria very frequently.

00:09:47,682 --> 00:09:53,214
SPEAKER_0:  In the lab, we can engineer its genome. We can perturb its function by poking.

00:09:53,538 --> 00:09:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  its own DNA with the.

00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  foreignDNA.V

00:09:57,282 --> 00:09:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  engineer in the lab.

00:09:58,818 --> 00:10:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  We work with Ecoli. It's the most simple in terms of model systems go.

00:10:04,706 --> 00:10:05,150
SPEAKER_0:  goes.

00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  organism that one can study well established.

00:10:08,706 --> 00:10:09,118
SPEAKER_0:  Ehh

00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  sort of a pet, lab pet.

00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:15,998
SPEAKER_0:  that we use it a lot for cloning and for understanding.

00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  basic functions of the cell given that it's really well studied.

00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,878
SPEAKER_1:  So, and then what you do with that E. coli.

00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,214
SPEAKER_1:  You said that you injected with point DNA?

00:10:25,602 --> 00:10:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  We inject pretty much all the bacteria that we work with, with foreign DNA. We also work with diazotrophs. These are azotobacteria.

00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  They're one of the prime nitrogen fixers, nitrogen fixing.

00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  Bacteria.

00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:43,134
SPEAKER_1:  Can you explain what that is? Nitrogen fixing? Is that the source of its energy?

00:10:43,714 --> 00:10:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  So nitrogen is a triple bond.

00:10:46,338 --> 00:10:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  gas that's pretty abundant in the atmosphere.

00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  Nitrogen itself cannot be directly utilized by cells given it has triple bond.

00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:58,814
SPEAKER_0:  It needs to be converted to ammonia that is then used.

00:10:59,106 --> 00:10:59,870
SPEAKER_0:  for

00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:00,542
SPEAKER_0:  dude.

00:11:01,282 --> 00:11:02,046
SPEAKER_0:  downstream.

00:11:02,754 --> 00:11:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  cellular functions.

00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,214
SPEAKER_1:  And that's what counts as.

00:11:05,506 --> 00:11:06,974
SPEAKER_1:  nitrogen fixing.

00:11:07,202 --> 00:11:08,327
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, so...

00:11:08,327 --> 00:11:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  to be fixed before our cells can make use of it.

00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:12,254
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:11:12,482 --> 00:11:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  And it's... No offense to nitrogen either. Well, it's actually a very important element. It's one of the most abundant elements on our planet that is used by biology. It's in...

00:11:23,618 --> 00:11:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  ATP, it's in chlorophyll.

00:11:27,202 --> 00:11:27,902
SPEAKER_0:  users

00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,502
SPEAKER_0:  that relies on nitrogen.

00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  So it's a very important enzyme for a lot of

00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  cell functions.

00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:38,435
SPEAKER_1:  And there's just one mechanism that evolution invented to convert.

00:11:38,435 --> 00:11:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  It is.

00:11:39,938 --> 00:11:48,926
SPEAKER_0:  So far we know there's only one nitrogen fixation pathway, as opposed to say carbon. You can find up to seven or eight different carbon ways.

00:11:49,154 --> 00:11:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  microbes invented to fix carbon.

00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:54,622
SPEAKER_0:  That's not the case for nitrogen. It's a singularity.

00:11:54,946 --> 00:11:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  across geologic time. We think it evolved around 2.7 maybe.

00:11:59,426 --> 00:12:00,670
SPEAKER_0:  Um, roughly three.

00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,126
SPEAKER_0:  probably less than three billion years ago.

00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  And that's the only way that nature invented to fix the nitrogen in the atmosphere for the subsequent use.

00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,934
SPEAKER_1:  Would we still have life as we know it today if we didn't invent?

00:12:16,162 --> 00:12:17,598
SPEAKER_1:  that nitrogen fixing step.

00:12:17,698 --> 00:12:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  I cannot think of it, no.

00:12:19,362 --> 00:12:21,406
SPEAKER_0:  It's essential to.

00:12:21,634 --> 00:12:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  Life as we know, you and I are having this conversation because...

00:12:25,282 --> 00:12:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  life.

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,925
SPEAKER_0:  found a way to fix nitrogen.

00:12:27,925 --> 00:12:30,430
SPEAKER_1:  Is that one of the tougher ones? If you put it sort of-

00:12:30,914 --> 00:12:32,382
SPEAKER_1:  uh, oxygen.

00:12:33,058 --> 00:12:33,886
SPEAKER_1:  Nitrogen.

00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:34,942
SPEAKER_1:  carbon.

00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,318
SPEAKER_1:  What are-

00:12:36,706 --> 00:12:38,942
SPEAKER_1:  in terms of being able to work with these.

00:12:39,682 --> 00:12:40,254
SPEAKER_1:  elements.

00:12:41,474 --> 00:12:42,558
SPEAKER_1:  What is the hardest?

00:12:43,394 --> 00:12:44,830
SPEAKER_1:  What is the most essential for life?

00:12:45,282 --> 00:12:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  Just to give context. Well, we think of this as the cocktail. You may hear schnapps. What's in the cocktail? It's the schnapps, right? Carbon hydrogen oxygen.

00:12:53,442 --> 00:12:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  nitrogen, sulfur.

00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  So there are five elements.

00:12:56,578 --> 00:12:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  that life relies on.

00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,630
SPEAKER_0:  We don't quite know whether that's...

00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  the only out of many options that life necessarily needs to operate on. But that's just how it.

00:13:08,738 --> 00:13:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  how it happened on our own planet.

00:13:10,786 --> 00:13:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  and there are many abiotic ways to fix nitrogen.

00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  and like lightning, right? Lightning can accumulate ammonia.

00:13:19,938 --> 00:13:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  Humans found a way about a hundred years ago.

00:13:23,138 --> 00:13:24,094
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

00:13:24,322 --> 00:13:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  around World War I.

00:13:26,466 --> 00:13:31,870
SPEAKER_0:  the Haber-Bosch process that we can abiotically convert nitrogen.

00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  in Turmonia.

00:13:33,474 --> 00:13:39,102
SPEAKER_0:  Actually, 50% of the nitrogen in our bodies comes from the human

00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  conversion of nitrogen to ammonia.

00:13:42,658 --> 00:13:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  It's helped, it's the fertilizer that we use, urea, comes from that process.

00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  It's in our food. So we helped, we found a way to

00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,846
SPEAKER_0:  fix our own nitrogen for ourselves.

00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:55,934
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, but that...

00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:56,606
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

00:13:57,026 --> 00:13:58,878
SPEAKER_1:  That's way after the original.

00:13:59,202 --> 00:14:00,327
SPEAKER_1:  Invention of how to

00:14:00,327 --> 00:14:01,077
SPEAKER_0:  Absolutely.

00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:03,006
SPEAKER_1:  And without that we wouldn't have.

00:14:03,714 --> 00:14:06,462
SPEAKER_1:  we wouldn't have all the steps of evolution along with it.

00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:09,598
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, absolutely. We tried to replicate.

00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:12,990
SPEAKER_0:  in the most simplest way what nature has.

00:14:13,282 --> 00:14:13,982
SPEAKER_0:  Come up, bitch.

00:14:14,946 --> 00:14:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  We do this by taking nitrogen using a lot of pressure and then generating ammonia.

00:14:20,354 --> 00:14:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  Life does this in a more sophisticated way, relying on one single enzyme called nitrogenase.

00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  It's the nitrogen.

00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  that is used together with 8 electron donor.

00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  and ATP.

00:14:33,186 --> 00:14:35,454
SPEAKER_0:  together with a lot of hydrogen.

00:14:36,034 --> 00:14:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  life.

00:14:36,962 --> 00:14:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  pushes this metabolism down to create.

00:14:40,002 --> 00:14:41,054
SPEAKER_0:  fixed nitrogen.

00:14:41,474 --> 00:14:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  It's quite remarkable.

00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:47,806
SPEAKER_1:  So the lab pet, E. coli inject them with DNA. Those are the E. coli does nitrogen fixing.

00:14:48,194 --> 00:14:49,918
SPEAKER_1:  in part or is that a different one?

00:14:50,146 --> 00:14:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  So some biological engineers.

00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  engineered E. coli to

00:14:54,882 --> 00:14:57,374
SPEAKER_0:  fixed nitrogen, I believe, not us.

00:14:57,762 --> 00:14:59,070
SPEAKER_0:  We use the.

00:14:59,426 --> 00:15:00,670
SPEAKER_0:  Nature's nitrogen.

00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  nitrogen fixing bug.

00:15:02,626 --> 00:15:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  and engineer it with the nitrogen fixing.

00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:10,783
SPEAKER_0:  metabolism that we resurrected using our computational and phylogenetic methods.

00:15:10,783 --> 00:15:11,518
SPEAKER_1:  tools.

00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,345
SPEAKER_1:  How complicated are these little organisms? What are we talking about?

00:15:15,345 --> 00:15:17,118
SPEAKER_0:  depends on how you define complication.

00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:20,446
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so I could tell.

00:15:20,706 --> 00:15:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  that you appreciate and respect the full complexity of even the most seemingly.

00:15:27,522 --> 00:15:27,838
SPEAKER_1:

00:15:28,354 --> 00:15:31,934
SPEAKER_1:  primitive organisms because none of them are primitive. okay

00:15:32,418 --> 00:15:37,374
SPEAKER_1:  That said, what kind of, what are we talking about? How, how, um...

00:15:38,178 --> 00:15:40,446
SPEAKER_1:  What kind of machineries do they have?

00:15:40,802 --> 00:15:42,974
SPEAKER_1:  that you're working with when you're injecting them with DNA.

00:15:43,362 --> 00:15:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  So I will...

00:15:44,738 --> 00:15:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  start with one of the most fascinating machineries that we target, which is the translation machinery.

00:15:50,914 --> 00:15:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  It is a very unique.

00:15:54,146 --> 00:15:54,622
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:15:54,914 --> 00:15:55,710
SPEAKER_0:  subsystem.

00:15:55,938 --> 00:15:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  of cellular life.

00:15:57,698 --> 00:16:00,414
SPEAKER_0:  in comparison to, I would say, metabolism.

00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,286
SPEAKER_0:  And we used to...

00:16:04,706 --> 00:16:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  When we are thinking about cellular life, we think of cell as the basic unit.

00:16:10,274 --> 00:16:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  Ehh or dude

00:16:11,426 --> 00:16:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  building block.

00:16:12,674 --> 00:16:15,230
SPEAKER_0:  But from a key perspective...

00:16:15,618 --> 00:16:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  That's...

00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  Not the case. There's just gonna be a curse on the day, I know the curse already exists...

00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:21,246
SPEAKER_0:  One may argue that everything that happens inside the cell

00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:23,102
SPEAKER_0:  serves the translation.

00:16:23,554 --> 00:16:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  and the translation machinery.

00:16:26,146 --> 00:16:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  Um, there's a nice paper that called this that entire cell.

00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:32,254
SPEAKER_0:  is hopelessly addicted.

00:16:32,482 --> 00:16:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  to this main informatic.

00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  computing, biological.

00:16:38,018 --> 00:16:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  Chemical.

00:16:38,946 --> 00:16:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  system that it's.

00:16:40,226 --> 00:16:41,918
SPEAKER_0:  is operating at the heart of the cell.

00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:43,390
SPEAKER_1:  which is the translation.

00:16:43,746 --> 00:16:45,726
SPEAKER_1:  It is the translation. It is the translation form.

00:16:46,722 --> 00:16:47,102
SPEAKER_1:  to what?

00:16:47,362 --> 00:16:48,254
SPEAKER_1:  So RNA.

00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  enzymes converts.

00:16:50,722 --> 00:16:51,902
SPEAKER_0:  Linear Sequence.

00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  of mRNA into a folded.

00:16:54,754 --> 00:16:56,350
SPEAKER_0:  later folded protein.

00:16:56,994 --> 00:17:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  That's the core processing center for information for life.

00:17:04,386 --> 00:17:08,670
SPEAKER_0:  It has multiple steps. It initiates, it elongates.

00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  It's...

00:17:10,338 --> 00:17:12,350
SPEAKER_0:  terminates and it recycles.

00:17:13,538 --> 00:17:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  operates.

00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:15,454
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:16,574
SPEAKER_0:  Eww.

00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:17,342
SPEAKER_0:  discrete.

00:17:17,762 --> 00:17:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  bits of information itself is like a chemical decoding.

00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  device and that is incredibly.

00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  unique for translation that I don't think you will find.

00:17:28,706 --> 00:17:30,590
SPEAKER_0:  anywhere else in the cell.

00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:31,614
SPEAKER_0:  that does this.

00:17:31,906 --> 00:17:32,286
SPEAKER_1:  So.

00:17:32,706 --> 00:17:37,790
SPEAKER_1:  Even though it's called translation, it's really like a factory that reads.

00:17:38,402 --> 00:17:39,454
SPEAKER_1:  The schematic.

00:17:40,418 --> 00:17:44,222
SPEAKER_1:  and builds a three-dimensional object. It's a printer.

00:17:44,706 --> 00:17:47,774
SPEAKER_0:  I would divide it into actually even four more.

00:17:48,098 --> 00:17:54,270
SPEAKER_0:  additional steps or disciplines, then what would it take to study it by the way you described it?

00:17:54,562 --> 00:17:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  It's a chemical system.

00:17:56,802 --> 00:17:59,454
SPEAKER_0:  It's the compounds that make it up, or chemicals.

00:17:59,842 --> 00:18:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  It's physical.

00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  It tracks the energy.

00:18:03,618 --> 00:18:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  to make.

00:18:04,738 --> 00:18:06,014
SPEAKER_0:  its job to do its job.

00:18:06,498 --> 00:18:07,710
SPEAKER_0:  It's on Informatic.

00:18:08,258 --> 00:18:09,790
SPEAKER_0:  What is processed are the bits.

00:18:10,434 --> 00:18:11,582
SPEAKER_0:  It's computational.

00:18:12,194 --> 00:18:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  the discrete states that

00:18:14,402 --> 00:18:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  the system is placed when the information is being processed, that itself is computational.

00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  And it's biological. It's a, there's variability and inheritance that come.

00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:27,454
SPEAKER_0:  from imperfect replication even.

00:18:27,842 --> 00:18:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  and in perfect computation.

00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:32,350
SPEAKER_1:  So your hand that's so good. So

00:18:32,642 --> 00:18:34,782
SPEAKER_1:  From the biology comes the...

00:18:35,138 --> 00:18:36,126
SPEAKER_1:  Like when you mess up.

00:18:37,058 --> 00:18:39,582
SPEAKER_1:  The bugs are the features, that's the biology.

00:18:39,906 --> 00:18:43,518
SPEAKER_1:  Informatics is obvious in the RNA that says several information there.

00:18:44,098 --> 00:18:50,942
SPEAKER_1:  The different steps along the way is actually kind of what the computer does with with bits. It's done computation

00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:52,606
SPEAKER_1:  physical there's a

00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:53,630
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:18:54,466 --> 00:19:02,238
SPEAKER_1:  I guess, almost like a mechanical process to the whole thing that requires energy and actually, you know, it's manipulating actual physical objects.

00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,990
SPEAKER_1:  and chemicals because you're

00:19:05,826 --> 00:19:08,286
SPEAKER_1:  have to ultimately it's all chemistry. Not all chemistry is not going to be easy.

00:19:08,418 --> 00:19:15,454
SPEAKER_0:  And it tracks this information. So it is almost a mini computer device inside ourselves. Yeah.

00:19:15,682 --> 00:19:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  EW

00:19:16,642 --> 00:19:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  computational device of life.

00:19:18,306 --> 00:19:19,454
SPEAKER_0:  It's, it's, uh...

00:19:20,162 --> 00:19:20,638
SPEAKER_0:  Likely.

00:19:21,154 --> 00:19:21,790
SPEAKER_0:  The key.

00:19:22,402 --> 00:19:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  Oh.

00:19:23,426 --> 00:19:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  operation system that had to evolve for life.

00:19:27,778 --> 00:19:28,382
SPEAKER_1:  emerge.

00:19:28,642 --> 00:19:30,526
SPEAKER_1:  It's more interesting.

00:19:31,746 --> 00:19:32,190
SPEAKER_1:  or

00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:36,510
SPEAKER_1:  It's more complicated in interesting ways than the computers we have today.

00:19:36,866 --> 00:19:39,134
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, everything you said, which is really, really nice.

00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:41,790
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I guess our computers have the informatic.

00:19:42,146 --> 00:19:43,518
SPEAKER_1:  and then have the computational.

00:19:44,002 --> 00:19:45,877
SPEAKER_1:  but they don't have the chemical, the physical.

00:19:45,877 --> 00:19:51,838
SPEAKER_0:  Exactly. And the computers don't have, don't link information to function.

00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:56,606
SPEAKER_0:  They are not tightly coupled, nowhere close to what transition.

00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,230
SPEAKER_0:  and all the way translation does it.

00:19:59,778 --> 00:20:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  So that's the number one, I think, difference between the two.

00:20:03,618 --> 00:20:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  and yes, it's informatic and we can...

00:20:07,234 --> 00:20:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  Disgust is...

00:20:08,898 --> 00:20:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  further too.

00:20:09,858 --> 00:20:13,598
SPEAKER_1:  100%. Let's please discuss this further.

00:20:13,954 --> 00:20:18,078
SPEAKER_1:  which part are we discussing for each one of those fascinating worlds each each of the five

00:20:18,498 --> 00:20:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, so well, we can start with the more, I guess, the...

00:20:22,274 --> 00:20:25,950
SPEAKER_0:  the ones that are more established, which is the chemical aspect.

00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  of the translation machinery.

00:20:28,322 --> 00:20:33,982
SPEAKER_0:  It's the specific compounds make up the assembly of RNA chemists.

00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,478
SPEAKER_0:  show to this in many different ways.

00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  We can rip apart the entire machinery. We know that it's the core of it.

00:20:40,962 --> 00:20:42,910
SPEAKER_0:  there's an RNA that's...

00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  Eww.

00:20:44,194 --> 00:20:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  that operates.

00:20:45,794 --> 00:20:50,718
SPEAKER_0:  not only as an information system itself or information itself, but also as an enzyme.

00:20:51,202 --> 00:20:59,614
SPEAKER_0:  And origin of life chemists make these molecules easily. Now we know we can manipulate RNA, we can make even with single-part chemistries.

00:20:59,938 --> 00:21:01,813
SPEAKER_0:  we can create compounds.

00:21:01,813 --> 00:21:02,622
SPEAKER_1:  chemistry.

00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:10,487
SPEAKER_0:  I would say when you add all the recipes that you know that will lead you to the final product.

00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:12,830
SPEAKER_1:  original left cameras do is they they

00:21:13,058 --> 00:21:15,262
SPEAKER_1:  come up with this part, they throw a bunch of chemicals in.

00:21:15,522 --> 00:21:16,638
SPEAKER_1:  And they tried to.

00:21:16,866 --> 00:21:20,227
SPEAKER_1:  They're basically chefs of a certain kind.

00:21:20,227 --> 00:21:32,894
SPEAKER_0:  sure if that's what they call it, but that's how I think of it. Because it is all combined in a test tube and you know the outcome. And it's very mathematical once you know the right environment and the right chemistry that needs to get into this.

00:21:33,154 --> 00:21:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  container with this pod.

00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:39,934
SPEAKER_0:  You know what the outcomes, there's no luck there anymore. It's a pretty rigid, established.

00:21:40,322 --> 00:21:40,670
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

00:21:41,154 --> 00:21:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  input-output system and it's all chemistry.

00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:46,398
SPEAKER_1:  So you actually wear a lot of hats as one of them.

00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,286
SPEAKER_1:  Origin of Life chemist

00:21:48,386 --> 00:21:52,382
SPEAKER_0:  My PhD is in chemistry, but I don't do original life chemistry.

00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:53,703
SPEAKER_1:  But you're interested in origin.

00:21:53,703 --> 00:21:55,203
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, absolutely.

00:21:55,203 --> 00:21:58,270
SPEAKER_1:  Some of your best friends are original life chemists.

00:21:58,914 --> 00:22:02,878
SPEAKER_0:  Just make sure that you have good chemist friends if you're interested in Origin of Life.

00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  That's

00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,814
SPEAKER_0:  100% requirement, should be mandatory.

00:22:07,874 --> 00:22:12,222
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so chemistry, so what else about this machinery that we need to know?

00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  Well, uh...

00:22:14,338 --> 00:22:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  Chemically, I think that's it. You have enzymes, you have proteins. Enzymes are doing their thing. They know how to chew energy using ATP or GTP. They know what to do in their own way. They do their enzymatic thing.

00:22:28,802 --> 00:22:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  So it's not just the ribosome that is at the heart of the transition, but there are a lot of different proteins.

00:22:35,586 --> 00:22:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  You're looking at about 100 different components that compose this machinery.

00:22:40,418 --> 00:22:44,926
SPEAKER_1:  Well, let me ask kind of maybe it's a ridiculous question, but did the chemistry.

00:22:46,018 --> 00:22:47,454
SPEAKER_1:  Make this machine.

00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,342
SPEAKER_1:  Or did the machine?

00:22:49,986 --> 00:22:53,406
SPEAKER_1:  Use chemistry to achieve a purpose.

00:22:54,594 --> 00:22:55,230
SPEAKER_1:  So like...

00:22:56,322 --> 00:22:56,894
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:22:57,986 --> 00:23:01,278
SPEAKER_1:  I guess there's a lot of different chemical possibilities on earth.

00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  Is this translation machinery just like...

00:23:06,274 --> 00:23:08,734
SPEAKER_1:  uh choosing picking and choosing different

00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:12,862
SPEAKER_1:  chemical reactions that you can use to achieve a purpose.

00:23:13,858 --> 00:23:14,398
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhh

00:23:14,754 --> 00:23:16,702
SPEAKER_1:  Or did the chemistry basically...

00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:23,678
SPEAKER_1:  like there's like a momentum, like a constraint to the thing that can only build a certain kind of machinery.

00:23:24,162 --> 00:23:27,166
SPEAKER_1:  that's basically is chemistry fundamental.

00:23:27,618 --> 00:23:29,630
SPEAKER_1:  Or is it just emergent?

00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,675
SPEAKER_1:  Like how important is chemistry to this whole process?

00:23:32,675 --> 00:23:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  Yes. You cannot have life without chemistry. You cannot have any.

00:23:37,602 --> 00:23:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  cellular process without.

00:23:40,066 --> 00:23:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  What makes life interesting is that even if the chemistry is imperfect...

00:23:44,098 --> 00:23:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  even if there are accidents along the way.

00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,022
SPEAKER_0:  if something binds to another.

00:23:50,082 --> 00:23:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  Chemical.

00:23:50,882 --> 00:23:52,382
SPEAKER_0:  in a way it shouldn't.

00:23:52,802 --> 00:23:55,998
SPEAKER_0:  there is resilience within the system that it can.

00:23:56,386 --> 00:23:58,974
SPEAKER_0:  maybe not necessarily repair itself, but it moves on.

00:23:59,362 --> 00:24:09,054
SPEAKER_0:  how every imperfect mistakes can be handled. That's where the biology comes in. But in terms of chemistry, you absolutely cannot have a transition missionary without chemistry.

00:24:09,378 --> 00:24:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:24:10,338 --> 00:24:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  So as I said, there are four main steps. These are the core steps that are conserved.

00:24:15,714 --> 00:24:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  in all translation machinery and I should say all life has this machine.

00:24:19,874 --> 00:24:20,254
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

00:24:20,962 --> 00:24:21,630
SPEAKER_0:  every cell.

00:24:22,114 --> 00:24:22,974
SPEAKER_0:  On Earth.

00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:23,902
SPEAKER_0:  on Earth.

00:24:25,538 --> 00:24:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

00:24:26,306 --> 00:24:27,806
SPEAKER_1:  when you think of this machine.

00:24:28,226 --> 00:24:33,694
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think very specifically about the kind of machinery that we're talking about, or do you think more philosophically?

00:24:34,178 --> 00:24:37,374
SPEAKER_1:  a machine that converts information into function.

00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:41,246
SPEAKER_0:  It's I cannot separate the two. I think what makes this-

00:24:41,474 --> 00:24:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  machinery fascinating is that those five components that I listed, they coexist.

00:24:47,234 --> 00:24:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  So for instance, if we...

00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  Let's just.

00:24:51,746 --> 00:24:52,382
SPEAKER_0:  talking about the.

00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  chemistry part.

00:24:54,146 --> 00:24:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:24:55,554 --> 00:24:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  We know the certain...

00:24:58,274 --> 00:25:03,678
SPEAKER_0:  rate constant, all these proteins that operate in this machinery needs to

00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  Harbor.

00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  in order to

00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  Get the-

00:25:07,394 --> 00:25:08,702
SPEAKER_0:  mechanism going.

00:25:09,346 --> 00:25:15,294
SPEAKER_0:  right, if you are bringing the information to the translation machinery and you are the initiator

00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:16,446
SPEAKER_0:  of this.

00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:17,886
SPEAKER_0:  computation system.

00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,702
SPEAKER_0:  you need to have.

00:25:20,994 --> 00:25:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  You can only afford a certain range of mistakes. If you're too fast...

00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  then the next message cannot be delivered fast. If you're too slow,

00:25:28,738 --> 00:25:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  that you may stall the process.

00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  So there is definitely chemistry constant going on within the machinery.

00:25:35,746 --> 00:25:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  Again, it's not perfect.

00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:38,718
SPEAKER_0:  Fire from it.

00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  But they all...

00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:47,355
SPEAKER_0:  have their own margin of error that they can tolerate versus they cannot, otherwise they collapse, the system collapses.

00:25:47,355 --> 00:25:52,605
SPEAKER_1:  So it's like a jazz ensemble, the notes of the chemistry, but you can be-

00:25:52,605 --> 00:25:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  I love that you said jazz, it's definitely true. It's a party and it's like everybody's invited and they need to.

00:25:58,754 --> 00:25:59,870
SPEAKER_0:  operate together.

00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  right? And they, what's really cool about it, I think, there are many things.

00:26:05,122 --> 00:26:09,374
SPEAKER_0:  that are very interesting about this thing. But if you remove it from the cell...

00:26:09,762 --> 00:26:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  and put it in a cell-free environment.

00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:15,294
SPEAKER_0:  works just fine, right? So you can get...

00:26:15,618 --> 00:26:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  cell-free translation systems.

00:26:17,954 --> 00:26:19,966
SPEAKER_0:  put this transition in a...

00:26:20,514 --> 00:26:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  this test tube and it is.

00:26:23,202 --> 00:26:25,630
SPEAKER_0:  doing its thing. It doesn't need the rest of the cell.

00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:29,502
SPEAKER_0:  to translate information. Of course you need to feed the information.

00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  at least so far.

00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  But because we.

00:26:33,474 --> 00:26:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, far from.

00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  evolving a translation. Maybe not so far.

00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  evolving a translation in the lab.

00:26:40,418 --> 00:26:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  or the machinery that can

00:26:42,786 --> 00:26:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  process information as it generates it. We have not done that yet.

00:26:46,658 --> 00:26:49,022
SPEAKER_1:  It's a pretty complicated machinery, so it's hard for a digit.

00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:50,430
SPEAKER_1:  for those, uh...

00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:53,315
SPEAKER_1:  or original life chemists to find a pot that generates.

00:26:53,315 --> 00:27:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  Because it's far more than chemistry. You need biology, obviously. You need biochemistry. You need to think as a...

00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  Network Systems folk.

00:27:04,994 --> 00:27:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  You need to think about computation. You need to think about information.

00:27:08,258 --> 00:27:11,710
SPEAKER_0:  And that is not happening yet, except we are trying.

00:27:12,002 --> 00:27:13,374
SPEAKER_0:  to bring this perspective.

00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  But the more you understand how the information systems work, you cannot, once you see it, you cannot unsee it. That's one of those things.

00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:25,022
SPEAKER_1:  So, but you can still rip it out and the chemistry happens.

00:27:25,122 --> 00:27:25,534
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

00:27:25,986 --> 00:27:29,726
SPEAKER_0:  And chemistry can happen even if you strip some of the...

00:27:29,986 --> 00:27:31,294
SPEAKER_0:  parts out.

00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  It can, you can get very minimal.

00:27:34,434 --> 00:27:37,054
SPEAKER_0:  level of information processing.

00:27:37,442 --> 00:27:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  that does not look anything like the translation that cells relies on.

00:27:41,442 --> 00:27:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  but chemists showed from linear, you can generate information that arrives.

00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:50,814
SPEAKER_0:  to a processing center in the form of a linear.

00:27:51,298 --> 00:27:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  Polymer

00:27:52,642 --> 00:27:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  But the-

00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  Informatic part of this system that I think sets the part.

00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:58,078
SPEAKER_0:  from

00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  computation and from metabolism.

00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:04,606
SPEAKER_0:  comes in if you think about the information itself.

00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:05,758
SPEAKER_0:  Right, so.

00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  We have.

00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  four nucleotide letters that compose DNA.

00:28:10,018 --> 00:28:13,694
SPEAKER_0:  and they are processed in the translation in triplets.

00:28:14,434 --> 00:28:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  So you have in triplet code on.

00:28:17,218 --> 00:28:17,854
SPEAKER_0:  fragments.

00:28:18,274 --> 00:28:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  So you have four times four times four. So you have 64 possible states that can be.

00:28:24,482 --> 00:28:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  encoded.

00:28:26,306 --> 00:28:28,702
SPEAKER_0:  by four letters in three positions.

00:28:29,922 --> 00:28:30,590
SPEAKER_0:  Alright, so...

00:28:30,722 --> 00:28:31,774
SPEAKER_1:  It's so amazing.

00:28:32,066 --> 00:28:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. It's so amazing. There's only one.

00:28:34,306 --> 00:28:35,838
SPEAKER_0:  code that says start.

00:28:36,386 --> 00:28:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  that there's only one.

00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,102
SPEAKER_0:  And then there's...

00:28:39,394 --> 00:28:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  to

00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  if not three, that says stop.

00:28:43,426 --> 00:28:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  That's what you work with. But you can have 64 possible states, but life only uses.

00:28:50,402 --> 00:28:50,782
SPEAKER_0:  Sweeney.

00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:52,350
SPEAKER_0:  Amino acids.

00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  So we used, 6Live uses 64 possible states minus 4.

00:28:56,994 --> 00:28:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  of the starts and stops.

00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  to code for 20 amino acids in different combinations.

00:29:03,426 --> 00:29:03,966
SPEAKER_0:  That is-

00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:06,078
SPEAKER_0:  really amazing if you think about.

00:29:06,722 --> 00:29:09,598
SPEAKER_0:  There are 500 different amino acids life can choose, right?

00:29:11,426 --> 00:29:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  narrowed it down to 20. We don't know why.

00:29:13,762 --> 00:29:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of people think about this genetic code is quite fascinating.

00:29:18,498 --> 00:29:22,623
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it didn't do it for four billion years. I don't know, we may wait for another four billion years, but.

00:29:22,623 --> 00:29:25,623
SPEAKER_1:  But you didn't have those amino acids in the very beginning, right?

00:29:25,623 --> 00:29:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  know. So we would be fooling ourselves if we said we know exactly how many amino acids existed.

00:29:32,482 --> 00:29:36,734
SPEAKER_0:  But there's no reason to think that it wasn't the same.

00:29:37,346 --> 00:29:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  or similar.

00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  We don't have a good reason.

00:29:42,242 --> 00:29:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  but because, roughly...

00:29:44,354 --> 00:29:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  2 any out of 60 states are used you're using one third.

00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:48,766
SPEAKER_0:  of your.

00:29:49,026 --> 00:29:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  possible states in your information system.

00:29:52,354 --> 00:29:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  So this may seem.

00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,294
SPEAKER_0:  like a waste.

00:29:55,618 --> 00:29:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  but informatically.

00:29:57,282 --> 00:29:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  It's important because it's abundant and it is.

00:30:00,226 --> 00:30:01,342
SPEAKER_0:  redundant.

00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,126
SPEAKER_0:  Right? right?

00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:06,622
SPEAKER_0:  degeneracy, you see this in

00:30:07,074 --> 00:30:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  that's implemented by this translation machinery inside the cell.

00:30:11,202 --> 00:30:14,110
SPEAKER_0:  So it means we can make errors, right? We can make errors.

00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  but the message will still get through.

00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  You can speak.

00:30:17,986 --> 00:30:21,854
SPEAKER_0:  missing some letters to the information can miss some parts, but the message will.

00:30:22,082 --> 00:30:28,831
SPEAKER_0:  still get through. So that's two thirds of the not used states gives you that robustness and resilience within the system.

00:30:28,831 --> 00:30:35,166
SPEAKER_1:  So at the informatic level there's room for error. There's probably room for error probably in all five

00:30:36,258 --> 00:30:36,926
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:30:37,346 --> 00:30:40,721
SPEAKER_1:  categories we're talking about there's probably room for error in the computation that's probably room

00:30:40,721 --> 00:30:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, there's, yes, exactly. Everywhere there's room for error. Because the informatic capacity is made possible together with the other.

00:30:48,802 --> 00:30:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  And not only that, but also the product yields.

00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:55,678
SPEAKER_0:  function.

00:30:55,906 --> 00:30:56,350
SPEAKER_0:  No.

00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:56,958
SPEAKER_1:  Ehh

00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:57,886
SPEAKER_1:  Baby.

00:30:58,306 --> 00:30:59,710
SPEAKER_0:  In this case, enzyme or protein.

00:31:00,322 --> 00:31:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  Right? So, so...

00:31:02,498 --> 00:31:03,623
SPEAKER_0:  That's really amazing to me.

00:31:03,623 --> 00:31:09,566
SPEAKER_1:  It is, I mean, in my head, just, you know, because I'm a computer science AI person.

00:31:10,146 --> 00:31:13,630
SPEAKER_1:  the parallels between even like language models.

00:31:13,954 --> 00:31:15,646
SPEAKER_1:  that encode language.

00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:20,446
SPEAKER_1:  or now they're able to encode basically any kind of thing, including

00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,622
SPEAKER_1:  images and actions.

00:31:22,946 --> 00:31:24,350
SPEAKER_1:  all in this kind of way.

00:31:24,994 --> 00:31:28,190
SPEAKER_1:  the parallel in terms of informatic and.

00:31:28,738 --> 00:31:30,142
SPEAKER_1:  computation.

00:31:30,914 --> 00:31:32,254
SPEAKER_1:  is just incredible.

00:31:32,354 --> 00:31:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  Actually, I have a...

00:31:34,754 --> 00:31:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  image, maybe I can send you. Can we pull it up now? If you just do genetic codon charts.

00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  We can pull that off. Yeah, it's a very standard table.

00:31:43,906 --> 00:31:46,878
SPEAKER_0:  So I can explain why this is so amazing.

00:31:47,394 --> 00:31:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  So you're looking at, this is life's alphabet, right? And so I also want to make a very quick link now to your first question, the tree of life.

00:31:55,682 --> 00:31:59,966
SPEAKER_0:  When we try to understand ancient.

00:32:00,194 --> 00:32:01,822
SPEAKER_0:  languages, right? Or...

00:32:02,434 --> 00:32:07,422
SPEAKER_0:  the cultures that use these extinct languages.

00:32:07,746 --> 00:32:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  We start with the modern languages, right? So we look at.

00:32:11,522 --> 00:32:12,862
SPEAKER_0:  Indo-European.

00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,926
SPEAKER_0:  languages and try to understand certain words.

00:32:17,314 --> 00:32:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  and make trees.

00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  To understand, you know, this is what Slavic word is for snow.

00:32:24,418 --> 00:32:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  something like snig.

00:32:25,602 --> 00:32:28,227
SPEAKER_1:  Now we jump to languages that humans spoke.

00:32:28,227 --> 00:32:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  Look, exactly. So we make trees.

00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:34,686
SPEAKER_0:  to understand what is the original ancestor, what did they use?

00:32:35,202 --> 00:32:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  to say snow.

00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:40,030
SPEAKER_0:  You have a lot of cultures who use the word snow. You can imagine that.

00:32:40,514 --> 00:32:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  It was snowy.

00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  That's why they needed that word.

00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  It's the same thing for

00:32:45,154 --> 00:32:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  Biology, right? If they have some...

00:32:47,938 --> 00:32:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  If we understand some function about that enzyme.

00:32:50,626 --> 00:32:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  We can.

00:32:51,394 --> 00:32:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  understand the environment that they lived in. It's the similar.

00:32:55,202 --> 00:32:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  It's similar in that sense. So now you're looking at the alphabet.

00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  In this case, it's not 20 or 25 letters.

00:33:02,754 --> 00:33:03,358
SPEAKER_0:  You have.

00:33:03,586 --> 00:33:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  Four letters.

00:33:04,866 --> 00:33:07,838
SPEAKER_0:  So what is really interesting that stands out.

00:33:08,226 --> 00:33:14,366
SPEAKER_0:  me when I look at this. On the outer shell, you're looking at the too many amino acids. That's compost life, right?

00:33:14,818 --> 00:33:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  The one, the methionine.

00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  that you see, that's the start. So the start is always the same.

00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  To me, that is fascinating that all life starts with the same starts. There's no other start code.

00:33:26,914 --> 00:33:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  So you sent the...

00:33:28,322 --> 00:33:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  uh... a g you know a u g to the south that when that information arrives

00:33:34,114 --> 00:33:36,094
SPEAKER_0:  Translation knows, all right, I gotta start.

00:33:36,546 --> 00:33:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  Function is coming.

00:33:38,626 --> 00:33:40,734
SPEAKER_0:  Following this is a chain of information.

00:33:41,026 --> 00:33:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  until the stop.

00:33:42,882 --> 00:33:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  code arrives which are.

00:33:44,418 --> 00:33:46,293
SPEAKER_0:  highlights in black squares.

00:33:46,293 --> 00:33:49,438
SPEAKER_1:  So for people just listening, we're looking at a standard RNA.

00:33:49,698 --> 00:33:51,486
SPEAKER_1:  colored table organizing a wheel.

00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:56,830
SPEAKER_1:  There's an outer shell and there's an inner shell all using the four letters that we're talking about with that.

00:33:57,058 --> 00:33:57,886
SPEAKER_1:  compose.

00:33:58,178 --> 00:34:00,062
SPEAKER_1:  all of the amino acids and there's a start.

00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,598
SPEAKER_1:  And let's just stop.

00:34:01,954 --> 00:34:03,838
SPEAKER_1:  and presumably you put together.

00:34:05,186 --> 00:34:08,830
SPEAKER_1:  the with these letters you walk around the wheel to put together

00:34:09,282 --> 00:34:09,854
SPEAKER_1:  Words.

00:34:09,954 --> 00:34:12,446
SPEAKER_0:  sentences that make- Yeah, the words and sentences and-

00:34:12,866 --> 00:34:19,262
SPEAKER_0:  Again, you get one start, you get three, there are three different ways to stop this. One way to start it.

00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:20,190
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:21,182
SPEAKER_0:  For each.

00:34:21,538 --> 00:34:22,110
SPEAKER_0:  letter

00:34:22,402 --> 00:34:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  You have multiple options. So you say you have a code A.

00:34:26,338 --> 00:34:28,542
SPEAKER_0:  The second code can be another A.

00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  And even if you mess that up...

00:34:30,594 --> 00:34:35,422
SPEAKER_0:  You still can't rescue yourself. So you can get, for instance, I'm looking at the lysine K.

00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  You get an A and you get an A and then you get an A that gives you the lysine.

00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  Right. But if you get an A, and if you get an A and then get a G, you still get the license. So there are different combinations. So even if there's an error, we don't know if these are selected because they were error-ness and somehow they got locked down.

00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:54,366
SPEAKER_0:  We don't know if there is air.

00:34:54,882 --> 00:34:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  mechanism behind this to orbit.

00:34:57,506 --> 00:34:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  We certainly don't know this definitively.

00:35:00,802 --> 00:35:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  This is Informatic.

00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  And notice that the colors.

00:35:05,218 --> 00:35:07,262
SPEAKER_0:  And in some tables too, the colors will be...

00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  coded in a way that the type of the nucleotides can be similar chemically.

00:35:13,186 --> 00:35:17,022
SPEAKER_0:  But the point is that you will still end up with the same.

00:35:17,314 --> 00:35:20,689
SPEAKER_0:  amino acids or something similar to it, even if you mess up the code.

00:35:20,689 --> 00:35:25,182
SPEAKER_1:  Do we understand the mechanism how natural selection interplays with this?

00:35:25,954 --> 00:35:27,230
SPEAKER_1:  Resilience to error.

00:35:28,514 --> 00:35:29,790
SPEAKER_1:  So which errors.

00:35:30,498 --> 00:35:31,710
SPEAKER_1:  Result in the same.

00:35:32,418 --> 00:35:32,990
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

00:35:33,858 --> 00:35:34,718
SPEAKER_1:  output like

00:35:35,138 --> 00:35:36,830
SPEAKER_1:  the same function and which don't.

00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,227
SPEAKER_1:  which actually results in a dysfunction which

00:35:40,227 --> 00:35:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  We understand to some degree the

00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:46,526
SPEAKER_0:  how translation and the rest of the cell work together.

00:35:47,202 --> 00:35:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  have an error at the translation level. This is the really core level can impact.

00:35:52,578 --> 00:35:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  entire self.

00:35:54,114 --> 00:36:00,030
SPEAKER_0:  but we understand very little about the evolutionary mechanisms behind the selection.

00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  of the system.

00:36:01,538 --> 00:36:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  It's.

00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  thought to be one of the hardest problems in biology, and it is still the dark side of biology, even though it is so...

00:36:09,698 --> 00:36:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  essential.

00:36:11,138 --> 00:36:14,078
SPEAKER_0:  So this is, yeah, you're looking at the.

00:36:15,426 --> 00:36:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  language of life, so to speak, and how it can.

00:36:19,202 --> 00:36:21,022
SPEAKER_0:  found ways rather to...

00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:22,846
SPEAKER_0:  tolerates its own.

00:36:23,362 --> 00:36:24,487
SPEAKER_0:  Mistakes.

00:36:24,487 --> 00:36:26,014
SPEAKER_1:  Diaphylogenetic tree.

00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:32,743
SPEAKER_1:  can be deconstructed with this wheel of language.

00:36:32,743 --> 00:36:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  Because all the final letters, that's the 20 amino acids, that's our alphabet.

00:36:39,362 --> 00:36:39,934
SPEAKER_0:  brought.

00:36:40,258 --> 00:36:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  together with these bits of information, right?

00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  So when you look at the genes, you're looking at those four letters. When you look at the proteins, you're looking at the 20 amino acids.

00:36:49,698 --> 00:36:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  which may be a little easier way to track the information when we create.

00:36:54,626 --> 00:36:55,550
SPEAKER_0:  the tree

00:36:56,034 --> 00:36:57,758
SPEAKER_1:  So using this language.

00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:00,958
SPEAKER_1:  can describe all life that's lived on Earth.

00:37:01,826 --> 00:37:02,951
SPEAKER_1:  I wish.

00:37:02,951 --> 00:37:04,254
SPEAKER_0:  perspective.

00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:07,317
SPEAKER_0:  We are not that good at it yet, right?

00:37:07,317 --> 00:37:08,318
SPEAKER_1:  point theory.

00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,294
SPEAKER_1:  This is one way to look at life on earth.

00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  If you're a biologist and you want to understand

00:37:14,722 --> 00:37:19,838
SPEAKER_0:  how life evolved from a molecular perspective, this would be the way.

00:37:20,258 --> 00:37:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  to do it.

00:37:21,218 --> 00:37:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  And this is what nature narrowed its code down to. So maybe think of nitrogen.

00:37:26,882 --> 00:37:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  when we think of carbon, when we think of sulfur.

00:37:29,858 --> 00:37:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  It's all in this.

00:37:32,962 --> 00:37:36,030
SPEAKER_0:  nucleotides are built based on those elements.

00:37:36,642 --> 00:37:39,267
SPEAKER_1:  And this is fundamentally the informatic perspective.

00:37:39,267 --> 00:37:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  Exactly. That's the informatics.

00:37:41,346 --> 00:37:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  perspective and it's important to emphasize that this is not engineered by

00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:46,750
SPEAKER_0:  Humans.

00:37:47,362 --> 00:37:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  this evolved by itself.

00:37:50,082 --> 00:37:55,806
SPEAKER_1:  Like, right, humans didn't invent this just because we were just describing, we're trying to find-

00:37:56,386 --> 00:37:58,462
SPEAKER_1:  trying to describe the language of life.

00:37:58,626 --> 00:38:00,318
SPEAKER_0:  It appears to be...

00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:02,014
SPEAKER_0:  highly optimized.

00:38:02,466 --> 00:38:04,318
SPEAKER_0:  chemical and information code.

00:38:04,834 --> 00:38:09,310
SPEAKER_0:  It may indicate that a great deal of...

00:38:09,666 --> 00:38:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  chemical evolution and...

00:38:12,866 --> 00:38:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  and this may

00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  indicate that a lot of selection pressure and Darwinian evolution happened prior to the rise of last universal common ancestor.

00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:26,523
SPEAKER_0:  because this is almost a bridge that connects the earliest cells to the last universal common ancestor.

00:38:26,523 --> 00:38:30,590
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, can you describe what the heck you just said? So this?

00:38:31,778 --> 00:38:34,110
SPEAKER_1:  mechanism evolved before.

00:38:34,722 --> 00:38:35,230
SPEAKER_1:  The what?

00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:37,365
SPEAKER_1:  common ancestor, the last.

00:38:37,365 --> 00:38:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  universal common sense. When we talk about the tree, when we think about the root, if you...

00:38:42,722 --> 00:38:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  Ideally

00:38:43,682 --> 00:38:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  Ehh

00:38:44,706 --> 00:38:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  included all the living information, all the available information that comes from living organisms.

00:38:51,586 --> 00:38:52,350
SPEAKER_0:  on your tree.

00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  then at the root of your tree lies the last universal common ancestor, Luka.

00:38:57,378 --> 00:38:58,334
SPEAKER_1:  Why last?

00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:00,062
SPEAKER_1:  Last universal.

00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:04,735
SPEAKER_1:  because the earlier universe, it also had trees, but they all died off.

00:39:04,735 --> 00:39:06,814
SPEAKER_0:  We call it the last because it is

00:39:07,362 --> 00:39:09,598
SPEAKER_0:  sort of the first one that we can track.

00:39:10,178 --> 00:39:10,718
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

00:39:11,938 --> 00:39:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  because we cannot.

00:39:13,186 --> 00:39:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  We don't know what we cannot track.

00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:15,934
SPEAKER_0:  Right? One.

00:39:16,226 --> 00:39:17,406
SPEAKER_1:  There's one organism.

00:39:18,242 --> 00:39:19,422
SPEAKER_1:  that started the whole thing.

00:39:19,554 --> 00:39:19,998
SPEAKER_0:  It's-

00:39:20,258 --> 00:39:24,383
SPEAKER_0:  more like a I would think of it as more like a population a group of organisms

00:39:24,383 --> 00:39:27,934
SPEAKER_1:  I tweeted this so I want to know the accuracy of my tweet. Alright.

00:39:28,258 --> 00:39:28,574
SPEAKER_1:  Thank you.

00:39:29,346 --> 00:39:33,470
SPEAKER_1:  Sometimes early in the morning I tweet very pothead like things.

00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:35,518
SPEAKER_1:  I said that.

00:39:35,778 --> 00:39:37,054
SPEAKER_1:  We all evolved.

00:39:37,602 --> 00:39:37,982
SPEAKER_1:  from.

00:39:38,786 --> 00:39:39,294
SPEAKER_1:  one.

00:39:40,418 --> 00:39:44,350
SPEAKER_1:  common ancestor that was a single cell organism.

00:39:44,962 --> 00:39:46,750
SPEAKER_1:  3.5 billion years ago.

00:39:47,106 --> 00:39:48,382
SPEAKER_1:  uh... something like this

00:39:49,378 --> 00:39:49,790
SPEAKER_1:  How?

00:39:50,018 --> 00:39:53,054
SPEAKER_1:  How true is that tweet? Do I need to delete it? No, there's-

00:39:53,474 --> 00:40:00,990
SPEAKER_1:  actually correct. I mean, I think of course there's a lot to say which is like we don't know exactly.

00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:05,918
SPEAKER_1:  But to what degrees the single organism aspect is that true?

00:40:06,306 --> 00:40:10,270
SPEAKER_1:  versus multiple organisms. Do you want me to be?

00:40:10,754 --> 00:40:12,350
SPEAKER_1:  Brutally honest, yes please.

00:40:13,602 --> 00:40:13,918
SPEAKER_1:  this.

00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:14,526
SPEAKER_1:  Ha!

00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  There's still time.

00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:19,285
SPEAKER_1:  This is how we get like caveats.

00:40:19,285 --> 00:40:22,334
SPEAKER_0:  and tweets. All right. So first of all, it's not. It's not.

00:40:22,594 --> 00:40:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  3.5 is still a very conservative estimate. That's the first one. First direction.

00:40:26,978 --> 00:40:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  I would say it's 3.8 is probably...

00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  safer to say at this point. The point just people said...

00:40:33,794 --> 00:40:36,670
SPEAKER_0:  probably wait before that. If you put an approximate, I'll take that.

00:40:36,866 --> 00:40:39,006
SPEAKER_1:  I didn't. I just love the idea.

00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:40,190
SPEAKER_1:  that

00:40:40,482 --> 00:40:41,694
SPEAKER_1:  I was once.

00:40:42,146 --> 00:40:42,750
SPEAKER_1:  First of all...

00:40:43,138 --> 00:40:44,382
SPEAKER_1:  as a single organism.

00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:45,758
SPEAKER_1:  I was once a cell.

00:40:46,242 --> 00:40:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  Well, you're still less.

00:40:47,522 --> 00:40:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  you're a group of cells.

00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:51,070
SPEAKER_1:  No, but I started from a single self.

00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:54,174
SPEAKER_0:  Me, Lex. You mean like you-

00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:57,877
SPEAKER_0:  versus Luca. Are you relating to Luca right now?

00:40:57,877 --> 00:40:58,627
SPEAKER_1:  to my

00:40:58,627 --> 00:40:59,774
SPEAKER_0:  Your own development.

00:40:59,938 --> 00:41:02,366
SPEAKER_1:  my own development I started from a single cell.

00:41:02,658 --> 00:41:06,302
SPEAKER_1:  It's like, it like built up and stuff, okay. That-

00:41:06,626 --> 00:41:08,606
SPEAKER_1:  And then so that's a for single.

00:41:08,962 --> 00:41:12,638
SPEAKER_1:  biological organs and then from an evolutionary perspective, the Luca.

00:41:13,602 --> 00:41:16,254
SPEAKER_1:  I start like my ancestors a single cell.

00:41:16,578 --> 00:41:19,006
SPEAKER_1:  And then here I am sitting half asleep.

00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:19,998
SPEAKER_1:  tweeting.

00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:26,270
SPEAKER_1:  Like I started from a single cell evolved a ton of murder along the way.

00:41:26,594 --> 00:41:28,414
SPEAKER_1:  Delete this...

00:41:29,122 --> 00:41:29,982
SPEAKER_1:  Brutal.

00:41:30,402 --> 00:41:31,358
SPEAKER_1:  uh, search

00:41:31,778 --> 00:41:32,286
SPEAKER_1:  for...

00:41:32,642 --> 00:41:33,662
SPEAKER_1:  adaptation.

00:41:33,986 --> 00:41:36,030
SPEAKER_1:  So it's the 3.5.

00:41:36,386 --> 00:41:37,511
SPEAKER_1:  point eight billion.

00:41:37,511 --> 00:41:44,478
SPEAKER_0:  So you defy the code of Douglas Adams. You are proud of your ancestors and you invite them over to dinner and you invite them over to your Twitter.

00:41:44,578 --> 00:41:47,518
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, and it's amazing that this intelligence.

00:41:47,874 --> 00:41:51,998
SPEAKER_1:  to the degree you can call it intelligence emerged to be able to tweet whatever the heck

00:41:52,258 --> 00:41:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  I want. Yes, it's almost intelligence at the chemical level. And this is also.

00:41:57,282 --> 00:41:59,230
SPEAKER_0:  probably one of the first.

00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:00,830
SPEAKER_0:  chemically intelligent.

00:42:01,314 --> 00:42:03,038
SPEAKER_0:  system that evolved by itself.

00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:04,455
SPEAKER_0:  in nature.

00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:07,486
SPEAKER_1:  So you see that translation is in a fundamental way.

00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:09,886
SPEAKER_1:  intelligent mechanism.

00:42:10,178 --> 00:42:13,310
SPEAKER_0:  in its own way and again, the

00:42:14,082 --> 00:42:17,246
SPEAKER_0:  if we manage to figure out how to drive.

00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:18,814
SPEAKER_0:  of life's evolution.

00:42:19,682 --> 00:42:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  uh... in in it's ken

00:42:21,762 --> 00:42:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  if it can evolve.

00:42:23,138 --> 00:42:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  a sophisticated sort of informatic.

00:42:26,914 --> 00:42:27,550
SPEAKER_0:  um

00:42:28,034 --> 00:42:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  processing system like this.

00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  you may ask yourself what might chemical systems...

00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  be capable of.

00:42:36,002 --> 00:42:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  independently doing.

00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  100.

00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,222
SPEAKER_0:  different circumstances.

00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:46,782
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so like locally, they're intelligent locally. They don't need the rest of the shebang. Like they don't need the big.

00:42:46,914 --> 00:42:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  They need so that that's.

00:42:49,346 --> 00:42:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  That's a great.

00:42:50,498 --> 00:42:52,734
SPEAKER_0:  segue into what makes this biological.

00:42:53,058 --> 00:42:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  The heart of the cellular activities are translation. You kill translation, you kill the cell.

00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:02,558
SPEAKER_0:  Yes. The transition itself, you kill.

00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:03,486
SPEAKER_0:  Ehh...

00:43:04,194 --> 00:43:09,918
SPEAKER_0:  component that initiates it, you kill the cell. You kill, you remove the component that elongates it, you kill the cell.

00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:15,678
SPEAKER_0:  So there are many different ways to disrupt this machinery. All the parts are important.

00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:27,070
SPEAKER_0:  Now, it can vary across different organisms. We see variation between bacteria versus eukaryotes versus archaea, right? So it is not the same exact steps, but...

00:43:28,194 --> 00:43:29,502
SPEAKER_0:  it can get more crowded.

00:43:29,922 --> 00:43:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  as we get closer to eukaryotes, for instance.

00:43:32,802 --> 00:43:40,190
SPEAKER_0:  but you are still computing about 20 amino acids per second. This is what you're generating every second.

00:43:40,834 --> 00:43:43,006
SPEAKER_1:  that single machinery is doing 20 a second.

00:43:43,106 --> 00:43:47,390
SPEAKER_0:  21 for bacteria, I believe 8 for eukaryotes or 9.

00:43:47,618 --> 00:43:48,894
SPEAKER_1:  21 a second.

00:43:49,186 --> 00:43:52,798
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, that's super inefficient or super efficient depending on how you think about it.

00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:55,605
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's great.

00:43:55,605 --> 00:43:57,310
SPEAKER_1:  I bet it's way slower than a computer.

00:43:58,338 --> 00:43:59,006
SPEAKER_1:  could generate.

00:43:59,234 --> 00:44:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  Is there simulation? I think-

00:44:01,442 --> 00:44:04,574
SPEAKER_0:  If you can show me a computer that does this, we are done here.

00:44:04,674 --> 00:44:07,966
SPEAKER_1:  Well, this is the big, this includes the five things.

00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:11,518
SPEAKER_1:  Not just, but I could show you a computer that's doing the informatic.

00:44:12,226 --> 00:44:12,542
SPEAKER_1:  Right?

00:44:12,642 --> 00:44:16,446
SPEAKER_0:  I guess you can show me that, but you cannot show me the one that has all.

00:44:16,706 --> 00:44:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  For now.

00:44:17,858 --> 00:44:22,142
SPEAKER_1:  For now. I will ask you about probably what, alfa-fold right?

00:44:22,434 --> 00:44:37,566
SPEAKER_0:  I think the more we learn about, and this is why early life and origin is also very fascinating and applicable to many different disciplines. There is no way you see this the way we just described it, unless you think about early life and origin.

00:44:38,018 --> 00:44:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  Early Geochemistry.

00:44:39,618 --> 00:44:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  and earliest emergent systems.

00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  but going.

00:44:44,354 --> 00:44:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  going back to.

00:44:46,114 --> 00:44:47,582
SPEAKER_0:  the biological component.

00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:44:49,026 --> 00:44:49,950
SPEAKER_0:  All of these.

00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:52,254
SPEAKER_0:  attributes that we think about.

00:44:52,514 --> 00:44:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  Life.

00:44:53,602 --> 00:44:56,350
SPEAKER_0:  or that we associate with biology, stems.

00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:59,934
SPEAKER_0:  from translation and as well as metabolism.

00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:06,558
SPEAKER_0:  I see metabolism as a way to keep translation going and translation keeps metabolism going.

00:45:08,194 --> 00:45:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  Translation is arguably a bit more sophisticated process for the reasons that

00:45:12,482 --> 00:45:14,183
SPEAKER_0:  I just described.

00:45:14,183 --> 00:45:17,374
SPEAKER_1:  So metabolism is a source of energy for this translation process.

00:45:17,634 --> 00:45:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  It's a way to process materials and it is inherently dynamic.

00:45:23,522 --> 00:45:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  And it is flexible, but it is not focused on repetition as translation does. So that's the main difference. Translation is the kind of in a way just it's repeats, right? So.

00:45:34,722 --> 00:45:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  You have the metabolism that can synthesize materials.

00:45:37,954 --> 00:45:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  it creates or benefits from available energy.

00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:43,422
SPEAKER_0:  And again, it's a dynamic system.

00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:46,526
SPEAKER_0:  And then you have competition that it's.

00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  that is inherently repetitive, right, needs to carry out repetitive processes.

00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:52,510
SPEAKER_0:  uh... it and it

00:45:52,802 --> 00:45:57,182
SPEAKER_0:  does the tasks and it implements an algorithm, but it is not dynamic.

00:45:57,602 --> 00:46:02,718
SPEAKER_0:  So you see both of those attributes in translation combined. It is repetitive.

00:46:03,106 --> 00:46:04,158
SPEAKER_0:  And it is dynamic.

00:46:04,482 --> 00:46:09,822
SPEAKER_0:  and it also processes this information. So they are fundamentally different.

00:46:10,274 --> 00:46:12,606
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know if you can get...

00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  life if you don't find a way to process the information around you.

00:46:19,202 --> 00:46:20,830
SPEAKER_1:  in a repetitive dynamic way.

00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, and somehow that's what's got.

00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  um, selected, maybe not selected. I don't know if it was.

00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  accidental, but that's what it seems to be.

00:46:31,106 --> 00:46:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  conserved for four billion years, that that's what life.

00:46:34,498 --> 00:46:35,623
SPEAKER_0:  established.

00:46:35,623 --> 00:46:40,254
SPEAKER_1:  What's the connection between translation and the self replication which seems to be a

00:46:40,866 --> 00:46:43,710
SPEAKER_1:  another weird thing that life just started doing.

00:46:44,162 --> 00:46:45,287
SPEAKER_1:  wanting to just replicate.

00:46:45,287 --> 00:46:51,998
SPEAKER_0:  I think when we truly understand the answer to that question, we may have just made ourselves life, right? Something we know quite.

00:46:52,482 --> 00:46:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  How?

00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:55,230
SPEAKER_0:  Translation machinery as a whole.

00:46:55,522 --> 00:46:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  fits into equation.

00:46:57,602 --> 00:46:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  So we try to understand.

00:47:00,034 --> 00:47:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:47:00,674 --> 00:47:01,502
SPEAKER_0:  Ribosomes.

00:47:01,922 --> 00:47:05,726
SPEAKER_0:  RNA, how the linear information is processed.

00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:47:06,914 --> 00:47:07,262
SPEAKER_0:

00:47:08,162 --> 00:47:13,822
SPEAKER_0:  Or the genetic code, why this codon's not others, why 20 not more, not less.

00:47:14,242 --> 00:47:19,070
SPEAKER_0:  And we are sort of moving towards transition. That's what we're working on anyway.

00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  to finally look at the patterns in which the system.

00:47:23,842 --> 00:47:24,862
SPEAKER_0:  operates itself.

00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:29,918
SPEAKER_0:  And if you understand that, you're really unlocking a very emergent behavior.

00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:32,990
SPEAKER_1:  I, one of the things you didn't mention is.

00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:34,110
SPEAKER_1:  physical.

00:47:34,594 --> 00:47:37,214
SPEAKER_1:  Is there something to mention about that component that's interesting?

00:47:37,378 --> 00:47:38,590
SPEAKER_0:  There's actually a paper.

00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  published in 2013, I want to say the first author is Zirnoff.

00:47:44,354 --> 00:47:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  So they

00:47:46,498 --> 00:47:47,358
SPEAKER_0:  Surveys.

00:47:49,314 --> 00:47:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  a computational.

00:47:52,258 --> 00:47:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  engineered, systems level.

00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:56,606
SPEAKER_0:  computation, energy consumption.

00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, and they-

00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:00,958
SPEAKER_0:  Try to understand whether the universe

00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  is using its own or life is using its full capacity of energy consumption.

00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  and whether if different planets in the universe had life, would the capacity would increase or decrease? Does life operate at its energy maximum?

00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:18,366
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

00:48:18,978 --> 00:48:21,950
SPEAKER_0:  And they think that it does, that it actually.

00:48:22,178 --> 00:48:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  operates at an efficiency that is far more

00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:26,965
SPEAKER_0:  above and beyond any computational.

00:48:26,965 --> 00:48:29,182
SPEAKER_1:  How is that possible to determine at all?

00:48:29,442 --> 00:48:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  That you tell me. That's why I dropped the citation. I found the citation. It's quite an interesting paper.

00:48:37,442 --> 00:48:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  Hey

00:48:38,178 --> 00:48:38,814
SPEAKER_0:  And it's a.

00:48:39,202 --> 00:48:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  Obviously, you can only calculate an infer these things.

00:48:42,178 --> 00:48:43,303
SPEAKER_0:  uh... but uh...

00:48:43,303 --> 00:48:44,286
SPEAKER_1:  Good question to ask.

00:48:44,738 --> 00:48:45,982
SPEAKER_1:  is dull life.

00:48:46,594 --> 00:48:50,590
SPEAKER_1:  that we see here on earth and life elsewhere in the universe? Is it using

00:48:51,234 --> 00:48:52,446
SPEAKER_1:  the energy.

00:48:52,802 --> 00:48:54,238
SPEAKER_1:  Most efficiently. Yeah.

00:48:54,754 --> 00:48:59,870
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it seems to be very efficient again if we compare to computers. It seems to be incredibly

00:49:00,386 --> 00:49:01,511
SPEAKER_1:  Efficient

00:49:01,511 --> 00:49:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  I think they look at the theoretical optimum for electronic devices and then try to understand where life falls on this and life is...

00:49:10,786 --> 00:49:11,902
SPEAKER_0:  certainly more efficient.

00:49:12,034 --> 00:49:15,678
SPEAKER_1:  And that's ultimately the physical side. How well are you using for this entire mechanism?

00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:17,598
SPEAKER_1:  the energy available to you.

00:49:18,498 --> 00:49:20,510
SPEAKER_1:  And so given.

00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:25,150
SPEAKER_1:  given all the resilience to errors and all that kind of stuff, it seems that it's close to its maximum.

00:49:26,082 --> 00:49:29,118
SPEAKER_1:  And this paper aside, it does seem.

00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:31,806
SPEAKER_1:  the life obviously that's the constraint

00:49:32,354 --> 00:49:34,654
SPEAKER_1:  we have on earth, right, is the amount of energy.

00:49:35,938 --> 00:49:38,174
SPEAKER_1:  So that's one way to define life.

00:49:40,706 --> 00:49:42,526
SPEAKER_1:  The input is energy.

00:49:43,042 --> 00:49:44,990
SPEAKER_1:  And the output is what? I don't know.

00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:47,230
SPEAKER_1:  self-replicating.

00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:53,182
SPEAKER_1:  Wait, okay, let's go there. How do you personally define life? Do you have a-

00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:55,070
SPEAKER_1:  Do you have a favorite definition?

00:49:55,362 --> 00:49:56,990
SPEAKER_1:  You try to sneak up on?

00:49:57,986 --> 00:49:58,462
SPEAKER_1:  Um,

00:49:58,818 --> 00:50:00,222
SPEAKER_1:  Is it possible?

00:50:00,514 --> 00:50:01,662
SPEAKER_1:  I define life.

00:50:02,274 --> 00:50:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know. It depends on what you are defining it for. If you're defining it for...

00:50:07,362 --> 00:50:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  finding different life forms, then it probably needs to have some quantification.

00:50:12,226 --> 00:50:14,334
SPEAKER_0:  in it so that you can.

00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:19,047
SPEAKER_0:  use it in whatever the mission that you're operating.

00:50:19,047 --> 00:50:21,150
SPEAKER_1:  You mean like it's not binary, it's uh...

00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:23,454
SPEAKER_1:  This is like a seven out of ten.

00:50:24,386 --> 00:50:25,511
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, uh, uh, no.

00:50:25,511 --> 00:50:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know. I don't think that-

00:50:30,338 --> 00:50:34,110
SPEAKER_0:  defining is that essential? I think it's a good exercise.

00:50:34,946 --> 00:50:37,342
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not sure if we need to.

00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:38,590
SPEAKER_0:  Agree.

00:50:39,074 --> 00:50:42,526
SPEAKER_0:  a universally defined way of understanding life.

00:50:42,946 --> 00:50:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  Because the definition itself seems to be ever evolving anyway, right? We have the NASA's definition. It's, it's, it's.

00:50:50,018 --> 00:50:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  It has its

00:50:51,746 --> 00:50:54,622
SPEAKER_0:  minuses and pluses, but it seems to be doing its job.

00:50:55,106 --> 00:50:57,566
SPEAKER_1:  But what are the different if there is a line?

00:50:57,890 --> 00:50:58,398
SPEAKER_1:  and it's.

00:50:58,818 --> 00:51:01,374
SPEAKER_1:  impossible or unproductive to define that line.

00:51:01,762 --> 00:51:03,806
SPEAKER_1:  Nevertheless, we know it when we see it.

00:51:05,442 --> 00:51:06,622
SPEAKER_1:  is one definition.

00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:08,510
SPEAKER_1:  that the Supreme Court likes.

00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:10,174
SPEAKER_1:  And that's it.

00:51:11,138 --> 00:51:12,894
SPEAKER_1:  kind of an important thing to...

00:51:13,986 --> 00:51:17,758
SPEAKER_1:  to think about when we look at life on other planets.

00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:19,230
SPEAKER_1:  So...

00:51:20,034 --> 00:51:20,542
SPEAKER_1:  How do we?

00:51:21,794 --> 00:51:25,278
SPEAKER_1:  to identify if a thing is living when we go to Mars when we go to

00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:26,398
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:51:26,754 --> 00:51:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  the different moons.

00:51:28,514 --> 00:51:32,030
SPEAKER_1:  in our solar system, we would go outside our solar system to look for life.

00:51:32,258 --> 00:51:34,814
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. On other planets. It's unlikely to be a-

00:51:35,042 --> 00:51:43,070
SPEAKER_0:  sort of smoking gun event, right? It's not going to be, hey, I found this. You don't think so? I don't think so, unless you find an elephant on.

00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  some exoplanet, then I can say, yeah, there's life here.

00:51:46,306 --> 00:51:47,966
SPEAKER_1:  No, but is there a dynamic?

00:51:48,386 --> 00:51:49,566
SPEAKER_1:  Nature did the thing.

00:51:49,954 --> 00:51:50,462
SPEAKER_1:  Like, uh...

00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:51,710
SPEAKER_1:  It moves.

00:51:52,418 --> 00:51:53,438
SPEAKER_1:  It has...

00:51:53,858 --> 00:51:54,814
SPEAKER_1:  A membrane that

00:51:55,138 --> 00:51:57,310
SPEAKER_1:  looks like there's stuff inside.

00:51:57,634 --> 00:52:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  It doesn't make no move, right? I mean, like look at plants.

00:52:00,514 --> 00:52:03,166
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, they grow, but there are plants that are.

00:52:03,586 --> 00:52:04,958
SPEAKER_0:  can be also pretty dormant.

00:52:05,506 --> 00:52:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  Arguably there.

00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  They do everything that is one of my...

00:52:10,882 --> 00:52:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  favorite professors once said that the plant does everything that a giraffe does without moving.

00:52:15,842 --> 00:52:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  So movement is not necessarily.

00:52:19,266 --> 00:52:23,614
SPEAKER_1:  But on a certain time scale, the plant does move. It just moves slower.

00:52:24,162 --> 00:52:30,558
SPEAKER_0:  Yes. It moves pretty quickly. I would say that. It's hard to quantify this or even measure it, but it is a.

00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  Life is definitely...

00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  So...

00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  chemistry finding solutions, right? So it is chemistry exploring itself.

00:52:41,474 --> 00:52:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  and maintaining this exploration for billions of years.

00:52:45,026 --> 00:52:46,302
SPEAKER_1:  So, okay, so a planet.

00:52:47,362 --> 00:52:48,766
SPEAKER_1:  is a bunch of chemistry.

00:52:49,506 --> 00:52:51,518
SPEAKER_1:  And then you run it and say, all right.

00:52:52,546 --> 00:52:54,078
SPEAKER_1:  figure out what...

00:52:54,626 --> 00:52:57,662
SPEAKER_1:  what cool stuff you can come up with. that's essentially what life is.

00:52:58,178 --> 00:53:00,803
SPEAKER_1:  Given a chemistry, what is the cool stuff I can come up?

00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:04,158
SPEAKER_0:  If that chemistry or the solutions that it's...

00:53:05,122 --> 00:53:06,014
SPEAKER_0:  embarks upon.

00:53:06,562 --> 00:53:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  are maintained in a form of memory.

00:53:10,018 --> 00:53:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  Right. So you don't just need to have the...

00:53:13,826 --> 00:53:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  exploring chemical space, but you need to also maintain a memory of some of those.

00:53:20,098 --> 00:53:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  solutions for over.

00:53:22,178 --> 00:53:23,262
SPEAKER_0:  long periods of time.

00:53:23,906 --> 00:53:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  So that's.

00:53:24,866 --> 00:53:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  the memory components.

00:53:27,586 --> 00:53:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  makes it more living to me.

00:53:29,538 --> 00:53:32,190
SPEAKER_0:  Because chemistry can always sample, right?

00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:33,534
SPEAKER_0:  Chemistry is chemistry.

00:53:34,018 --> 00:53:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  but are you just constantly sampling or are you building on?

00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  your former solutions and then maintaining a memory of those solutions over billions of years or at least that's what happened here.

00:53:45,698 --> 00:53:48,862
SPEAKER_1:  how much you can't build life if it's always living in the moment

00:53:49,506 --> 00:53:51,390
SPEAKER_1:  the physicist will be very upset with you.

00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:52,606
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:54,942
SPEAKER_1:  So memory could be.

00:53:55,842 --> 00:53:56,967
SPEAKER_1:  fundamental.

00:53:56,967 --> 00:54:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, life is obviously chemistry and physics.

00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:03,678
SPEAKER_0:  leading to...

00:54:04,354 --> 00:54:06,846
SPEAKER_0:  So this is not a disciplinary.

00:54:07,522 --> 00:54:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  problem of one discipline.

00:54:09,794 --> 00:54:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  trying playing other disciplines. But what you need to have is definitely, chemistry is everywhere, right?

00:54:17,346 --> 00:54:18,366
SPEAKER_0:  Tent a thing you can be a c-

00:54:18,658 --> 00:54:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  chemists, you can study chemistry, you can study physics, you can study geology anywhere in the universe, but this is the only place you can study biology.

00:54:26,338 --> 00:54:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  This is the only place to be a biologist. This poor guy.

00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  That's it.

00:54:29,346 --> 00:54:38,014
SPEAKER_0:  So definitely something very fundamental happened here and you cannot take biology out of the equation if you want to understand how that vast chemistry space.

00:54:38,466 --> 00:54:39,678
SPEAKER_0:  of that general.

00:54:40,514 --> 00:54:41,598
SPEAKER_0:  sequence space.

00:54:41,922 --> 00:54:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  got narrowed down to what is available.

00:54:45,698 --> 00:54:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  or what is used by life.

00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:52,593
SPEAKER_0:  you need to understand the rules of selection. And that's when evolution and biology come.

00:54:52,593 --> 00:54:57,470
SPEAKER_1:  So the rules of natural selection operate to you on the level of biology?

00:54:58,786 --> 00:55:06,942
SPEAKER_0:  Rules, I don't know if there are any rules like that. It would be fascinating to find in terms of the biology's rules. They're onlyinaudible.

00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  very interesting and

00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:55:09,986 --> 00:55:14,302
SPEAKER_0:  It's a very fascinating area of study now, and probably we will hear more about that.

00:55:14,882 --> 00:55:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  decades to come. A��

00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  if you wanna go from the broad to specific.

00:55:19,938 --> 00:55:25,086
SPEAKER_0:  you need to understand the rules of selection. And that is going to come from understanding biology, yes.

00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:27,550
SPEAKER_1:  Well, actually, let me ask you about...

00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:32,286
SPEAKER_1:  selection you have a paper on evolutionary stalling.

00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:35,806
SPEAKER_1:  where you describe that evolution is not good at multitasking.

00:55:36,482 --> 00:55:39,294
SPEAKER_1:  or like in populations that have.

00:55:39,842 --> 00:55:40,926
SPEAKER_1:  evolve quickly.

00:55:41,154 --> 00:55:45,822
SPEAKER_1:  It's a very specific thing, but there could be a generalizable fundamental thing to this.

00:55:46,402 --> 00:55:50,686
SPEAKER_1:  that evolution is not able to improve multiple modules simultaneously.

00:55:51,394 --> 00:55:53,182
SPEAKER_1:  I guess the question is...

00:55:53,538 --> 00:55:55,806
SPEAKER_1:  What part of the organism does evolution...

00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:58,462
SPEAKER_1:  quote unquote focus on to improve.

00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:00,542
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, that was the driving question.

00:56:00,898 --> 00:56:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  We meddled with...

00:56:03,202 --> 00:56:06,078
SPEAKER_0:  the part where you shouldn't be messing up with translation.

00:56:06,594 --> 00:56:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  This is the... Should or should not.

00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:13,773
SPEAKER_0:  You shouldn't. As I said, there are many ways to break it and all life needs it. And there are some, oh, there's just so many ways

00:56:13,773 --> 00:56:18,206
SPEAKER_1:  One of your favorite things to do is to break life, see what happens.

00:56:19,234 --> 00:56:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  It's yeah, because that's how kids learn. Right. So you have to break something and see how it's.

00:56:25,538 --> 00:56:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  Then you do it over and over again to see if it will...

00:56:27,618 --> 00:56:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  fix itself in the same ways.

00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  So that's our, I don't know, it's the most fundamental properties of our.

00:56:33,826 --> 00:56:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  ourselves as human beings.

00:56:35,586 --> 00:56:40,461
SPEAKER_0:  So if we shouldn't break translation, then we should try to break it to see how it will repair. So let's try to break it to see how it will repair.

00:56:40,461 --> 00:56:40,894
SPEAKER_1:  break.

00:56:41,218 --> 00:56:42,654
SPEAKER_0:  I broke elongation.

00:56:43,074 --> 00:56:46,206
SPEAKER_1:  So what's the role of elongation in this process?

00:56:46,626 --> 00:56:57,694
SPEAKER_0:  So we have four steps of the transitions, initiate, elongate. So elongate the chain of the information chain that you're now creating, the peptide chain.

00:56:58,082 --> 00:57:00,958
SPEAKER_0:  or let's say broadly polymer chain.

00:57:01,442 --> 00:57:07,774
SPEAKER_0:  And there's the termination step and there's the recycling. So all of these steps are.

00:57:08,226 --> 00:57:11,102
SPEAKER_0:  carried out by proteins that are also named after these steps.

00:57:11,682 --> 00:57:12,478
SPEAKER_0:  initiation.

00:57:12,834 --> 00:57:17,342
SPEAKER_0:  is the initiation factor protein, elongation is the elongator protein.

00:57:17,826 --> 00:57:19,966
SPEAKER_0:  Um, we, um,

00:57:21,026 --> 00:57:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  broke.

00:57:21,698 --> 00:57:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  elongation.

00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  So the cell, the starting codon could still arrive to where it's supposed to be.

00:57:28,514 --> 00:57:28,926
SPEAKER_0:  Go.

00:57:29,314 --> 00:57:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  But the-

00:57:30,786 --> 00:57:31,422
SPEAKER_0:  following.

00:57:31,874 --> 00:57:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  information.

00:57:33,122 --> 00:57:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  couldn't get carried out because we

00:57:35,138 --> 00:57:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  replaced elongation.

00:57:36,834 --> 00:57:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  with its own ancestral version. So we inserted.

00:57:41,442 --> 00:57:42,238
SPEAKER_0:  roughly.

00:57:43,074 --> 00:57:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  700 million year old.

00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  elongation factor protein.

00:57:48,482 --> 00:57:49,086
SPEAKER_0:  of turk.

00:57:49,634 --> 00:57:50,526
SPEAKER_0:  removing.

00:57:50,946 --> 00:57:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  Dude.

00:57:52,098 --> 00:57:55,166
SPEAKER_0:  modern gene. So we made this ancient modern.

00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  hybrid.

00:57:56,834 --> 00:57:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  organism.

00:57:57,666 --> 00:58:01,726
SPEAKER_1:  And that essentially creates in some way the ancient version of that organism.

00:58:02,754 --> 00:58:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  I wouldn't say so. It's a hybrid organism. It's not necessary because the rest of the cell, the rest of the...

00:58:11,266 --> 00:58:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:58:12,226 --> 00:58:13,278
SPEAKER_0:  genome is still.

00:58:13,506 --> 00:58:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  Modern.

00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  And that goes back to the difference between Jurassic Park.

00:58:17,442 --> 00:58:21,182
SPEAKER_0:  There are many differences, obviously, given that this is not fiction, we're doing it.

00:58:21,506 --> 00:58:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  but also we are not necessarily, I think in Jurassic Park they are taking

00:58:27,074 --> 00:58:27,454
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:58:27,682 --> 00:58:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  ancient or they find an ancient organism and then put in modern gene inside the ancient organism. In our case we are still working with what we got.

00:58:35,938 --> 00:58:38,563
SPEAKER_0:  putting an ancestral DNA inside the modern organism.

00:58:38,563 --> 00:58:41,854
SPEAKER_1:  So you're like taking a new car and putting an old engine into it.

00:58:42,626 --> 00:58:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  In a way, yeah.

00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:44,711
SPEAKER_1:  Yes. In the magician's shop.

00:58:44,711 --> 00:58:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, but in our case, it's more like a transformer than just a regular car.

00:58:50,242 --> 00:58:51,367
SPEAKER_0:  doing things.

00:58:51,367 --> 00:58:55,486
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so it's a more complicated organism than just a car. Yeah.

00:58:56,098 --> 00:58:59,838
SPEAKER_1:  I got it. So what does that teach you?

00:59:00,834 --> 00:59:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  We wanted to understand multiple things. One is how does the cell respond to perturbation?

00:59:07,106 --> 00:59:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  And we didn't just put the ancient DNA, we inserted, we sampled DNA from currently existing organisms, so the cousins of this microbe.

00:59:16,674 --> 00:59:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:59:18,018 --> 00:59:20,510
SPEAKER_0:  collected DNA sequences from the cousins as well.

00:59:21,026 --> 00:59:22,846
SPEAKER_0:  So both ancestor and the...

00:59:23,074 --> 00:59:23,902
SPEAKER_0:  current cousin.

00:59:24,162 --> 00:59:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  DNA, so to speak.

00:59:25,698 --> 00:59:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  and engineered all of these things to the modern bacteria and generated a collection.

00:59:31,202 --> 00:59:32,062
SPEAKER_0:  of microbes.

00:59:32,290 --> 00:59:34,270
SPEAKER_0:  that either have the ancient

00:59:34,562 --> 00:59:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  component or the variant.

00:59:37,058 --> 00:59:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  elongator component that

00:59:39,202 --> 00:59:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  STILL

00:59:40,098 --> 00:59:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  alive today, but...

00:59:41,826 --> 00:59:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  coming from a different part of the tree.

00:59:44,002 --> 00:59:45,854
SPEAKER_1:  So you broke elongation.

00:59:47,074 --> 00:59:51,934
SPEAKER_1:  Was that something you did as part of the paper on evolutionary stalling to try to figure out?

00:59:53,058 --> 00:59:55,518
SPEAKER_1:  how evolution figures out what to try to improve.

00:59:55,906 --> 00:59:56,542
SPEAKER_1:  Did that help?

00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:59,102
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, because we were not supposed to.

00:59:59,778 --> 01:00:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  Messed with the translation. That's exactly what we did.

01:00:02,914 --> 01:00:03,582
SPEAKER_0:  and we.

01:00:04,226 --> 01:00:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  altered.

01:00:05,218 --> 01:00:06,686
SPEAKER_0:  Elongation. My mind's at your service.

01:00:06,914 --> 01:00:07,646
SPEAKER_0:  changing it with

01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:11,262
SPEAKER_0:  different versions of elongation that are either coming from...

01:00:12,002 --> 01:00:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  species.

01:00:13,154 --> 01:00:13,694
SPEAKER_0:

01:00:14,082 --> 01:00:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  still are around today.

01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  You can imagine them as sitting on the tips of the tree.

01:00:19,266 --> 01:00:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  near.

01:00:20,162 --> 01:00:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  branch for our branch.

01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  compared to the organism that we're working with.

01:00:25,346 --> 01:00:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  Cousins, distant cousins.

01:00:28,482 --> 01:00:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  as well as the ancestors of the bacteria that we are now modifying.

01:00:33,314 --> 01:00:39,038
SPEAKER_1:  How much different variation is there in that elongation step? Like what are the different flavors of elongation?

01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  That's a very good question. So-

01:00:41,122 --> 01:00:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  mechanistically or mechanically, it's the same. It's very conserved. So all life elongates the same way. You are, it's nothing but a shuttle. You just carry.

01:00:51,298 --> 01:00:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  and...

01:00:52,834 --> 01:00:53,662
SPEAKER_0:  Chemical with you.

01:00:54,498 --> 01:00:55,166
SPEAKER_0:  the bits.

01:00:55,682 --> 01:00:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  too.

01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  the heart of the machine.

01:00:58,242 --> 01:01:00,734
SPEAKER_1:  Is it essentially doing like a copy paste operation?

01:01:01,026 --> 01:01:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  It has its tail.

01:01:02,434 --> 01:01:03,582
SPEAKER_0:  that's attached to...

01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:04,190
SPEAKER_0:  thing.

01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:05,758
SPEAKER_0:  code.

01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  which is then carried biochemically to the...

01:01:10,594 --> 01:01:12,894
SPEAKER_0:  linear chain to the core of ribosome.

01:01:13,282 --> 01:01:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  and it sits on there.

01:01:15,586 --> 01:01:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  It's released in the peptides.

01:01:17,218 --> 01:01:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  Click.

01:01:17,858 --> 01:01:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  the codes rather click.

01:01:20,642 --> 01:01:21,438
SPEAKER_0:  once that.

01:01:21,666 --> 01:01:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  chemistry that is at the tail end, occurs the protein.

01:01:25,058 --> 01:01:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  LEAVES DAY.

01:01:26,626 --> 01:01:27,198
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  So you can imagine it's like it hops in there and hops out. And when it hops in up south, it leaves the information behind.

01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  That's all it does is bring the information, get out of there.

01:01:37,762 --> 01:01:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  and it's all triggered by biophysics, biochemistry.

01:01:41,826 --> 01:01:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  Because of the way the enzyme choose energy in this case gtp how the fast for leaves the center that kicks that gives the.

01:01:50,402 --> 01:01:51,358
SPEAKER_0:  additional kick.

01:01:51,842 --> 01:01:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  to the enzyme to leave.

01:01:54,434 --> 01:01:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  the center.

01:01:55,298 --> 01:01:58,997
SPEAKER_1:  to which parts are different then? where's the flavors of different flavors?

01:01:58,997 --> 01:01:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  Go to K, not reeve Pepp excessive Especially in drips Eh這是該有伎倉 Have got cash Erm eh That brings out my

01:01:59,906 --> 01:02:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  usually the parts that matter don't change over time.

01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:08,894
SPEAKER_0:  Nature conserves the sites of these proteins that are important for its job.

01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  if there's a difference than V

01:02:12,226 --> 01:02:15,582
SPEAKER_0:  we wanna know, especially if there's a difference between.

01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  cousins.

01:02:17,026 --> 01:02:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:02:17,762 --> 01:02:22,302
SPEAKER_0:  We look at the sites that interact with the most important.

01:02:22,914 --> 01:02:24,446
SPEAKER_0:  parts of this machinery.

01:02:24,706 --> 01:02:31,166
SPEAKER_0:  If we see any difference, we tend to mutate or we revert, we engineer that part, we alter that part because it gives us the clue that...

01:02:31,394 --> 01:02:33,534
SPEAKER_0:  there must be something interesting going on here or not.

01:02:33,986 --> 01:02:38,238
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so that's not the fundamental part of the machinery, but it's some.

01:02:38,754 --> 01:02:40,629
SPEAKER_1:  flavorful characteristic that you can play with.

01:02:40,629 --> 01:02:45,790
SPEAKER_0:  So now you stripped the machinery down to its parts and now you're looking at the parts of the parts.

01:02:46,146 --> 01:02:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  And it depends where you're looking and how you're looking and what you're looking at.

01:02:52,162 --> 01:02:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  but usually we see.

01:02:54,434 --> 01:02:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  up to 70% level.

01:02:56,994 --> 01:02:59,294
SPEAKER_0:  conserved identity across all.

01:02:59,682 --> 01:03:00,254
SPEAKER_0:  Modern.

01:03:00,706 --> 01:03:01,790
SPEAKER_0:  versions.

01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:05,758
SPEAKER_0:  when you travel back in time, identity decreases.

01:03:06,178 --> 01:03:13,374
SPEAKER_0:  elongation likely existed. We have good reason to think that it existed at the dawn of life. So you're looking at a 3.8 billion year old.

01:03:14,018 --> 01:03:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  mechanism.

01:03:15,426 --> 01:03:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:03:16,226 --> 01:03:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  And when we look at the ancestors that we resurrect, we see about 40% identity. So the identity definitely decreases.

01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  as you go back in time, but still 60%.

01:03:26,978 --> 01:03:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  Shared information over 4 billion years.

01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:30,695
SPEAKER_0:  It's pretty good.

01:03:30,695 --> 01:03:32,945
SPEAKER_1:  is that just for elongation for the entire translation.

01:03:32,945 --> 01:03:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  depends on what you do.

01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  So for initiation, we've also recently published this. It's a different story.

01:03:40,002 --> 01:03:40,478
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, but.

01:03:40,738 --> 01:03:44,254
SPEAKER_0:  Overall, you see high level of identity.

01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  that is kept intact, especially if the component is essential for life. Okay, so...

01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:57,054
SPEAKER_1:  40% and 60, 70% he said, but like from generation to generation, how does evolution?

01:03:57,538 --> 01:04:01,630
SPEAKER_1:  and presumably that's what that paper is looking at is the parts of the parts the

01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:03,262
SPEAKER_1:  Haru-zu

01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:04,734
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhh...

01:04:05,026 --> 01:04:10,142
SPEAKER_1:  able to say like mess with the parts and try to come up with a cooler improved.

01:04:10,882 --> 01:04:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  version of the organism. Yeah, so let me describe to you what we did in that experiment. We took.

01:04:15,586 --> 01:04:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  different, we took bacteria, we...

01:04:17,986 --> 01:04:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  the elongation in all of these with different variants. So we had an initial set of

01:04:23,394 --> 01:04:23,806
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:04:24,386 --> 01:04:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  group.

01:04:25,602 --> 01:04:26,686
SPEAKER_0:  bacteria that we had.

01:04:27,106 --> 01:04:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  We then subjected these bacteria to evolution in the lab.

01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  All right, so we.

01:04:31,906 --> 01:04:35,710
SPEAKER_0:  First of all, we knew we broke it because upon engineering we measured.

01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:41,662
SPEAKER_0:  What's going on with the cell? It's not growing as well. They're not healthy. We can see it with our eyes. We can measure it.

01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  that if they were generating an offspring every 20 minutes, now it is 40 minutes. So we really messed them up. They don't wanna-

01:04:48,962 --> 01:04:49,278
SPEAKER_0:  work.

01:04:49,538 --> 01:04:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  with this thing day.

01:04:50,722 --> 01:04:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  don't want each other, but they need each other. So we created that situation for them.

01:04:55,362 --> 01:04:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  which is.

01:04:56,290 --> 01:04:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  good because we want...

01:04:57,890 --> 01:05:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  to see how we wanted to see how they will.

01:05:01,954 --> 01:05:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  cooperate with each other.

01:05:04,226 --> 01:05:05,726
SPEAKER_0:  to fix this problem.

01:05:05,954 --> 01:05:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  because we know that that's not the condition that they want to live in.

01:05:09,506 --> 01:05:11,006
SPEAKER_0:  especially when they know what they can do.

01:05:11,810 --> 01:05:14,334
SPEAKER_0:  So with that, we subjected this.

01:05:14,562 --> 01:05:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  organisms to evolution in the lab.

01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:18,302
SPEAKER_0:  That's...

01:05:19,202 --> 01:05:23,422
SPEAKER_0:  We refer to this as experimental evolution. We subject bacteria.

01:05:23,810 --> 01:05:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  to.

01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:26,974
SPEAKER_0:  different selection pressure.

01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  project them through bottlenecks.

01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:31,902
SPEAKER_0:  Everyday we...

01:05:32,546 --> 01:05:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  randomly collect.

01:05:34,146 --> 01:05:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  a handful of bacteria from the flask.

01:05:36,738 --> 01:05:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  give them, put them in a new fresh environment with fresh food.

01:05:40,226 --> 01:05:45,726
SPEAKER_0:  keep them in this environment for 24 hours until they reach a more dormant state.

01:05:46,498 --> 01:05:49,022
SPEAKER_0:  subject introduced them to an even environment. A

01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  repeated this for about it.

01:05:51,394 --> 01:05:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  I will say 150 days.

01:05:54,466 --> 01:05:55,294
SPEAKER_0:  of every day.

01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:58,151
SPEAKER_0:  Not non-stop. We repeated this experiment.

01:05:58,151 --> 01:05:58,878
SPEAKER_1:  Some kind of

01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:01,150
SPEAKER_1:  how much

01:06:01,474 --> 01:06:03,198
SPEAKER_1:  how many different kinds of environments are there.

01:06:03,298 --> 01:06:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  We kept the environments to the same because we had different initial conditions. We kept the environment constant.

01:06:10,114 --> 01:06:12,606
SPEAKER_0:  Same temperature, same food, same source of...

01:06:12,834 --> 01:06:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  carbon.

01:06:13,794 --> 01:06:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  but we created replicates for each.

01:06:18,594 --> 01:06:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  So in some ways we created our own fossil record.

01:06:22,786 --> 01:06:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  in the lab by evolving and generating these flasks and every.

01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:28,958
SPEAKER_0:  in every step of the way we all saw.

01:06:29,346 --> 01:06:33,493
SPEAKER_0:  froze these cells and took stacks of them in the cryopresence.

01:06:33,493 --> 01:06:36,958
SPEAKER_1:  How long does it take to go from one generation to the next of bacteria?

01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  If you, for E. coli, it's usually 20 minutes.

01:06:43,138 --> 01:06:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  Great, so.

01:06:44,514 --> 01:06:47,422
SPEAKER_1:  That's the experiment. That's the experiment. And in your

01:06:47,842 --> 01:06:48,958
SPEAKER_1:  You're always messing it.

01:06:49,282 --> 01:06:50,398
SPEAKER_1:  with it in the same way.

01:06:50,658 --> 01:06:51,262
SPEAKER_1:  the initial.

01:06:51,426 --> 01:06:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  It's the same way. So we introduce variation at the elongation level because...

01:06:56,898 --> 01:07:01,502
SPEAKER_0:  So because we perdubbed it with different elongations, we found that if we introduce

01:07:02,626 --> 01:07:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  different protein that is very different.

01:07:04,706 --> 01:07:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  The cells.

01:07:05,698 --> 01:07:08,894
SPEAKER_0:  don't like that, right? So if the distance is larger, the

01:07:09,826 --> 01:07:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  consequences.

01:07:10,850 --> 01:07:11,582
SPEAKER_0:  also large.

01:07:11,906 --> 01:07:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  meaning that you hit them harder if you introduce a variant that is really foreign to them, that's really distant.

01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  in our case, was the ancestor. They really did not like the ancestor.

01:07:21,378 --> 01:07:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  but they were okay with their nearest cousin.

01:07:25,058 --> 01:07:27,774
SPEAKER_1:  Right, okay, great. So you did vary in the distance.

01:07:27,874 --> 01:07:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  We varied it to this evolutionary distance and then we kept the experimental conditions the same.

01:07:33,474 --> 01:07:36,222
SPEAKER_0:  and we propagated these populations every day.

01:07:36,578 --> 01:07:38,078
SPEAKER_0:  for 150 days.

01:07:38,338 --> 01:07:42,654
SPEAKER_0:  and we collected bacteria every step of the way.

01:07:42,914 --> 01:07:43,838
SPEAKER_0:  and looked at.

01:07:44,098 --> 01:07:48,734
SPEAKER_0:  the sequence, we wanted to understand what sort of changes may have happened in the genome.

01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:50,526
SPEAKER_0:  to respond to.

01:07:50,914 --> 01:07:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  the variation that we've introduced.

01:07:53,986 --> 01:07:58,910
SPEAKER_1:  So what kind of changes would you be seeing depending on the evolutionary distance of the thing you shoved into it?

01:07:59,106 --> 01:08:02,046
SPEAKER_0:  Exactly. So we knew where we punched, right? We punched right at the heart.

01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  We punched the translation.

01:08:04,994 --> 01:08:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  We expect it. Is it going to be a translation?

01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:09,822
SPEAKER_0:  Are we gonna see?

01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:13,566
SPEAKER_0:  change the real translation respond to this by fixing itself right away.

01:08:13,858 --> 01:08:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  or will it be?

01:08:15,266 --> 01:08:15,934
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:22,334
SPEAKER_0:  another outside of translation, something completely different, a different module, because translation itself is a module.

01:08:22,978 --> 01:08:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  or would be within elongation at really sub protein level.

01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:29,118
SPEAKER_0:  So we all.

01:08:29,346 --> 01:08:31,806
SPEAKER_0:  had a strategy to identify.

01:08:32,290 --> 01:08:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  the mutational pathways by categorizing.

01:08:35,298 --> 01:08:37,470
SPEAKER_0:  what we expected to find or where.

01:08:38,786 --> 01:08:40,894
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so why?

01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:43,134
SPEAKER_1:  does it not do multitasking?

01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:47,358
SPEAKER_1:  Why is it not improving multiple things?

01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:48,926
SPEAKER_0:  Why? Simultaneously.

01:08:49,538 --> 01:08:50,366
SPEAKER_0:  Turned out that...

01:08:50,658 --> 01:08:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  What we observed in general is that first of all the harder we...

01:08:54,178 --> 01:08:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  hit the cells, the more likely they were to respond by changes right at where we

01:08:59,842 --> 01:09:02,467
SPEAKER_1:  When you say hit it, you mean like change the something about it?

01:09:02,467 --> 01:09:11,902
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't think of it as hitting because we are, I like to think of it as breaking the cell, right? I mean not breaking enough to kill it, but we still, because they're still alive, they're not doing their job well.

01:09:12,386 --> 01:09:15,486
SPEAKER_1:  So the bigger the evolutionary distance.

01:09:16,034 --> 01:09:16,894
SPEAKER_1:  of the thing you

01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:23,143
SPEAKER_1:  put in there the heart of the hit is how you think about it. The bigger the hammer. The bigger the hammer.

01:09:23,143 --> 01:09:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  That's what it turned out to be because that's what the data told us.

01:09:27,906 --> 01:09:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  If the variation is higher, then the consequences will also be.

01:09:33,666 --> 01:09:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  higher, in the sense that the cells will not grow as healthy compared to

01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:42,765
SPEAKER_0:  a variant that is coming from a near evolutionary.

01:09:42,765 --> 01:09:43,678
SPEAKER_1:  we can expect to be of interest. So will either be successful or not. But first let me point out the basic functionality for both the needs of the user text and the

01:09:43,906 --> 01:09:46,654
SPEAKER_1:  Is it wrong to think of this kind of hitting as a...

01:09:47,202 --> 01:09:48,510
SPEAKER_1:  akin to a mutation.

01:09:49,282 --> 01:09:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  Oh no.

01:09:50,018 --> 01:09:52,446
SPEAKER_1:  What are we supposed to learn from this hitting? How…

01:09:53,122 --> 01:09:56,670
SPEAKER_1:  how the thing evolves after it's being hit in this way. What does that teach us?

01:09:56,802 --> 01:10:00,830
SPEAKER_0:  Because we see translation machinery as almost...

01:10:01,666 --> 01:10:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  It is so conserved and so essential, it is not even clear whether we can remove some of the parts or whether the entire translation will need all of the same parts in the same efficiency.

01:10:11,234 --> 01:10:13,854
SPEAKER_0:  We don't understand the rules of this machinery.

01:10:14,562 --> 01:10:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  So the first thing we understand is that what is the resilience? What are we really talking about here when we talk about you cannot mess with this translation?

01:10:22,114 --> 01:10:22,718
SPEAKER_0:  Is this true?

01:10:23,458 --> 01:10:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  because it is so conserved and so similar and functions in the most conserved ways.

01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:30,965
SPEAKER_0:  That was the first thing that we wanted to understand.

01:10:30,965 --> 01:10:35,465
SPEAKER_1:  Did you learn anything interesting about the resilience at the chemical physical informatics

01:10:35,465 --> 01:10:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  No, I wouldn't say that I think the biological level yes

01:10:39,522 --> 01:10:41,278
SPEAKER_0:  because we found that the...

01:10:41,986 --> 01:10:46,110
SPEAKER_0:  different modules started responding to the changes that we've introduced.

01:10:46,562 --> 01:10:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  and that we could never recover.

01:10:49,602 --> 01:10:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  translation as effectively as it used to be so that it never reached to

01:10:54,242 --> 01:10:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  It is.

01:10:55,842 --> 01:11:03,518
SPEAKER_0:  optimality, that it was always suboptimal. It needed, say, one more mutation perhaps to get there. It accumulated four mutations.

01:11:03,778 --> 01:11:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  that was.

01:11:04,738 --> 01:11:07,422
SPEAKER_0:  We did a lot of experiments to understand this, of course.

01:11:07,746 --> 01:11:11,102
SPEAKER_0:  it was accumulating mutations, it was getting better at its task,

01:11:11,714 --> 01:11:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe it needed

01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  couple other mutations to get really good at it, but somehow those mutations never happened.

01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  Before those mutations happened, we saw another module.

01:11:20,898 --> 01:11:21,438
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:11:21,762 --> 01:11:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  emerging through mutations and getting better at its own different tasks. That is not translation.

01:11:27,298 --> 01:11:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  You can think of cell as a web of networks, right? When we think of this as multiple almost.

01:11:33,666 --> 01:11:36,414
SPEAKER_0:  Airports that are proteins that are more central hubs.

01:11:36,866 --> 01:11:39,678
SPEAKER_0:  versus their proteins that maybe are not as important. If you.

01:11:39,938 --> 01:11:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  In theory it's a problem in the most-

01:11:41,858 --> 01:11:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  populated hubs.

01:11:43,234 --> 01:11:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  you're going to mess up the traffic system more drastically. And that's what we were messing with in the biological terms.

01:11:50,946 --> 01:11:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  as well.

01:11:51,778 --> 01:11:54,403
SPEAKER_1:  So when we say module, like translation would be one of them.

01:11:54,403 --> 01:11:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  Translation will be one. So you're-

01:11:56,258 --> 01:11:58,462
SPEAKER_1:  Basically saying when you mess with translation

01:11:59,234 --> 01:12:00,126
SPEAKER_1:  the organism.

01:12:00,802 --> 01:12:01,822
SPEAKER_1:  would choose.

01:12:02,146 --> 01:12:05,694
SPEAKER_1:  to either try to fix that module or another module.

01:12:06,114 --> 01:12:08,725
SPEAKER_1:  depending exactly, but it wouldn't do multiple.

01:12:08,725 --> 01:12:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  It wouldn't do multiple modules, it focused on one module at a time.

01:12:12,258 --> 01:12:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  and right before that module maybe reached to its own maximum.

01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  it's stalled, it's optimality at a certain degree. So you never get to a degree that is more optimal than you can achieve, even though perhaps another mutation could get you there.

01:12:26,914 --> 01:12:28,606
SPEAKER_1:  Since you messed with the translation.

01:12:29,858 --> 01:12:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  from a sort of optimal perspective with them.

01:12:32,194 --> 01:12:35,262
SPEAKER_1:  Makes sense for the cell to try to start fixing the translation.

01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:42,526
SPEAKER_0:  Not that's exactly what we thought. And it didn't, it was not the case for all the broken transition missionaries, for instance, if the.

01:12:42,754 --> 01:12:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  variant was coming from a near ancestor that didn't happen.

01:12:45,922 --> 01:12:50,718
SPEAKER_0:  It was almost cruising around trying different modules and sort of living its best life still.

01:12:51,202 --> 01:12:54,878
SPEAKER_0:  because there is no real urgency in the system to fix the...

01:12:55,202 --> 01:12:58,462
SPEAKER_1:  most important problem. And there's also not a direction.

01:12:59,618 --> 01:13:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  you know, maybe to you it's obvious that's the problem with the cell

01:13:03,906 --> 01:13:11,230
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe you're the problem. I'm living, like you said, my best life. Like, we don't, I mean, I guess that's the thing about evolution is we don't know.

01:13:11,874 --> 01:13:12,574
SPEAKER_1:  What the right?

01:13:12,834 --> 01:13:13,598
SPEAKER_1:  direction.

01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:18,925
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it's almost like you can imagine that you have this messy closet and you know,

01:13:18,925 --> 01:13:19,646
SPEAKER_1:  Go on.

01:13:21,346 --> 01:13:24,721
SPEAKER_1:  happens to be an accurate representation of my life.

01:13:24,721 --> 01:13:33,662
SPEAKER_0:  So you take a look at it and you see all the sweaters or jeans all over the place and then you look at a drawer that has socks.

01:13:33,890 --> 01:13:36,926
SPEAKER_0:  coming out of it and you'd think that's the most important one I'm just gonna fix that one.

01:13:37,378 --> 01:13:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  And then you fix that one and then you think you will get to the other one, but you don't because you just.

01:13:41,922 --> 01:13:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  Fix the most important one, that is whatever that was getting into your way.

01:13:46,018 --> 01:13:56,030
SPEAKER_0:  That's really what evolution is. It's quite lazy. It fixes the problem that seems to be the most immediate, and it doesn't go beyond what it really needs to. It seems like at least for our experimental setup, that was the case.

01:13:56,418 --> 01:13:59,006
SPEAKER_1:  especially for rapidly evolving systems.

01:13:59,682 --> 01:14:03,006
SPEAKER_1:  So like, is the environment they're operating pretty constrained?

01:14:03,842 --> 01:14:04,967
SPEAKER_1:  Like, is there a-

01:14:04,967 --> 01:14:09,630
SPEAKER_0:  I would say that we definitely constrain the environment.

01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  removed from.

01:14:11,618 --> 01:14:15,678
SPEAKER_0:  They are natural setup. We are not evolving them into guts.

01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  It's a very homogeneous system, very controlled temperature, controlled food.

01:14:21,634 --> 01:14:22,334
SPEAKER_0:  controlled carbon.

01:14:22,946 --> 01:14:30,302
SPEAKER_1:  So just looking at that, let me ask the romantic question. How did evolution create so much beautiful, complex variety on Earth?

01:14:31,458 --> 01:14:32,286
SPEAKER_1:  Like from that.

01:14:32,994 --> 01:14:40,382
SPEAKER_1:  You're saying that we're talking about improving different modules, but if we step back and look at the entirety of the tree of the different organisms that created all throughout.

01:14:40,770 --> 01:14:41,342
SPEAKER_1:  history.

01:14:41,858 --> 01:14:50,366
SPEAKER_1:  the stuff that's fun to you with the first few billion and the stuff that's fun to me when I watch on YouTube, which is like the.

01:14:50,722 --> 01:14:53,214
SPEAKER_1:  the lion versus gorilla fights and so on.

01:14:53,634 --> 01:14:58,398
SPEAKER_1:  But the whole thing is fun, so all that beautiful variety from the predator and the prey.

01:14:58,818 --> 01:14:59,358
SPEAKER_1:  Oh.

01:14:59,714 --> 01:15:02,526
SPEAKER_1:  from the self-replicating bacteria and all that kind of stuff.

01:15:03,234 --> 01:15:03,870
SPEAKER_1:  How did it do it?

01:15:04,674 --> 01:15:06,846
SPEAKER_0:  how is a very difficult question.

01:15:07,266 --> 01:15:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  especially when we don't understand the past.

01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:12,382
SPEAKER_0:  with clarity at all.

01:15:13,154 --> 01:15:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  I-

01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:20,702
SPEAKER_0:  can tell you that there seems to be very critical innovations that happened throughout the history of life.

01:15:21,314 --> 01:15:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  that are each themselves.

01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  this.

01:15:24,354 --> 01:15:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  very sophisticated singularities that emerged once and then they said

01:15:29,122 --> 01:15:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  the tone.

01:15:30,434 --> 01:15:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  one of which is.

01:15:32,258 --> 01:15:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  emergence of translation.

01:15:34,178 --> 01:15:34,558
SPEAKER_0:  It's.

01:15:35,106 --> 01:15:37,374
SPEAKER_0:  Seems like it happened once, it had to happen once.

01:15:37,698 --> 01:15:38,750
SPEAKER_0:  Seems like that's all it took.

01:15:40,066 --> 01:15:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  3.8 billion years, maybe older.

01:15:43,106 --> 01:15:43,646
SPEAKER_0:  Clearly.

01:15:43,906 --> 01:15:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  subjected to let off.

01:15:45,922 --> 01:15:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  chemical evolution even prior to last universal common ancestor.

01:15:50,178 --> 01:15:51,358
SPEAKER_0:  And then you...

01:15:51,586 --> 01:15:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  Jump.

01:15:52,514 --> 01:15:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  and you see.

01:15:53,698 --> 01:15:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  emergence of

01:15:56,514 --> 01:15:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  cyanobacteria.

01:15:58,210 --> 01:16:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  that's undeniably changed the course.

01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  of those planets.

01:16:02,690 --> 01:16:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  in the subsequent.

01:16:04,194 --> 01:16:04,638
SPEAKER_0:  Arabic

01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:05,310
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:16:05,922 --> 01:16:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  photosynthesis that life learned.

01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  I have to...

01:16:10,210 --> 01:16:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  utilize what's available in this environment in the most profound way.

01:16:14,466 --> 01:16:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  and then you move forward, you see the emergence.

01:16:17,282 --> 01:16:20,606
SPEAKER_0:  of eukaryotes to endosymbiosis.

01:16:20,962 --> 01:16:22,398
SPEAKER_0:  Also another singular event.

01:16:23,074 --> 01:16:25,694
SPEAKER_0:  and then you move forward and then comes the plants.

01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  Desart.

01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:29,406
SPEAKER_0:  I counted, I think, six different things.

01:16:29,922 --> 01:16:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  that seems to have happened just once.

01:16:32,962 --> 01:16:36,670
SPEAKER_1:  and singularity events in the history of evolution of life on earth.

01:16:37,890 --> 01:16:41,086
SPEAKER_0:  What's really fascinating here is that there seems to be two different

01:16:41,474 --> 01:16:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  courses, the time course.

01:16:43,458 --> 01:16:47,582
SPEAKER_0:  evolution is operating at the molecular level. Right, we are talking about-

01:16:48,226 --> 01:16:53,662
SPEAKER_0:  seconds. We're talking about mutations that happen every second. We're talking about selection that's also happening.

01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  under a minute.

01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  Right, so.

01:16:56,034 --> 01:17:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  That is a very fast process. The fact that I can evolve bacteria in a lab.

01:17:00,802 --> 01:17:01,278
SPEAKER_0:  And I.

01:17:01,506 --> 01:17:05,886
SPEAKER_0:  say almost complaining me, oh my goodness, it took me 150 days.

01:17:06,178 --> 01:17:07,454
SPEAKER_0:  I mean that's pretty rapid.

01:17:07,778 --> 01:17:09,918
SPEAKER_0:  to for for a change to be seen.

01:17:11,362 --> 01:17:15,006
SPEAKER_0:  But then the big changes and the ones that I'm talking, the really...

01:17:15,586 --> 01:17:18,782
SPEAKER_0:  big innovations that caused an increase of...

01:17:19,106 --> 01:17:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  oxygen on this planet or even its own mere presence.

01:17:22,178 --> 01:17:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  are due to these molecular innovations.

01:17:24,674 --> 01:17:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  seems to only happen a handful of times.

01:17:27,298 --> 01:17:29,310
SPEAKER_0:  over billions of years of time scale.

01:17:29,410 --> 01:17:30,526
SPEAKER_1:  Let me ask you this question.

01:17:30,818 --> 01:17:33,118
SPEAKER_1:  having to deal with my half asleep tweet.

01:17:34,114 --> 01:17:37,694
SPEAKER_1:  The saying that we all originated from one common ancestor.

01:17:39,010 --> 01:17:39,390
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:17:39,874 --> 01:17:41,246
SPEAKER_1:  That's just one of them.

01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:43,230
SPEAKER_1:  Miraculous things.

01:17:44,546 --> 01:17:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  about life on earth. Of course you could say there's multiple common assessions in the beginning, multiple organisms and so on.

01:17:50,562 --> 01:17:54,366
SPEAKER_1:  But the other stuff that you're talking about is these singular events.

01:17:54,594 --> 01:17:56,510
SPEAKER_1:  these leaps of invention.

01:17:56,834 --> 01:17:58,110
SPEAKER_1:  throughout evolutionary history.

01:17:58,882 --> 01:18:00,830
SPEAKER_1:  Now there's a bunch of people who are commenting.

01:18:01,826 --> 01:18:03,006
SPEAKER_1:  A bit surprising to me.

01:18:03,682 --> 01:18:04,158
SPEAKER_1:  for watching.

01:18:04,450 --> 01:18:06,334
SPEAKER_1:  basically skeptical of this idea.

01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:07,486
SPEAKER_1:  Die, D.O.F.

01:18:07,906 --> 01:18:10,558
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I would say evolution, honestly.

01:18:10,946 --> 01:18:14,366
SPEAKER_1:  process of evolution, but when you just actually focus in.

01:18:14,914 --> 01:18:16,414
SPEAKER_1:  I'm like, holy crap.

01:18:17,570 --> 01:18:18,142
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:22,686
SPEAKER_1:  eukaryotes were invented holy crap photosynthesis was invented

01:18:23,746 --> 01:18:26,174
SPEAKER_1:  Those are incredible inventions. And also-

01:18:26,498 --> 01:18:29,150
SPEAKER_1:  We can even go to Homo sapiens, intelligence.

01:18:29,666 --> 01:18:33,214
SPEAKER_1:  Like where did that come from? What are these mysteries?

01:18:33,602 --> 01:18:34,846
SPEAKER_1:  I think with that.

01:18:35,234 --> 01:18:36,702
SPEAKER_1:  skeptical comments are coming from.

01:18:37,218 --> 01:18:39,198
SPEAKER_1:  or also just a general skepticism.

01:18:39,458 --> 01:18:40,574
SPEAKER_1:  of science.

01:18:41,666 --> 01:18:42,174
SPEAKER_1:  I think.

01:18:43,042 --> 01:18:46,654
SPEAKER_1:  from the pandemic, people, maybe a failure of institutions and so on.

01:18:46,882 --> 01:18:47,998
SPEAKER_1:  I think the, 아

01:18:49,378 --> 01:18:51,582
SPEAKER_1:  And there's been a growing distrust of science.

01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:54,942
SPEAKER_1:  And it's not so much that it's anti-evolution.

01:18:55,234 --> 01:18:57,726
SPEAKER_1:  It's more of a stepping back and saying.

01:18:58,082 --> 01:18:58,654
SPEAKER_1:  Wait a minute.

01:18:59,170 --> 01:19:01,150
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe scientists don't have it all figured out.

01:19:01,794 --> 01:19:02,430
SPEAKER_1:  I think.

01:19:02,946 --> 01:19:03,486
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:19:04,322 --> 01:19:05,598
SPEAKER_1:  to Steel Man.

01:19:05,826 --> 01:19:06,590
SPEAKER_1:  that case.

01:19:07,202 --> 01:19:07,806
SPEAKER_1:  is.

01:19:08,034 --> 01:19:12,446
SPEAKER_1:  Almost a step back and to realize there's so much mystery to each of these leaps

01:19:13,218 --> 01:19:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  So it makes you wonder, is there something that in 100, 200 years we'll figure out?

01:19:18,338 --> 01:19:19,838
SPEAKER_1:  that we totally don't understand yet.

01:19:20,994 --> 01:19:22,302
SPEAKER_1:  like some, you know, there's.

01:19:22,562 --> 01:19:24,222
SPEAKER_1:  I talked to a bunch of people, but...

01:19:24,706 --> 01:19:26,814
SPEAKER_1:  another mystery which is consciousness.

01:19:27,234 --> 01:19:27,774
SPEAKER_1:  All right, and there's.

01:19:28,066 --> 01:19:29,982
SPEAKER_1:  People called panpsychists who believe

01:19:30,338 --> 01:19:31,166
SPEAKER_1:  consciousness.

01:19:31,522 --> 01:19:33,822
SPEAKER_1:  is one of the fundamental laws of the universe.

01:19:34,082 --> 01:19:35,166
SPEAKER_1:  There could be a.

01:19:35,906 --> 01:19:38,974
SPEAKER_1:  You know, like we have laws of physics that could be something.

01:19:39,330 --> 01:19:39,678
SPEAKER_1:  That's.

01:19:40,418 --> 01:19:42,878
SPEAKER_1:  like a consciousness field or something.

01:19:43,330 --> 01:19:44,734
SPEAKER_1:  that permeates all matter.

01:19:45,282 --> 01:19:46,686
SPEAKER_1:  And so like there might be.

01:19:46,914 --> 01:19:47,262
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

01:19:47,618 --> 01:19:50,590
SPEAKER_1:  It's kind of like Newtonian physics versus general relativity.

01:19:51,010 --> 01:19:52,638
SPEAKER_1:  Like, we have a good understanding.

01:19:53,058 --> 01:19:54,238
SPEAKER_1:  of how things happen.

01:19:54,658 --> 01:19:57,054
SPEAKER_1:  but we need another layer of understanding.

01:19:57,506 --> 01:19:59,774
SPEAKER_1:  to fill in the gaps of the mysteries of it all.

01:20:00,418 --> 01:20:00,862
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:20:01,762 --> 01:20:08,766
SPEAKER_1:  that sort of is a sobering reality that maybe there is something we really deeply don't understand. Do you have a sense of?

01:20:09,442 --> 01:20:11,422
SPEAKER_1:  where the biggest mysteries here are.

01:20:11,938 --> 01:20:14,110
SPEAKER_1:  Is it at the origin of life itself?

01:20:14,594 --> 01:20:16,350
SPEAKER_1:  Is it the leaps?

01:20:17,218 --> 01:20:20,318
SPEAKER_1:  that we're talking about. So you, you see the beauty.

01:20:20,706 --> 01:20:22,974
SPEAKER_1:  You're fascinated by the translation mechanism.

01:20:25,026 --> 01:20:25,726
SPEAKER_1:  What are the-

01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:27,614
SPEAKER_1:  Deep mysteries there too.

01:20:30,466 --> 01:20:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  We are nothing but chemical systems capable of.

01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:20:35,362 --> 01:20:38,750
SPEAKER_0:  formulating or answering questions about our own existence.

01:20:39,970 --> 01:20:42,302
SPEAKER_1:  We humans or all of life, you think?

01:20:42,978 --> 01:20:48,158
SPEAKER_0:  Humans are, I mean, the fact that we can even have this conversation about...

01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  Brbruむむむむむむむむむむっ

01:20:50,562 --> 01:20:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  place in the universe is.

01:20:53,346 --> 01:20:55,678
SPEAKER_0:  that this to our knowledge is quite specific to.

01:20:56,258 --> 01:20:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  Ah, wrong chemical.

01:20:57,474 --> 01:20:57,982
SPEAKER_0:  species.

01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:01,118
SPEAKER_1:  It's kinda wild.

01:21:01,762 --> 01:21:02,078
SPEAKER_1:  Good.

01:21:02,338 --> 01:21:05,214
SPEAKER_1:  we're introspecting on our evolutionary history.

01:21:05,762 --> 01:21:07,518
SPEAKER_1:  and we're just a couple of organisms.

01:21:08,258 --> 01:21:11,166
SPEAKER_1:  would like another organism listening to this.

01:21:11,586 --> 01:21:12,030
SPEAKER_1:  and like...

01:21:12,290 --> 01:21:13,246
SPEAKER_1:  They're mind blown.

01:21:13,986 --> 01:21:15,454
SPEAKER_1:  There's like three organisms.

01:21:16,034 --> 01:21:18,462
SPEAKER_1:  Two of them talking and the third one's like, holy shit.

01:21:20,258 --> 01:21:22,238
SPEAKER_0:  I think that understanding the...

01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  What I really find interesting about understanding origin of life.

01:21:26,082 --> 01:21:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  or even contemplating about our own place in the universe.

01:21:29,730 --> 01:21:32,254
SPEAKER_0:  if at the end of this would come down to...

01:21:32,514 --> 01:21:33,630
SPEAKER_0:  appreciating.

01:21:34,114 --> 01:21:37,630
SPEAKER_0:  or even before appreciating, really truly comprehending.

01:21:38,114 --> 01:21:39,550
SPEAKER_0:  what it is that we got here.

01:21:40,514 --> 01:21:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  That to me is a huge gain.

01:21:43,554 --> 01:21:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  Because there's...

01:21:44,738 --> 01:21:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  No single...

01:21:46,594 --> 01:21:48,638
SPEAKER_0:  question in biology, I think that will give that.

01:21:49,954 --> 01:21:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  that will deliver that magnitude of that message and understanding.

01:21:53,602 --> 01:21:53,982
SPEAKER_0:  But.

01:21:54,914 --> 01:21:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  understanding how life here started at first place, if we truly comprehend that.

01:21:59,938 --> 01:22:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  This is not a concept that is well thought.

01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  in schools.

01:22:04,258 --> 01:22:09,502
SPEAKER_0:  ask students to memorize these concepts if they are lucky they learned RNA World.

01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:18,462
SPEAKER_0:  chicken and egg problem, et cetera. That's the extent to which maybe their biology teacher was personally interested in the subject matter.

01:22:18,882 --> 01:22:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  if they're lucky.

01:22:20,226 --> 01:22:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  You know the saying that...

01:22:22,114 --> 01:22:22,590
SPEAKER_0:  to.

01:22:23,234 --> 01:22:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  Oh.

01:22:24,194 --> 01:22:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  Brains are...

01:22:26,146 --> 01:22:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  evenly distributed.

01:22:27,842 --> 01:22:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  Oh.

01:22:28,514 --> 01:22:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  across any metric you can imagine, but...

01:22:30,626 --> 01:22:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  Opportunities are not.

01:22:34,498 --> 01:22:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  So if people aren't understanding...

01:22:37,506 --> 01:22:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  The importance of this is because that's a lack of opportunity right there. That's.

01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:42,846
SPEAKER_0:  It was skipped through.

01:22:44,482 --> 01:22:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  proper education and training.

01:22:46,498 --> 01:22:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  in the delivery of my

01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:51,125
SPEAKER_0:  science matters or how science actually works.

01:22:51,125 --> 01:22:53,278
SPEAKER_1:  But how do you even begin to...

01:22:54,082 --> 01:22:55,774
SPEAKER_1:  Seriously?

01:22:56,066 --> 01:22:57,726
SPEAKER_1:  Think about the origin of life.

01:22:59,074 --> 01:22:59,550
SPEAKER_1:  I mean...

01:23:00,706 --> 01:23:01,342
SPEAKER_1:  Every

01:23:01,570 --> 01:23:02,366
SPEAKER_1:  problem.

01:23:03,938 --> 01:23:05,854
SPEAKER_1:  of existence, of life.

01:23:06,818 --> 01:23:07,806
SPEAKER_1:  has its time.

01:23:08,642 --> 01:23:11,518
SPEAKER_1:  So I don't know if it's time to understand consciousness yet.

01:23:12,002 --> 01:23:12,734
SPEAKER_1:  Who might be?

01:23:13,378 --> 01:23:14,622
SPEAKER_1:  a hundred years away from that.

01:23:14,978 --> 01:23:15,998
SPEAKER_1:  The Origin of Life

01:23:16,514 --> 01:23:21,790
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if it's time for us to understand that yet. Maybe we need to solve so many more problems along the way.

01:23:22,434 --> 01:23:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  It's not a competition of problems.

01:23:24,994 --> 01:23:25,822
SPEAKER_0:  So there are

01:23:26,050 --> 01:23:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  all kinds of problems and it takes a lot of people to make the world. So you will always have some

01:23:30,754 --> 01:23:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  Interesting brain.

01:23:32,002 --> 01:23:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  Going off the rim.

01:23:32,994 --> 01:23:34,526
SPEAKER_0:  interesting problem to their own.

01:23:35,234 --> 01:23:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  The issue here is that we need to first of all understand that

01:23:39,458 --> 01:23:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  V.

01:23:40,578 --> 01:23:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  What we have going on on this planet is pretty good.

01:23:44,098 --> 01:23:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  Good planets are hard to find.

01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  If we are alone in the universe, that's huge.

01:23:50,786 --> 01:23:53,246
SPEAKER_0:  we need to take care of what we got here.

01:23:53,474 --> 01:23:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  and we are incredibly vulnerable.

01:23:56,610 --> 01:24:00,958
SPEAKER_0:  to the changes that our own species also helped create.

01:24:01,698 --> 01:24:03,710
SPEAKER_0:  on at the biosphere at the ecosystem level.

01:24:04,258 --> 01:24:07,710
SPEAKER_0:  We take it for granted. We take what we created for granted.

01:24:08,034 --> 01:24:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  because of the fact that we think we are some sort of

01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:12,350
SPEAKER_0:  ultimate endpoint.

01:24:12,706 --> 01:24:15,934
SPEAKER_0:  the most sophisticated, amazing thing that nature could generate.

01:24:17,346 --> 01:24:19,582
SPEAKER_0:  I think understanding…

01:24:20,098 --> 01:24:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  Not even understanding but-

01:24:21,858 --> 01:24:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  asking these questions of

01:24:23,650 --> 01:24:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  Where did this even come from?

01:24:25,954 --> 01:24:27,454
SPEAKER_0:  How did this even begin?

01:24:28,034 --> 01:24:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:24:30,498 --> 01:24:34,398
SPEAKER_0:  Attempting to understand that using chemistry and physics and biology

01:24:35,202 --> 01:24:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  and because we can.

01:24:37,442 --> 01:24:41,438
SPEAKER_0:  That's the ultimate gift we can give back to the entire species on this planet.

01:24:42,466 --> 01:24:44,030
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean it's humbling.

01:24:44,578 --> 01:24:50,686
SPEAKER_1:  It's humbling to realize the complexity of this whole mechanism. It certainly puts humans in their proper perspective.

01:24:51,234 --> 01:24:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  that were not.

01:24:53,602 --> 01:24:55,806
SPEAKER_1:  just because we have brains and brains are intelligent.

01:24:56,098 --> 01:24:56,958
SPEAKER_1:  doesn't mean

01:24:58,114 --> 01:25:08,734
SPEAKER_1:  we're the most intelligent thing because ultimately the whole mechanism of nature seems to be orders and magnitude more intelligent. All of it, like we're a bunch of, we're like a hierarchy of organisms.

01:25:09,282 --> 01:25:11,838
SPEAKER_1:  that have a history of several billion years.

01:25:12,130 --> 01:25:14,462
SPEAKER_1:  and then all somehow came together to make a human.

01:25:14,882 --> 01:25:16,510
SPEAKER_1:  and there'll be life after us.

01:25:17,122 --> 01:25:20,638
SPEAKER_1:  just as was life before us, and something that comes after a bee.

01:25:21,122 --> 01:25:22,430
SPEAKER_1:  Perhaps even more fascinating.

01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  I think when you understand the magnitude of what happened here

01:25:26,914 --> 01:25:32,894
SPEAKER_0:  There is no room for arrogance. It should overwhelm you and humiliate. It's pretty humiliating. Yeah.

01:25:33,186 --> 01:25:36,030
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it's quite amazing what...

01:25:36,322 --> 01:25:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  what happened here.

01:25:39,010 --> 01:25:40,734
SPEAKER_0:  There is no other discipline that will.

01:25:41,602 --> 01:25:43,614
SPEAKER_0:  deliver that, but exploring.

01:25:44,546 --> 01:25:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  our own origins and looking at life as a more planetary system phenomena rather than.

01:25:50,722 --> 01:25:53,982
SPEAKER_0:  one single species at a time, a collective look.

01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:58,462
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, you mentioned this question in your Ted talk is.

01:26:00,034 --> 01:26:01,342
SPEAKER_1:  the two possibilities.

01:26:02,082 --> 01:26:02,654
SPEAKER_1:  of

01:26:03,106 --> 01:26:04,702
SPEAKER_1:  the Universe being full of life.

01:26:05,506 --> 01:26:09,022
SPEAKER_1:  and the universe being empty and we're the only life in the universe.

01:26:10,786 --> 01:26:12,638
SPEAKER_1:  How do you feel about both options?

01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:15,422
SPEAKER_1:  Just actually you as a single.

01:26:16,066 --> 01:26:19,326
SPEAKER_1:  chemical organism introspecting about its existence in this.

01:26:19,906 --> 01:26:20,382
SPEAKER_1:  world.

01:26:21,026 --> 01:26:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  It's.

01:26:21,570 --> 01:26:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  Having a planet full of life is interesting because there are...

01:26:24,994 --> 01:26:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  We talked about...

01:26:27,330 --> 01:26:29,918
SPEAKER_0:  life being all about chemistry exploring solutions.

01:26:30,466 --> 01:26:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  and having solutions in front of you is great, it's beneficial.

01:26:35,234 --> 01:26:40,109
SPEAKER_1:  solutions being different organisms like other humans you see them as a solution to a chemistry problem

01:26:40,109 --> 01:26:40,859
SPEAKER_0:  different again

01:26:40,859 --> 01:26:49,982
SPEAKER_1:  That's an interesting solution. That's not next time we were in Austin So there's a bunch of weirdos every time I see a weirdo. I feel like oh, that's an interesting solution to this chemistry problem

01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:51,038
SPEAKER_1:  I'm going to...

01:26:52,226 --> 01:26:55,015
SPEAKER_0:  Now you think like an origin of life science.

01:26:55,015 --> 01:26:56,702
SPEAKER_1:  Funny that that one worked out.

01:26:57,474 --> 01:26:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  Let's see where else it goes. But having-

01:26:59,810 --> 01:27:00,126
SPEAKER_0:

01:27:00,418 --> 01:27:02,494
SPEAKER_0:  emptiness and unpredictability.

01:27:03,042 --> 01:27:03,518
SPEAKER_0:  off

01:27:04,258 --> 01:27:08,990
SPEAKER_0:  uncovering a novel solution can also have its own benefits. And we should-

01:27:09,506 --> 01:27:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  Oh.

01:27:10,690 --> 01:27:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  be open to.

01:27:12,866 --> 01:27:16,241
SPEAKER_0:  what other solutions might be out there in exploring those solutions?

01:27:16,241 --> 01:27:21,491
SPEAKER_1:  to different chemistry problems. So that's where you see the other planets out there as different chemistry problems.

01:27:21,491 --> 01:27:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  to their own local environment, yes. So.

01:27:24,066 --> 01:27:25,854
SPEAKER_1:  How many chemistry problems?

01:27:27,106 --> 01:27:28,510
SPEAKER_1:  have solutions.

01:27:28,770 --> 01:27:30,078
SPEAKER_1:  that are lifelike to you.

01:27:30,882 --> 01:27:32,510
SPEAKER_1:  out there in the universe.

01:27:33,186 --> 01:27:35,134
SPEAKER_0:  It's a wide open palette if you think about it.

01:27:35,554 --> 01:27:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  I don't quite know. It's the, we know the chemistry is chemistry.

01:27:39,522 --> 01:27:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think the chemistry will be different elsewhere.

01:27:41,730 --> 01:27:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  But again, what is selected by chemistry will be determined.

01:27:45,122 --> 01:27:46,997
SPEAKER_0:  by the environment most likely.

01:27:46,997 --> 01:27:47,550
SPEAKER_1:  I think.

01:27:47,906 --> 01:27:49,470
SPEAKER_1:  There is life.

01:27:50,210 --> 01:27:51,070
SPEAKER_1:  Everywhere.

01:27:51,490 --> 01:27:51,806
SPEAKER_1:  there.

01:27:52,706 --> 01:27:54,302
SPEAKER_1:  So there's a guy named Nick Lane.

01:27:55,810 --> 01:27:56,510
SPEAKER_1:

01:27:56,834 --> 01:27:57,246
SPEAKER_1:  Gut.

01:27:57,858 --> 01:27:59,230
SPEAKER_1:  And it's interesting to me.

01:27:59,522 --> 01:28:00,958
SPEAKER_1:  I wonder what you think about it is.

01:28:01,346 --> 01:28:03,806
SPEAKER_1:  His gut is, there's life everywhere out there.

01:28:04,258 --> 01:28:09,182
SPEAKER_1:  but it stops at the bacteria stage. So he says the eukaryotes.

01:28:10,146 --> 01:28:13,150
SPEAKER_1:  is like the biggest invention and the hardest one.

01:28:13,410 --> 01:28:16,190
SPEAKER_0:  I wonder if he thinks that's an accidental outcome.

01:28:16,450 --> 01:28:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  If he thinks that's inevitable, I wonder what that means.

01:28:19,522 --> 01:28:23,678
SPEAKER_0:  But it's a likely possibility that the...

01:28:24,162 --> 01:28:27,038
SPEAKER_0:  bacterial or microbial life is definitely more attainable.

01:28:27,714 --> 01:28:28,670
SPEAKER_0:  Um, So that-

01:28:29,122 --> 01:28:30,142
SPEAKER_1:  That's a weird...

01:28:30,498 --> 01:28:33,873
SPEAKER_1:  world where our entire galaxy just says bacteria.

01:28:33,873 --> 01:28:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, everywhere. So, you know, if you don't like microbes, you aren't on the wrong planet.

01:28:39,234 --> 01:28:39,614
SPEAKER_1:  Niner.

01:28:40,002 --> 01:28:40,830
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:28:41,122 --> 01:28:43,838
SPEAKER_1:  And viruses. I don't know which one there's more of.

01:28:44,450 --> 01:28:47,230
SPEAKER_1:  but they're both, and most of them are like.

01:28:47,458 --> 01:28:50,083
SPEAKER_0:  They're fascinating. They do everything for us.

01:28:50,083 --> 01:28:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  If you don't like my cups you're on the wrong planet.

01:28:53,346 --> 01:28:57,374
SPEAKER_1:  You're full of good lines. Okay, right, right. I just can't

01:28:58,114 --> 01:29:00,094
SPEAKER_1:  there's like an imperative to the whole thing.

01:29:00,514 --> 01:29:01,118
SPEAKER_1:  To me.

01:29:01,986 --> 01:29:03,134
SPEAKER_1:  The Origin.

01:29:04,770 --> 01:29:06,142
SPEAKER_1:  is the hard question.

01:29:06,402 --> 01:29:09,118
SPEAKER_1:  But once it gets going, I just don't see.

01:29:09,762 --> 01:29:14,910
SPEAKER_1:  Wait, go ahead. It seems like it's constantly creating more intelligent things.

01:29:16,258 --> 01:29:16,894
SPEAKER_1:  More.

01:29:17,890 --> 01:29:19,765
SPEAKER_1:  fascinating complex things they're able to do.

01:29:19,765 --> 01:29:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  That's a very interesting, I definitely...

01:29:24,994 --> 01:29:32,126
SPEAKER_0:  agree that the initial steps may be the ultimate determinants, that once it's, you cannot stop it once it starts. It's possible.

01:29:32,930 --> 01:29:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  rights and arm.

01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:35,678
SPEAKER_1:  I just have never on Earth.

01:29:36,194 --> 01:29:37,822
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe it's, but maybe.

01:29:38,690 --> 01:29:40,958
SPEAKER_1:  I just, whenever I see life...

01:29:41,314 --> 01:29:42,718
SPEAKER_1:  It seems to flourish.

01:29:44,194 --> 01:29:45,054
SPEAKER_1:  Everywhere.

01:29:46,082 --> 01:29:48,510
SPEAKER_1:  The thing is, I don't...

01:29:48,834 --> 01:29:51,582
SPEAKER_1:  The only thing I haven't seen is the start of it.

01:29:52,674 --> 01:29:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  Exactly. But that's...

01:29:54,914 --> 01:30:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  And how are we going to understand that if we don't the origin of life science? I mean, that's the end. The question here isn't exactly...

01:30:03,042 --> 01:30:06,942
SPEAKER_0:  our ability to recapitulate everything that happened in the exact way that it happened.

01:30:07,586 --> 01:30:07,902
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

01:30:08,322 --> 01:30:08,926
SPEAKER_0:  This is about

01:30:09,378 --> 01:30:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  What can happen, or maybe how?

01:30:12,418 --> 01:30:17,054
SPEAKER_1:  You think it's possible to study the origin of language?

01:30:17,346 --> 01:30:18,398
SPEAKER_1:  using English.

01:30:19,202 --> 01:30:19,646
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:30:20,738 --> 01:30:23,902
SPEAKER_1:  Like there's a very particular chemistry here. There's a particular.

01:30:24,194 --> 01:30:27,166
SPEAKER_1:  set of assumptions, understanding about what life is, what...

01:30:27,682 --> 01:30:30,814
SPEAKER_1:  Everything is our perception of reality is very specific.

01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:34,366
SPEAKER_1:  Lee constructed through the evolutionary process.

01:30:34,690 --> 01:30:35,966
SPEAKER_1:  I wonder if it's possible to-

01:30:37,058 --> 01:30:40,062
SPEAKER_1:  get to some first principles, deep understanding of.

01:30:40,834 --> 01:30:43,838
SPEAKER_1:  how life originates in such a way that you can actually

01:30:44,194 --> 01:30:45,886
SPEAKER_1:  Constructed on other planets

01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:50,270
SPEAKER_1:  I ultimately, it feels like if you're doing it in the lab on earth.

01:30:50,786 --> 01:30:52,862
SPEAKER_1:  You're always going to be using...

01:30:53,410 --> 01:30:55,902
SPEAKER_1:  some aspect of the life that's already here.

01:30:56,930 --> 01:30:57,246
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:30:57,506 --> 01:30:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  Ehh

01:30:58,562 --> 01:30:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  That's.

01:30:59,714 --> 01:31:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  What I-

01:31:00,642 --> 01:31:02,718
SPEAKER_0:  sort of talked about in my talk as well.

01:31:03,426 --> 01:31:04,551
SPEAKER_0:  and have a great day.

01:31:04,551 --> 01:31:05,310
SPEAKER_1:  I should go.

01:31:06,786 --> 01:31:08,414
SPEAKER_1:  Watch the TED Talks very good.

01:31:08,802 --> 01:31:12,926
SPEAKER_1:  The annoying thing to me about Ted Talks, I guess it's by design, is they're too short.

01:31:13,378 --> 01:31:14,718
SPEAKER_1:  It's like, come on.

01:31:16,482 --> 01:31:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  And did you know that there's no prompter involved?

01:31:19,746 --> 01:31:22,046
SPEAKER_1:  There's no, wait, there is or there isn't? Subscribe!!

01:31:22,434 --> 01:31:25,278
SPEAKER_1:  You have to memorize stuff.

01:31:26,018 --> 01:31:32,702
SPEAKER_0:  And thanks to my amazing editor who probably is watching this too, David Bielo, that it was very, very helpful.

01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:34,951
SPEAKER_0:  But I would say that-

01:31:34,951 --> 01:31:38,494
SPEAKER_1:  I like this podcast. It's a very professional organization.

01:31:38,914 --> 01:31:40,606
SPEAKER_1:  I respect that medium.

01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:44,734
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, yeah, anyway, in the, in the tight talk about, yeah, life.

01:31:45,698 --> 01:31:46,654
SPEAKER_1:  Life Creating Life.

01:31:47,394 --> 01:31:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  is a likely scenario.

01:31:49,506 --> 01:31:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  that once we understand.

01:31:52,226 --> 01:31:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  How?

01:31:54,210 --> 01:31:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  Life.

01:31:55,522 --> 01:31:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  is a chemical system.

01:31:57,314 --> 01:31:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  is.

01:31:59,074 --> 01:32:00,638
SPEAKER_0:  capable of formulating.

01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  its own expression.

01:32:03,138 --> 01:32:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  and generating a memory.

01:32:05,122 --> 01:32:07,422
SPEAKER_0:  and manages its existence on a.

01:32:07,970 --> 01:32:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  planetary body for billions of years.

01:32:11,042 --> 01:32:12,190
SPEAKER_0:  once we understand.

01:32:12,674 --> 01:32:12,990
SPEAKER_0:  What's?

01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:15,998
SPEAKER_0:  conditions gave rise to that.

01:32:16,930 --> 01:32:17,598
SPEAKER_0:  We may.

01:32:17,986 --> 01:32:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  be very likely to.

01:32:20,226 --> 01:32:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  Understand.

01:32:23,298 --> 01:32:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  whether a different planet also be likely to instigate its own.

01:32:28,322 --> 01:32:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  chemical revolution if it were.

01:32:31,746 --> 01:32:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  It was provided by

01:32:33,506 --> 01:32:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  through some missing ingredients.

01:32:35,586 --> 01:32:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  you can think of it as a sending fertilizer to a different planet.

01:32:38,722 --> 01:32:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  that is missing its own.

01:32:40,098 --> 01:32:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  chemical composition or lacking or.

01:32:43,106 --> 01:32:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  that it needs more of what it has.

01:32:46,338 --> 01:32:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  the difference between.

01:32:48,162 --> 01:32:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  making

01:32:49,090 --> 01:32:57,790
SPEAKER_0:  that planet Earth-like, which was, this is not what that's about. We're not talking about terraforming, or if you're not talking about turning that planet into Earth-like system.

01:32:58,466 --> 01:33:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  We are talking about first understanding that planet.

01:33:02,050 --> 01:33:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  studying its chemistry, studying its...

01:33:04,930 --> 01:33:07,390
SPEAKER_0:  its properties well enough to understand.

01:33:07,842 --> 01:33:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  whether it is close to its own chemical revolution.

01:33:11,138 --> 01:33:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  and maybe giving it that extra nudge.

01:33:14,338 --> 01:33:16,222
SPEAKER_0:  So this is obviously a pretty...

01:33:16,482 --> 01:33:16,798
SPEAKER_0:  Big.

01:33:17,090 --> 01:33:19,646
SPEAKER_0:  speculation and suggestion and

01:33:20,002 --> 01:33:22,590
SPEAKER_0:  It's a very interesting proposition because...

01:33:22,818 --> 01:33:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  This is a yes or no.

01:33:24,354 --> 01:33:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  question, right? This is the ultimate would you rather.

01:33:27,522 --> 01:33:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  It's the, and I think it says a lot about.

01:33:30,498 --> 01:33:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  the perception of the person who's answering this question.

01:33:34,146 --> 01:33:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  that if the answer is

01:33:35,394 --> 01:33:38,686
SPEAKER_0:  No, no, no, absolutely not. That's not something we want to do.

01:33:39,042 --> 01:33:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  I wanna know why that is the case.

01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:45,374
SPEAKER_1:  So just to be clear, what we're talking about is looking at the chemical cocktail of a particular planet.

01:33:46,690 --> 01:33:47,230
SPEAKER_1:  And.

01:33:47,842 --> 01:33:49,502
SPEAKER_1:  having like tasting it.

01:33:50,466 --> 01:33:51,198
SPEAKER_1:  Let's see.

01:33:51,586 --> 01:33:57,566
SPEAKER_1:  Seeing what's missing so having a very systematic rigorous scientific process for understanding what is missing

01:33:58,370 --> 01:34:03,006
SPEAKER_1:  not what is missing in terms of to make it Earth-like, but what is missing in order to.

01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:05,182
SPEAKER_1:  be sufficiently.

01:34:05,634 --> 01:34:10,046
SPEAKER_1:  uh... have the spark or the capacity of the spark to launch the

01:34:11,458 --> 01:34:12,606
SPEAKER_1:  Evolution Revolution.

01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:18,366
SPEAKER_1:  the evolutionary process. Exactly. And then the question is, do we want to then...

01:34:20,194 --> 01:34:21,319
SPEAKER_1:  Complete the cocktail.

01:34:21,319 --> 01:34:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  BOO

01:34:22,370 --> 01:34:23,902
SPEAKER_0:  Proposition is to also.

01:34:24,162 --> 01:34:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  make us think that we will likely have this capacity at some point.

01:34:28,194 --> 01:34:30,014
SPEAKER_0:  especially when we understand.

01:34:31,010 --> 01:34:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  Origin of Life.

01:34:32,514 --> 01:34:33,214
SPEAKER_0:  better and better.

01:34:34,370 --> 01:34:36,990
SPEAKER_0:  So we will be asking ourselves this question.

01:34:37,474 --> 01:34:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  I guess I wanted to bring this to daylight a little bit because...

01:34:42,050 --> 01:34:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  maybe in 10, 20 years, maybe.

01:34:44,322 --> 01:34:44,798
SPEAKER_0:  more.

01:34:44,994 --> 01:34:47,838
SPEAKER_1:  So you wanted to ask the ethical question, should we?

01:34:48,898 --> 01:34:49,246
SPEAKER_1:  of.

01:34:49,826 --> 01:34:50,622
SPEAKER_1:  basically

01:34:51,010 --> 01:34:51,934
SPEAKER_1:  Start Life.

01:34:52,962 --> 01:34:54,087
SPEAKER_1:  elsewhere on an-

01:34:54,087 --> 01:34:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  or enabled.

01:34:56,386 --> 01:34:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  the chemical.

01:34:58,210 --> 01:35:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  the chemical capacity of that planet that it may one day itself.

01:35:02,754 --> 01:35:03,262
SPEAKER_0:  Get there.

01:35:03,874 --> 01:35:06,526
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so for me the answer is yes.

01:35:07,266 --> 01:35:07,870
SPEAKER_1:  So...

01:35:08,386 --> 01:35:12,158
SPEAKER_1:  If you were to try to argue against my yes, what would you say? Why not?

01:35:12,802 --> 01:35:14,238
SPEAKER_1:  What's the worst that could happen?

01:35:14,914 --> 01:35:17,502
SPEAKER_1:  if we seed another planet with life.

01:35:17,922 --> 01:35:18,878
SPEAKER_1:  What are the things we should...

01:35:19,138 --> 01:35:21,118
SPEAKER_1:  think about is your main concern.

01:35:21,730 --> 01:35:24,830
SPEAKER_1:  A chemical biological one or is it an ethical one?

01:35:25,378 --> 01:35:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  What do you think about the worst thing that can happen is that it wouldn't work.

01:35:28,834 --> 01:35:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  Right? So that's not a...

01:35:31,618 --> 01:35:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  So, likely.

01:35:33,506 --> 01:35:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  It's not likely that.

01:35:35,138 --> 01:35:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  any attempt like this would work.

01:35:37,218 --> 01:35:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  That's probably.

01:35:38,434 --> 01:35:39,230
SPEAKER_0:  Because how do you?

01:35:39,618 --> 01:35:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  You gotta be very, you know, you have to have an understanding that I don't think we have just yet.

01:35:45,794 --> 01:35:48,926
SPEAKER_1:  I see, because if it doesn't work, then we could try again.

01:35:49,570 --> 01:35:49,886
SPEAKER_1:  Right?

01:35:51,586 --> 01:35:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  to me.

01:35:52,994 --> 01:35:55,710
SPEAKER_1:  The worst case, the thing I would be worried about.

01:35:56,386 --> 01:35:56,766
SPEAKER_1:  is we

01:35:57,154 --> 01:35:58,174
SPEAKER_1:  Create life.

01:35:58,818 --> 01:36:00,190
SPEAKER_1:  I mean the same stuff I worry about.

01:36:00,642 --> 01:36:01,822
SPEAKER_1:  Like with plants or...

01:36:03,554 --> 01:36:06,206
SPEAKER_1:  is things that might have a conscious experience.

01:36:06,818 --> 01:36:07,390
SPEAKER_1:  And then.

01:36:08,770 --> 01:36:10,910
SPEAKER_1:  the dark aspect of life.

01:36:11,266 --> 01:36:11,710
SPEAKER_1:  is.

01:36:12,194 --> 01:36:14,718
SPEAKER_1:  Life is increasingly complex life.

01:36:15,586 --> 01:36:17,470
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe I'm anthropomorphizing, but...

01:36:17,762 --> 01:36:19,774
SPEAKER_1:  It seems to have the capacity to suffer.

01:36:21,122 --> 01:36:23,902
SPEAKER_1:  And so we're creating something.

01:36:24,898 --> 01:36:26,014
SPEAKER_1:  It's like when you have children.

01:36:26,626 --> 01:36:27,102
SPEAKER_1:  You put.

01:36:28,034 --> 01:36:29,662
SPEAKER_1:  creatures into this world.

01:36:31,202 --> 01:36:32,254
SPEAKER_1:  that...

01:36:32,834 --> 01:36:33,630
SPEAKER_1:  will suffer.

01:36:34,050 --> 01:36:34,750
SPEAKER_1:  can suffer.

01:36:35,362 --> 01:36:36,254
SPEAKER_1:  and may suffer.

01:36:36,866 --> 01:36:38,078
SPEAKER_1:  Depending on how you view life.

01:36:38,370 --> 01:36:39,582
SPEAKER_1:  may likely suffer.

01:36:40,066 --> 01:36:42,974
SPEAKER_1:  And so now you carry this responsibility for.

01:36:43,202 --> 01:36:46,398
SPEAKER_1:  doing your best to alleviate any suffering that might go through.

01:36:46,754 --> 01:36:47,518
SPEAKER_1:  And that...

01:36:48,066 --> 01:36:51,614
SPEAKER_1:  Perhaps it's a romanticizing this notion of life

01:36:52,450 --> 01:36:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  Perhaps bacteria are not capable of suffering.

01:36:55,298 --> 01:36:58,334
SPEAKER_1:  but perhaps it'll create more complex life forms that...

01:36:59,202 --> 01:37:00,446
SPEAKER_1:  would be able to suffer.

01:37:02,082 --> 01:37:04,830
SPEAKER_1:  And that feels like a responsibility as well.

01:37:05,378 --> 01:37:07,326
SPEAKER_1:  Of course, other people would be concerned.

01:37:07,714 --> 01:37:08,702
SPEAKER_1:  The more obvious.

01:37:08,962 --> 01:37:09,886
SPEAKER_1:  concern is like

01:37:10,434 --> 01:37:14,366
SPEAKER_1:  Well you just created a life form, how do you know it's not going to be a super deadly virus?

01:37:14,946 --> 01:37:15,294
SPEAKER_1:  that

01:37:15,714 --> 01:37:17,342
SPEAKER_1:  somehow is able to hurt humans.

01:37:17,762 --> 01:37:20,926
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, my concern is more. I feel like that's a solvable problem.

01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:22,270
SPEAKER_1:  The problem of

01:37:22,978 --> 01:37:26,334
SPEAKER_1:  creating conscious beings that are able to suffer. That's it.

01:37:26,594 --> 01:37:27,070
SPEAKER_1:  tricky one.

01:37:27,298 --> 01:37:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I can see why, because-

01:37:29,922 --> 01:37:32,286
SPEAKER_0:  It goes back to again, would we...

01:37:32,674 --> 01:37:33,342
SPEAKER_0:  First of all,

01:37:33,986 --> 01:37:34,462
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:37:34,946 --> 01:37:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  Do we have a responsibility?

01:37:37,282 --> 01:37:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  to.

01:37:38,722 --> 01:37:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  propagate more.

01:37:40,386 --> 01:37:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  of this chemistry that we have on this planet elsewhere.

01:37:44,962 --> 01:37:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  given that we know ultimately.

01:37:47,010 --> 01:37:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  We will.

01:37:48,066 --> 01:37:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  be vanished.

01:37:50,338 --> 01:37:51,838
SPEAKER_0:  By V, I mean the entire planet.

01:37:52,834 --> 01:37:56,382
SPEAKER_0:  And if this is in fact a very rare.

01:37:57,218 --> 01:37:58,078
SPEAKER_0:  chemical events.

01:37:58,402 --> 01:38:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  that happens because all the.

01:38:00,834 --> 01:38:03,966
SPEAKER_0:  right circumstances came together and we were lucky.

01:38:04,290 --> 01:38:04,606
SPEAKER_0:  One.

01:38:05,538 --> 01:38:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  do we have?

01:38:07,842 --> 01:38:09,822
SPEAKER_0:  a responsibility to sponsor it.

01:38:10,114 --> 01:38:11,166
SPEAKER_0:  This is it.

01:38:11,458 --> 01:38:12,766
SPEAKER_0:  If we were to back up.

01:38:12,898 --> 01:38:14,654
SPEAKER_1:  Sponsor, I like it.

01:38:14,882 --> 01:38:15,902
SPEAKER_1:  Let's go ahead and put it.

01:38:16,162 --> 01:38:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  If you try to...

01:38:18,530 --> 01:38:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  backup.

01:38:19,362 --> 01:38:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  remnants of our civilization, right? 곡

01:38:21,538 --> 01:38:22,238
SPEAKER_0:  Viva la...

01:38:22,914 --> 01:38:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  potentially.

01:38:24,258 --> 01:38:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  creates.

01:38:25,410 --> 01:38:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  conditions on different planets so that humans can survive given that we know that we want to just just for the sake of

01:38:34,658 --> 01:38:35,134
SPEAKER_0:  growing.

01:38:35,458 --> 01:38:36,446
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, propagating.

01:38:36,802 --> 01:38:38,677
SPEAKER_1:  becoming multipletaries.

01:38:38,677 --> 01:38:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  Exactly, but...

01:38:40,738 --> 01:38:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  really is at stake here, I think is actually, or what is really more interesting is.

01:38:45,826 --> 01:38:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  what we don't see.

01:38:47,298 --> 01:38:47,998
SPEAKER_0:  Which is the-

01:38:48,258 --> 01:38:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  again, that chemical behavior that enabled everything at first place.

01:38:52,450 --> 01:38:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  That's different then.

01:38:54,722 --> 01:38:56,030
SPEAKER_0:  sending potato crops.

01:38:56,322 --> 01:38:59,902
SPEAKER_0:  or engineering bacteria to live on different planet. That's very different.

01:39:00,578 --> 01:39:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  You're really good.

01:39:02,082 --> 01:39:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  stripping it down to...

01:39:03,970 --> 01:39:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  What is?

01:39:05,026 --> 01:39:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  what is possible at the chemical level. So even if you are instigating chemistry on different planets,

01:39:13,186 --> 01:39:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  you are letting that very planet to do its thing.

01:39:16,674 --> 01:39:20,542
SPEAKER_0:  you're not necessarily contaminating this planet with different chemistry because

01:39:20,962 --> 01:39:22,558
SPEAKER_0:  The idea behind this.

01:39:22,850 --> 01:39:23,934
SPEAKER_0:  At least the way I would-

01:39:24,642 --> 01:39:25,598
SPEAKER_0:  I thought about.

01:39:26,082 --> 01:39:32,062
SPEAKER_0:  is that you understand that planet, you understand the conditions, you understand the chemistry of the planet really well.

01:39:32,450 --> 01:39:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  Before...

01:39:34,626 --> 01:39:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  choosing.

01:39:35,682 --> 01:39:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  the planet is a candidate at first place.

01:39:38,338 --> 01:39:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  And then...

01:39:39,618 --> 01:39:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  It's not about sending a missing ingredient per se, but again, just sending more of what it already has.

01:39:47,202 --> 01:39:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  that would be respecting.

01:39:48,994 --> 01:39:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  that planet's condition to. So I'm not suggesting any occupation. I'm not suggesting any colonization. I'm not suggesting any.

01:39:56,290 --> 01:39:58,558
SPEAKER_0:  Like, let's just strip everything and make everything Earth-like.

01:39:59,490 --> 01:40:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  That's not what I'm saying.

01:40:00,834 --> 01:40:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  It's more about empowering that place.

01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  What's

01:40:04,482 --> 01:40:06,942
SPEAKER_0:  you are saying is likely to be.

01:40:08,354 --> 01:40:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  The motivator behind all this, that's not because I see suffering, I see pain.

01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  It's very interesting. I think this is a question that really reveals about.

01:40:17,794 --> 01:40:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  a lot about the person who's answering it.

01:40:20,066 --> 01:40:22,494
SPEAKER_1:  Well, OK, so the pushback on my.

01:40:23,202 --> 01:40:23,902
SPEAKER_1:  Push back.

01:40:25,026 --> 01:40:28,350
SPEAKER_1:  If I so am deeply troubled by suffering.

01:40:28,866 --> 01:40:32,382
SPEAKER_1:  then I should be probably paralyzed about the history of life on Earth.

01:40:33,698 --> 01:40:34,686
SPEAKER_1:  And, um...

01:40:35,330 --> 01:40:36,455
SPEAKER_1:  You know, there's...

01:40:36,455 --> 01:40:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  Can you elaborate? What do you mean?

01:40:38,754 --> 01:40:40,830
SPEAKER_1:  most of life who's ever lived.

01:40:41,666 --> 01:40:44,894
SPEAKER_1:  suffered in ways that are almost unimaginable to me.

01:40:45,378 --> 01:40:46,206
SPEAKER_1:  You mean, uh...

01:40:46,594 --> 01:40:48,455
SPEAKER_0:  like our own species.

01:40:48,455 --> 01:40:49,886
SPEAKER_1:  our own species than before.

01:40:50,242 --> 01:40:51,646
SPEAKER_1:  and animals living today.

01:40:51,970 --> 01:40:54,238
SPEAKER_1:  And we're not even talking about factory farms.

01:40:55,426 --> 01:40:57,086
SPEAKER_1:  uh... would just

01:40:57,442 --> 01:41:00,606
SPEAKER_1:  of animals living in extreme poverty in the jungle.

01:41:01,346 --> 01:41:05,758
SPEAKER_1:  You don't, people think like in a natural environment, animals live in a happy place.

01:41:06,146 --> 01:41:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  No, it's a brutal place.

01:41:08,354 --> 01:41:12,190
SPEAKER_1:  of desperately trying to survive, of desperately trying to look for food.

01:41:12,450 --> 01:41:17,118
SPEAKER_1:  And it's just like all of that life, that's just mammals. And we understand mammals, but like.

01:41:17,506 --> 01:41:18,110
SPEAKER_1:  throughout.

01:41:18,658 --> 01:41:20,414
SPEAKER_1:  like trillions of organisms.

01:41:20,802 --> 01:41:22,334
SPEAKER_1:  that led up to those mammals.

01:41:22,562 --> 01:41:25,374
SPEAKER_1:  and the organisms living everywhere, like even bacteria.

01:41:25,666 --> 01:41:26,814
SPEAKER_1:  There's death everywhere.

01:41:27,394 --> 01:41:30,750
SPEAKER_1:  So maybe this idea of death, this idea of suffering.

01:41:31,586 --> 01:41:34,206
SPEAKER_1:  is actually this thing that we see as a bug.

01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:36,318
SPEAKER_1:  is actually a feature.

01:41:37,346 --> 01:41:41,054
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think suffering is a linear property like that with life.

01:41:42,082 --> 01:41:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  And I may be with Nick Lane on this one, that the likeliness of anything similar to what we got here, evolving in another planetary body, I think is quite low.

01:41:51,842 --> 01:41:53,598
SPEAKER_1:  Where would you say is the look?

01:41:54,210 --> 01:41:59,345
SPEAKER_1:  the biggest unlikely thing. Do you mean humans or do you mean even multicellular organisms?

01:41:59,345 --> 01:42:01,342
SPEAKER_0:  probably mal Disney Learто

01:42:01,762 --> 01:42:02,814
SPEAKER_0:  It's a, but.

01:42:04,194 --> 01:42:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  I understand the-

01:42:06,722 --> 01:42:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  both sides of the

01:42:08,898 --> 01:42:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  equation, right? In one level, I can see that we may not have any other choice.

01:42:13,602 --> 01:42:14,494
SPEAKER_0:  But too.

01:42:16,034 --> 01:42:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  uh, back up this chemistry somewhere else.

01:42:19,426 --> 01:42:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. So you would be saving it's the ultimate safe saving or the record our own record. It's not about.

01:42:26,178 --> 01:42:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  you know, yes, let's also save.

01:42:28,898 --> 01:42:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  Beatles and all the amazing songs. But.

01:42:31,810 --> 01:42:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  This would be the ultimate.

01:42:33,154 --> 01:42:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  repository of life.

01:42:35,778 --> 01:42:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  but I can also see your point of view.

01:42:38,978 --> 01:42:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  For sure.

01:42:39,650 --> 01:42:41,278
SPEAKER_1:  It's really interesting, so like.

01:42:41,730 --> 01:42:43,774
SPEAKER_1:  Don't see to plan with the missing ingredient.

01:42:44,546 --> 01:42:46,974
SPEAKER_1:  try to understand what the ingredients it has.

01:42:47,682 --> 01:42:49,534
SPEAKER_1:  Is it possible to construct life?

01:42:51,138 --> 01:42:53,470
SPEAKER_1:  For me, from a computer person.

01:42:53,762 --> 01:42:56,318
SPEAKER_1:  It just feels like something that could be solved computationally.

01:42:56,898 --> 01:42:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  we can learn from the mistakes that we've done.

01:42:59,650 --> 01:43:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  here.

01:43:00,354 --> 01:43:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:43:01,346 --> 01:43:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  aspire not to repeat them.

01:43:03,842 --> 01:43:04,286
SPEAKER_0:  It is.

01:43:04,514 --> 01:43:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  possible.

01:43:05,346 --> 01:43:10,558
SPEAKER_0:  We do amazing things as humans. There's a lot of suffering, but there's also a lot of beauty.

01:43:11,042 --> 01:43:12,766
SPEAKER_0:  we could choose.

01:43:14,114 --> 01:43:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  what we want to be or what we want to...

01:43:17,378 --> 01:43:17,758
SPEAKER_0:  No.

01:43:19,842 --> 01:43:25,246
SPEAKER_0:  see, right? So these attempts don't need not to come from a place of fear.

01:43:25,890 --> 01:43:28,926
SPEAKER_0:  but it can be ultimately, it can come from a piece of hope and love.

01:43:29,186 --> 01:43:35,774
SPEAKER_1:  I think we're just very recently figuring out stuff like we've even just a century ago we're doing atrocities that.

01:43:36,162 --> 01:43:37,950
SPEAKER_1:  weren't seen as atrocities at the time.

01:43:38,498 --> 01:43:38,942
SPEAKER_1:  I mean...

01:43:39,298 --> 01:43:39,870
SPEAKER_1:  Edited

01:43:40,194 --> 01:43:42,819
SPEAKER_1:  I think we're learning very quickly of what is right.

01:43:42,819 --> 01:43:44,926
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, and I work with a lot of

01:43:45,506 --> 01:43:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe because I'm at the university, I get to teach.

01:43:48,866 --> 01:43:50,558
SPEAKER_0:  young people every day.

01:43:51,138 --> 01:43:51,518
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:43:51,874 --> 01:43:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  Even at the...

01:43:53,282 --> 01:43:53,630
SPEAKER_0:  time of.

01:43:54,722 --> 01:43:57,246
SPEAKER_0:  four years or three few years you see.

01:43:58,210 --> 01:43:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  Ew.

01:43:59,778 --> 01:44:02,750
SPEAKER_0:  generational difference already unfolding in front of you.

01:44:03,394 --> 01:44:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:44:04,002 --> 01:44:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe that's why I-

01:44:05,346 --> 01:44:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  See hope because

01:44:06,914 --> 01:44:08,702
SPEAKER_0:  I think what we...

01:44:09,122 --> 01:44:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  get to interact within classrooms.

01:44:11,682 --> 01:44:12,350
SPEAKER_0:  Every year.

01:44:12,578 --> 01:44:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  It's just getting better.

01:44:14,050 --> 01:44:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  day.

01:44:14,786 --> 01:44:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  are aware of issues in a way that I sure wasn't.

01:44:18,306 --> 01:44:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  Day Rage.

01:44:19,458 --> 01:44:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  In some levels I was, but in many levels I...

01:44:22,178 --> 01:44:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  didn't think about.

01:44:23,586 --> 01:44:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  I wasn't concerned of the problems. Well,

01:44:26,498 --> 01:44:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  they maybe have to be concerned because it's...

01:44:29,474 --> 01:44:31,646
SPEAKER_0:  hitting the reality, he's hitting them hard.

01:44:33,186 --> 01:44:36,222
SPEAKER_0:  Younger people are not afraid of these things an 18 year old can face.

01:44:36,610 --> 01:44:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  these brutal facts about the planet in ways that

01:44:39,458 --> 01:44:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think any other generation before them did.

01:44:41,954 --> 01:44:44,158
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, super cool. And like the, uh,

01:44:45,314 --> 01:44:49,630
SPEAKER_1:  You know, there's all these cool technologies that aid in the process.

01:44:50,274 --> 01:44:51,774
SPEAKER_1:  of a human being.

01:44:53,154 --> 01:44:58,078
SPEAKER_1:  being able to see the truth at deeper, deeper levels like Wikipedia and just the internet in general.

01:44:58,402 --> 01:45:01,777
SPEAKER_1:  is enabling education at a level that was unimaginable before the...

01:45:01,777 --> 01:45:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  internet. Yes and I think space exploration.

01:45:04,834 --> 01:45:08,254
SPEAKER_0:  Even contemplating about these possibilities ultimately...

01:45:08,706 --> 01:45:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  And I will-

01:45:09,538 --> 01:45:13,022
SPEAKER_0:  Emphasize this again, should make us think about our wrong place.

01:45:13,410 --> 01:45:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  in the universe. If we are alone, that is quite fascinating and we definitely have a responsibility to

01:45:20,194 --> 01:45:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  Guard what we got better and protect it better and don't take it for granted.

01:45:24,098 --> 01:45:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  If you're not the only one, that's also a lot of responsibility to understand.

01:45:28,962 --> 01:45:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  What else is out there?

01:45:30,690 --> 01:45:33,342
SPEAKER_0:  either proposition as famously being told.

01:45:33,826 --> 01:45:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  It's fascinating.

01:45:36,386 --> 01:45:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  Is a.

01:45:37,154 --> 01:45:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  As a scientist, I think.

01:45:39,362 --> 01:45:46,014
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that's the general behavior. Maybe not my fellow scientists listening to this can correct me if they aren't like this, but, to actually dig in I wonder which Brand Maybe I am aware

01:45:46,658 --> 01:45:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  You need to have a level of optimism.

01:45:48,802 --> 01:45:49,726
SPEAKER_0:  and hope.

01:45:50,178 --> 01:45:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  That's something, you know, that...

01:45:52,322 --> 01:45:54,302
SPEAKER_0:  things are worth working for.

01:45:54,690 --> 01:45:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  worth dreaming.

01:45:56,098 --> 01:45:58,398
SPEAKER_0:  worth imagining and we cannot just have.

01:45:58,658 --> 01:46:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  fear of suffering or fear of...

01:46:00,802 --> 01:46:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  pain.

01:46:02,082 --> 01:46:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  stopping us from.

01:46:04,290 --> 01:46:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  doing marvelous things.

01:46:05,890 --> 01:46:10,334
SPEAKER_1:  I've talked to quite a few people in my life who've gotten a lot of shit done.

01:46:10,882 --> 01:46:12,510
SPEAKER_1:  have helped a lot of people.

01:46:13,058 --> 01:46:13,694
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:46:14,146 --> 01:46:16,862
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know a single one of them who's not an optimist.

01:46:18,050 --> 01:46:21,310
SPEAKER_1:  There's a place for critics and cynicism in this world, but...

01:46:21,730 --> 01:46:23,966
SPEAKER_1:  in terms of actually building things.

01:46:24,418 --> 01:46:27,486
SPEAKER_1:  and creating things in this world that help a lot of people.

01:46:28,194 --> 01:46:35,134
SPEAKER_1:  I think optimism is a requirement, is a precondition in almost all cases. In my limited.

01:46:36,098 --> 01:46:37,662
SPEAKER_1:  humble human experience.

01:46:38,274 --> 01:46:41,694
SPEAKER_1:  But I tend to, when I look out there, think that aliens are everywhere.

01:46:42,274 --> 01:46:43,230
SPEAKER_1:  I think there's...

01:46:45,090 --> 01:46:47,038
SPEAKER_1:  To me, I have a humility about.

01:46:47,298 --> 01:46:48,830
SPEAKER_1:  I tend to see us humans as

01:46:49,346 --> 01:46:51,294
SPEAKER_1:  being very limited cognitively.

01:46:52,514 --> 01:46:54,974
SPEAKER_1:  Like there's so many things we don't understand.

01:46:55,874 --> 01:47:00,382
SPEAKER_1:  I think eventually we'll understand. Of course we don't know this, but my gut says-

01:47:01,218 --> 01:47:02,526
SPEAKER_1:  we'll understand that.

01:47:02,786 --> 01:47:04,094
SPEAKER_1:  Alien Signals

01:47:04,514 --> 01:47:05,342
SPEAKER_1:  and life.

01:47:05,698 --> 01:47:07,102
SPEAKER_1:  has been all around us.

01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:09,534
SPEAKER_1:  and we're too dumb to see it.

01:47:10,818 --> 01:47:11,134
SPEAKER_1:  like.

01:47:11,682 --> 01:47:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  whatever life is, whatever the life force is, whatever consciousness is, whatever intelligence, or whatever the...

01:47:17,442 --> 01:47:18,526
SPEAKER_1:  The mechanism.

01:47:19,330 --> 01:47:22,942
SPEAKER_1:  that led to the origin of life on Earth was everywhere.

01:47:23,746 --> 01:47:25,342
SPEAKER_1:  or we're just too dumb to see it.

01:47:25,634 --> 01:47:29,246
SPEAKER_1:  It's in the physics. It's somewhere, we'll find it somewhere in the physics.

01:47:30,498 --> 01:47:32,510
SPEAKER_0:  I think that's one of the most...

01:47:33,474 --> 01:47:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  is humbling parts of

01:47:35,394 --> 01:47:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  also being a scientist.

01:47:37,250 --> 01:47:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  that we know.

01:47:38,338 --> 01:47:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  that we never know.

01:47:40,098 --> 01:47:40,542
SPEAKER_0:  for sure.

01:47:41,154 --> 01:47:42,494
SPEAKER_0:  and for the...

01:47:43,490 --> 01:47:46,430
SPEAKER_0:  outsiders perhaps. That may be a very...

01:47:46,978 --> 01:47:47,390
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:47:48,354 --> 01:47:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  Strange.

01:47:49,378 --> 01:47:50,110
SPEAKER_0:  The way of living.

01:47:50,978 --> 01:47:52,766
SPEAKER_0:  especially when you're...

01:47:53,058 --> 01:47:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  pursue is about creating knowledge.

01:47:55,842 --> 01:47:59,006
SPEAKER_0:  and that you'll know that what you created can also be.

01:47:59,394 --> 01:48:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  and hopefully will be.

01:48:01,506 --> 01:48:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  disproven.

01:48:02,562 --> 01:48:03,870
SPEAKER_0:  So that another level.

01:48:04,130 --> 01:48:04,830
SPEAKER_0:  will rise.

01:48:05,506 --> 01:48:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  Boom.

01:48:06,242 --> 01:48:08,798
SPEAKER_0:  And I think we've seen that.

01:48:09,154 --> 01:48:11,070
SPEAKER_0:  this lack of maybe connection.

01:48:11,842 --> 01:48:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  between the approach to science or knowledge.

01:48:14,658 --> 01:48:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  versus.

01:48:16,386 --> 01:48:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  folks who are maybe not thinking about these problems every day.

01:48:19,202 --> 01:48:20,638
SPEAKER_0:  We are okay with being wrong.

01:48:21,250 --> 01:48:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  In fact, we know that's the only way to...

01:48:24,418 --> 01:48:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  pushed the limits of knowledge.

01:48:27,554 --> 01:48:30,558
SPEAKER_1:  How do you think life originated on Earth? We've talked about this.

01:48:31,234 --> 01:48:33,630
SPEAKER_1:  but do you have a gut feeling about?

01:48:34,498 --> 01:48:39,134
SPEAKER_1:  First of all, actually even to step back, do you think because you were like flirting with this idea.

01:48:39,490 --> 01:48:41,854
SPEAKER_1:  Did the translation mechanism came before life?

01:48:42,786 --> 01:48:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  I think that you cannot separate.

01:48:44,706 --> 01:48:45,438
SPEAKER_0:  from...

01:48:45,666 --> 01:48:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  emergence of translation machinery from emergence of life or something like translation machinery, this whole

01:48:52,322 --> 01:48:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  Informatic.

01:48:53,506 --> 01:48:55,294
SPEAKER_0:  chemical computing system.

01:48:55,746 --> 01:48:57,438
SPEAKER_0:  that is also capable of.

01:48:57,954 --> 01:49:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  dynamism and evolvability that comes with biology.

01:49:02,242 --> 01:49:03,870
SPEAKER_0:  biological behavior.

01:49:04,130 --> 01:49:05,758
SPEAKER_0:  from emergence of life itself.

01:49:06,274 --> 01:49:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  We've definitely...

01:49:07,970 --> 01:49:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  took a lot of steps towards understanding origins.

01:49:11,714 --> 01:49:14,238
SPEAKER_0:  able to create molecules from.

01:49:15,138 --> 01:49:15,806
SPEAKER_0:  Right.

01:49:16,674 --> 01:49:18,462
SPEAKER_0:  environment's lightening heat.

01:49:19,202 --> 01:49:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  and you make amino acids. So we are able to create the building blocks, the Miller-Urey experiment.

01:49:25,762 --> 01:49:27,678
SPEAKER_0:  That's now 60 years ago.

01:49:28,930 --> 01:49:36,222
SPEAKER_0:  we are able to create the building blocks. We are able to make them interact with one another. They can get more complex some.

01:49:36,770 --> 01:49:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  this messy, there's all this chemistry that's going on, we are able to.

01:49:41,442 --> 01:49:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  have these chemicals interact with one another maybe.

01:49:44,482 --> 01:49:45,278
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:49:47,042 --> 01:49:49,758
SPEAKER_0:  have even some emergent properties that we can quantify.

01:49:51,746 --> 01:50:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  Definitely there is this trend towards more systems-level approach to origins, with more introduction of systems-level chemistry.

01:50:00,578 --> 01:50:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  or network level chemistry.

01:50:02,402 --> 01:50:04,702
SPEAKER_0:  and complex system integration.

01:50:05,058 --> 01:50:13,694
SPEAKER_0:  in order to understand how, now that we can make these building blocks, we can make them interact with one another, but how do we make them interact with one another in more intelligent ways that will...

01:50:14,818 --> 01:50:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  properties of a biological system will be heritable.

01:50:17,890 --> 01:50:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  it will be responding to the environment.

01:50:19,906 --> 01:50:22,206
SPEAKER_0:  it will mutate and it will sustain itself.

01:50:23,234 --> 01:50:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  That is the final bit, I think, in our original life adventure.

01:50:30,082 --> 01:50:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  We are extremely close. I'm very optimistic that our community will.

01:50:34,178 --> 01:50:36,766
SPEAKER_0:  get a handle of this problem in this decade.

01:50:37,186 --> 01:50:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  This is in fact, I think one of the most exciting times to be doing this work.

01:50:41,058 --> 01:50:43,678
SPEAKER_1:  What would be super convincing to you, like?

01:50:44,066 --> 01:50:45,982
SPEAKER_1:  incredibly amazing

01:50:46,274 --> 01:50:47,806
SPEAKER_1:  would blow your mind.

01:50:48,386 --> 01:50:49,886
SPEAKER_1:  if it was done.

01:50:50,850 --> 01:50:52,030
SPEAKER_1:  X was done in the lab.

01:50:52,482 --> 01:50:53,150
SPEAKER_1:  Like what?

01:50:54,562 --> 01:51:03,015
SPEAKER_1:  would you I mean I don't know if you would call it origin of life but something really truly remarkable and special done in the lab. What would that look like to you?

01:51:03,015 --> 01:51:03,678
SPEAKER_0:  The- the- the-

01:51:03,906 --> 01:51:06,622
SPEAKER_0:  properties that I listed. This was five.

01:51:06,946 --> 01:51:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  properties that I listed about and the machinery that is capable of.

01:51:11,042 --> 01:51:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  sensing and responding the environment.

01:51:13,218 --> 01:51:14,078
SPEAKER_0:  If we can.

01:51:14,370 --> 01:51:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  Ehmm.

01:51:15,746 --> 01:51:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  I would imagine.

01:51:17,570 --> 01:51:20,510
SPEAKER_0:  is similar to Miller-Urey experiment where they...

01:51:21,442 --> 01:51:23,966
SPEAKER_0:  only sparked in the

01:51:24,514 --> 01:51:26,814
SPEAKER_0:  particular environmental forces and were able to

01:51:27,362 --> 01:51:29,118
SPEAKER_0:  produce a chemical.

01:51:29,378 --> 01:51:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  that is important for a mix of

01:51:31,490 --> 01:51:33,182
SPEAKER_0:  Chemicals are important for life.

01:51:33,794 --> 01:51:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  or building blocks, rather.

01:51:35,522 --> 01:51:35,966
SPEAKER_0:  I would-

01:51:36,610 --> 01:51:43,518
SPEAKER_0:  If I saw that a similar experiment where a well-defined geochemical parameter was

01:51:44,034 --> 01:51:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  subjected on a mix of chemistry.

01:51:46,818 --> 01:51:47,742
SPEAKER_0:

01:51:48,482 --> 01:51:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  chemistry too.

01:51:50,306 --> 01:51:50,718
SPEAKER_0:  forum.

01:51:51,394 --> 01:51:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  some level of

01:51:52,482 --> 01:51:54,046
SPEAKER_0:  Computation Informatic.

01:51:54,306 --> 01:51:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  biological property and by biological I'm going to keep it to very minimum.

01:51:58,530 --> 01:51:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:51:59,394 --> 01:52:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  as I defined early on.

01:52:01,922 --> 01:52:02,366
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:52:02,850 --> 01:52:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  That would be super exciting to me, is self-organizing.

01:52:06,434 --> 01:52:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  chemistry.

01:52:07,426 --> 01:52:09,822
SPEAKER_0:  that we can create experimentally in a flask.

01:52:10,210 --> 01:52:11,454
SPEAKER_0:  by simulating.

01:52:12,034 --> 01:52:16,190
SPEAKER_0:  the conditions of early Earth, be it radiation, be it temperature or...

01:52:16,418 --> 01:52:17,310
SPEAKER_0:  Mix of both.

01:52:17,762 --> 01:52:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  Oh.

01:52:19,042 --> 01:52:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  That would be very cool.

01:52:20,258 --> 01:52:25,278
SPEAKER_1:  And doing all the five, the chemical, physical, informatic, computational biology. Yes.

01:52:26,274 --> 01:52:26,846
SPEAKER_1:  So like-

01:52:27,106 --> 01:52:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  simulation.

01:52:28,450 --> 01:52:30,174
SPEAKER_1:  And a computer would not... No.

01:52:30,658 --> 01:52:35,934
SPEAKER_0:  It would be great because they help to understand the parameters.

01:52:36,514 --> 01:52:39,518
SPEAKER_0:  maybe formulate, maybe quantify, create models.

01:52:39,746 --> 01:52:41,278
SPEAKER_0:  but ultimately you need to experiment.

01:52:41,698 --> 01:52:47,198
SPEAKER_1:  Unless it's quantum mechanical simulation, but that's going to be extremely difficult. So, let's start by doing some simple simulation from the physics app.

01:52:47,650 --> 01:52:49,630
SPEAKER_1:  That's going to be very...

01:52:49,922 --> 01:52:51,262
SPEAKER_1:  because you're gonna have to simulate.

01:52:51,874 --> 01:52:56,574
SPEAKER_1:  the physical the chemical the informatics i mean honestly it's.

01:52:56,962 --> 01:53:00,510
SPEAKER_1:  It's very difficult to start the quantum mechanics.

01:53:01,090 --> 01:53:02,494
SPEAKER_1:  and end up in biology.

01:53:02,850 --> 01:53:04,094
SPEAKER_1:  alter simulation.

01:53:04,418 --> 01:53:09,118
SPEAKER_1:  But the stuff that DeepMind did with AlphaFold and the protein folding is really inspiring. The

01:53:10,082 --> 01:53:11,166
SPEAKER_1:  It's inspiring in that.

01:53:11,906 --> 01:53:13,086
SPEAKER_1:  you're able to do.

01:53:13,442 --> 01:53:14,567
SPEAKER_1:  to solve a difficult biode.

01:53:14,567 --> 01:53:20,958
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, absolutely. That's why there's definitely a lot of benefit to those models, predictions.

01:53:21,282 --> 01:53:25,086
SPEAKER_0:  because they at least helped the experimentalist.

01:53:25,506 --> 01:53:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  to come up with the priors and parameterize things better, maybe eliminate.

01:53:30,562 --> 01:53:31,294
SPEAKER_0:  very obvious.

01:53:31,778 --> 01:53:36,734
SPEAKER_0:  dead ends early on, given that experiments take such a long time and it's a huge investment.

01:53:37,346 --> 01:53:37,854
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:53:38,498 --> 01:53:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  and no one's a better

01:53:39,586 --> 01:53:41,150
SPEAKER_0:  experimentalist in nature.

01:53:42,178 --> 01:53:43,966
SPEAKER_1:  Let me ask you, perhaps.

01:53:44,770 --> 01:53:45,726
SPEAKER_1:  pressing sad.

01:53:45,922 --> 01:53:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  I really want to make me say, you're not going to win.

01:53:49,250 --> 01:53:49,918
SPEAKER_1:  I know.

01:53:50,274 --> 01:53:53,694
SPEAKER_1:  There's a flame of optimism in you that will never be extinguished. Okay.

01:53:54,306 --> 01:53:54,974
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:53:55,554 --> 01:53:56,990
SPEAKER_1:  The idea of past permeate.

01:53:58,114 --> 01:53:58,974
SPEAKER_1:  You mentioned...

01:53:59,682 --> 01:54:02,046
SPEAKER_1:  Would we seed another planet with life?

01:54:02,562 --> 01:54:04,222
SPEAKER_1:  Is it possible that our planet

01:54:04,898 --> 01:54:06,773
SPEAKER_1:  or seeded with life from elsewhere.

01:54:06,773 --> 01:54:07,390
SPEAKER_0:  So what?

01:54:07,650 --> 01:54:08,222
SPEAKER_0:  DOOP

01:54:08,450 --> 01:54:09,886
SPEAKER_0:  the proposition I made.

01:54:10,626 --> 01:54:17,310
SPEAKER_0:  like to think of it as protospermia rather than panspermia because it's even more, it's more proto-state than

01:54:17,826 --> 01:54:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  acknowledging because in Panspermia you still have

01:54:21,666 --> 01:54:22,270
SPEAKER_0:  itself.

01:54:23,106 --> 01:54:27,390
SPEAKER_0:  Right? You still have something that is very, even the cell to me would be very Earth-like.

01:54:28,162 --> 01:54:28,926
SPEAKER_0:  Right, I'm...

01:54:29,538 --> 01:54:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  I'm talking at sub-sailor level in the proposition of...

01:54:34,594 --> 01:54:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  is.

01:54:36,162 --> 01:54:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  spreading chemistry.

01:54:37,570 --> 01:54:39,806
SPEAKER_1:  So spreading chemical ingredients, not spreading life.

01:54:40,386 --> 01:54:43,838
SPEAKER_0:  Exactly. It will be more like the fertilizer that is well...

01:54:44,226 --> 01:54:48,414
SPEAKER_0:  Adopted and compatible with that plant everybody in Panspermia you're still.

01:54:48,770 --> 01:54:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  imagining either an entire bacteria.

01:54:50,946 --> 01:54:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  or microbe.

01:54:51,906 --> 01:54:54,878
SPEAKER_0:  or a cell or something that is DNA, which is still...

01:54:55,330 --> 01:54:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  Terran.

01:54:56,002 --> 01:54:57,726
SPEAKER_1:  So that sounds that would.

01:54:58,690 --> 01:55:04,894
SPEAKER_1:  That doesn't matter to you because it's chemistry, that's the initial conditions, doesn't matter how the initial conditions came to be.

01:55:05,186 --> 01:55:07,070
SPEAKER_1:  they are where they are and let's go from there.

01:55:07,618 --> 01:55:10,782
SPEAKER_1:  and there's all kinds of fascinatingly different.

01:55:11,458 --> 01:55:13,333
SPEAKER_1:  initial conditions in terms of chemistry.

01:55:13,333 --> 01:55:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  from planets. But in terms of past premium, obviously that's-

01:55:17,314 --> 01:55:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  There's going to be always...

01:55:19,010 --> 01:55:19,838
SPEAKER_0:  Room 4

01:55:20,290 --> 01:55:22,718
SPEAKER_0:  that those sort of discussions or there will be.

01:55:23,234 --> 01:55:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  Ew.

01:55:24,322 --> 01:55:26,974
SPEAKER_0:  Those discussions will always be present, I think, in any...

01:55:27,202 --> 01:55:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  life in the universe.

01:55:29,090 --> 01:55:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  Debates?

01:55:30,178 --> 01:55:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  But the problem I have is...

01:55:32,514 --> 01:55:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  PENSPREMIER is that it removes the problem from...

01:55:36,450 --> 01:55:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  the planet to somewhere else.

01:55:38,050 --> 01:55:38,750
SPEAKER_0:  It makes it.

01:55:40,258 --> 01:55:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  very difficult to answer scientifically.

01:55:43,522 --> 01:55:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  You just took the problem away from this planet.

01:55:47,138 --> 01:55:48,254
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

01:55:49,314 --> 01:55:51,710
SPEAKER_0:  formulated in a way that I cannot go and...

01:55:52,418 --> 01:55:53,406
SPEAKER_0:  try to understand.

01:55:53,634 --> 01:55:56,743
SPEAKER_0:  in the lab doing experiments or even through models.

01:55:56,743 --> 01:55:57,566
SPEAKER_1:  Self-Herd.

01:55:57,794 --> 01:56:01,022
SPEAKER_1:  Brilliant biologists like yourself say that, but I just.

01:56:01,410 --> 01:56:02,110
SPEAKER_1:  To me.

01:56:02,946 --> 01:56:04,414
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, here's how I think of Earth.

01:56:05,026 --> 01:56:08,702
SPEAKER_1:  So I actually am able to hold all these possibilities in my head.

01:56:09,026 --> 01:56:10,782
SPEAKER_1:  and all of them are inspiring to me.

01:56:11,202 --> 01:56:14,398
SPEAKER_1:  I kind of think there's a possibility that Earth is just...

01:56:14,754 --> 01:56:18,750
SPEAKER_1:  an experiment by a graduate student, by an alien graduate student.

01:56:19,458 --> 01:56:22,878
SPEAKER_0:  So I know the exact episode of Star Trek you're talking about.

01:56:23,618 --> 01:56:26,206
SPEAKER_1:  But like there is some, to me that's inspiring.

01:56:26,818 --> 01:56:27,902
SPEAKER_1:  If we are...

01:56:28,130 --> 01:56:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  But that's not what Panspermia is about.

01:56:31,522 --> 01:56:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  You're talking about...

01:56:32,802 --> 01:56:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  My proposition. That's not what pen's permea is.

01:56:35,330 --> 01:56:37,205
SPEAKER_0:  What's Pinsbury? It just... Also if you perhaps noticed I didn't actually lose to the other players Yeah

01:56:37,205 --> 01:56:38,622
SPEAKER_1:  Life just came from elsewhere.

01:56:39,458 --> 01:56:41,054
SPEAKER_1:  still that's interesting because

01:56:41,282 --> 01:56:44,990
SPEAKER_1:  There's still giant leaps that happened on Earth, it seems like.

01:56:45,794 --> 01:56:48,318
SPEAKER_1:  beyond the initial primitive organisms, like.

01:56:48,418 --> 01:56:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think fans spur me up usually.

01:56:53,122 --> 01:56:53,662
SPEAKER_0:  Eugh.

01:56:54,146 --> 01:56:57,598
SPEAKER_0:  articulates at the level of eukaryotes. I think they talk about...

01:56:58,242 --> 01:57:00,030
SPEAKER_0:  bacteria primarily.

01:57:00,354 --> 01:57:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  I think so. Right.

01:57:01,634 --> 01:57:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  Mm-hmm.

01:57:02,114 --> 01:57:06,989
SPEAKER_1:  So that's still interesting because all the different leaps of evolution still happen here on earth. That's still interesting.

01:57:06,989 --> 01:57:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  But it's...

01:57:08,706 --> 01:57:10,558
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's definitely...

01:57:12,194 --> 01:57:14,590
SPEAKER_0:  interesting to listen to, but I wouldn't.

01:57:15,106 --> 01:57:20,731
SPEAKER_0:  place it in, I wouldn't know how to place it in the studies of original life, I guess.

01:57:20,731 --> 01:57:21,470
SPEAKER_1:  replace it.

01:57:21,698 --> 01:57:23,230
SPEAKER_1:  You have the initial conditions.

01:57:23,490 --> 01:57:24,574
SPEAKER_1:  for the origin of life?

01:57:24,834 --> 01:57:25,758
SPEAKER_1:  and you try to...

01:57:26,338 --> 01:57:31,262
SPEAKER_1:  create life in that way that you've described in the five components, and it keeps failing.

01:57:32,066 --> 01:57:32,382
SPEAKER_1:  See.

01:57:32,706 --> 01:57:34,974
SPEAKER_1:  what what pants permeate allows you to do

01:57:35,330 --> 01:57:37,438
SPEAKER_1:  Is this also considered a question?

01:57:38,946 --> 01:57:40,821
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe there's missing components.

01:57:40,821 --> 01:57:42,302
SPEAKER_0:  How do you answer that question?

01:57:43,202 --> 01:57:48,094
SPEAKER_1:  through exploration, through science, looking outside, looking outside of earth.

01:57:48,418 --> 01:57:50,293
SPEAKER_1:  looking at the fundamentals of chemistry.

01:57:50,293 --> 01:57:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  in physics. Do you understand that with fundamentals of chemistry in physics?

01:57:55,362 --> 01:57:56,318
SPEAKER_1:  How do you understand?

01:57:56,770 --> 01:58:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  How do you understand gravity? But you're talking about panspermia, right? Just, I don't understand how would you-

01:58:02,626 --> 01:58:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  It's different than if you think it's similar to looking for life.

01:58:06,434 --> 01:58:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  in the universe. Is that what you're thinking?

01:58:08,770 --> 01:58:10,645
SPEAKER_1:  No, I'm saying there's a missing component.

01:58:10,645 --> 01:58:11,710
SPEAKER_0:  that came from elsewhere.

01:58:12,578 --> 01:58:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  A whole entire organism is not a missing component right there, right? I mean, when you're thinking about Origin of Life.

01:58:17,282 --> 01:58:24,574
SPEAKER_1:  No, no, no, that's an assumption. Your assumption is all the ingredients for the origin of life are here on Earth.

01:58:25,250 --> 01:58:27,710
SPEAKER_1:  I tend to believe that most likely that's the case.

01:58:28,066 --> 01:58:29,918
SPEAKER_1:  I'm just saying it's inspiring.

01:58:30,370 --> 01:58:32,574
SPEAKER_1:  to think that there is some ingredients.

01:58:33,410 --> 01:58:36,126
SPEAKER_1:  You're going to push back because that's not past program. It's desperation and it's the other way.

01:58:36,354 --> 01:58:37,479
SPEAKER_1:  But...

01:58:37,479 --> 01:58:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  See, okay, so think...

01:58:40,482 --> 01:58:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  But yeah.

01:58:41,186 --> 01:58:48,958
SPEAKER_1:  It's also kind of fun to push back on you. No, I understand, I understand. If actually a living organism.

01:58:49,858 --> 01:58:51,614
SPEAKER_1:  ended up here from elsewhere.

01:58:52,034 --> 01:58:56,158
SPEAKER_1:  That means a lot of the exploration we're doing here with the ingredients that we know.

01:58:56,610 --> 01:58:58,878
SPEAKER_1:  will not give us the clues to the...

01:58:59,586 --> 01:59:00,190
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:59:00,578 --> 01:59:01,790
SPEAKER_1:  to the origin of life.

01:59:02,914 --> 01:59:03,934
SPEAKER_1:  It just seems like...

01:59:05,922 --> 01:59:08,318
SPEAKER_1:  It's still very useful to try to create.

01:59:09,026 --> 01:59:10,206
SPEAKER_1:  life here.

01:59:10,434 --> 01:59:11,966
SPEAKER_1:  and then we'll see, wait a minute.

01:59:12,386 --> 01:59:13,790
SPEAKER_1:  Don't you think we'll be able to-

01:59:14,722 --> 01:59:17,918
SPEAKER_1:  prove, not prove, but show that past sperm is very likely.

01:59:18,722 --> 01:59:20,158
SPEAKER_1:  Like if we just keep failing.

01:59:20,514 --> 01:59:21,639
SPEAKER_1:  We understand biology.

01:59:21,639 --> 01:59:25,310
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think so.

01:59:26,082 --> 01:59:31,006
SPEAKER_0:  The failure is not going to indicate that this must have been.

01:59:31,490 --> 01:59:32,542
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think anyone...

01:59:32,994 --> 01:59:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  will put the problem to something else just because our failures, our experiments failed.

01:59:39,714 --> 01:59:42,339
SPEAKER_1:  So failure means we don't understand chemistry deeply enough.

01:59:42,339 --> 01:59:45,054
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, and we've given the progress we made.

01:59:45,602 --> 01:59:48,190
SPEAKER_0:  and how many billions of people are working on this right now.

01:59:48,674 --> 01:59:50,718
SPEAKER_0:  and it's definitely more

01:59:51,778 --> 01:59:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  I would say that we are approaching this problem in more...

01:59:54,754 --> 01:59:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  broader ways, different ways possible.

01:59:57,506 --> 02:00:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  I'm confident that we will get there for us. Again, we are interested in...

02:00:03,554 --> 02:00:06,814
SPEAKER_0:  early cells and first cells and what followed the origin of life, but we cannot

02:00:07,330 --> 02:00:10,718
SPEAKER_0:  given that it's a continuum that's the between...

02:00:10,946 --> 02:00:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  origin and emergence of first cells.

02:00:13,730 --> 02:00:16,510
SPEAKER_0:  it's hard to separate these two ends.

02:00:16,866 --> 02:00:18,910
SPEAKER_1:  from one another. Given that life is a-

02:00:19,266 --> 02:00:20,958
SPEAKER_1:  solution to a chemistry problem.

02:00:21,442 --> 02:00:23,614
SPEAKER_1:  if we re-ran Earth.

02:00:24,034 --> 02:00:26,014
SPEAKER_1:  a million times how different would

02:00:27,426 --> 02:00:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  the results be.

02:00:29,314 --> 02:00:30,750
SPEAKER_1:  if we look at that wheel.

02:00:31,842 --> 02:00:35,806
SPEAKER_1:  How different would be the tree of life do you think? Like what's your gut say?

02:00:37,538 --> 02:00:37,886
SPEAKER_0:  My-

02:00:38,178 --> 02:00:39,902
SPEAKER_0:  uh, mind asks

02:00:40,482 --> 02:00:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  Are you imagining if we're repeating the planet one million?

02:00:44,610 --> 02:00:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  times. Are we?

02:00:46,210 --> 02:00:46,910
SPEAKER_0:  seeing.

02:00:47,458 --> 02:00:48,030
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:00:48,482 --> 02:00:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  are these things that happened, I'm not talking at the chemical level, but at the environment level.

02:00:54,018 --> 02:00:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  Do they happen at the same time, at the same frequency, at the same intensity?

02:00:58,850 --> 02:01:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  every time you're running this tape.

02:01:00,738 --> 02:01:01,534
SPEAKER_0:  over and over again.

02:01:02,018 --> 02:01:02,398
SPEAKER_1:  Yes.

02:01:02,818 --> 02:01:03,943
SPEAKER_1:  You mean like geological?

02:01:03,943 --> 02:01:05,443
SPEAKER_0:  stuff. Yeah, like so is the

02:01:05,443 --> 02:01:14,174
SPEAKER_1:  You're saying those are important. I mean, the fact that you would ask that question is also fascinating. So that's important. The timing, the frequency, the intensity.

02:01:14,338 --> 02:01:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  of geological events? When we run this imaginary rewind and replay experiments in our minds.

02:01:19,426 --> 02:01:25,598
SPEAKER_0:  I want to know whether we are positioning all the same geologic events at the same chronological order as well.

02:01:25,922 --> 02:01:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  or whether we are also giving them more randomness.

02:01:28,962 --> 02:01:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  So if the volcano erupted, it's happening at the same time. If you have a me.

02:01:33,506 --> 02:01:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  Our dinosaur's getting wiped off every time with the same-

02:01:36,226 --> 02:01:36,958
SPEAKER_0:  Meteorites.

02:01:37,346 --> 02:01:38,471
SPEAKER_0:  hitting the same...

02:01:38,471 --> 02:01:39,221
SPEAKER_1:  temperature change.

02:01:39,221 --> 02:01:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  Change is all that matters. Change is all that matters.

02:01:41,570 --> 02:01:43,902
SPEAKER_1:  That's actually, I've heard you say somewhere that.

02:01:44,354 --> 02:01:46,910
SPEAKER_1:  One of the things that's fascinating to you about this whole-

02:01:47,170 --> 02:01:48,734
SPEAKER_1:  process of evolution is that...

02:01:50,562 --> 02:01:52,350
SPEAKER_1:  And the memory...

02:01:52,770 --> 02:01:56,222
SPEAKER_1:  the process of evolution, all the mechanisms were invented and developed.

02:01:57,538 --> 02:01:58,206
SPEAKER_1:  despite

02:01:58,498 --> 02:02:00,222
SPEAKER_1:  all the variation geologically.

02:02:00,642 --> 02:02:02,654
SPEAKER_1:  through the hardship that Earth has gone through.

02:02:03,042 --> 02:02:06,417
SPEAKER_0:  that the biological innovations persisted despite that?

02:02:06,417 --> 02:02:07,358
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, despite that.

02:02:07,938 --> 02:02:09,438
SPEAKER_1:  which is interesting.

02:02:09,698 --> 02:02:10,622
SPEAKER_1:  You kind of think of...

02:02:11,298 --> 02:02:13,923
SPEAKER_1:  The biological innovation is kind of happening in their own.

02:02:13,923 --> 02:02:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  Because we actually have a center exploring this problem.

02:02:18,562 --> 02:02:19,262
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:02:19,522 --> 02:02:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  We want to understand.

02:02:20,898 --> 02:02:21,406
SPEAKER_0:  weather.

02:02:21,730 --> 02:02:27,902
SPEAKER_0:  It's almost like judging a book by its cover, right? Do you just look at an environment and then see whatever is present?

02:02:28,322 --> 02:02:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  or scares in that environment. And then

02:02:30,754 --> 02:02:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  think that okay, the life form that will exist in this environment will

02:02:34,594 --> 02:02:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  obviously have a lot of

02:02:36,482 --> 02:02:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  molybdenum in its system. Look at all this molybdenum around here.

02:02:40,514 --> 02:02:48,350
SPEAKER_0:  Or will it be... Because if you say that, you are now putting the environment in the more prime.

02:02:48,578 --> 02:02:54,270
SPEAKER_0:  driver role, right? You're saying that environment will determine what biology will or will not use.

02:02:55,234 --> 02:02:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  But we've.

02:02:57,538 --> 02:02:58,718
SPEAKER_0:  Don't study Zdets.

02:02:59,106 --> 02:03:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  show that it's not necessarily this straightforward.

02:03:02,626 --> 02:03:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  that for instance we looked at going back to nitrogen.

02:03:05,890 --> 02:03:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  one thing that's fascinating about

02:03:08,578 --> 02:03:10,526
SPEAKER_0:  and waste cells fix nitrogen.

02:03:11,042 --> 02:03:12,574
SPEAKER_0:  the ones that can do.

02:03:13,090 --> 02:03:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  Is that they also do this through a lot of help of a lot of metals a lot of elemental support really

02:03:20,674 --> 02:03:21,022
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:03:21,794 --> 02:03:22,302
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:03:23,618 --> 02:03:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  which geologists use to understand where did this metabolism even evolved.

02:03:29,282 --> 02:03:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  wear.

02:03:30,082 --> 02:03:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  at first place. So we look at ancient oceans, we try to understand the elemental composition of ancient oceans.

02:03:35,938 --> 02:03:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  And what we see is that

02:03:38,530 --> 02:03:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  in some cases the metabolisms even though they prefer a certain metal.

02:03:42,562 --> 02:03:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  or an element that is in the environment.

02:03:45,954 --> 02:03:46,878
SPEAKER_0:  That medal wasn't.

02:03:47,266 --> 02:03:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  Abandoned in the environment. But still.

02:03:49,954 --> 02:03:50,846
SPEAKER_0:  Life shows that.

02:03:51,106 --> 02:03:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:03:51,714 --> 02:03:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  It's not that straightforward as though whatever you are.

02:03:55,490 --> 02:03:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  You are what you eat, but you don't necessarily eat what is obvious to you.

02:03:59,458 --> 02:04:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  Just because there's a lot of that food around it doesn't mean life will ultimately go there. Maybe most of the time it will.

02:04:05,186 --> 02:04:09,311
SPEAKER_0:  But it seems like in the case of nitrogen fixation, it didn't, and maybe that made the difference.

02:04:09,311 --> 02:04:14,142
SPEAKER_1:  It's so cool that, right, it's not the abundant resource that's going to be the definition of what.

02:04:14,466 --> 02:04:15,614
SPEAKER_1:  kind of life flourishes.

02:04:16,706 --> 02:04:17,662
SPEAKER_1:  So...

02:04:18,498 --> 02:04:20,606
SPEAKER_1:  So it's not a straightforward thing.

02:04:20,962 --> 02:04:22,846
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, your sense is that.

02:04:23,298 --> 02:04:24,574
SPEAKER_1:  the different timing.

02:04:24,994 --> 02:04:27,710
SPEAKER_1:  the different conditions of the environment would change.

02:04:28,098 --> 02:04:29,726
SPEAKER_1:  the way evolution happens.

02:04:29,890 --> 02:04:32,382
SPEAKER_0:  For instance, I think it's in the...

02:04:32,610 --> 02:04:34,750
SPEAKER_0:  80s maybe earlier than that.

02:04:35,010 --> 02:04:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  Stephen Jay Gould's book, Wonderful Life, which changed, I think, a lot of...

02:04:40,130 --> 02:04:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  scientists life, including mine.

02:04:43,138 --> 02:04:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:04:44,386 --> 02:04:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  he contemplates on.

02:04:45,794 --> 02:04:49,022
SPEAKER_0:  this notion of the tape of life, of course.

02:04:50,018 --> 02:04:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  I hope people still know what tape is, but I think your listeners will know what tape is. Do read comments, but note I have brought Rs environment to와alk you an overviewm what tape is, gives me time

02:04:54,274 --> 02:04:55,399
SPEAKER_0:  It's the...

02:04:55,399 --> 02:05:00,958
SPEAKER_1:  Tape? Go on, tell me about the tape. Is it like a TikTok? Can you swipe on it?

02:05:02,690 --> 02:05:03,550
SPEAKER_1:  I am so good.

02:05:04,066 --> 02:05:05,191
SPEAKER_1:  I apologize.

02:05:05,191 --> 02:05:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  the弄

02:05:06,402 --> 02:05:12,318
SPEAKER_0:  I kind of asked for it. But he speculated or suggested this hypothetical experiment.

02:05:12,578 --> 02:05:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  weather.

02:05:13,442 --> 02:05:22,398
SPEAKER_0:  If life was recorded on or can be imagined to be recorded on a linear, is a linear chain of events recorded on a tape.

02:05:22,882 --> 02:05:28,958
SPEAKER_0:  And if we were to rewind the tape, we'd be listening to the same song. Right? So this was an Enid's proposition, I also thought.

02:05:29,762 --> 02:05:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  Um, yeah, but are we replaying the tape in the same exact manner or are we?

02:05:35,362 --> 02:05:43,166
SPEAKER_0:  meaning all the geological and environmental events, are they happening at the same time? Because then you removed the randomness from equation a little bit.

02:05:43,650 --> 02:05:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  You just.

02:05:45,314 --> 02:05:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  You moved it.

02:05:46,562 --> 02:05:50,462
SPEAKER_0:  you're assuming everything will happen at the same time, at the same intensity. So that's not too contingent.

02:05:51,234 --> 02:05:58,398
SPEAKER_0:  That means that the natural selection you're thinking is really operating it more or evolution is operating it more under more random.

02:05:58,882 --> 02:05:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  forces.

02:05:59,938 --> 02:06:02,750
SPEAKER_0:  then that can be dictated by the environment.

02:06:03,042 --> 02:06:11,006
SPEAKER_0:  In our way of understanding or thinking about rewinding, replaying, I don't think we're thinking about the role of the environment as clearly or don't seem to be.

02:06:11,330 --> 02:06:12,414
SPEAKER_0:  integrated as much.

02:06:13,218 --> 02:06:13,598
SPEAKER_1:  But I'll-

02:06:14,338 --> 02:06:18,686
SPEAKER_1:  I also wonder if it's possible that the chemistry ultimately defines the destination.

02:06:19,650 --> 02:06:20,510
SPEAKER_1:  That, uh...

02:06:21,538 --> 02:06:24,094
SPEAKER_1:  despite all the environmental changes, despite...

02:06:24,834 --> 02:06:27,367
SPEAKER_1:  all the randomness will end up-

02:06:27,367 --> 02:06:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  But we are not talking about whether life will emerge and sustain itself. We are talking about whether life will emerge and sustain itself in the shape and form that is similar to what we have right now.

02:06:38,306 --> 02:06:38,686
SPEAKER_0:  sold.

02:06:38,914 --> 02:06:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  You are chemistry, I'm chemistry, we're having this conversation. And your plants are chemistry too. They're also having their own conversation. These plants are fake, but yes.

02:06:47,554 --> 02:06:50,929
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't want to say that, but they're fake

02:06:50,929 --> 02:06:54,366
SPEAKER_1:  Look at my place. Of course that would be fake. Otherwise they would die

02:06:54,498 --> 02:06:57,214
SPEAKER_0:  What's wrong with this place? It's wonderful.

02:06:57,346 --> 02:07:00,798
SPEAKER_1:  It's, it's, I'm Alice and this is Wonderland.

02:07:01,058 --> 02:07:01,758
SPEAKER_1:  This is great.

02:07:02,018 --> 02:07:08,478
SPEAKER_1:  This is great, it's just that, you know, this is a place where robots flourish and those plants are fake.

02:07:09,378 --> 02:07:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  Are you saying that you and I are the only living organisms? Well, obviously there are microbes in this room.

02:07:13,218 --> 02:07:13,982
SPEAKER_0:  but yeah.

02:07:14,402 --> 02:07:16,414
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, we are the only living organisms.

02:07:16,674 --> 02:07:17,799
SPEAKER_1:  I'll take care of getting a dog.

02:07:17,799 --> 02:07:20,799
SPEAKER_0:  Well, you know, this is not a clean room, so you have microbes.

02:07:20,799 --> 02:07:21,549
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, many.

02:07:21,549 --> 02:07:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  millions. Yes, so you and I and all the microbes in this room.

02:07:25,282 --> 02:07:27,166
SPEAKER_0:  your chemical systems that are operating it.

02:07:27,618 --> 02:07:31,358
SPEAKER_0:  in a way that we can respond and sense our environments and whatnot.

02:07:31,714 --> 02:07:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  But in-

02:07:32,770 --> 02:07:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  If you are asking if you're going to be here, then you're imagining that another solution is also possible, which is different.

02:07:39,778 --> 02:07:40,222
SPEAKER_0:  Done.

02:07:40,802 --> 02:07:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  fundamentals of life because life will do always life will do its life thing

02:07:46,882 --> 02:07:48,446
SPEAKER_1:  I guess it goes all the way back.

02:07:48,898 --> 02:07:51,038
SPEAKER_1:  to the things we're talking about translation.

02:07:51,362 --> 02:07:52,862
SPEAKER_1:  and the stuff you were messing with.

02:07:53,090 --> 02:07:55,710
SPEAKER_1:  is figuring out what is the important stuff and what isn't.

02:07:57,506 --> 02:08:01,566
SPEAKER_1:  makes me wonder about, you know, just like with the translation.

02:08:02,210 --> 02:08:03,134
SPEAKER_1:  machinery

02:08:04,098 --> 02:08:07,614
SPEAKER_1:  with human beings, I wonder what's the important stuff. Is it important to have two limbs?

02:08:08,834 --> 02:08:10,174
SPEAKER_1:  Is it important to have eyes?

02:08:10,530 --> 02:08:14,686
SPEAKER_1:  It was obvious that the sensory mechanism of eyes excite.

02:08:15,138 --> 02:08:15,838
SPEAKER_1:  which it developed.

02:08:16,578 --> 02:08:20,894
SPEAKER_1:  How many times if you were here on Earth would the sensory mechanism of sight?

02:08:21,282 --> 02:08:21,630
SPEAKER_1:  develop.

02:08:21,986 --> 02:08:24,254
SPEAKER_1:  And what would it look like? Would it be one giant eye?

02:08:25,026 --> 02:08:25,758
SPEAKER_1:  I'll be too.

02:08:26,242 --> 02:08:28,117
SPEAKER_1:  What's with the symmetry? Why are we so damn s-

02:08:28,117 --> 02:08:28,670
SPEAKER_0:  symmetrical.

02:08:29,346 --> 02:08:32,862
SPEAKER_0:  In response to Steve Jay Gould's proposition.

02:08:34,018 --> 02:08:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  Most people who...

02:08:35,682 --> 02:08:41,182
SPEAKER_0:  who argue that life is convergent and it will in fact lead to a few...

02:08:41,602 --> 02:08:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  determined.

02:08:42,594 --> 02:08:44,190
SPEAKER_0:  outcomes or the...

02:08:45,282 --> 02:08:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  It's not that the outcome is determined per se, but it's...

02:08:48,674 --> 02:08:50,590
SPEAKER_0:  The pathways are restricted and

02:08:51,490 --> 02:08:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  mutational trajectories that life can act upon.

02:08:54,466 --> 02:08:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  are already very limited.

02:08:56,930 --> 02:08:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  so that the final outcomes are a few.

02:09:00,450 --> 02:09:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  and eyes being one of them.

02:09:04,738 --> 02:09:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  the convergence at the eye level was...

02:09:08,290 --> 02:09:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  suggested as an example, was presented as an example of why life may actually embark on the same.

02:09:13,954 --> 02:09:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  solution over and over again, given that many species evolved it.

02:09:17,826 --> 02:09:21,246
SPEAKER_1:  independently from one another. Do you think there's any inkling of truth to that?

02:09:21,890 --> 02:09:22,686
SPEAKER_1:  Like, uh...

02:09:22,978 --> 02:09:25,246
SPEAKER_1:  Is it just us humans thinking we're special?

02:09:25,506 --> 02:09:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  I think those innovations came again so far after the...

02:09:31,490 --> 02:09:34,430
SPEAKER_0:  I know it's the fun stuff. Yes.

02:09:34,914 --> 02:09:36,039
SPEAKER_0:  uh... because it's

02:09:36,039 --> 02:09:40,798
SPEAKER_1:  Thank you. I mean, thank you. I think we humans tend to talk about the later stuff.

02:09:41,378 --> 02:09:44,542
SPEAKER_0:  but without the earlier stuff. So if I think of earlier there's...

02:09:45,794 --> 02:09:47,934
SPEAKER_0:  And I ask this to my students too, I want...

02:09:48,418 --> 02:09:53,790
SPEAKER_0:  to close their eyes and think about just nothingness but dust. We don't have trees, we don't have plants.

02:09:54,114 --> 02:09:59,934
SPEAKER_0:  When we say an empty place, or visually at least, we are talking about a planet that is really alien.

02:10:00,642 --> 02:10:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  So understanding our own past is similar to understanding an alien planet altogether.

02:10:05,666 --> 02:10:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  Given that it is a very different planet that did not have any oxygen for 2 billion years.

02:10:11,106 --> 02:10:14,590
SPEAKER_0:  There's nothing that is familiar to us that we would even...

02:10:14,882 --> 02:10:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  Think about it.

02:10:16,322 --> 02:10:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  when we think about life.

02:10:17,890 --> 02:10:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  that is present in our past, yet here we are.

02:10:20,834 --> 02:10:23,454
SPEAKER_1:  So cool that from that came this.

02:10:23,874 --> 02:10:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  Like houses and people. And we are very, very.

02:10:27,618 --> 02:10:32,254
SPEAKER_0:  We are the super late arrivals to the party, right? So this is definitely not our planet.

02:10:33,026 --> 02:10:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  It's the microbial planets that we live in.

02:10:35,010 --> 02:10:37,342
SPEAKER_1:  but the potential to create us was always there.

02:10:38,338 --> 02:10:39,134
SPEAKER_1:  I hope you know that.

02:10:40,738 --> 02:10:41,886
SPEAKER_1:  because we were created.

02:10:43,202 --> 02:10:43,582
SPEAKER_1:  Oh.

02:10:44,578 --> 02:10:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know.

02:10:45,698 --> 02:10:48,158
SPEAKER_1:  What is it? You think it's possible this?

02:10:48,706 --> 02:10:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  Even for the early stuff.

02:10:50,722 --> 02:10:53,022
SPEAKER_1:  Oh yeah, maybe if it's super unlikely, yeah.

02:10:53,282 --> 02:10:57,694
SPEAKER_1:  that we just got super, this is the planet that got really lucky given the chemistry.

02:10:58,882 --> 02:11:02,174
SPEAKER_1:  like maybe to create the bacteria is not so lucky.

02:11:03,042 --> 02:11:07,678
SPEAKER_1:  but to create complex organisms all the way up to mammals, that's super lucky.

02:11:07,778 --> 02:11:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, and it may all come down to a few innovations that happened at the molecular level.

02:11:13,474 --> 02:11:15,646
SPEAKER_0:  That may or may not be inevitable.

02:11:16,130 --> 02:11:16,574
SPEAKER_0:  Oh.

02:11:17,730 --> 02:11:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  that's that so all these

02:11:19,938 --> 02:11:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  molecular tricks may have enabled.

02:11:23,682 --> 02:11:28,414
SPEAKER_0:  this sort of mere existence of whatever you are able to define as familiar to yourself.

02:11:28,642 --> 02:11:31,966
SPEAKER_1:  And you have a hope that science can answer these questions.

02:11:32,194 --> 02:11:33,374
SPEAKER_1:  to reconstruct.

02:11:33,858 --> 02:11:40,126
SPEAKER_0:  science is answering these questions. I mean, we are limited to going back to the beginning.

02:11:40,482 --> 02:11:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  in our ways, right? So we rely on biology, it's just overwritten.

02:11:45,410 --> 02:11:51,806
SPEAKER_0:  You're talking about four billion year old records that is ever changing. That again makes it beautiful, but also makes it difficult.

02:11:52,162 --> 02:11:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  It's not tractable.

02:11:53,922 --> 02:11:56,030
SPEAKER_0:  geology has.

02:11:57,794 --> 02:12:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  some degree, to some degree it has a record.

02:12:01,250 --> 02:12:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  of a more static.

02:12:04,322 --> 02:12:04,894
SPEAKER_0:  frozen.

02:12:05,186 --> 02:12:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  State record.

02:12:06,818 --> 02:12:07,614
SPEAKER_0:  that is embedded.

02:12:08,418 --> 02:12:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  on itself.

02:12:09,858 --> 02:12:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  on the surface of this planet if we can find them.

02:12:13,090 --> 02:12:15,806
SPEAKER_0:  And that's the key that most of these.

02:12:16,098 --> 02:12:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  Recorded.

02:12:17,282 --> 02:12:17,854
SPEAKER_0:  um

02:12:18,786 --> 02:12:19,678
SPEAKER_0:  Remnants are.

02:12:21,378 --> 02:12:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  If we are lucky we find them.

02:12:23,458 --> 02:12:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  They are not naturally selected.

02:12:25,410 --> 02:12:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  They are the...

02:12:27,042 --> 02:12:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  they're found, they need to be found for us to read them. So.

02:12:30,210 --> 02:12:30,910
SPEAKER_0:  We work with a.

02:12:31,170 --> 02:12:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  very handful set of samples, especially

02:12:34,338 --> 02:12:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  when we talk about the deep past.

02:12:38,210 --> 02:12:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  planet with no oxygen when we pass the great oxidation event threshold that is about.

02:12:43,362 --> 02:12:45,726
SPEAKER_0:  2.5 billion years. So the earliest life is

02:12:46,146 --> 02:12:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  Even harder, you are trying to write the story of life.

02:12:49,890 --> 02:12:52,894
SPEAKER_0:  based on a handful of rocks and what is recorded on them.

02:12:53,474 --> 02:12:55,262
SPEAKER_1:  Speaking of finding...

02:12:55,938 --> 02:12:58,846
SPEAKER_1:  select remnants of our deep past.

02:12:59,330 --> 02:13:01,438
SPEAKER_1:  You said that you've been thinking about Nick.

02:13:02,178 --> 02:13:05,694
SPEAKER_1:  Neelan's essay on scientific knowledge and scientific abstraction.

02:13:06,018 --> 02:13:08,606
SPEAKER_1:  So let me ask you, what do you think scientific questions?

02:13:09,090 --> 02:13:11,678
SPEAKER_1:  and answers or in general ideas come from.

02:13:13,122 --> 02:13:14,110
SPEAKER_1:  You're a scientist.

02:13:15,074 --> 02:13:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  You ask very good questions.

02:13:17,506 --> 02:13:21,566
SPEAKER_1:  and try systematically and rigorously to answer them through experiment.

02:13:22,306 --> 02:13:23,998
SPEAKER_1:  Where do you think ideas come from?

02:13:24,994 --> 02:13:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  Ideas come all the time, right? There are all kinds of ideas. There are good ideas. There are not so good ideas.

02:13:31,330 --> 02:13:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  They're really exciting ideas.

02:13:32,898 --> 02:13:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  uh, maybe some boring ones.

02:13:35,778 --> 02:13:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:13:36,706 --> 02:13:37,630
SPEAKER_0:  If you...

02:13:39,458 --> 02:13:44,926
SPEAKER_0:  are really interested in doing something different, then you need to be willing to take the risk to be wrong.

02:13:46,114 --> 02:13:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  And that's incredibly difficult, even though...

02:13:49,794 --> 02:13:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  We talked about the idealist.

02:13:51,938 --> 02:13:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  sort of notion behind science that we ultimately want to be rejected or ideas need to be rejected for it too.

02:13:58,978 --> 02:13:59,710
SPEAKER_0:  the entire

02:14:00,226 --> 02:14:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  infrastructure to move forward.

02:14:03,682 --> 02:14:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  there is a level of risk taking, I think, behind.

02:14:07,970 --> 02:14:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:14:09,826 --> 02:14:11,774
SPEAKER_0:  any creative idea.

02:14:12,290 --> 02:14:13,982
SPEAKER_0:  And I mean that in a true sense.

02:14:14,210 --> 02:14:17,342
SPEAKER_0:  If you are disappointed that your idea didn't work.

02:14:18,146 --> 02:14:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  then it wasn't a

02:14:19,266 --> 02:14:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  risk.

02:14:20,290 --> 02:14:21,854
SPEAKER_0:  because you still hoped that it will work.

02:14:23,266 --> 02:14:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  The true risk is that you accept that this may not work.

02:14:25,890 --> 02:14:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  so that the failure shouldn't also surprise you.

02:14:30,818 --> 02:14:32,958
SPEAKER_1:  Is it when you embark on stuff do you?

02:14:33,250 --> 02:14:34,590
SPEAKER_1:  When you embark on an idea...

02:14:35,138 --> 02:14:36,222
SPEAKER_1:  Do you actually?

02:14:37,730 --> 02:14:39,518
SPEAKER_1:  Contemplate and accept.

02:14:40,066 --> 02:14:40,894
SPEAKER_1:  uh, failure?

02:14:41,314 --> 02:14:44,798
SPEAKER_0:  Like as a possible I wouldn't say so but I.

02:14:45,314 --> 02:14:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  eliminated a lot of the things.

02:14:47,682 --> 02:14:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:14:48,962 --> 02:14:49,758
SPEAKER_0:  out of my

02:14:50,754 --> 02:14:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  work line by...

02:14:52,418 --> 02:14:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  simply.

02:14:53,826 --> 02:14:55,230
SPEAKER_0:  not feeling like studying them.

02:14:55,970 --> 02:14:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  I was bored.

02:14:57,442 --> 02:14:59,070
SPEAKER_0:  chasing certain questions.

02:14:59,362 --> 02:15:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  and I

02:15:00,450 --> 02:15:05,283
SPEAKER_1:  So you trusted the signal of boredom as a good sign that it's not a good question.

02:15:05,283 --> 02:15:07,390
SPEAKER_0:  It should definitely...

02:15:07,778 --> 02:15:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  Whatever you're doing should be exciting to you. If there's only one person that should be ever excited about what you're doing,

02:15:15,298 --> 02:15:15,998
SPEAKER_0:  That should be you.

02:15:16,834 --> 02:15:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  And that's enough for that idea to go somewhere, I think, that you need to believe.

02:15:21,634 --> 02:15:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  in the idea, but at the same time.

02:15:23,714 --> 02:15:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's important to...

02:15:25,794 --> 02:15:27,902
SPEAKER_0:  not fall in love with your mistakes.

02:15:28,898 --> 02:15:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  you know, that you if if something isn't working.

02:15:32,866 --> 02:15:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  You should.

02:15:33,858 --> 02:15:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  Let it go.

02:15:35,458 --> 02:15:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  instead of trying to fix it.

02:15:37,410 --> 02:15:40,734
SPEAKER_0:  even though you feel that this is a mistake or you know that it's a mistake.

02:15:41,378 --> 02:15:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  in order to

02:15:42,690 --> 02:15:43,134
SPEAKER_0:  Oh-whip.

02:15:43,490 --> 02:15:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  is sorry, instead of.

02:15:45,506 --> 02:15:46,494
SPEAKER_0:  trying to fix it.

02:15:47,362 --> 02:15:48,414
SPEAKER_0:  You should

02:15:49,698 --> 02:15:53,073
SPEAKER_0:  wrap it up and move on to something else, which is incredibly hard.

02:15:53,073 --> 02:15:56,094
SPEAKER_1:  Good advice for science, but also good advice for relationships.

02:15:56,802 --> 02:15:57,118
SPEAKER_1:  Heh.

02:15:57,666 --> 02:16:03,262
SPEAKER_1:  Um, but okay. So like, that's actually really hard, especially, I mean, this is like PhD stuff like

02:16:03,650 --> 02:16:07,806
SPEAKER_1:  if you sink in so much of your time, not even PhD, the entire.

02:16:08,034 --> 02:16:10,910
SPEAKER_1:  entire scientific careers, it's really tough to let go.

02:16:11,298 --> 02:16:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, and there is not a lot of...

02:16:12,962 --> 02:16:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  room for true freedom.

02:16:16,098 --> 02:16:16,702
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:16:16,994 --> 02:16:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe.

02:16:18,338 --> 02:16:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  at this certain degree. So first you need to be trained, right?

02:16:21,986 --> 02:16:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  It's not.

02:16:23,010 --> 02:16:31,006
SPEAKER_0:  that scientists are just brilliant, amazing humans. I mean, they just know and learn how, they know how to do science because they're trained.

02:16:31,618 --> 02:16:34,398
SPEAKER_0:  how to do science. So that is important because I...

02:16:34,914 --> 02:16:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  As someone who...

02:16:37,186 --> 02:16:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  W-wants to definitely-

02:16:39,010 --> 02:16:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  I'm hoping that I'm...

02:16:41,026 --> 02:16:43,038
SPEAKER_0:  giving the message that this is for everybody.

02:16:43,490 --> 02:16:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  That

02:16:44,226 --> 02:16:48,638
SPEAKER_0:  There's this notion of science, scientists being super smart people. That's definitely...

02:16:49,058 --> 02:16:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  Not true.

02:16:50,274 --> 02:16:50,590
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

02:16:50,818 --> 02:16:55,166
SPEAKER_0:  It is a method that you learn to solve a problem. That's really what science is.

02:16:55,810 --> 02:16:57,694
SPEAKER_0:  and some are really good at it.

02:16:58,018 --> 02:17:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  and they get better at it under really good guidance, maybe good mentorship.

02:17:03,234 --> 02:17:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  And ultimately everyone finds their own style of problem solving and what sort of problems they solve but I have not met a scientist that finds their own.

02:17:12,354 --> 02:17:13,310
SPEAKER_0:  Pursue boarding.

02:17:16,098 --> 02:17:19,710
SPEAKER_1:  Well, it can happen, but they're not going to be effective, just like you said, I think.

02:17:20,610 --> 02:17:26,782
SPEAKER_1:  It's kind of interesting because in the age of social media and attention economies and stuff like that

02:17:27,522 --> 02:17:29,310
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I've interacted with a lot of folks.

02:17:29,794 --> 02:17:31,198
SPEAKER_1:  like YouTubers and so on.

02:17:32,194 --> 02:17:35,966
SPEAKER_1:  I think a lot of their work is driven by what others find exciting.

02:17:37,346 --> 02:17:41,310
SPEAKER_1:  And I think that ultimately leads to a life that's not fulfilling.

02:17:41,890 --> 02:17:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  I can see the reason.

02:17:43,810 --> 02:17:48,510
SPEAKER_0:  behind it or perhaps there's again fear of failure.

02:17:48,898 --> 02:17:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  that can be a major.

02:17:51,298 --> 02:17:51,806
SPEAKER_0:  Terminant

02:17:52,450 --> 02:17:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  of that pattern, right? You

02:17:55,170 --> 02:17:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  ehh

02:17:56,034 --> 02:17:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  try to do something that is accepted by others because that's maybe unlikely to.

02:18:00,130 --> 02:18:00,542
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:18:00,994 --> 02:18:02,942
SPEAKER_0:  give results right away.

02:18:03,490 --> 02:18:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  But it's a long game, it's a very long game. And if you are aiming a long-term change in long-term impact...

02:18:10,626 --> 02:18:14,558
SPEAKER_0:  You gotta be very, very patient about it. And you better, um...

02:18:15,522 --> 02:18:16,766
SPEAKER_1:  tame your ego.

02:18:18,210 --> 02:18:22,590
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, on YouTube and those kinds of places, on the internet, on social media.

02:18:23,170 --> 02:18:24,222
SPEAKER_1:  You get feedback.

02:18:25,058 --> 02:18:26,110
SPEAKER_1:  Like right away.

02:18:26,562 --> 02:18:28,958
SPEAKER_1:  So it's even harder to be patient.

02:18:29,218 --> 02:18:31,902
SPEAKER_1:  Yes. So in because yeah, but.

02:18:32,194 --> 02:18:37,054
SPEAKER_1:  Change in ideas develop over a period of months and years, not decades.

02:18:37,570 --> 02:18:40,606
SPEAKER_1:  and the response from social media and so on is.

02:18:41,058 --> 02:18:42,933
SPEAKER_1:  and the rate of seconds, minutes and hours.

02:18:42,933 --> 02:18:44,062
SPEAKER_0:  So I recommend

02:18:44,546 --> 02:18:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  actual physical libraries for people who may wanna

02:18:48,770 --> 02:18:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  appreciate or remember.

02:18:51,234 --> 02:18:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  sense of time.

02:18:52,194 --> 02:18:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  and how long it takes.

02:18:54,402 --> 02:18:56,382
SPEAKER_0:  to build something. I think it is.

02:18:56,994 --> 02:19:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  You're right, that's the immediacy and the right response of... And the fact that these...

02:19:03,682 --> 02:19:04,158
SPEAKER_0:  Buh.

02:19:04,770 --> 02:19:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  Please, is over.

02:19:05,922 --> 02:19:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  And the algorithm wants you to respond right away and interact with itself, right?

02:19:10,658 --> 02:19:12,606
SPEAKER_0:  I can see the appeal.

02:19:13,122 --> 02:19:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  What's?

02:19:13,858 --> 02:19:15,806
SPEAKER_0:  true innovation, I think, does anyone.

02:19:16,098 --> 02:19:16,606
SPEAKER_0:  Scream.

02:19:17,090 --> 02:19:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  It doesn't, it's not shiny.

02:19:19,170 --> 02:19:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  especially in the beginning.

02:19:20,770 --> 02:19:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  Ehm

02:19:21,442 --> 02:19:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  But it's also important to not fool ourselves and think that everything that people criticize

02:19:25,698 --> 02:19:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  has some super important meaning behind it.

02:19:29,250 --> 02:19:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  So it's a mix of...

02:19:30,530 --> 02:19:33,438
SPEAKER_0:  the technique, the methods and your gut feeling.

02:19:35,426 --> 02:19:39,614
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, and a weird dance between learning and accepting.

02:19:39,938 --> 02:19:41,214
SPEAKER_1:  the ideas.

02:19:41,474 --> 02:19:42,942
SPEAKER_1:  of the current science.

02:19:43,490 --> 02:19:44,126
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:19:45,346 --> 02:19:47,070
SPEAKER_1:  at times trusting your gut.

02:19:47,586 --> 02:19:48,798
SPEAKER_1:  and rejecting those.

02:19:49,346 --> 02:19:50,942
SPEAKER_1:  The science progresses by...

02:19:51,682 --> 02:19:57,054
SPEAKER_1:  sometimes rejecting the ideas of the past or sometimes building on them in a way that changes them, transforms them.

02:19:57,154 --> 02:20:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, and I think what is hard is to

02:20:00,482 --> 02:20:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  really

02:20:01,634 --> 02:20:02,398
SPEAKER_0:  drill down.

02:20:02,658 --> 02:20:06,014
SPEAKER_0:  into a concept, right? You can create a

02:20:06,626 --> 02:20:07,390
SPEAKER_0:  a new thing.

02:20:07,746 --> 02:20:08,574
SPEAKER_0:  and then it may

02:20:08,834 --> 02:20:10,526
SPEAKER_0:  be appealing and get a lot of.

02:20:11,074 --> 02:20:12,862
SPEAKER_0:  gain a lot of traction, but.

02:20:13,890 --> 02:20:17,406
SPEAKER_0:  sustain that, to continue that, you really need to show the true expertise.

02:20:17,954 --> 02:20:23,326
SPEAKER_0:  So it's not only about defining a problem, but then really systematically solve that problem.

02:20:25,058 --> 02:20:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  maybe over the course of decades.

02:20:28,642 --> 02:20:29,822
SPEAKER_1:  You mentioned library.

02:20:30,402 --> 02:20:34,942
SPEAKER_1:  I've also saw that you've translated scientific documents, or at least I mentioned that you did it.

02:20:35,490 --> 02:20:37,118
SPEAKER_1:  at some point in your life.

02:20:37,634 --> 02:20:38,238
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:20:39,170 --> 02:20:40,382
SPEAKER_1:  So let me ask you how much.

02:20:40,706 --> 02:20:42,270
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think it's lost in translation?

02:20:43,010 --> 02:20:44,446
SPEAKER_1:  in science and in life.

02:20:46,498 --> 02:20:47,774
SPEAKER_1:  How many languages do you speak?

02:20:48,194 --> 02:20:48,702
SPEAKER_1:  Two.

02:20:49,762 --> 02:20:50,942
SPEAKER_1:  How much is lost?

02:20:52,066 --> 02:20:55,441
SPEAKER_1:  in translation, in science, and in life between those.

02:20:55,441 --> 02:20:58,334
SPEAKER_0:  So it's actually three because science is like another language.

02:20:58,594 --> 02:20:59,294
SPEAKER_1:  It is.

02:20:59,746 --> 02:21:01,822
SPEAKER_1:  I speak Russian, a little bit of French.

02:21:02,338 --> 02:21:10,526
SPEAKER_1:  And it's always fascinating to see how much is lost. And the Soviet Union has a tradition of science and mathematics and so on. And it's interesting that.

02:21:10,946 --> 02:21:12,926
SPEAKER_1:  a lot of the wisdom gained from...

02:21:13,794 --> 02:21:14,814
SPEAKER_1:  that part of the world.

02:21:15,234 --> 02:21:15,902
SPEAKER_1:  is lost.

02:21:16,738 --> 02:21:19,070
SPEAKER_1:  basically because it was never translated.

02:21:20,674 --> 02:21:21,054
SPEAKER_1:  Well...

02:21:21,154 --> 02:21:21,790
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:21:22,146 --> 02:21:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not sure if it is lost per se.

02:21:25,762 --> 02:21:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe it's more like a gain in some sense.

02:21:28,610 --> 02:21:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  because you understand.

02:21:31,010 --> 02:21:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:21:32,514 --> 02:21:34,430
SPEAKER_0:  Science is ultimately human.

02:21:34,690 --> 02:21:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  pursue. So you cannot separate.

02:21:38,114 --> 02:21:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  as much as maybe it's the best.

02:21:41,154 --> 02:21:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  system that humans ever came up with.

02:21:43,938 --> 02:21:47,358
SPEAKER_0:  to seek knowledge to generate and make sense of the world.

02:21:48,578 --> 02:21:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  It works most of the time. It doesn't mean it's perfect.

02:21:52,706 --> 02:21:55,614
SPEAKER_1:  The kind of translation you do, by the way, was for scientific work.

02:21:56,386 --> 02:22:01,534
SPEAKER_0:  Directly translated for scientific work, yes. I think that...

02:22:02,754 --> 02:22:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  Again, we will.

02:22:04,610 --> 02:22:09,406
SPEAKER_0:  Brains are equally distributed, but opportunities are not. Right.

02:22:10,018 --> 02:22:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:22:11,970 --> 02:22:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  want to include, if you want to benefit from all human.

02:22:15,842 --> 02:22:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  power, whatever we can generate as human beings, you need to include everybody on the table.

02:22:20,770 --> 02:22:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  and that is by extending the opportunity.

02:22:23,970 --> 02:22:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  I think most of us that make it.

02:22:26,882 --> 02:22:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  tend to think that we did because of something special about ourselves.

02:22:30,626 --> 02:22:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  but it is important to know that.

02:22:33,378 --> 02:22:35,262
SPEAKER_0:  No, we were given opportunities.

02:22:35,522 --> 02:22:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  That's why we are here, not because...

02:22:38,914 --> 02:22:41,406
SPEAKER_0:  there was something inherently special about us or...

02:22:41,858 --> 02:22:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:22:42,850 --> 02:22:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  or that the system truly selects for the ones that really are.

02:22:46,978 --> 02:22:49,246
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, and language is a part of the opportunity.

02:22:49,474 --> 02:23:04,734
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, language is an opportunity because it comes with similar to bacteria, right? They speak these languages. They have, even we call this, we call culturing the bacteria, we call it culturing, right? When we grow bacteria that we isolate from the environment in the lab.

02:23:05,314 --> 02:23:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  meaning that you create an environment for them to grow and thrive.

02:23:09,026 --> 02:23:12,926
SPEAKER_0:  and sustain themselves. That's what we say, but culture is.

02:23:13,282 --> 02:23:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  for microbiologists.

02:23:14,850 --> 02:23:15,230
SPEAKER_0:  Fort.

02:23:15,778 --> 02:23:19,262
SPEAKER_0:  language comes with a different culture, a different perspective.

02:23:19,874 --> 02:23:22,238
SPEAKER_0:  And you bring that to...

02:23:22,914 --> 02:23:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  the table.

02:23:24,546 --> 02:23:27,902
SPEAKER_0:  It brings the sense of diversity that can only be achieved.

02:23:28,514 --> 02:23:28,894
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

02:23:29,186 --> 02:23:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  Clashing perhaps two different cultures, two different languages, two different approaches, maybe in some cases four different approaches.

02:23:36,930 --> 02:23:42,430
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I think language is not just a mechanism of communication. It's a way to, uh,

02:23:43,202 --> 02:23:44,158
SPEAKER_1:  It's a dynamic.

02:23:44,482 --> 02:23:50,238
SPEAKER_1:  system of exploring ideas and it's interesting to see that different languages explores ideas differently.

02:23:50,786 --> 02:23:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, and I think that, so when I said science is like a language itself.

02:23:55,266 --> 02:23:57,726
SPEAKER_0:  I said it in two different ways. One is very...

02:23:58,018 --> 02:24:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  very literal meaning that you can speak English, but that doesn't mean you will understand the scientific paper.

02:24:04,322 --> 02:24:12,158
SPEAKER_0:  It's a different level of English that you need to learn to understand. Even not just for scientific papers, even from discipline to discipline.

02:24:12,674 --> 02:24:14,686
SPEAKER_0:  I challenge any chemist to

02:24:15,394 --> 02:24:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  read an evolutionary biology paper.

02:24:18,018 --> 02:24:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  and vice versa. or p.

02:24:20,066 --> 02:24:22,558
SPEAKER_0:  sound extremely different and different language altogether.

02:24:23,010 --> 02:24:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  But there's also the language of communicating and because words matter, how we talk matter.

02:24:28,930 --> 02:24:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  how we represent our science matters. So yes, just learning English as a second language alone is not going to make you.

02:24:35,746 --> 02:24:36,958
SPEAKER_0:  fluent in science either.

02:24:37,730 --> 02:24:38,782
SPEAKER_1:  And it's interesting because.

02:24:39,586 --> 02:24:44,510
SPEAKER_1:  In that sense, you speak many more than three languages because you're pretty cross-disciplinary.

02:24:45,250 --> 02:24:47,742
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like you have a foot in.

02:24:48,450 --> 02:24:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  in a lot of disciplines, in question, geology, biology.

02:24:52,898 --> 02:24:53,502
SPEAKER_1:  Evol-

02:24:53,858 --> 02:24:55,550
SPEAKER_1:  evolutionary biology I mean this

02:24:55,970 --> 02:24:57,310
SPEAKER_1:  uh chemistry

02:24:58,370 --> 02:25:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  Biochemistry, biophysics, even we do a lot of statistics. So there's a lot of mathematics to what we do as well. Yes, we like to think of it as this.

02:25:08,098 --> 02:25:11,774
SPEAKER_0:  NOS astrobiology program says I repeat it because it's fun.

02:25:12,194 --> 02:25:13,310
SPEAKER_0:  that it is not a...

02:25:13,922 --> 02:25:14,494
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:25:15,298 --> 02:25:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  fruit salad but it's a smoothie.

02:25:17,666 --> 02:25:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  that that's what we're generating.

02:25:20,834 --> 02:25:21,406
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

02:25:21,634 --> 02:25:25,214
SPEAKER_1:  not a fruit salad. So a smoothie is a successful.

02:25:26,338 --> 02:25:26,846
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

02:25:27,202 --> 02:25:30,014
SPEAKER_1:  is a successful combination of those fields that a fruit salad is not.

02:25:30,402 --> 02:25:33,182
SPEAKER_0:  I wouldn't say it's success, necessarily.

02:25:33,666 --> 02:25:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  If you put a

02:25:34,786 --> 02:25:39,230
SPEAKER_0:  If you put the wrong ingredient and you press the blender and you made it a smoothie, you made it a smoothie.

02:25:39,650 --> 02:25:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  It can ruin the entire mix.

02:25:41,602 --> 02:25:42,727
SPEAKER_1:  Ken it though, because the

02:25:42,727 --> 02:25:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like yes, I can definitely assess that for ginger first. Those that ruins every smoothie. I don't like ginger. I think so, but it's just a personal thing. And also I don't like cinnamon.

02:25:52,002 --> 02:25:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  But, um...

02:25:53,090 --> 02:25:55,715
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, the ginger has a cinnamon taste, because I thought ginger was...

02:25:55,715 --> 02:25:57,965
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think they do but I also don't like was that

02:25:57,965 --> 02:26:06,718
SPEAKER_1:  I think they add in a lot of smoothies. I was forced a smoothie. I went to Malibu with a good friend of mine, Dan Reynolds, and he forced me to consume a smoothie.

02:26:07,042 --> 02:26:07,518
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:26:07,778 --> 02:26:09,854
SPEAKER_1:  You know, it's probably the first movie I've ever had.

02:26:10,498 --> 02:26:15,550
SPEAKER_1:  because I always was very judgmental of the kind of places people that drink smoothies, but it was good.

02:26:15,714 --> 02:26:22,206
SPEAKER_0:  That's good. Well, smoothie is very American, so I... Yeah, it is an American thing. I wouldn't say success per se, but it is true that...

02:26:22,466 --> 02:26:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  when you dance at the edge of different disciplines, that's when the...

02:26:27,426 --> 02:26:30,558
SPEAKER_0:  inevitably the innovation will rise because you will see things.

02:26:31,266 --> 02:26:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  maybe a little differently when you're on the edge, right?

02:26:36,898 --> 02:26:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  but it will probably take longer.

02:26:38,882 --> 02:26:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  and it may not be.

02:26:40,482 --> 02:26:42,206
SPEAKER_0:  Understood right away, it may not.

02:26:42,594 --> 02:26:45,022
SPEAKER_0:  come into final form quickly.

02:26:45,570 --> 02:26:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  given that it is.

02:26:46,946 --> 02:26:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  and new

02:26:47,938 --> 02:26:48,382
SPEAKER_0:  Doh.

02:26:50,370 --> 02:26:51,230
SPEAKER_0:  concept rising.

02:26:51,970 --> 02:26:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:26:52,738 --> 02:26:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  therefore the patients will make more sense, I'm sorry, patients will be even more important. So if you are

02:26:58,594 --> 02:27:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  In other words, if you are...

02:27:00,834 --> 02:27:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  into.

02:27:01,954 --> 02:27:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  Immediately.

02:27:03,394 --> 02:27:04,190
SPEAKER_0:  appreciation.

02:27:05,570 --> 02:27:06,942
SPEAKER_0:  That's probably not the way to go.

02:27:09,090 --> 02:27:11,070
SPEAKER_1:  You're one chemical organism

02:27:12,002 --> 02:27:17,886
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, so let me ask maybe a little bit more of a personal thing. Where did your life form originate?

02:27:18,914 --> 02:27:22,942
SPEAKER_1:  And what fond memory do you have from the early days of childhood?

02:27:24,706 --> 02:27:25,278
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:27:25,506 --> 02:27:28,126
SPEAKER_1:  that are representative of your bacteria culture.

02:27:30,082 --> 02:27:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  I was born in Istanbul.

02:27:33,058 --> 02:27:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  So I grew up in Turkey.

02:27:36,706 --> 02:27:38,078
SPEAKER_0:  It's a city that has two...

02:27:38,658 --> 02:27:39,518
SPEAKER_0:  continents which

02:27:40,322 --> 02:27:41,918
SPEAKER_0:  It's quite interesting you have a.

02:27:42,946 --> 02:27:44,286
SPEAKER_0:  You see, a welcome to Europe.

02:27:44,674 --> 02:27:46,750
SPEAKER_0:  sign and then welcome to Asia sign.

02:27:47,202 --> 02:27:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  same day.

02:27:48,258 --> 02:27:50,462
SPEAKER_0:  depending on which part of the bridge you are.

02:27:51,362 --> 02:27:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:27:52,098 --> 02:27:57,790
SPEAKER_0:  So that's where I was born and I spent roughly 20 years of my life in the night.

02:27:58,082 --> 02:27:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  immigrated to the United States.

02:28:00,418 --> 02:28:02,910
SPEAKER_1:  It's a very proud culture, it's a beautiful culture.

02:28:03,330 --> 02:28:04,830
SPEAKER_1:  It's a very flavorful culture.

02:28:05,698 --> 02:28:09,086
SPEAKER_1:  what aspects of it is part of who you are.

02:28:09,410 --> 02:28:09,726
SPEAKER_1:  that.

02:28:09,954 --> 02:28:13,150
SPEAKER_1:  What are the beautiful aspects that you carry with you in your heart?

02:28:14,594 --> 02:28:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhh

02:28:15,586 --> 02:28:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  I think...

02:28:17,282 --> 02:28:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  We are very.

02:28:18,498 --> 02:28:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  Sincerely, Human.

02:28:20,514 --> 02:28:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  as a culture.

02:28:21,538 --> 02:28:24,158
SPEAKER_0:  Do we have a saying that don't go to bed?

02:28:25,634 --> 02:28:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  if you're

02:28:28,034 --> 02:28:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  Neighbors hungry.

02:28:29,922 --> 02:28:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:28:31,106 --> 02:28:32,094
SPEAKER_0:  You know, you wouldn't...

02:28:32,866 --> 02:28:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  eat any food in front of someone where I come from.

02:28:35,970 --> 02:28:36,830
SPEAKER_0:  without offering.

02:28:37,442 --> 02:28:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  to be shared by.

02:28:38,658 --> 02:28:41,182
SPEAKER_0:  So I think those things, however small they may sound.

02:28:41,890 --> 02:28:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  Um, really.

02:28:43,458 --> 02:28:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  big deal, especially when you are put in a, or move to a place that.

02:28:48,866 --> 02:28:50,078
SPEAKER_0:  may not have those attributes.

02:28:51,074 --> 02:28:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  So I think that.

02:28:52,738 --> 02:28:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  culturally there.

02:28:54,562 --> 02:28:55,710
SPEAKER_0:  be a little conscious.

02:28:57,858 --> 02:29:00,254
SPEAKER_0:  You just roll deep human.

02:29:00,898 --> 02:29:03,523
SPEAKER_1:  The connection, the value of the connection between.

02:29:03,523 --> 02:29:06,965
SPEAKER_0:  I think so, yeah. I think I definitely carried that with me.

02:29:06,965 --> 02:29:12,638
SPEAKER_1:  We talk a lot about biology. Let me ask you about the romantic question, what role does love?

02:29:13,090 --> 02:29:14,622
SPEAKER_1:  in the human condition.

02:29:15,042 --> 02:29:15,422
SPEAKER_1:  or.

02:29:16,674 --> 02:29:18,622
SPEAKER_1:  in the entirety of life on Earth.

02:29:20,386 --> 02:29:23,102
SPEAKER_0:  It's not easy to learn.

02:29:23,394 --> 02:29:27,166
SPEAKER_0:  have to love if you're not loved.

02:29:28,482 --> 02:29:28,958
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:29:29,250 --> 02:29:32,894
SPEAKER_0:  So it's something, but the good news is that it is something that's.

02:29:33,378 --> 02:29:34,654
SPEAKER_0:  You can learn.

02:29:35,106 --> 02:29:37,342
SPEAKER_0:  I think that's, you can practice.

02:29:37,602 --> 02:29:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  It's interesting, Max, you will tell us about the

02:29:38,562 --> 02:29:40,190
SPEAKER_0:  and teach yourself.

02:29:40,546 --> 02:29:41,150
SPEAKER_0:  have to.

02:29:41,506 --> 02:29:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe give yourself the thing that wasn't given to you. And then ultimately.

02:29:45,442 --> 02:29:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  give it to others. I think it would be quite

02:29:48,706 --> 02:29:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  Arrogant to think that we will be capable of.

02:29:52,386 --> 02:29:54,494
SPEAKER_0:  loving it could be anything really.

02:29:55,042 --> 02:29:59,167
SPEAKER_1:  Um, so just like translation, it's a repeating and a dynamical process.

02:29:59,167 --> 02:30:02,750
SPEAKER_0:  That you can learn. Yeah, that you can learn. Yes, and you should learn.

02:30:03,170 --> 02:30:06,558
SPEAKER_0:  We should even there's no excuse not learning.

02:30:07,010 --> 02:30:07,454
SPEAKER_1:  to love.

02:30:07,938 --> 02:30:09,063
SPEAKER_1:  Because that's deeply human.

02:30:09,063 --> 02:30:14,366
SPEAKER_0:  It is a deeply human thing. It is a very sad thing if any one of us passes this.

02:30:14,818 --> 02:30:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  planet without.

02:30:16,162 --> 02:30:16,670
SPEAKER_0:  though.

02:30:17,346 --> 02:30:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  knowing what love is. And that could be a love to a pet, a love to a plant.

02:30:21,794 --> 02:30:23,294
SPEAKER_1:  robot. robot.

02:30:23,810 --> 02:30:24,542
SPEAKER_1:  Just kidding.

02:30:24,898 --> 02:30:25,630
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:30:25,890 --> 02:30:27,454
SPEAKER_1:  Or a fake plant.

02:30:28,418 --> 02:30:28,958
SPEAKER_1:  We love.

02:30:29,250 --> 02:30:30,398
SPEAKER_1:  We can't help who we love.

02:30:30,914 --> 02:30:35,134
SPEAKER_1:  What advice would you give to a young person today? What advice would you give to a young person today?

02:30:37,666 --> 02:30:38,334
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:30:38,594 --> 02:30:40,318
SPEAKER_1:  how to have a career.

02:30:41,218 --> 02:30:43,550
SPEAKER_1:  they can be proud of or how to have a life they can be proud of.

02:30:44,418 --> 02:30:46,398
SPEAKER_1:  You said an interesting thing about brains.

02:30:46,754 --> 02:30:49,022
SPEAKER_1:  being distributed evenly but opportunities not.

02:30:49,890 --> 02:30:50,750
SPEAKER_1:  It's um...

02:30:51,074 --> 02:30:54,238
SPEAKER_1:  It's really interesting to think about. I've talked to folks from Africa.

02:30:55,010 --> 02:30:57,662
SPEAKER_1:  you realize that there's whole areas of this earth.

02:30:58,402 --> 02:30:59,902
SPEAKER_1:  that have so much brilliance.

02:31:00,546 --> 02:31:02,846
SPEAKER_1:  But unfortunately so little opportunity

02:31:04,002 --> 02:31:08,862
SPEAKER_1:  And one of the exciting things about the 21st century is more and more opportunities are created.

02:31:09,154 --> 02:31:11,806
SPEAKER_1:  And so the brilliance is unlocked in all those different places.

02:31:13,026 --> 02:31:17,534
SPEAKER_1:  And so all these young people now have the opportunity to like do something.

02:31:17,762 --> 02:31:18,686
SPEAKER_1:  to change the world.

02:31:19,618 --> 02:31:22,238
SPEAKER_0:  I had a chance to visit.

02:31:22,562 --> 02:31:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  Um, pause now.

02:31:24,834 --> 02:31:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  So I.

02:31:25,890 --> 02:31:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:31:27,074 --> 02:31:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  was invited to give a talk in a very northern most part of the country.

02:31:34,754 --> 02:31:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  that was impacted by the war tremendously.

02:31:38,530 --> 02:31:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  And it was a...

02:31:41,314 --> 02:31:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  public talk.

02:31:42,658 --> 02:31:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  was open to everybody in the village.

02:31:45,218 --> 02:31:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  And I was told even people drew from Sarajevo to attend.

02:31:49,954 --> 02:31:50,590
SPEAKER_0:  whenever I

02:31:50,978 --> 02:31:51,806
SPEAKER_0:  think about.

02:31:54,914 --> 02:31:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  our role as a scientist or...

02:31:57,986 --> 02:32:00,542
SPEAKER_0:  beneficiaries of the knowledge that we create.

02:32:01,090 --> 02:32:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  I always think about that night.

02:32:03,234 --> 02:32:07,102
SPEAKER_0:  That's how many people were in that room. It was incredibly.

02:32:08,002 --> 02:32:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  crowded.

02:32:09,282 --> 02:32:10,238
SPEAKER_0:  And the-

02:32:10,722 --> 02:32:12,478
SPEAKER_0:  lots of young people.

02:32:12,962 --> 02:32:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  who were trying to

02:32:15,298 --> 02:32:16,606
SPEAKER_0:  start everything new.

02:32:16,994 --> 02:32:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  and not do.

02:32:18,914 --> 02:32:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  or not carry.

02:32:22,690 --> 02:32:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  replace whatever maybe the feeling that was taken from them with hope and love.

02:32:29,186 --> 02:32:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  starts.

02:32:30,210 --> 02:32:33,022
SPEAKER_0:  a new beginning, be the seed for the next generation.

02:32:33,762 --> 02:32:36,222
SPEAKER_0:  And it moved me so much that they all came.

02:32:36,610 --> 02:32:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  to hear about.

02:32:38,050 --> 02:32:38,718
SPEAKER_0:  early life.

02:32:39,330 --> 02:32:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  Space.

02:32:40,322 --> 02:32:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  something maybe different for them that maybe they were always interested in and never thought about.

02:32:46,050 --> 02:32:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  but what's

02:32:46,786 --> 02:32:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  What stayed with me was the look on their faces and the feeling in the room.

02:32:52,866 --> 02:32:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  The energy just was really...

02:32:54,626 --> 02:32:57,406
SPEAKER_1:  moving to their willingness to be the seed.

02:32:58,242 --> 02:32:59,806
SPEAKER_1:  the first of their.

02:33:00,130 --> 02:33:02,005
SPEAKER_1:  family and generation to do that.

02:33:02,005 --> 02:33:02,974
SPEAKER_0:  Big news.

02:33:03,202 --> 02:33:04,158
SPEAKER_0:  and I will.

02:33:04,450 --> 02:33:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  And that's exactly.

02:33:05,794 --> 02:33:07,326
SPEAKER_0:  Why I'm telling this whole-

02:33:07,874 --> 02:33:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  story because

02:33:09,442 --> 02:33:09,854
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:33:10,178 --> 02:33:16,510
SPEAKER_0:  For most of us, we may have to be that seed in our families, that the first one to do something new.

02:33:17,282 --> 02:33:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  Um, do to break that cycle, whatever is it that you want to break.

02:33:22,178 --> 02:33:22,718
SPEAKER_0:  free from.

02:33:23,362 --> 02:33:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  I want, I would want the young people to know that you can be that.

02:33:28,418 --> 02:33:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  that there are.

02:33:29,506 --> 02:33:29,918
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:33:30,882 --> 02:33:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:33:32,258 --> 02:33:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  Just.

02:33:32,834 --> 02:33:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  Wonderful things.

02:33:34,050 --> 02:33:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  to learn from this life. And it's just.

02:33:36,866 --> 02:33:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  incredible to be living.

02:33:39,010 --> 02:33:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  and I would.

02:33:39,970 --> 02:33:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  want them to know that their voice matters and they need to use it, especially

02:33:44,994 --> 02:33:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:33:46,722 --> 02:33:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  those who...

02:33:47,682 --> 02:33:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  think that their voice doesn't matter.

02:33:51,298 --> 02:33:55,678
SPEAKER_0:  And ultimately, I think what it comes down to is to trust in yourself.

02:33:56,482 --> 02:33:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  trusting and respecting your voice.

02:33:59,074 --> 02:34:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  If you're not loved...

02:34:00,482 --> 02:34:06,974
SPEAKER_0:  Learn how to love. If you were not respected, start by respecting yourself. Learn how to respect yourself. We can teach ourselves things.

02:34:08,130 --> 02:34:09,886
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's really difficult.

02:34:10,114 --> 02:34:11,966
SPEAKER_1:  when you're surrounded by people.

02:34:12,706 --> 02:34:13,790
SPEAKER_1:  that don't believe in you.

02:34:14,146 --> 02:34:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, I definitely.

02:34:17,122 --> 02:34:18,302
SPEAKER_0:  know the feeling and...

02:34:18,594 --> 02:34:21,246
SPEAKER_0:  I would just want them to know that.

02:34:21,602 --> 02:34:23,422
SPEAKER_0:  They don't need to be defined.

02:34:24,450 --> 02:34:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

02:34:25,282 --> 02:34:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  or reduce down to.

02:34:27,202 --> 02:34:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  what others see in them.

02:34:30,626 --> 02:34:34,654
SPEAKER_1:  Believe in yourself, have the respect for yourself. Try to develop the respect and the love for yourself.

02:34:35,746 --> 02:34:36,638
SPEAKER_1:  And then from that...

02:34:37,122 --> 02:34:37,982
SPEAKER_1:  It flourishes.

02:34:38,274 --> 02:34:39,774
SPEAKER_1:  You'll find others that'll give you love.

02:34:40,034 --> 02:34:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  It may not.

02:34:41,346 --> 02:34:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, life is not fair. It's true.

02:34:43,746 --> 02:34:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it's be prepared that it's a it's a it's not very fair. 4.

02:34:49,890 --> 02:34:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  And so I don't want to depict this.

02:34:52,098 --> 02:34:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  Disney story that and then yes and everything will be just fine.

02:34:56,258 --> 02:34:59,358
SPEAKER_0:  It mostly isn't, but you learn a way. Learn, you know.

02:34:59,586 --> 02:35:00,606
SPEAKER_0:  Life does it all the time.

02:35:04,194 --> 02:35:06,942
SPEAKER_1:  Speaking of which, what do you think is the meaning of all this?

02:35:07,842 --> 02:35:09,022
SPEAKER_1:  What's the meaning of life?

02:35:10,754 --> 02:35:11,742
SPEAKER_1:  Why are we here?

02:35:12,098 --> 02:35:12,830
SPEAKER_1:  Why we are here.

02:35:14,050 --> 02:35:15,486
SPEAKER_1:  all the beauty you've discussed.

02:35:16,642 --> 02:35:17,246
SPEAKER_1:  Why?

02:35:18,658 --> 02:35:21,630
SPEAKER_1:  is the translational mechanism machinery here.

02:35:23,394 --> 02:35:23,806
SPEAKER_1:  Why?

02:35:24,098 --> 02:35:25,598
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think there is. As you can see on this video, I broke my rock faster than myilte. So this is it.

02:35:26,178 --> 02:35:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  Why so much beauty?

02:35:28,066 --> 02:35:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  Oh.

02:35:28,834 --> 02:35:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  It is because we choose to see it that way. It's beautiful.

02:35:32,386 --> 02:35:32,798
SPEAKER_0:  What's?

02:35:33,410 --> 02:35:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  There is no meaning, I don't think so.

02:35:36,514 --> 02:35:37,822
SPEAKER_1:  Why is it so beautiful?

02:35:38,114 --> 02:35:39,038
SPEAKER_1:  Why do we choose?

02:35:40,354 --> 02:35:41,054
SPEAKER_1:  from where.

02:35:41,442 --> 02:35:42,558
SPEAKER_1:  is the imperative.

02:35:43,106 --> 02:35:44,638
SPEAKER_1:  to see it as...

02:35:45,378 --> 02:35:47,454
SPEAKER_1:  to see so much beauty in a thing.

02:35:48,034 --> 02:35:50,526
SPEAKER_1:  that scientifically speaking.

02:35:51,042 --> 02:35:51,486
SPEAKER_1:  or

02:35:51,874 --> 02:35:54,398
SPEAKER_1:  from a rational perspective is void.

02:35:54,722 --> 02:35:55,102
SPEAKER_1:  beauty.

02:35:55,746 --> 02:35:57,310
SPEAKER_1:  It's just, it just is.

02:35:58,626 --> 02:36:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  Not everybody chooses.

02:36:00,450 --> 02:36:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  to see the beauty.

02:36:03,874 --> 02:36:04,798
SPEAKER_1:  Hate is gonna hate.

02:36:06,690 --> 02:36:08,565
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, we have the capacity.

02:36:08,565 --> 02:36:14,565
SPEAKER_0:  We have the capacity, so why not use it to the fullest, right? We have the capacity.

02:36:14,565 --> 02:36:16,254
SPEAKER_1:  that capacity, isn't that fascinating?

02:36:16,738 --> 02:36:17,726
SPEAKER_1:  Have we developed that?

02:36:18,050 --> 02:36:22,430
SPEAKER_1:  It feels like that was always laid in there in the whole process of life.

02:36:23,426 --> 02:36:24,638
SPEAKER_1:  this ability to...

02:36:25,954 --> 02:36:28,830
SPEAKER_1:  to find, to introspect ourselves.

02:36:29,474 --> 02:36:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's definitely suiting to things like that.

02:36:32,002 --> 02:36:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  but I don't think...

02:36:33,378 --> 02:36:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  there is a meaning like that way. It's fascinating that we can understand it.

02:36:39,298 --> 02:36:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:36:40,194 --> 02:36:41,310
SPEAKER_1:  But why is it soothing?

02:36:43,330 --> 02:36:44,455
SPEAKER_1:  There's a desire, there's a-

02:36:44,455 --> 02:36:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  But suiting doesn't mean...

02:36:48,002 --> 02:36:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  there's a meaning. Why why is soothing a meaning?

02:36:51,426 --> 02:36:56,126
SPEAKER_0:  Let me just put it this way, because there is just, I think, so much unfairness going on.

02:36:57,090 --> 02:37:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  I wouldn't even dare myself to think that there's a meaning.

02:37:00,610 --> 02:37:03,358
SPEAKER_0:  out of respect to the ones that are suffering.

02:37:04,866 --> 02:37:05,374
SPEAKER_1:  I see.

02:37:05,890 --> 02:37:06,558
SPEAKER_1:  I-

02:37:07,074 --> 02:37:07,582
SPEAKER_1:  stink.

02:37:09,186 --> 02:37:18,430
SPEAKER_1:  I think out of suffering emerges flourishing in beauty. I mean, that's what I see. I agree with you. When I went to Ukraine and saw all the people suffering.

02:37:18,978 --> 02:37:20,318
SPEAKER_1:  in their eyes.

02:37:20,610 --> 02:37:24,638
SPEAKER_1:  and in their stories is a hope for the future, is a love.

02:37:25,474 --> 02:37:26,014
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:37:26,338 --> 02:37:33,150
SPEAKER_1:  is a love for the people who are still living, is a love for life, so it's there. And that's the dark thing is the suffering.

02:37:33,538 --> 02:37:36,670
SPEAKER_1:  and the law somehow intensifies your appreciation.

02:37:37,378 --> 02:37:38,814
SPEAKER_1:  of the life that is to the left.

02:37:39,458 --> 02:37:41,086
SPEAKER_0:  That's a weird thing too. I think that's-

02:37:41,890 --> 02:37:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  There's some.

02:37:43,234 --> 02:37:44,286
SPEAKER_0:  something about.

02:37:45,634 --> 02:37:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  still doing your best.

02:37:47,842 --> 02:37:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  and believing that there's...

02:37:51,042 --> 02:37:51,454
SPEAKER_0:  There is

02:37:52,322 --> 02:37:54,462
SPEAKER_0:  whatever goodness is worth.

02:37:55,490 --> 02:37:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  working for.

02:37:57,218 --> 02:37:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:37:59,554 --> 02:38:03,006
SPEAKER_0:  is beyond and to do that without a meaning.

02:38:04,194 --> 02:38:07,006
SPEAKER_0:  that there's something more humiliating, humbling.

02:38:07,682 --> 02:38:09,502
SPEAKER_0:  and profound about that.

02:38:12,194 --> 02:38:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  And I, we have a-

02:38:15,778 --> 02:38:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:38:16,994 --> 02:38:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  this will come out very random. Okay so I just saw tighten sounds.

02:38:21,250 --> 02:38:21,694
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:38:22,018 --> 02:38:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  In Turkish bathrooms?

02:38:24,130 --> 02:38:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  There is this sign.

02:38:26,914 --> 02:38:28,286
SPEAKER_0:  that says...

02:38:29,634 --> 02:38:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  Leave it.

02:38:30,626 --> 02:38:32,094
SPEAKER_0:  is you want to find it.

02:38:35,042 --> 02:38:35,806
SPEAKER_0:  And I think...

02:38:36,706 --> 02:38:37,662
SPEAKER_0:  That's a pretty good.

02:38:38,594 --> 02:38:41,969
SPEAKER_1:  That's your meaning of life found in the turkey. There's wisdom too.

02:38:41,969 --> 02:38:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  There's wisdom to that but it also is because the...

02:38:45,186 --> 02:38:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  however you leave.

02:38:46,658 --> 02:38:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  defines you.

02:38:48,034 --> 02:38:48,350
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

02:38:49,314 --> 02:38:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  So I think there's some.

02:38:51,234 --> 02:38:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  profound meaning to that too, just leave it as you would.

02:38:56,066 --> 02:38:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  wants to find it.

02:38:58,690 --> 02:38:59,934
SPEAKER_1:  so that...

02:39:00,162 --> 02:39:01,598
SPEAKER_1:  your little scribble.

02:39:01,954 --> 02:39:03,390
SPEAKER_1:  in the long story.

02:39:03,618 --> 02:39:04,702
SPEAKER_1:  of life on earth.

02:39:05,122 --> 02:39:06,494
SPEAKER_1:  is one that ultimately

02:39:06,722 --> 02:39:07,934
SPEAKER_1:  did a pretty good job.

02:39:08,482 --> 02:39:11,486
SPEAKER_1:  at least kept it the same as you found.

02:39:12,514 --> 02:39:15,889
SPEAKER_0:  Or at least I left it in the way that I wish I found it.

02:39:15,889 --> 02:39:17,406
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, yeah, right.

02:39:19,010 --> 02:39:20,135
SPEAKER_1:  Oh man.

02:39:20,135 --> 02:39:22,385
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, that's that's a wisdom from Turkish best

02:39:22,385 --> 02:39:23,582
SPEAKER_1:  That's where I...

02:39:23,938 --> 02:39:25,854
SPEAKER_1:  search for wisdom as well and it's...

02:39:26,146 --> 02:39:30,718
SPEAKER_1:  as we started with the origin of life and ended.

02:39:31,554 --> 02:39:35,966
SPEAKER_1:  with the wisdom of the Turkish Baratheon. I think that's a perfect conversation. You're an incredible person.

02:39:36,834 --> 02:39:40,510
