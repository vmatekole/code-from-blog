00:00:00,098 --> 00:00:05,726
SPEAKER_1:  I'm here with Mr. Beast, the brilliant mastermind behind some of the most popular videos ever created.

00:00:06,434 --> 00:00:09,118
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think you'll ever make a video that gets 1 billion views?

00:00:09,538 --> 00:00:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  I think maybe one of the videos we've already made might.

00:00:12,322 --> 00:00:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  Get a billion views.

00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  Which one do you think? Probably like the squid game video with enough time. I mean, it's only a year old and it's already on 300 million or...

00:00:19,426 --> 00:00:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  Some of the newer ones we've done I've gotten like 100 million views in a month.

00:00:23,138 --> 00:00:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:00:23,746 --> 00:00:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  So those four projected over 10 years because YouTube's not going anywhere.

00:00:27,618 --> 00:00:30,046
SPEAKER_1:  Probably one of those. Over time they don't necessarily plateau.

00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:33,950
SPEAKER_0:  It's interesting. We're literally jumping right in. I love it. Uh-

00:00:34,338 --> 00:00:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  So...

00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:35,646
SPEAKER_0:  I-

00:00:35,906 --> 00:00:38,590
SPEAKER_0:  I'm a firm believer that it's much easier to hypothetically get.

00:00:39,074 --> 00:00:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  10 million views on one video than 100,000 on 100.

00:00:42,498 --> 00:00:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  And part of why it's much easier in my opinion is like, if you make a really good video, it's just so evergreen and it never dies.

00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  because YouTube.

00:00:49,218 --> 00:00:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  When you open up YouTube and look at the videos, they're just serving you whatever they think you'll like the best, you know?

00:00:54,402 --> 00:00:56,030
SPEAKER_0:  And so if you just make a great video.

00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  and it's constantly just above.

00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:07,390
SPEAKER_0:  every other video, you know, even two years down the road, then they'll just keep serving it and never stop, you know, which is why it's much easier to make one great video than a bunch of mediocre ones.

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,470
SPEAKER_1:  What about 1 billion subscribers?

00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,758
SPEAKER_1:  You've passed PewDiePie's most subscribed to YouTube channel.

00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,614
SPEAKER_1:  When do you think you get a billion?

00:01:16,354 --> 00:01:17,854
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, let me do some math real quick.

00:01:18,114 --> 00:01:19,070
SPEAKER_1:  So we're on 100.

00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:22,270
SPEAKER_0:  So you think about this? No I don't honestly I-

00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  Because one thing you'll find if you want to gain subscribers, if you want to get views, if you want to make money, almost any metric,

00:01:29,058 --> 00:01:38,302
SPEAKER_0:  in this video creation space if you want something, it all comes back to, okay, well then just make great videos. So instead of like focusing on all these arbitrary vanity metrics.

00:01:38,562 --> 00:01:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  I just kind of focus on the one thing that gets me all that.

00:01:40,962 --> 00:01:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  which is make good videos. But, and I do think we will, one day hit a billion subscribers. I don't have a plan on going anywhere.

00:01:46,818 --> 00:01:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  Even though we're only on 120 million right now I'm the main channel.

00:01:49,922 --> 00:01:52,446
SPEAKER_0:  I think like we're doing around 10 million a month now.

00:01:52,898 --> 00:01:53,246
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:01:53,570 --> 00:02:00,318
SPEAKER_0:  YouTube just, yeah, I just don't see it going anywhere. And I don't see any reason why I'd ever get burnt out or quit. So I think with enough time, yes.

00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:04,959
SPEAKER_1:  I wanted to ask you those family friendly questions before I go to the dark questions.

00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:10,959
SPEAKER_0:  We have dark questions right now, but if you wanted to hook them, you would start off with the dark question. That's how you get them. Okay.

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,830
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, well, let me ask about the...

00:02:13,218 --> 00:02:14,398
SPEAKER_1:  A Twitter poll you posted.

00:02:14,754 --> 00:02:15,710
SPEAKER_1:  at 10,000.

00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  dollar death poll.

00:02:17,602 --> 00:02:18,366
SPEAKER_1:  He tweeted.

00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,518
SPEAKER_1:  If someone offered you $10,000 but if you take it, a random person on earth dies.

00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:25,662
SPEAKER_1:  Would you take the $10,000?

00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,894
SPEAKER_1:  and 45% of people said yes.

00:02:29,186 --> 00:02:33,598
SPEAKER_1:  That's, at least at the time I checked, 850,000 people committing murder.

00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,678
SPEAKER_1:  for just eight.

00:02:36,034 --> 00:02:37,918
SPEAKER_1:  $1.5 billion in total.

00:02:38,306 --> 00:02:40,702
SPEAKER_1:  So what do you learn about human nature from that?

00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  That's a good question.

00:02:43,938 --> 00:02:50,846
SPEAKER_0:  Honestly, this is like late at night when I threw that up too. I was just like, huh, this will be a funny thing. I assumed it'd be 90% no and like 10% yes.

00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,926
SPEAKER_0:  but there are a lot of serious people.

00:02:53,186 --> 00:02:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  Um, for you guys listening, I just did this random Twitter poll. I was like.

00:02:57,154 --> 00:03:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  Would you take 10 grand if it meant someone random in the world died?

00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of the replies on the tweet were like, hell yeah, why not? And I was just not expecting that.

00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:09,731
SPEAKER_0:  And so I don't really know. I mean, I feel like your take would be better than mine.

00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,454
SPEAKER_1:  Was it disturbing to you, surprising to you?

00:03:11,586 --> 00:03:20,446
SPEAKER_0:  A little bit, yeah. But obviously a lot of people were trolling, but you read through those replies, I do think like 10% of them were like dead serious. WELL

00:03:20,642 --> 00:03:23,582
SPEAKER_1:  I think sometimes the trolling and the lulls reveal.

00:03:24,226 --> 00:03:28,094
SPEAKER_1:  thing we're too embarrassed to admit about the darker aspects of our nature.

00:03:28,418 --> 00:03:31,518
SPEAKER_1:  So I don't know if you listened to Dan Carlin's Hardcore History Podcast.

00:03:32,034 --> 00:03:34,558
SPEAKER_1:  He has an episode on painful tainment.

00:03:34,818 --> 00:03:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  which he

00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,598
SPEAKER_1:  describes throughout history.

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,246
SPEAKER_1:  how humans have been really attracted to watching the suffering of others.

00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,798
SPEAKER_1:  So public executions, all that kind of stuff.

00:03:45,122 --> 00:03:47,646
SPEAKER_1:  and he believes that's in all of us.

00:03:47,938 --> 00:03:50,494
SPEAKER_1:  that for example if something like a YouTube

00:03:50,786 --> 00:03:51,870
SPEAKER_1:  or different platform.

00:03:52,994 --> 00:03:54,846
SPEAKER_1:  stream to public execution.

00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,758
SPEAKER_1:  or streamed the torture of another human being.

00:03:58,626 --> 00:04:01,598
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of people would say that's deeply unethical.

00:04:01,922 --> 00:04:03,070
SPEAKER_1:  but they will still tune in.

00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:03,966
SPEAKER_1:  and watch.

00:04:04,226 --> 00:04:05,182
SPEAKER_1:  And that we're...

00:04:05,474 --> 00:04:07,294
SPEAKER_1:  We're attracted to that drama.

00:04:07,746 --> 00:04:10,014
SPEAKER_1:  and especially the most extreme versions of that drama.

00:04:10,338 --> 00:04:10,942
SPEAKER_1:  So I think.

00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,350
SPEAKER_1:  part of the lulls.

00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,422
SPEAKER_1:  reveals something that's actually true in that poll.

00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:16,286
SPEAKER_1:  that.

00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,462
SPEAKER_1:  Like your answer is so much better than mine.

00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,390
SPEAKER_1:  Do you?

00:04:19,746 --> 00:04:22,206
SPEAKER_1:  Think about that maybe even with the squid game.

00:04:23,426 --> 00:04:28,862
SPEAKER_1:  So I think, how many views does this game currently have? 300 million? Something like this?

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:30,718
SPEAKER_1:  So...

00:04:32,642 --> 00:04:33,694
SPEAKER_1:  Just imagine...

00:04:34,722 --> 00:04:37,342
SPEAKER_1:  thought experiment how many views that video would get.

00:04:38,082 --> 00:04:39,102
SPEAKER_1:  It feels like real.

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I mean YouTube is like, we'll turn a blind eye. We won't take it down.

00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I mean...

00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:46,677
SPEAKER_0:  I've obviously probably have billions of you.

00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:49,374
SPEAKER_1:  How do you think you will die and do you think you'll be during a video?

00:04:49,890 --> 00:05:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  Probably doing something dumb like going to space when I'm older, like trying to go to Mars or something like that. I know for a fact it won't be on a video. Every video we do with safety experts and stuff like that, so it's not really risk, it's just that a lot of experts are doing it, and it's really helpful to walk down

00:05:01,826 --> 00:05:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:09,717
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I could see myself like, you know, after a million people go to Mars or something like that, I'd probably like, you know what, let's go. And something like that maybe.

00:05:09,717 --> 00:05:12,510
SPEAKER_1:  not in the name of a video just for the hallway. No. No.

00:05:13,218 --> 00:05:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  Are you open to taking risks when you shoot videos? You just went to Antarctica. I mean, you're putting yourself in the line a little bit, right?

00:05:19,394 --> 00:05:24,286
SPEAKER_0:  Of course, but we've had that video on the works for three years and then we consult with tons of experts.

00:05:24,514 --> 00:05:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  radar the entire path we're going to walk beforehand to see if there's crevasses. So we know there's no crevasses, we do training, we consult with experts, and we have survival guides there with us and monitor the weather and everything.

00:05:35,394 --> 00:05:41,086
SPEAKER_0:  It's like any variable that where we could get harmed, we just pre-plan for it. Same thing with buried alive.

00:05:41,378 --> 00:05:43,614
SPEAKER_0:  David Blaine spent a week underground.

00:05:43,906 --> 00:05:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  And so I consulted with him and consulted with basically anyone who ever buried themselves alive. You know, the coffin we used to bury me, we did so many tests. Like that coffin was buried 10 times before I was, you know, for way longer than 50 hours.

00:05:56,034 --> 00:06:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  it tested the airflow and everything to the point where I was safer in that coffin underground than I was above ground. So we just tend to just not leave anything up to chance, you know?

00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:06,942
SPEAKER_1:  Another strange question then.

00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,214
SPEAKER_1:  So you recorded these videos.

00:06:10,178 --> 00:06:12,446
SPEAKER_1:  to yourself five years, 10 years from now.

00:06:12,994 --> 00:06:14,270
SPEAKER_1:  Have you recorded a video?

00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,582
SPEAKER_1:  that's to be released.

00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:16,670
SPEAKER_1:  once you die.

00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  Well, first off...

00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  I am just glad that not every one of your questions have to do with like views or things like that. You really had me kidding.

00:06:23,778 --> 00:06:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  different questions. So this is good.

00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:36,766
SPEAKER_0:  No, seriously. It's a little dark. No, no, but it's fine because a lot of people just be like, how much money do you make? You know, it's just something I just, everything's always about money now over for when people talk to me. So it's nice.

00:06:37,154 --> 00:06:48,190
SPEAKER_0:  But for the videos I made, for you guys who probably don't follow me too closely, when I had 8,000 subscribers and I was a teenager, I filmed a bunch of videos and scheduled them years in the future. And I said...

00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,478
SPEAKER_0:  I filmed one where I was like, hi, me in a year. And the video went up a year later and it was just like, hey.

00:06:52,706 --> 00:06:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  I think you'll have 100,000 subscribers. And then I did one where I was like, time me in five years.

00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,526
SPEAKER_0:  I was like, hey, in five years, I think you'll have a million.

00:06:58,754 --> 00:07:01,342
SPEAKER_0:  and then one that hasn't come out yet, but comes out in two years.

00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  was high me in 10 years and I tried to predict 10 years later how many subs I'd have

00:07:05,954 --> 00:07:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  what he's referring to.

00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:09,918
SPEAKER_0:  And yes, there are some that are scheduled, like...

00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  20 years in the future. And so if I don't dial, just move them up.

00:07:13,698 --> 00:07:14,046
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:07:14,498 --> 00:07:16,190
SPEAKER_0:  I remember, because I filmed these though, like...

00:07:16,578 --> 00:07:18,878
SPEAKER_0:  seven years ago, but it was.

00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  I remember saying a line like...

00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  You know, if I'm dead, then I...

00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:34,974
SPEAKER_0:  currently just in a coffin and like whatever, blah, blah, blah. And because the only way the video would go up is if I'm not alive and if I'm not alive, then I won't be able to push back the schedule upload date so it will go public automatically. And so yeah, I have a couple of those.

00:07:35,202 --> 00:07:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  Like if I knew I was gonna die of like...

00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:52,638
SPEAKER_0:  cancer or something and I had like three months to live. I would vlog every day, I'd film so many videos and then I would just schedule upload a video a week for like the next five years so it's like I'm still alive and I would completely act like I'm still alive and everything and I think something like that would be cool.

00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:58,110
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know why, but I fantasize, not fantasize, but I've dreamt about that a lot.

00:07:58,434 --> 00:08:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, if I only had 30 days to live, what would I do? And for me, I would try to make like a decades worth of content and schedule upload it so they automatically go public in the future.

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  And so it's just like I never died. I'm just there.

00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:13,790
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's a kind of immortality, but it's also kind of troll.

00:08:14,242 --> 00:08:15,358
SPEAKER_1:  on the concept of time.

00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:19,454
SPEAKER_1:  that you can die in the physical space but persist in the digital space.

00:08:19,938 --> 00:08:21,662
SPEAKER_1:  I actually, I recorded a video like that.

00:08:22,178 --> 00:08:22,558
SPEAKER_1:  ZED

00:08:23,234 --> 00:08:24,222
SPEAKER_1:  some concerns and

00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,542
SPEAKER_1:  I just thought it's also a good exercise to do. A video would like.

00:08:29,058 --> 00:08:30,302
SPEAKER_1:  to be released if I die.

00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,310
SPEAKER_1:  And it was actually a really interesting exercise.

00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,118
SPEAKER_1:  It's cool. Like it shows like what you really care about. I guess it's like writing a will.

00:08:37,378 --> 00:08:39,253
SPEAKER_1:  when you're younger you don't think about that kind of stuff

00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:46,331
SPEAKER_0:  Exactly. Mine was just dumb. I'm bones in a coffin. Yours was probably so serious. No, it's fine.

00:08:46,331 --> 00:08:49,342
SPEAKER_1:  actually, what you realize is like there's no point to be serious at this point.

00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:50,558
SPEAKER_1:  It's a weird.

00:08:50,882 --> 00:08:56,030
SPEAKER_1:  thing i guess you've done this but it's a weird thing to address the world when you the physical you is no longer there.

00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,949
SPEAKER_1:  So like, you know this would only be released if you're no longer there. Exactly.

00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:05,694
SPEAKER_0:  You know what's funny? Of all the people listening to this, we're probably the only two people.

00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:12,926
SPEAKER_0:  that have made videos for when we die. It's like such a niche thing and the fact that we're bonding over it's kind of funny. I think people should-

00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:16,862
SPEAKER_1:  Think about doing that. It's not just about YouTube. It's also social media. Just think about it.

00:09:17,698 --> 00:09:19,326
SPEAKER_1:  Like there's gonna be a last tweet.

00:09:19,714 --> 00:09:22,590
SPEAKER_1:  And the last, I don't know, Facebook post, the last Instagram post.

00:09:23,394 --> 00:09:24,286
SPEAKER_1:  and uh...

00:09:25,186 --> 00:09:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I feel like there's some aspect.

00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:28,574
SPEAKER_1:  That's...

00:09:29,186 --> 00:09:32,126
SPEAKER_1:  meditative to just even considering making a post like that.

00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:35,838
SPEAKER_1:  And also it's a way for the people that love you to kind of...

00:09:36,418 --> 00:09:37,543
SPEAKER_1:  Like celebrate. Check ou.

00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,518
SPEAKER_0:  Think that would help them cope or not.

00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  Like if someone randomly watching this did film a video.

00:09:42,754 --> 00:09:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  you know, for if they accidentally died in some freak accident to be given to their family. Do you think that would?

00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  And it was like a genuine. I think it would really help.

00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it depends because like- How would you even intro that?

00:09:52,514 --> 00:09:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  Hey Mom!

00:09:53,346 --> 00:09:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  If you're seeing this, you know, it means I'm probably dead. Yeah, exactly. That's how you entry. That's the opener.

00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  I just want you to know. Yeah, I guess.

00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:07,166
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, and I guess you could say in a kind of funny way, but and just talk about the things that mean a lot to you.

00:10:07,426 --> 00:10:11,262
SPEAKER_1:  Because otherwise you are at the risk of the last post you have is like.

00:10:12,354 --> 00:10:14,229
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know talking shit about like.

00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  McDonald's, screw it by order. Exactly. And then you're dead, that's it, 100 years.

00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,295
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know this.

00:10:20,295 --> 00:10:25,566
SPEAKER_1:  I do recommend it, it's like the Stoics meditate on death every day in the same way you kind of

00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:31,038
SPEAKER_1:  meditating your death when you make a video like that. Because it's actually not just even talking to yourself, it's talking to the world.

00:10:31,778 --> 00:10:32,510
SPEAKER_1:  And it like.

00:10:32,738 --> 00:10:33,886
SPEAKER_1:  For some reason, at least for me.

00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:35,678
SPEAKER_1:  that made it very concrete.

00:10:36,098 --> 00:10:37,214
SPEAKER_1:  that there's going to be an end.

00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:38,686
SPEAKER_1:  And I'm like.

00:10:39,714 --> 00:10:44,798
SPEAKER_1:  It's almost it's over for me. If I make in the video, it's over for me. It's an interesting thought experiment. I recommend people.

00:10:45,314 --> 00:10:45,630
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:46,910
SPEAKER_1:  Try it

00:10:47,234 --> 00:10:48,158
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

00:10:49,186 --> 00:10:50,526
SPEAKER_0:  From, are you afraid of death by the way?

00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:52,734
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, I- I-

00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  It's hard because...

00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  Like, what if you just die and then you just see nothing forever? You know? Yeah, the nothingness. It just fades to blackness and you're just like that for trillions upon trillions to-

00:11:04,162 --> 00:11:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  billion squared years.

00:11:06,114 --> 00:11:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  It's just, it's scary. But also before you're born, you don't remember those X amount of years either. So.

00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  That gives me a little comfort, but.

00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:15,518
SPEAKER_0:  No, it's definitely.

00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  Very scary. Something I'd rather not think about until I'm like 80. I'll deal with that problem then.

00:11:21,026 --> 00:11:22,334
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know if I told you this, but.

00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  I'm kind of hopeful that someone like Elon was like

00:11:25,698 --> 00:11:26,974
SPEAKER_0:  smart people just like.

00:11:27,202 --> 00:11:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  You know what screw it.

00:11:28,226 --> 00:11:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  I'm gonna figure out a way where we can slow down aging, get it where we can live to be two, 300 years old just like set their sights on that.

00:11:35,138 --> 00:11:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  and then just kind of save us.

00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:11:37,378 --> 00:11:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  Be really nice. It's like, it's, it's almost.

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:40,638
SPEAKER_0:  absurd.

00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  to think that in our lifetime, they won't figure out a way to just even slightly slow down aging, where we could live to be like 120, 130. And then that extra time, they won't figure out somewhere where we could live to be 200. Like obviously not immortal.

00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  but...

00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,662
SPEAKER_0:  I don't see how in my lifetime.

00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,382
SPEAKER_0:  the life expectancy doesn't just expand.

00:11:56,834 --> 00:12:01,566
SPEAKER_1:  What also could be that the immortality is achieved in the digital realm.

00:12:02,018 --> 00:12:04,766
SPEAKER_1:  Could be long after you're gone as a Mr. Beast.

00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,102
SPEAKER_1:  run by a chargpt-tab system. Exactly.

00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, that consumes everything I ever said, everything I ever wrote, but I don't want that. I want to live.

00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  What are you smart people out there, figure it out. I'll keep you entertained, but I need you to figure out how to keep me alive. Stay with me till 200, that will make me happy.

00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:24,894
SPEAKER_1:  Well that's funny, who owns the identity of Mr. Beast once the physical body is gone?

00:12:25,762 --> 00:12:31,582
SPEAKER_1:  Like is it illegal to create another MrBeast that's Chad GPT based? I don't know what the laws are on that.

00:12:31,874 --> 00:12:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, once I'm dead, I don't care.

00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:37,059
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I... Well, you just said you did, Kermit.

00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:41,630
SPEAKER_1:  There could be a AI like many Mr. Beast that are created after you're gone.

00:12:42,338 --> 00:12:45,054
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, that'd be cool to be able to like train up a model and.

00:12:45,282 --> 00:12:47,934
SPEAKER_0:  and let them loose so my content lives on, I guess. Yeah.

00:12:48,386 --> 00:12:48,958
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:12:49,442 --> 00:12:50,782
SPEAKER_1:  but it somehow feels...

00:12:51,394 --> 00:12:55,422
SPEAKER_1:  like it diminishes the value you contribute. Yeah, it's inauthentic, but it's also...

00:12:56,354 --> 00:12:59,550
SPEAKER_1:  There's some aspect to the finiteness of the art.

00:13:00,386 --> 00:13:01,511
SPEAKER_1:  being necessary for you.

00:13:01,511 --> 00:13:07,454
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, once the second that thing starts spamming out videos, the videos lose all meaning and it's pointless and it's a money grab.

00:13:09,154 --> 00:13:11,134
SPEAKER_1:  If you were on YouTube for a-

00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,894
SPEAKER_1:  how long she's run it, for a year.

00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,910
SPEAKER_1:  How do you change it? How do you improve it?

00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,030
SPEAKER_0:  It's hard because...

00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:19,326
SPEAKER_0:  You know, obviously I'm biased because we're doing really well, but.

00:13:19,554 --> 00:13:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like.

00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  When I open up YouTube on my television, I get the videos I wanna watch. I don't-

00:13:25,314 --> 00:13:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know. I don't-

00:13:26,786 --> 00:13:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  I don't ever open it and wonder like, what are these? What are these 10 videos on my homepage? When I click on a video, my suggestion, I don't ever wonder what these are, like I...

00:13:34,594 --> 00:13:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  I-

00:13:35,394 --> 00:13:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  And maybe it's because I'm very adamant about like the kind of videos I watch and I try not to watch videos that I don't want to get recommended more because I just that's how I think but

00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,174
SPEAKER_0:  I'm very happy with how it is at the moment. I think-

00:13:46,914 --> 00:13:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  One thing though that I just hate with the passion is the comment section on YouTube. It's just so bad.

00:13:51,362 --> 00:13:53,278
SPEAKER_0:  But I know that's not something that's gonna

00:13:53,602 --> 00:13:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  10X the growth of the platform, but if you think about it.

00:13:56,386 --> 00:14:00,574
SPEAKER_0:  You go to Reddit to read comments and somehow like, you know, usually the top.

00:14:00,898 --> 00:14:03,678
SPEAKER_0:  post on a popular Reddit post.

00:14:04,226 --> 00:14:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  or not spam.

00:14:05,218 --> 00:14:10,174
SPEAKER_0:  You know what I mean? Like have you ever clicked on something on the front page of Reddit and the most upvoted reply to it is like...

00:14:10,594 --> 00:14:16,926
SPEAKER_0:  go check out my site right here. And it's like trying to scam you out of a thousand dollars. Yeah, I can't even think of one instance I've ever had that happen. So this is my channel, my main niche.

00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  Like Reddit, it's so nice to click on posts and just see what people have to say.

00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:26,526
SPEAKER_0:  I almost wish like you had that same feeling when you read the comments on a YouTube video. Instead it's like...

00:14:26,882 --> 00:14:40,126
SPEAKER_0:  It's so many people just copy and pasting so many bots that just grab the top comment for your previous video and paste it over. So the top comments on every videos are the same. And the things that break through that are just scammers trying to get you to give them a thousand dollars for a free, you know, fake ad.

00:14:40,386 --> 00:14:43,038
SPEAKER_1:  that comment section is one of the most lively on the internet.

00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,886
SPEAKER_1:  So it would be amazing if YouTube invested in

00:14:46,274 --> 00:14:50,814
SPEAKER_1:  creating an actual community, like where people could do high effort comments and be rewarded for it, like on Reddit.

00:14:51,426 --> 00:14:52,551
SPEAKER_1:  Like actually right out of...

00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  That would make me so happy. Cause like when I upload a video.

00:14:56,002 --> 00:15:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  I usually go to Twitter to see feedback. I read my comments and I'll flip through newest.

00:15:01,794 --> 00:15:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  It's just, I feel like.

00:15:03,714 --> 00:15:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  Reddit and Twitter just give me so much better filtered feedback, especially now that

00:15:08,194 --> 00:15:10,494
SPEAKER_0:  with Twitter blue because people pay $8 a month.

00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:15:11,874 --> 00:15:20,542
SPEAKER_0:  I've noticed like any tweets I get from verified users now, they're usually not just garbage troll takes. Like these are people paying $8 a month. Like they're-

00:15:20,802 --> 00:15:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  usually.

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  relatively sensible.

00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:28,030
SPEAKER_0:  And so it's been pretty nice. Like after I upload a video, I just go on the verified tab on Twitter and just see what people have to say.

00:15:28,418 --> 00:15:31,198
SPEAKER_0:  And anyways, I live for the day that YouTube's like that.

00:15:31,874 --> 00:15:32,798
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think about it?

00:15:33,122 --> 00:15:34,814
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think of all the?

00:15:36,194 --> 00:15:38,942
SPEAKER_1:  fun activity happening recently since Elon.

00:15:39,202 --> 00:15:39,582
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:15:39,714 --> 00:15:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  I bought Twitter.

00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:46,677
SPEAKER_0:  I think he should make me CEO, like I tweeted.

00:15:46,677 --> 00:15:49,758
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I should say sort of we had, we just...

00:15:49,986 --> 00:15:52,254
SPEAKER_1:  like a couple hours ago I had a conversation with Elon.

00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:55,230
SPEAKER_1:  You guys sent in exchange for some excellent ideas.

00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:59,326
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I legitimately think, obviously you're exceptionally busy, but...

00:15:59,682 --> 00:16:00,638
SPEAKER_1:  I legitimately think.

00:16:01,282 --> 00:16:04,638
SPEAKER_1:  It would be awesome if you somehow participate in the future of Twitter. Yeah, it would be fun.

00:16:05,122 --> 00:16:08,574
SPEAKER_1:  because there's so much possibility of different ideas. First in the sort of the...

00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,398
SPEAKER_1:  the content like.

00:16:10,754 --> 00:16:15,614
SPEAKER_1:  dissemination, hosting, and all the different recommendations like the search and discovery, all the things that YouTube does well.

00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  I think the most exciting thing is...

00:16:18,082 --> 00:16:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  He's willing to move fast. And so I think there's gonna be a lot of interesting things that come out of it.

00:16:23,874 --> 00:16:25,534
SPEAKER_0:  because he's just moving quick and.

00:16:25,858 --> 00:16:30,590
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of these more mature platforms just take years to do the simplest stuff and they're very bureaucratic.

00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:16:31,586 --> 00:16:32,190
SPEAKER_0:  So it's gonna...

00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  I mean.

00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  It'll be interesting to see which way it goes when you just kind of take a move quick, break things, whatever type approach to social media.

00:16:39,682 --> 00:16:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  I'm actually-

00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  Pretty curious to see what features he rolls out.

00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,670
SPEAKER_1:  So it will be your first...

00:16:45,186 --> 00:16:46,302
SPEAKER_1:  Act as Twitter CEO.

00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:47,742
SPEAKER_0:  I can't spoil it.

00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,325
SPEAKER_0:  I gotta get hired.

00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:51,102
SPEAKER_1:

00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:53,214
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think about video on the platform?

00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:57,246
SPEAKER_1:  And do you think that's an interesting or is it like messing with the.

00:16:58,082 --> 00:16:59,207
SPEAKER_1:  The medium, the nature.

00:16:59,207 --> 00:17:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  platform. I think Twitter will always be closer to TikTok than it is to YouTube. Like, at least in its current form. Like, I don't-

00:17:06,114 --> 00:17:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  I don't see.

00:17:07,554 --> 00:17:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  20 minute, one hour long videos or whatever, even 15 minute videos being watched over there. See more is like the short and snappy stuff closer to TikTok.

00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  But...

00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:20,766
SPEAKER_1:  At the same time, Twitter is a really good comments section for the internet.

00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's almost weird why.

00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  Like why doesn't Twitter allow you to embed YouTube videos? Like why?

00:17:26,082 --> 00:17:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  Why does...

00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:27,710
SPEAKER_0:  Understand

00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  You should just ask Elon that. Like, I don't know if that's a YouTube thing, but...

00:17:31,266 --> 00:17:35,838
SPEAKER_0:  When a YouTuber posts a video, why do they have to link to YouTube? Why can't they just embed it on Twitter and just play it there?

00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:37,447
SPEAKER_0:  I mean wouldn't that just solve a lot of-

00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:41,947
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, but then the two companies have to agree to integrate each other's content. I don't know, but I-

00:17:41,947 --> 00:17:46,750
SPEAKER_0:  It seems like a win-win. I mean, well, it's more of a win for Twitter because then people don't have to leave the platform.

00:17:47,138 --> 00:17:48,062
SPEAKER_0:  I mean that would be the...

00:17:48,578 --> 00:17:49,703
SPEAKER_0:  the easiest solution.

00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:52,350
SPEAKER_1:  like when you watch the ads on a YouTube video.

00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:54,677
SPEAKER_1:  that's embedded in Twitter. Who guessed them all?

00:17:54,677 --> 00:18:00,702
SPEAKER_0:  It would still be YouTube, but at least then right now people just post a link and it takes you off Twitter and it just kills your session time on Twitter.

00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:02,878
SPEAKER_1:  That's really interesting. But that, yeah.

00:18:03,138 --> 00:18:04,734
SPEAKER_1:  because the Twitter, whatever the...

00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:09,246
SPEAKER_1:  the dynamics of the comments, especially once the spam bots are taken care of.

00:18:09,794 --> 00:18:10,750
SPEAKER_1:  Twitter just works.

00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:15,998
SPEAKER_1:  It's really nice. So Reddit is a nice comment section for the internet. It's like slower pace, more deliberate.

00:18:16,226 --> 00:18:17,182
SPEAKER_1:  Like higher effort.

00:18:17,954 --> 00:18:19,710
SPEAKER_1:  Twitter's like this high-paced.

00:18:20,194 --> 00:18:25,694
SPEAKER_1:  like ephemeral kind of stream, but there's the vote, the up voting and the down voting works much better because you can do.

00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,358
SPEAKER_1:  Retweeting, right?

00:18:27,618 --> 00:18:30,206
SPEAKER_1:  because the social network is much stronger than it is on YouTube.

00:18:30,498 --> 00:18:31,623
SPEAKER_1:  Like the interconnectivity.

00:18:31,623 --> 00:18:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  Un-un-unready you're gonna get-

00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:41,918
SPEAKER_0:  The top replies are gonna be the most refined ones whereas Twitter, stuff flows to the top that's not super refined. But like you're saying, more off the cuff stream of consciousness which...

00:18:42,178 --> 00:18:44,254
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of people prefer it's a little more personal.

00:18:45,378 --> 00:18:47,358
SPEAKER_1:  How do you think Twitter compares to YouTube?

00:18:47,682 --> 00:18:51,102
SPEAKER_1:  in terms of how you see its future on role in 2023.

00:18:51,394 --> 00:18:53,182
SPEAKER_0:  I think YouTube's gonna be YouTube and-

00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  Not much is really gonna change, but it's gonna keep growing just because.

00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,726
SPEAKER_0:  You know, that's.

00:18:58,082 --> 00:19:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  what it does because it's owned by Google.

00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:11,710
SPEAKER_0:  But Twitter, I don't know, I mean, it's one of those things like you can't predict if like, you know, a year from now, an economy is going to be in a recession or booming and I think Twitter's kind of the same thing.

00:19:12,002 --> 00:19:16,405
SPEAKER_0:  One thing's for certain, a lot of things are gonna be rolled out, but who knows, honestly.

00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:21,278
SPEAKER_1:  You responded to Elon saying, Twitter's unlikely to be able to pay creators more money than YouTube.

00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,878
SPEAKER_1:  Um, why do you think that is?

00:19:23,234 --> 00:19:26,526
SPEAKER_0:  Well, yeah, because I think the tweet I responded to was one where he was saying

00:19:26,946 --> 00:19:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  that.

00:19:28,642 --> 00:19:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  The-

00:19:29,634 --> 00:19:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  users will jump over if Twitter can potentially pay more.

00:19:33,346 --> 00:19:34,430
SPEAKER_0:  than other platforms.

00:19:34,658 --> 00:19:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  I was just saying, obviously, because Google has Google AdWords, and that's Google's whole thing, it's putting ads on stuff. They've been doing it better than anyone else in the world for a very long time.

00:19:42,242 --> 00:19:44,222
SPEAKER_0:  It's very unlikely in the next few years that...

00:19:44,546 --> 00:19:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  Twitter is gonna just magically or any platform, give a creator.

00:19:48,514 --> 00:19:51,006
SPEAKER_0:  the ability to make higher CPMs than on YouTube.

00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  It's... It's...

00:19:52,418 --> 00:19:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  Kinda crazy, like some creators...

00:19:54,626 --> 00:20:12,318
SPEAKER_0:  in December, you know, Q4 because ad rates are higher because of Christmas and everything. Some creators literally make like 30, $40 per thousand views and that's after YouTube's cut. Like it's almost like hard to think about like how high the RPMs get. And even then, once you pull out of finance and cars the high CPM niches and you move into just normal stuff it's still just...

00:20:12,706 --> 00:20:18,174
SPEAKER_0:  They're sheer volume of creators and the fact that all of them get these multi-dollar CPMs at scale.

00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  It's pretty beautiful.

00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,286
SPEAKER_1:  So you do.

00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:26,526
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know what you would call them, but like integrated ads in your videos and you do, I would say masterfully

00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  It's like part of the video. You know about brand deals?

00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,078
SPEAKER_1:  Brand deals, is that what you would call that? Did

00:20:30,306 --> 00:20:32,190
SPEAKER_1:  So it's a brand deal, it's part of the video.

00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:36,222
SPEAKER_1:  It's still really exciting to watch and yet there's a plug for the brand.

00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  In general, just brand deals since you brought it up, integrating them well. I think that's something a lot of creators...

00:20:42,914 --> 00:20:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  Do.

00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:50,494
SPEAKER_0:  Like they'll just do a brand deal out of the blue. They'll just be filming a video and then around the three minute mark, just start talking about a random company. Yeah.

00:20:50,914 --> 00:20:51,230
SPEAKER_0:  You.

00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:58,814
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like if you don't want viewers to click away and you want people to not get pissed off and call you to sell out, you gotta find a way to integrate in the content.

00:20:59,074 --> 00:21:04,286
SPEAKER_0:  And ideally, use the money in the video to make it better. Like, the easiest thing you do when you do a brand deal is just tell people.

00:21:04,546 --> 00:21:06,846
SPEAKER_0:  how you're using money from the brand deal make your content better

00:21:07,106 --> 00:21:11,582
SPEAKER_0:  And if you do that, like no one cares. Now they're supporting you for it. And you go from being a sellout to like, oh.

00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:14,691
SPEAKER_0:  I'm doing this to make better videos for you guys. You know, I don't know.

00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:15,838
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if you can share, but...

00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,406
SPEAKER_1:  with those brands.

00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:19,358
SPEAKER_1:  when you have discussions with them.

00:21:19,682 --> 00:21:22,206
SPEAKER_1:  Are they strict about how long you need to be talking about it?

00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,582
SPEAKER_1:  Or is it more...

00:21:24,066 --> 00:21:25,150
SPEAKER_1:  about their living.

00:21:25,378 --> 00:21:27,422
SPEAKER_1:  control to you about the artistic element of it.

00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  The problem is the ones who don't give us artistic element, we just don't really work with anymore. Sure. Thanks for listening, everyone.

00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we get 100 million views a video now and...

00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  confidently say I know how to entertain them and convert them better than.

00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:41,886
SPEAKER_0:  these random brands so.

00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, yeah, if they don't give us that freedom, I just won't work with them.

00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,765
SPEAKER_1:  So you have that leverage, but for smaller cr-

00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  It's a lot harder. Yeah, and they're gonna just say

00:21:50,882 --> 00:21:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  45 seconds, here's what you say, take it or leave it. And it's like pretty brutal.

00:21:55,074 --> 00:21:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  Because I think just in general.

00:21:57,314 --> 00:21:59,294
SPEAKER_0:  if brands were more accommodating to let.

00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:04,126
SPEAKER_0:  creators tell their story of the brand and talk about the brand in a way that felt a little more natural.

00:22:04,578 --> 00:22:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  I think A, it would be less cringe.

00:22:06,402 --> 00:22:07,710
SPEAKER_0:  people would be less likely to go.

00:22:08,034 --> 00:22:09,310
SPEAKER_0:  and you know tap, tap, tap, skip.

00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  And obviously it would convert better, but they're just so afraid and they want this standardized thing. Hey, these words.

00:22:14,978 --> 00:22:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  and 45 seconds.

00:22:16,674 --> 00:22:17,982
SPEAKER_0:  right here at this three-minute mark.

00:22:18,306 --> 00:22:19,966
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I often think about how...

00:22:20,514 --> 00:22:21,278
SPEAKER_1:  resist that.

00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  You just don't do them, though, right?

00:22:23,362 --> 00:22:28,190
SPEAKER_1:  Not on YouTube, right? On audio, I do ads in the very beginning, and I say you can skip them if you want.

00:22:28,546 --> 00:22:29,671
SPEAKER_1:  uh... but

00:22:29,671 --> 00:22:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  Grant loves that. I don't.

00:22:31,554 --> 00:22:38,174
SPEAKER_1:  Like the point is they So the funny thing about podcast is different than YouTube videos

00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,838
SPEAKER_1:  Podcast people actually.

00:22:40,162 --> 00:22:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  do listen to ads a lot because it's a slower pace and they like the the creator voice

00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:46,942
SPEAKER_1:  like talking about the thing.

00:22:47,234 --> 00:22:47,614
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,022
SPEAKER_1:  But in general I just...

00:22:49,698 --> 00:22:58,430
SPEAKER_1:  don't believe you should be talking about a thing for a minute exactly, and that's going to be effective. I wanna see the data for that. I think what's much more effective is the way you do ads.

00:22:58,690 --> 00:22:59,326
SPEAKER_1:  Which is like...

00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:04,702
SPEAKER_1:  integrated into the content, put a lot of effort into making a part of that, like doing the brand deals.

00:23:05,602 --> 00:23:06,046
SPEAKER_1:  I just.

00:23:06,402 --> 00:23:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  It's difficult.

00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,270
SPEAKER_1:  to have that conversation. It's like a very.

00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:18,558
SPEAKER_1:  strenuous conversations you have to have with brands. You have to have each one at a time. And I just wish there was more of a culture to say like...

00:23:19,138 --> 00:23:21,374
SPEAKER_1:  quality of the ad read matters a lot more.

00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:22,910
SPEAKER_1:  than the uh...

00:23:24,226 --> 00:23:29,406
SPEAKER_1:  the silly parameters like the timing of it, how long it is, the placement of it, all that kind of stuff.

00:23:29,762 --> 00:23:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  What percentage of your viewers do you think have seen one of my videos before?

00:23:34,434 --> 00:23:37,059
SPEAKER_1:  What percentage of the viewers on YouTube, right?

00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:38,014
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, your viewers.

00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:39,367
SPEAKER_1:  of the viewers.

00:23:39,367 --> 00:23:46,334
SPEAKER_0:  YouTube though. Yeah, okay sure or all of them. It's just interesting because you're speaking very specifically like about my brand deal process like for example I made a video going through my personal life like how am I even allowed to.

00:23:46,562 --> 00:23:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  And so in my head, I'm like, I wonder what percentage of these people even have any idea what he's talking about.

00:23:50,818 --> 00:23:52,693
SPEAKER_1:  That's interesting. I love the thinking about.

00:23:52,693 --> 00:23:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  The whole time we were having this conversation, that's all I could...

00:23:55,138 --> 00:23:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  Think about it. God dammit, he's-

00:23:57,186 --> 00:24:05,443
SPEAKER_0:  There's probably like 50% of these people have no fucking clue what he's saying. Probably. And we're about to torture him for five minutes. Yeah, yeah, probably. But that's something I can't turn off in my brain.

00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:08,766
SPEAKER_1:  Less than 50%. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Is that exciting to you?

00:24:08,994 --> 00:24:11,422
SPEAKER_1:  that there's like 50% of people don't.

00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:14,659
SPEAKER_1:  I've not watched the MrBeast video. Isn't that an opportunity to like-

00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I guess it's an opportunity to grow. I don't know. Honestly, I was just kind of excited to hang out with you. Yeah, me too. I mean, it was a lot of fun. Who cares if there's mics? Yeah, so it's kind of like having a buddy to go along the journey as I'm just kind of eating shit and doing my normal grind. It was like kind of fun. And also you just say really wise stuff constantly.

00:24:31,106 --> 00:24:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  So honestly, no, I never even put any thought into like the demographics of what I could gain. It's just interesting because like my retention brain, when you talk about something, I'm instantly like

00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  What value are they gonna get? How many of them are gonna be interested? What percentage of people do I think will lose? And I'm like running all those calculations in the background.

00:24:47,714 --> 00:24:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  And that whole conversation, like the long, it's just something I can't turn off.

00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:52,638
SPEAKER_0:  Bells are like.

00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,805
SPEAKER_0:  Error error, this is bad.

00:24:54,805 --> 00:24:57,406
SPEAKER_1:  What are the different strategies for higher attention?

00:24:58,018 --> 00:24:59,294
SPEAKER_1:  for your videos in general.

00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:03,358
SPEAKER_0:  It's like, how do you cook good food? You know what I mean? That's like the same kind of question.

00:25:03,842 --> 00:25:07,358
SPEAKER_1:  I see. So there's so many different ways that you, so it boils down to.

00:25:07,746 --> 00:25:08,094
SPEAKER_1:  I mean...

00:25:08,994 --> 00:25:11,390
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think at the level of a story?

00:25:11,682 --> 00:25:13,822
SPEAKER_1:  Or do you think like literally watching?

00:25:14,242 --> 00:25:15,294
SPEAKER_1:  Five seconds at a time.

00:25:15,586 --> 00:25:18,211
SPEAKER_1:  Am I gonna tune out here? Am I gonna tune out here? Am I gonna tune out here?

00:25:18,211 --> 00:25:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  It's all of it. You need the overarching narrative and then you also need the micro where every second, you know, needs to be entertaining and you basically

00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:31,582
SPEAKER_0:  What's interesting is the longer people watch something, the more likely they are to keep watching.

00:25:31,938 --> 00:25:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  You don't have to try as hard in the hypothetically back half of a video as you do in the front. Like, even right now, we're so deep into this where-

00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:45,854
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of people listening are probably just gonna keep listening relatively close to the analyst. We just have a really boring part of this conversation.

00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  because they're just in it, they're immersed.

00:25:48,706 --> 00:25:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

00:25:49,986 --> 00:25:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  A big, like to really boil it down to a simple level, you just wanna get people where they're immersed in the content and then just kind of hold them there.

00:25:57,378 --> 00:26:00,062
SPEAKER_1:  We had this discussion offline and by the way, I should mention that.

00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,174
SPEAKER_1:  This is like late at night.

00:26:02,306 --> 00:26:05,827
SPEAKER_0:  It is. What time is it? It's 9 o'clock.

00:26:05,827 --> 00:26:08,734
SPEAKER_1:  I only slept one hour last night because I'm an idiot.

00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,901
SPEAKER_1:  and I flew to the wrong location.

00:26:10,901 --> 00:26:12,350
SPEAKER_0:  Well, here, we're like, hey.

00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:20,638
SPEAKER_0:  let's just book you a hotel and a flight. He's like, no, I got it. We're like, you sure? We can just do it. We always do this. He's like, no, I got it, I got it. He's gonna have to rub it in. I know, and then.

00:26:20,866 --> 00:26:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  today come to find out he flew.

00:26:22,754 --> 00:26:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  to the wrong airport, airport with the, or city with a similar name to ours. Just- Same name, same name in a different state. And I was like, that's why you should have let us book it. And so he's on one hour of sleep and he's literally been dying all day. Before this podcast, he downed like two things of coffee. We've been going all day hard.

00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:44,222
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I've been get to interact with you. That's just say that this gave me an opportunity to I got a.

00:26:44,962 --> 00:26:48,382
SPEAKER_1:  a ride from a stranger and it was an incredible person.

00:26:49,346 --> 00:26:52,830
SPEAKER_1:  that got to interact with them. So there's so many kind people around here.

00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:55,294
SPEAKER_1:  Just like this kind of Southern energy.

00:26:55,778 --> 00:26:58,078
SPEAKER_1:  And then I got to go to a diner because I could.

00:26:59,074 --> 00:27:07,134
SPEAKER_1:  There's only one hour between me arriving and having to fly out. So I went to a diner, and there's a really kind waitress that called me honey.

00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:08,711
SPEAKER_1:  That was a beautiful moment, you know?

00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  I was so confused, you tweeted about that, and I...

00:27:11,682 --> 00:27:12,350
SPEAKER_0:  Steel's like.

00:27:12,642 --> 00:27:16,702
SPEAKER_0:  Lex, my assistant was like, Lex isn't here yet. And I saw your tweet and I was like...

00:27:16,994 --> 00:27:33,662
SPEAKER_0:  he's here, so he was like, no, he's still flying. I was like, an hour ago, he just tweeted about a nice diner. I didn't realize you flew to the right. It was a diner in a different state. And then you had to fly over here. And then I called you and you didn't answer. I was like, hmm. I was like, something's not adding up.

00:27:34,082 --> 00:27:35,966
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I feel like it's such an idiot because I'm...

00:27:36,226 --> 00:27:37,790
SPEAKER_1:  Apparently the world

00:27:38,146 --> 00:27:38,846
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:27:39,138 --> 00:27:40,958
SPEAKER_1:  has cities like Springfield, right?

00:27:41,698 --> 00:27:44,478
SPEAKER_1:  Like every single state has a Springfield. Oh really?

00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:46,183
SPEAKER_1:  I think so.

00:27:46,183 --> 00:27:47,683
SPEAKER_0:  That's like a Simpsons

00:27:47,683 --> 00:27:49,054
SPEAKER_1:  joke right that like it's

00:27:49,442 --> 00:27:57,598
SPEAKER_1:  the city and in some sense the Springfield and I think every single state or most of them have a Springfield. And the same is true for like a

00:27:58,082 --> 00:28:00,574
SPEAKER_1:  Georgetown, I think the most popular, I forget what the most.

00:28:01,698 --> 00:28:03,614
SPEAKER_1:  There's like a list of things people get.

00:28:03,746 --> 00:28:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  When they run out of ideas, they just keep using the same thing all over. They're your Achilles heel.

00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:11,230
SPEAKER_1:  Anyway, I got to meet a bunch of people from...

00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:15,806
SPEAKER_1:  from your team is just an incredible human being. So let me just ask on that topic.

00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:19,358
SPEAKER_1:  How do you hire a great team? What have you learned about hiring?

00:28:20,002 --> 00:28:20,894
SPEAKER_1:  for, uh...

00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,646
SPEAKER_1:  everything for the main channel that you do.

00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:27,678
SPEAKER_1:  for the the react again the the gaming channel

00:28:28,098 --> 00:28:30,174
SPEAKER_1:  to Mr. Beesburger to...

00:28:30,754 --> 00:28:31,838
SPEAKER_1:  uh... feasible so that

00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  The big thing is, especially in this content creation, because it's not like anything that's done on Netflix or-

00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  or different content mediums.

00:28:40,354 --> 00:28:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  I really need people who are coachable and like.

00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  really see the value in.

00:28:45,154 --> 00:28:48,702
SPEAKER_0:  I care about because it's a very specific way of going about things and it's a

00:28:48,962 --> 00:28:54,334
SPEAKER_0:  like a thing, there's no one like plug and play. Like if Netflix wanted to hire someone to do a documentary.

00:28:54,658 --> 00:28:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  there's probably tens of thousands of people you could hire that have worked on documentaries before.

00:28:58,658 --> 00:28:59,934
SPEAKER_0:  But if you want to hire someone to make.

00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  super viral YouTube videos, you know, like we do.

00:29:03,746 --> 00:29:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  There's just no one you can really pull from. Like sometimes I'll hire people from a-

00:29:08,034 --> 00:29:15,518
SPEAKER_0:  game shows, right? They have all these preconceived notions about pacing and how a video should be, and you have to spend like the first year like breaking all these habits and-

00:29:15,746 --> 00:29:20,926
SPEAKER_0:  and they think they're better than you. Like a lot of people in traditional think they're better than what we do.

00:29:21,186 --> 00:29:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

00:29:22,402 --> 00:29:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  For me, it's almost easier to hire people.

00:29:25,314 --> 00:29:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  that are just hard workers that are obsessed and

00:29:28,802 --> 00:29:30,878
SPEAKER_0:  really coachable and just train them how to like.

00:29:31,106 --> 00:29:34,462
SPEAKER_0:  be good at content creation and production than to hire someone from like

00:29:34,882 --> 00:29:41,662
SPEAKER_0:  traditional, which is the only way to really do it. Cause there's not that many YouTube channels that have scaled up. So it's not like there's a huge talent pool of people who've worked on YouTube channels.

00:29:41,954 --> 00:29:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  So

00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  It's easier just to train someone than just pull them from traditional because traditional people just thumb in the macau and date.

00:29:47,618 --> 00:29:51,998
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, they have all these opinions and things and they just think our way of going about things is dumb.

00:29:52,706 --> 00:29:53,470
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, so.

00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:57,041
SPEAKER_1:  You want people who have the humility to have a beginner's mind even if they have experience.

00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:58,622
SPEAKER_0:  I can see the value, like actually.

00:29:58,978 --> 00:30:11,838
SPEAKER_0:  You'll still get it. It's so crazy. Especially some of my other friends that are scaling up their YouTube channels. There's people that will come on and you'll ask them, like, what do you want to be doing in five years? And instead of saying, oh, I want to be working on this channel, they'll be like, oh, I hope to be working on movies or this or that. And they see like.

00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  working on a YouTube channel as a launchpad to go into traditional. And it's like, no, like you just don't get it. This is the future. This is the end goal. This is your career.

00:30:20,578 --> 00:30:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:25,246
SPEAKER_0:  And so I'm just so tired of having those kinds of conversations. I feel like.

00:30:25,474 --> 00:30:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  people really should be coming around.

00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  Are there like...

00:30:28,546 --> 00:30:30,334
SPEAKER_1:  recurring interview questions that you ask.

00:30:30,946 --> 00:30:32,350
SPEAKER_1:  Is there ways to get...

00:30:32,546 --> 00:30:45,205
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, but the biggest thing is like, what do you wanna be doing in 10 years? And if their answer isn't making content on YouTube, or if their answer is anything like movies or traditional, stuff like that, it's like just a hell no. Like it just won't even remotely work. I see you're

00:30:45,205 --> 00:30:46,705
SPEAKER_1:  I really want people to believe in the vision.

00:30:46,705 --> 00:30:50,238
SPEAKER_0:  of YouTube. Yeah, I mean, ideally, it's like, oh, working here, you know what I mean?

00:30:50,978 --> 00:30:54,558
SPEAKER_1:  So it's less about the medium and more about just being a great team that's doing epic stuff.

00:30:54,658 --> 00:30:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, well, and yeah, the media as well, because those

00:30:57,026 --> 00:30:57,406
SPEAKER_0:  It's just.

00:30:57,762 --> 00:30:58,558
SPEAKER_0:  It's hard to-

00:30:59,362 --> 00:31:00,510
SPEAKER_0:  put it into words, but...

00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  It's just two completely different ways of going about things. You know, like our videos aren't scripted and you know, it's a lot more run and gun and-

00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  when we, if we hypothetically blow up a giant car or whatever, like you only have one take, you know what I mean? So, and it's not scripted and so you have to over film, overshoot things, overcompensate for like the dumb way of going about it. And a lot of traditional people would be like, well, just plan what you're going to say and just plan the angles. You can cut the cameras in half, you can save 50 grand here, you can save, you know, $75,000 in editing, this and that. And it's like, yeah, but.

00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:39,774
SPEAKER_0:  That's not authentic. That's, you know, blah, blah. You get it. It's almost so obvious that it hurts to have to like constantly have these conversations, but.

00:31:40,322 --> 00:31:41,447
SPEAKER_0:  That's what we live in.

00:31:41,447 --> 00:31:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  There's also detail like there's a taste, like I've watched a bunch of videos with you.

00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,678
SPEAKER_1:  and it's clear to you that you've gotten really good.

00:31:48,546 --> 00:31:55,806
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know what the right word is, style or taste, to be able to know what's good and not in terms of retention, in terms of just stylistically, visually.

00:31:56,002 --> 00:31:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  I don't have to think, I can just watch a video and it just...

00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  screams in my head like this is what this is what should change based on the you know million videos i've watched and all these viral videos are consumed like this is bubble what's optimal

00:32:09,826 --> 00:32:10,878
SPEAKER_0:  Things like that. It's almost like.

00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:12,446
SPEAKER_0:  Your brain's like a...

00:32:13,218 --> 00:32:16,830
SPEAKER_0:  You know, like a neural net and like if you consume enough viral videos and enough.

00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  good content that you just kind of start to like train your brain to like see it and see these patterns that happen in all these viral videos and

00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  So that anytime I watch a video or a movie or anything, I just can't stop thinking about.

00:32:28,194 --> 00:32:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  what is optimal and so it's like.

00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  It gives me a headache sometimes when I watch something too slow or I don't think it's optimal. Obviously my taste isn't the end all of y'all.

00:32:35,906 --> 00:32:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:32:36,546 --> 00:32:39,230
SPEAKER_0:  but that's something that kind of torments me, if that makes any sense.

00:32:40,002 --> 00:32:54,878
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, you can't enjoy a slow-moving movie. And that's not to say there's no... The retention on Godfather is horrible. Yeah, no, exactly. I've tried to watch that movie like three times. But that's not to say slow movies are bad. Like there's an audience for it. It's just obviously not what I've trained my brain to like.

00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:58,686
SPEAKER_0:  and social media and YouTube right now, like this is not the meta.

00:32:58,818 --> 00:33:02,142
SPEAKER_1:  And in general, like you said, in neural network, you're training your brain.

00:33:03,202 --> 00:33:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  in part on actual data.

00:33:05,506 --> 00:33:09,790
SPEAKER_1:  Right, so you're actually data driven. So you're looking at like in terms of thumbnails and titles.

00:33:10,146 --> 00:33:10,462
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:33:10,754 --> 00:33:13,118
SPEAKER_1:  different aspects of the first 5-10 seconds.

00:33:13,442 --> 00:33:16,478
SPEAKER_1:  and then throughout the video the retention all that you're looking at all that

00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:22,366
SPEAKER_1:  uh, for your own videos to understand how to do it better. So that's where the neural network is training.

00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  Basically.

00:33:24,514 --> 00:33:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  There are ways you can kind of see like the most few videos on YouTube every day and stuff like that.

00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  I just kind of consume those every single day and I've been doing that for way too many years.

00:33:32,674 --> 00:33:34,430
SPEAKER_0:  And then you just start to notice patterns.

00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  The thumbnails on the most of your videos are videos that go super viral, tend to be clear, tend to not have much clutter, tend to be pretty simple. Titles tend to be less than 50 characters. Intros tend to be this. Stories tend to be this. You just kind of like, after you see those thousands and then tens of thousands of times.

00:33:49,634 --> 00:33:52,446
SPEAKER_0:  It just starts to click in your head like this is what it looks like. Yeah.

00:33:53,058 --> 00:33:54,206
SPEAKER_1:  So how are you able to?

00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:57,854
SPEAKER_1:  Transfer that taste that you've developed to the team.

00:33:58,274 --> 00:34:02,238
SPEAKER_1:  So for like, because you said like broad things, but I'm sure there's a million detailed things.

00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:05,155
SPEAKER_1:  Like what zoom to use on the face to use in the thumbnail, right?

00:34:05,155 --> 00:34:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  The answer is whatever makes the best video.

00:34:08,674 --> 00:34:09,790
SPEAKER_0:  Because the problem is the more...

00:34:10,562 --> 00:34:20,286
SPEAKER_0:  I have so many friends who are like this, they'll make like checklists for their editors. They'll make, you know, this beat and this beat and you need to have like a three-part arc and then this, but the problem is that's how you.

00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:25,278
SPEAKER_0:  the more constraints you put on the team, the more repetitive and-

00:34:25,506 --> 00:34:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  less innovation you get and the more like, you know, after 10 videos, people are going to be like, all right, I've already seen this. So

00:34:31,234 --> 00:34:36,094
SPEAKER_0:  To me, and I'm 24, and you know, probably my mindset will change over the next 10 years. I just haven't.

00:34:36,354 --> 00:34:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  been in this industry too long, but.

00:34:37,922 --> 00:34:44,318
SPEAKER_0:  The only way to really make innovative content and keep things fresh is to not put constraints on, or put as little as possible.

00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:48,158
SPEAKER_0:  And so that's why I'm very hesitant on all that stuff because the more-

00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  I say the more they're gonna be like, oh, then that's what we do. And then.

00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:59,102
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I'll say one time like, oh, you know, ideally there's a cut every three seconds. And then next thing you know, every video, there's a cut every three seconds or whatever. So

00:34:59,554 --> 00:35:01,822
SPEAKER_0:  It's hard because I try to...

00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:03,166
SPEAKER_0:  Give, uh...

00:35:03,394 --> 00:35:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  as little

00:35:05,346 --> 00:35:07,102
SPEAKER_0:  not training, but as a little...

00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:13,278
SPEAKER_0:  facts or as possible and more just make suggestions if that makes any sense. You mean publicly or to your team? on

00:35:14,242 --> 00:35:22,814
SPEAKER_1:  What was so you talked about sort of teaching your voice or your style, whatever we want to call it to other people on the team so they can be kind of.

00:35:23,074 --> 00:35:24,638
SPEAKER_1:  Mr. Beast replacement.

00:35:26,338 --> 00:35:28,606
SPEAKER_1:  So what's the process of teaching this? feito d transformer

00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:35,710
SPEAKER_0:  No, I got you. You're more talking about like what I would call almost like cloning, right? Like Tyler and other people like that. Yeah. So.

00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:38,078
SPEAKER_0:  When we were hanging out today I was showing him how

00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:47,079
SPEAKER_0:  We have multiple people and they come, it's almost like talking to the camera, it's a habit. Yeah, you turn slowly to the camera. I was like, it was a habit. Is it weird to you?

00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:48,158
SPEAKER_1:  not be looking at the camera.

00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  This whole

00:35:49,218 --> 00:35:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  Interview I

00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:56,583
SPEAKER_0:  constantly I've been turning towards the camera, I'm talking to him, it's a habit. My whole life I've just been talking to a camera.

00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:58,270
SPEAKER_1:  What were you thinking about when you were looking at the camera?

00:35:58,562 --> 00:35:59,687
SPEAKER_1:  Do you like imagine?

00:35:59,687 --> 00:36:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  I'm fully thinking about the person just sitting watching it and I almost

00:36:04,642 --> 00:36:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  It's weird when I'm looking at the camera, I don't see a camera.

00:36:08,098 --> 00:36:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  in a taze, picturing what the viewer is seeing when they watch it, if that makes sense.

00:36:12,354 --> 00:36:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  And that's where...

00:36:13,378 --> 00:36:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  I'll be saying things or doing something and then like when I'm watching, I'm like, that's not what I want. And then I'll freeze up. It's very weird when I'm filming. I'm melted.

00:36:21,634 --> 00:36:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  For people who haven't worked with me too much, don't think like.

00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, it's very weird, like how I go about it. Cause I'll just be doing whatever, like lighting a firework. All right, this is a thousand dollar firework go to lighting a ve-

00:36:32,738 --> 00:36:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  and I'll like freeze, because in my head I'm like, this, I don't know, I don't like how that floated or how that shot looked, because it's weird. I can perfectly picture.

00:36:39,618 --> 00:36:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  what I'm filming by just looking at the camera and then putting myself through the lens of the camera while irgendwann.

00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:47,459
SPEAKER_0:  making content. I can do it at the same time.

00:36:47,459 --> 00:36:49,118
SPEAKER_1:  So you're like real time editing.

00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:51,134
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, that's something that...

00:36:51,426 --> 00:36:56,126
SPEAKER_0:  Didn't at the start come natural to me, but in the last probably like five years it's happened.

00:36:56,482 --> 00:36:59,550
SPEAKER_0:  And so I would say it's one of my greatest strengths, I don't know how I developed it.

00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  But anytime I'm filming anything, like, it's almost like...

00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:07,262
SPEAKER_0:  like right side of my brain, I just can just look at it and I see exactly what I'm filming and I can just picture it.

00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,222
SPEAKER_1:  Well, that's probably.

00:37:08,706 --> 00:37:10,014
SPEAKER_1:  recording the video.

00:37:10,338 --> 00:37:12,350
SPEAKER_1:  Being the talent for the video and then watching the editing.

00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,773
SPEAKER_1:  and like analyzing it carefully and do that over and over.

00:37:14,773 --> 00:37:17,773
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, you do that 10,000 times. Yeah, you do the editing.

00:37:17,773 --> 00:37:19,966
SPEAKER_1:  editing more than being in front of the camera.

00:37:20,514 --> 00:37:20,990
SPEAKER_1:  So like.

00:37:21,538 --> 00:37:21,918
SPEAKER_1:  is

00:37:22,882 --> 00:37:25,118
SPEAKER_1:  you start to see yourself from that third person perspective.

00:37:25,346 --> 00:37:27,902
SPEAKER_1:  Exactly. That actually helps with the nerves of it too.

00:37:28,258 --> 00:37:28,574
SPEAKER_1:  Like.

00:37:28,962 --> 00:37:31,614
SPEAKER_1:  you see it as creating a video versus performing.

00:37:32,258 --> 00:37:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, yeah, I think so.

00:37:35,138 --> 00:37:36,094
SPEAKER_0:  It's weird, I've never...

00:37:36,738 --> 00:37:44,254
SPEAKER_0:  been nervous talking to a camera. It's harder for me to talk to a person than to talk to a camera, which I feel like a lot of people say that though that are.

00:37:44,482 --> 00:37:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  whatever, make content, right? Interesting. I've heard that so many times.

00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:51,459
SPEAKER_0:  Or maybe not, maybe I'm just awkward and dumb. Maybe they're practiced, I-

00:37:51,459 --> 00:37:52,190
SPEAKER_1:  to me it's

00:37:52,674 --> 00:37:55,518
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, both are terrifying, but being in front of the camera by yourself.

00:37:56,002 --> 00:37:57,054
SPEAKER_1:  is much easier.

00:37:57,314 --> 00:37:59,870
SPEAKER_0:  Really? Yeah, so much. I prefer it a million times over.

00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  But that's my whole life. You know, so it's just, that's why it's interesting. Like you've spent more of your time talking to people. It comes natural, you know that, but it's really interesting.

00:38:08,226 --> 00:38:08,894
SPEAKER_0:  I talked to her.

00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,015
SPEAKER_0:  piece of plastic. Are you huggin' me?

00:38:11,015 --> 00:38:14,765
SPEAKER_1:  I guess you're talking to a person too. They're just on the other side of the camera. Yeah, they're just a pixel.

00:38:14,765 --> 00:38:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  on a screen.

00:38:16,034 --> 00:38:17,909
SPEAKER_1:  So cloning, how do you...

00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:20,254
SPEAKER_0:  Oh yeah, that's right. That's the whole rabbit trail. So.

00:38:20,514 --> 00:38:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  I was showing him that I have a lot of people in the company who are able to think like me and

00:38:24,706 --> 00:38:26,430
SPEAKER_0:  uh, basically make decisions.

00:38:27,522 --> 00:38:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  I would make if I was like, if you were asked, hey, in this video, should we climb a mountain or should we dig a hole? Right. And like, you know, they would pick the same answer I'd pick 90 plus percent of the times. And so one example is Tyler who I was showing you.

00:38:41,474 --> 00:38:45,182
SPEAKER_0:  He was pitching stuff for content. And you can see, like this, he was on point.

00:38:45,538 --> 00:38:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  And uh...

00:38:46,402 --> 00:38:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  Basically for just.

00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  Four or five years, we just spent an absurd amount of time together.

00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:54,302
SPEAKER_0:  and worked on every single video together and we worked side by side.

00:38:54,562 --> 00:38:58,878
SPEAKER_0:  And same thing with my CEO, James. He literally lived with me for a couple years.

00:38:59,202 --> 00:39:03,102
SPEAKER_0:  I'm a big fan of just finding people who are super obsessed and-

00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:04,894
SPEAKER_0:  All in and A players that

00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  You know, they really just want to be great. And they're just dumping everything I have in them.

00:39:09,826 --> 00:39:12,702
SPEAKER_1:  And like you were saying, because I'd love to find that.

00:39:12,994 --> 00:39:13,790
SPEAKER_1:  and develop that.

00:39:14,114 --> 00:39:15,614
SPEAKER_1:  You're saying you're basically for.

00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,398
SPEAKER_1:  a long time just said everything you were thinking to them.

00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  Exactly. Like James, the guy who's basically my right hand man right now.

00:39:22,786 --> 00:39:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  Two years he lived with me and we probably talked on average over those two years, seven hours a day.

00:39:28,354 --> 00:39:37,470
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, anytime I had a phone call, I'd throw it on speaker and I'd let him listen. Anything I was reading, any content I was consuming, like really just training his brain to think like me. So that way...

00:39:37,698 --> 00:39:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  um... he could just...

00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  do things without my input, without me having to constantly watch over him or give him advice. And that's where we've gotten. Like, so for the first six months he didn't do anything. He just studied me and studied everything I cared about and how I spoke and.

00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  blah, blah, and then the next six months, he started taking on some responsibilities and now he can just run the company and you know.

00:39:56,162 --> 00:40:00,734
SPEAKER_0:  I don't ever really have to check it on him. Most of the decisions he makes are exactly what I would do.

00:40:01,122 --> 00:40:02,046
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and so.

00:40:03,106 --> 00:40:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  I call that cloning, I don't know what other people would, but it's just like finding people that are really obsessed and they just kind of really want it and just being like giving them an avenue to like... you

00:40:12,194 --> 00:40:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  Get it, if that makes any sense.

00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:18,654
SPEAKER_1:  Another way to see it is you're converging towards a common vision, and that makes like brainstorming.

00:40:19,618 --> 00:40:20,702
SPEAKER_1:  much more productive.

00:40:20,802 --> 00:40:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it just makes it where I don't have to be so involved in everything because I just have these people I know will

00:40:26,498 --> 00:40:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  think like I will, at least relatively.

00:40:28,834 --> 00:40:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  close to it. So I can kind of almost be in multiple places at once per se. And so these things that...

00:40:34,402 --> 00:40:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

00:40:35,202 --> 00:40:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  I still approve every idea we film in, you know, everything before we film in all the creative, I approve it, but I don't have to like be in the weeds and nuances and do all this minor stuff.

00:40:45,058 --> 00:40:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  I can just let them handle it. I can just do the more macro things.

00:40:47,554 --> 00:40:48,606
SPEAKER_1:  i got a chance to sit in

00:40:49,506 --> 00:40:52,894
SPEAKER_1:  to a lengthy brainstorming session with Tyler and others.

00:40:53,346 --> 00:40:54,238
SPEAKER_1:  That was really cool.

00:40:55,106 --> 00:40:57,886
SPEAKER_1:  Can you talk about the process of that?

00:40:58,466 --> 00:40:59,038
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,342
SPEAKER_1:  people pitching ideas.

00:41:01,954 --> 00:41:02,526
SPEAKER_1:  and you.

00:41:03,106 --> 00:41:07,495
SPEAKER_1:  pitching alternatives or shutting down ideas just going plowing through ideas very quickly

00:41:07,495 --> 00:41:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, you kind of just lit.

00:41:09,442 --> 00:41:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  described exactly what we did. Yea.

00:41:11,522 --> 00:41:12,670
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, but the ideas are really...

00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,686
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, really good. She's tossing out.

00:41:16,002 --> 00:41:18,334
SPEAKER_1:  like different categories of ideas.

00:41:18,658 --> 00:41:20,734
SPEAKER_1:  and then also fine tuning them to see like.

00:41:21,154 --> 00:41:23,029
SPEAKER_1:  How do I change, like thinking about the titles and...

00:41:23,029 --> 00:41:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  I work so well off of inspiration.

00:41:25,346 --> 00:41:27,358
SPEAKER_0:  It's like, that's a something.

00:41:28,962 --> 00:41:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  Like give me any word, I don't know.

00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  And Vince

00:41:32,226 --> 00:41:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, like I went to space, you know, what happens if you blow up a nuke in space or I went to the moon, I went to Mars, right?

00:41:37,986 --> 00:41:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  Because you said that one word, it was able to inspire me to come up with four ideas. So.

00:41:42,914 --> 00:41:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  That's just, it's for me.

00:41:45,474 --> 00:41:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  If you, the way to get a hundred million views on videos, you need something original, creative, something people really need to see, ideally never been done before, all these like things.

00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  And so you need like.

00:41:55,202 --> 00:42:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  If you want to consistently go super viral, you need just a constant stream of ideas. And the only way I've really found that I can consistently come up with a hundred million view videos is to intake inspiration and then see what my brain outputs.

00:42:06,626 --> 00:42:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  That's kinda at its core foundation, what I'm doing there. It's just like, intaking a lot of random inspiration to see what spawns in my mind so I can...

00:42:15,618 --> 00:42:18,110
SPEAKER_1:  output it. The network of your brain is generating.

00:42:19,586 --> 00:42:22,211
SPEAKER_1:  The video, the title, the thumbnail, all that.

00:42:22,211 --> 00:42:24,862
SPEAKER_0:  jointly exactly and that only comes because

00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  I spent 10 years of my life just obsessively studying all that stuff.

00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:29,566
SPEAKER_1:  I mean...

00:42:29,826 --> 00:42:31,454
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like you would literally.

00:42:32,034 --> 00:42:34,718
SPEAKER_1:  potentially shut down a video just because you can't come up with a good title.

00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:39,678
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, 100% or a thumbnail. Yeah, I mean, that's what happened to 70% of those in that pitch session. It's like.

00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, what was one of them? Genius vs. 100 people or...

00:42:42,914 --> 00:42:45,539
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, like maybe average intelligence versus genius.

00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I was like, what the heck is the thumbnail even if the title was good? Yeah. Yeah, I mean this

00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:52,478
SPEAKER_0:  So many, but yeah, people don't click, they don't watch.

00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:56,734
SPEAKER_1:  That's so interesting, but you developed over time the ability to kind of.

00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,294
SPEAKER_1:  Give it what what makes for a good title?

00:42:59,618 --> 00:42:59,998
SPEAKER_1:  short.

00:43:00,226 --> 00:43:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  Not just sure, it's also-

00:43:02,562 --> 00:43:03,006
SPEAKER_0:  I mean...

00:43:04,514 --> 00:43:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  If someone reads it, are they like, do they have to watch it? Is it just so intrinsically interesting that it's just gonna

00:43:11,138 --> 00:43:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  Fuck with them if they don't click on it. You know what I mean?

00:43:13,602 --> 00:43:16,254
SPEAKER_1:  So it doesn't have to be short, but it has to be.

00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:19,582
SPEAKER_1:  Like you almost want to have a retention.

00:43:20,034 --> 00:43:21,159
SPEAKER_1:  to word by word read.

00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  Ideally, it's a title also that...

00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:30,462
SPEAKER_0:  you know, because the titles don't live in a vacuum, right? So it has to lead into the content. So ideally the title represents.

00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:35,870
SPEAKER_0:  content that you would want to watch for 20 minutes. So if it's a 20 minute video and the title is I stepped on a bug.

00:43:36,354 --> 00:43:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  It's not gonna, because it's all of it combined. The click through rate is gonna be much lower.

00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  And then if it was like a five second video, people might click it. So you gotta, like even nuances of the length of the video based against the title will affect whether people wanna click it because sometimes they just don't add up.

00:43:50,146 --> 00:43:50,814
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's that.

00:43:51,042 --> 00:43:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, ideally you want it below 50 characters because above 50 characters on certain devices, you run the chance of it going dot, dot, dot.

00:43:57,154 --> 00:43:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  So like.

00:43:57,794 --> 00:44:00,638
SPEAKER_0:  I took a light pole and I saw how many...

00:44:00,898 --> 00:44:02,334
SPEAKER_0:  dollar bills I could stack on top.

00:44:02,594 --> 00:44:09,310
SPEAKER_0:  and they would just go dot dot dot because it's too long and it can't finish it. And that's the worst thing because then people don't even know what they're clicking on. And so it's going to do even worse.

00:44:09,634 --> 00:44:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:44:10,338 --> 00:44:10,718
SPEAKER_0:  Short.

00:44:10,946 --> 00:44:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  Simple, ideally, and just so freaking interesting to have to click.

00:44:14,466 --> 00:44:17,841
SPEAKER_0:  And it is a good segue into the content and it represents the length of the cut.

00:44:17,841 --> 00:44:20,030
SPEAKER_1:  And there's probably stuff it's hard to convert

00:44:20,418 --> 00:44:21,918
SPEAKER_1:  convert into words for you like.

00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:23,998
SPEAKER_1:  I stepped on a bug versus.

00:44:24,258 --> 00:44:26,883
SPEAKER_1:  stepping on a bug versus Mr. Beast stepped on a bug.

00:44:26,883 --> 00:44:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, well, I mean that...

00:44:28,482 --> 00:44:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  It's funny you bring that up, so it's like...

00:44:30,786 --> 00:44:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, the more extreme the opinion, typically the higher the click-through rate. If you can, like.

00:44:35,202 --> 00:44:35,710
SPEAKER_0:  Ah.

00:44:36,482 --> 00:44:39,857
SPEAKER_0:  pay it off in the content, then it just supercharges it. So like,

00:44:39,857 --> 00:44:41,357
SPEAKER_1:  So you have a kind of estimate of the.

00:44:41,357 --> 00:44:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  extremely sad this this water right you're like

00:44:45,218 --> 00:44:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  CG water sucks.

00:44:46,626 --> 00:44:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, that'd do fine.

00:44:47,842 --> 00:44:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  But if you said Fiji water.

00:44:49,282 --> 00:44:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  It's the worst water bottle.

00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  or the worst water I've ever drank in my life. Yeah.

00:44:53,538 --> 00:44:55,966
SPEAKER_0:  way more extreme opinion would do way better. you have to deliver.

00:44:56,258 --> 00:44:59,774
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, but then you have to deliver, because the more extreme you are, the more extreme you have to be in the video.

00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:02,750
SPEAKER_1:  That's almost inspiration for you to step up.

00:45:03,234 --> 00:45:07,902
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, you can be more extreme in a positive way. It's easier though.

00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:09,246
SPEAKER_0:  Pause it.

00:45:09,986 --> 00:45:10,430
SPEAKER_0:  Duh.

00:45:10,978 --> 00:45:16,350
SPEAKER_0:  Negative clickbait is much easier than positive clickbait. It just is. It's so much easier to get negative clicks.

00:45:16,578 --> 00:45:18,110
SPEAKER_0:  And so a lot of people are just.

00:45:18,402 --> 00:45:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  In my opinion, you know, a little bit lazier and...

00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:25,182
SPEAKER_0:  They just take the route like, oh, well, this one gets the same amount of clicks and it's easier, less effort.

00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:26,878
SPEAKER_0:  The positive one is.

00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:29,566
SPEAKER_1:  doing a large number of numbers of something.

00:45:29,922 --> 00:45:31,797
SPEAKER_1:  Like I spent this number of hours doing

00:45:31,797 --> 00:45:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  But whatever, if you just wanted to help people or... Alright, it's just harder to...

00:45:35,842 --> 00:45:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  get 10 million views on a video helping people than it is to get 10 million views on a video tearing down a celebrity, you know what I mean? or whatever negative video you want to insert there.

00:45:43,554 --> 00:45:45,918
SPEAKER_1:  Well, that said, most of your videos are pretty positive.

00:45:46,178 --> 00:45:50,238
SPEAKER_0:  So what's... But not a lot of people do those kinds of videos because they're hard. Yeah, they're hard.

00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:53,182
SPEAKER_1:  Some of that is giving away money, right?

00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:55,582
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. What's the secret to that?

00:45:55,938 --> 00:45:57,886
SPEAKER_1:  What's, how do you do that right?

00:45:58,146 --> 00:45:59,783
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, like give away.

00:45:59,783 --> 00:46:02,334
SPEAKER_1:  money or? In a video that made it to make it compelling.

00:46:03,202 --> 00:46:05,534
SPEAKER_1:  Um, is it? So there's a number that

00:46:05,794 --> 00:46:06,919
SPEAKER_1:  is better than another number.

00:46:06,919 --> 00:46:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  for it, right? The higher number is always better than the lower number. Yeah, for the most part. You know, it's interesting like.

00:46:12,898 --> 00:46:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  Some videos will give away a million dollars. Some videos will give away half a million. There's not really-

00:46:16,674 --> 00:46:25,598
SPEAKER_0:  I guess so. I'm retracting what I just said. I was more joking with that, but there's no difference whether I put 500K or a million. There's probably not even really a difference between 100K or a million. I haven't really looked into it.

00:46:26,338 --> 00:46:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  Some of our, most of your videos are not us giving away a million dollars and sometimes the million dollar videos just don't do as well as the other ones. So.

00:46:32,098 --> 00:46:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  There is a certain point where

00:46:34,146 --> 00:46:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  A dollar amount is just a large dollar amount to an average human. And so I think that point is 100K. Like anything above 100K.

00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  The average human is just like, that's a lot of money. It doesn't, a hundred K and a million like...

00:46:46,114 --> 00:46:48,254
SPEAKER_0:  Doesn't really move the needle, if that makes sense.

00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  Which that's a very nuanced piece of information that applies to very few people but...

00:46:53,506 --> 00:46:54,631
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. I don't know.

00:46:54,631 --> 00:46:59,550
SPEAKER_1:  It's fascinating. It's fascinating. Our relationship with money is fascinating.

00:46:59,778 --> 00:47:00,862
SPEAKER_1:  Why is it so exciting?

00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:01,470
SPEAKER_1:  to get.

00:47:02,434 --> 00:47:06,334
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, the times I found like 20 bucks in the ground.

00:47:06,978 --> 00:47:07,550
SPEAKER_1:  I like.

00:47:07,874 --> 00:47:08,542
SPEAKER_1:  Incredible.

00:47:08,802 --> 00:47:09,927
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know why.

00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,427
SPEAKER_0:  Why are you so happy?

00:47:11,427 --> 00:47:17,278
SPEAKER_1:  I'm happy. Like what exactly, so joyful about that. I mean, it depends where you are in life, what the situation is.

00:47:18,178 --> 00:47:21,342
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know, there's also a gamified aspect to it. It's exciting.

00:47:21,602 --> 00:47:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I get it. Like why people want to see people win money. It's just interesting that past 100 grand, it's it doesn't really seem to make a difference. Like it's the same basically.

00:47:30,882 --> 00:47:33,507
SPEAKER_1:  So you found that to be true with all the money you've given away that-

00:47:33,507 --> 00:47:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  click through it. Like, obviously, in terms of someone receiving it, yeah, a million dollars changes their life drastically more.

00:47:39,746 --> 00:47:42,654
SPEAKER_0:  Like that's the difference, like, oh, if you wanted to, you could really quit your job.

00:47:42,946 --> 00:47:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  I suppose 100K is like, not really.

00:47:45,378 --> 00:47:47,518
SPEAKER_1:  You probably do like a scientific study.

00:47:47,778 --> 00:47:48,702
SPEAKER_1:  Like a formula.

00:47:49,378 --> 00:47:50,942
SPEAKER_1:  giving away money to click through rate.

00:47:51,586 --> 00:47:59,038
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, there could be some kind of a return. It definitely the returns level off dramatically after 100K. That's basically the premise. What about 10000?

00:47:59,618 --> 00:48:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, no, there's 10, 100,000.

00:48:02,274 --> 00:48:04,254
SPEAKER_0:  It's funny because it's such a...

00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:10,878
SPEAKER_0:  small niche thing but yeah, 100,000 does it from what I see in our videos get more clicks than 10,000.

00:48:11,106 --> 00:48:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  But the difference between 100,000 and a million is just so little. I think big number, big number to a lot of people past that point.

00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:19,358
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so for 100,000 you can...

00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:26,407
SPEAKER_1:  Like a given average salary, you can probably live for a year, given, given what the average salary is in America. So that's like a big, that feels.

00:48:26,407 --> 00:48:30,462
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I think it's also just more when they read the title. It's just like it's a lot of zeros.

00:48:30,722 --> 00:48:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  Focloads, zeros, okay, click.

00:48:34,818 --> 00:48:37,918
SPEAKER_1:  Oh man, that's fascinating. So on the thumbnail side, again, that's...

00:48:38,146 --> 00:48:39,838
SPEAKER_1:  gonna be much harder to say probably.

00:48:40,642 --> 00:48:41,374
SPEAKER_1:  Um, but-

00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:44,894
SPEAKER_1:  offline, I got a chance to look at a bunch of thumbnails.

00:48:45,346 --> 00:48:47,454
SPEAKER_1:  And it's fascinating which ones do well and which ones don't.

00:48:48,162 --> 00:48:52,981
SPEAKER_1:  Is there something you could say about what are the elements of the thumbnail that work well? Is this also...

00:48:52,981 --> 00:49:02,014
SPEAKER_0:  deeply in sync with something. Well, that's where, yeah, it's the same thing, like how do you cook good food? But it's easier if you pull up a thumbnail and I can be like, that's why that's good, that's why that's bad. The

00:49:02,242 --> 00:49:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  Like an example would be like...

00:49:03,554 --> 00:49:06,398
SPEAKER_0:  One of my friends, he just uploaded a video recently.

00:49:06,658 --> 00:49:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  I called him and I was like, what is this? Because he's a very, very smart guy.

00:49:09,954 --> 00:49:10,750
SPEAKER_0:  And in the thumbnail...

00:49:11,042 --> 00:49:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  He's getting chased by cops, but...

00:49:13,538 --> 00:49:16,574
SPEAKER_0:  The cops were wearing yellow vests, so they didn't look at cops. I was like...

00:49:16,962 --> 00:49:17,310
SPEAKER_0:  Oh.

00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:21,406
SPEAKER_0:  Why are the cops in your thumbnail wearing yellow vests? Because that makes it so much more...

00:49:21,666 --> 00:49:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  Boring.

00:49:22,306 --> 00:49:22,942
SPEAKER_0:  And he was like...

00:49:23,234 --> 00:49:32,190
SPEAKER_0:  carrying a flag, but the pole and the color of the flag were the same color, so it's like, it's a little harder to see the flag. I was like, also you're wearing like a shirt with like five different colors, so it's like.

00:49:32,418 --> 00:49:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  It's hard to tell.

00:49:34,146 --> 00:49:39,646
SPEAKER_0:  what even what your outline is and then in the background there are cars and I was like well if you have cops chasing you why not

00:49:39,938 --> 00:49:41,150
SPEAKER_0:  Make the cars, cop cars.

00:49:41,538 --> 00:49:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:49:42,114 --> 00:49:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  You know, and.

00:49:43,042 --> 00:49:46,654
SPEAKER_0:  It's like, cause in my head, I'm like, dang, if you just did those like four or five things, Deré would have to be a completeeffect so he could watch the whole video like, so you

00:49:46,946 --> 00:49:48,734
SPEAKER_0:  Probably would have got like seven X of views.

00:49:49,314 --> 00:49:49,790
SPEAKER_1:  How much?

00:49:50,146 --> 00:49:53,982
SPEAKER_1:  I also got a chance to see the number of iterations you do on a

00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, just the brain. It's a problem now.

00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  It's an addiction.

00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:00,126
SPEAKER_1:  Is it so you can kind of

00:50:00,962 --> 00:50:02,782
SPEAKER_1:  Because a lot of the versions were really good.

00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:08,862
SPEAKER_0:  How do you know when to like stop? I love how you, when we pulled up that, the burger one and we were flipping through them, you're like, that's really good. It's like, oh, that's.

00:50:09,154 --> 00:50:11,779
SPEAKER_0:  version like one of like a thousand.

00:50:11,779 --> 00:50:16,414
SPEAKER_1:  But even the sketch, the idea was good. Like already even the original idea is strong.

00:50:16,674 --> 00:50:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, so one of our coming up videos, we made the world's largest plant-based burger.

00:50:20,034 --> 00:50:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  And the thumbnail we were thinking is like me standing beside the bird because it's six feet tall.

00:50:23,586 --> 00:50:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  That's what he's talking about.

00:50:25,026 --> 00:50:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  So like just picture a giant six foot tall burger, super wide.

00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  thousands of pounds and then I'm beside it.

00:50:30,018 --> 00:50:32,030
SPEAKER_0:  and then it's like eating the World's Largest Burger.

00:50:32,258 --> 00:50:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  Like you, that's just something you have to click. Like, so you were saying like, how would you describe a good thumbnail? Like that, you know what I mean? Like

00:50:38,722 --> 00:50:44,382
SPEAKER_1:  But I think you said the one I noticed first that was good, where you were very small in it.

00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:45,895
SPEAKER_1:  relative to the, and you do.

00:50:45,895 --> 00:50:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't like that one, I think. I needed to come forward a little bit. And also, the photo we took was just my upper body. So they photo-manipulated and created my legs.

00:50:54,466 --> 00:51:02,341
SPEAKER_0:  Photoshop and that's why I said I didn't like it because my right leg was a little like off. It was like bent the wrong way. You notice I was like this. Because they had to build those legs in Photoshop. Help me to make a cool bluetooth durable bike.

00:51:02,341 --> 00:51:02,846
SPEAKER_1:  Love you.

00:51:03,106 --> 00:51:07,981
SPEAKER_1:  Does the physics on the thumbnail have to even make sense? I mean, you can just like exaggerate the head size and all that.

00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, 100%. Yeah, things don't have to be relative.

00:51:10,754 --> 00:51:11,102
SPEAKER_0:  You can.

00:51:11,362 --> 00:51:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  You have a car in the background, it'll be three times the size.

00:51:14,434 --> 00:51:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, every one of my thumbnails, my face is in the...

00:51:16,994 --> 00:51:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  You know, left side, very big.

00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  So brand recognition, so just people know.

00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, especially because now that a lot of people copy our videos, it's just nice to like...

00:51:25,378 --> 00:51:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  You know, everyone else might make thumbnails like this, but this is mine.

00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  And obviously we usually over deliver and do bigger stuff.

00:51:32,034 --> 00:51:35,326
SPEAKER_1:  Would you recommend to other creators that want to make it big to...

00:51:35,906 --> 00:51:37,694
SPEAKER_1:  and they see Mr. Beast and they look up to you.

00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:41,342
SPEAKER_1:  to copy some elements of you or to really try to be unique.

00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:42,302
SPEAKER_1:  Unique.

00:51:42,402 --> 00:51:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  100% unique. You're not.

00:51:43,778 --> 00:51:54,302
SPEAKER_0:  The next Mr. Beast, quote unquote, it feels weird saying that in third person, but whatever, is not gonna do what I'm doing better. They're gonna just invent their own way. Like you're just not gonna do what I do better than me.

00:51:54,626 --> 00:52:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I have so many, I literally have the best people in the world working here and I reinvest everything I make even to this day. You know what I mean? Like it's absurd the amount of money I spend on content. And I don't care, I'll just stop sleeping and I'll just film every other day. Like you're just not gonna beat me at my own game and that's fine, you shouldn't. Like.

00:52:10,722 --> 00:52:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't get where I am by just beating someone else at their own game. I just found my own lane and innovated and adapted. And so...

00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, there's a lot of people that do copy me and it's fine. Whatever do it, but just know you're not going to get to where I am doing that. Um, and so I'd advise you don't.

00:52:25,826 --> 00:52:31,171
SPEAKER_1:  You give away a lot of the secrets, basically everything about how you operate. Is there a-

00:52:31,171 --> 00:52:34,375
SPEAKER_0:  I don't hold anything back. Go for it. How do you think about that?

00:52:34,375 --> 00:52:35,582
SPEAKER_1:  that's also that's pretty rare.

00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  I think...

00:52:36,546 --> 00:52:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  And this is definitely not a...

00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  Most people in my stance, I don't think would take this stance, but

00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  I see every other YouTuber or person on social media, is where I also focus super heavily on YouTube.

00:52:49,826 --> 00:52:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  But last year we were also the most followed TikTok creator in the world as well. Actually we were most subscribed to YouTube channel in the world and the most followed TikTok account in the world.

00:52:56,066 --> 00:52:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:57,182
SPEAKER_0:  But uh...

00:52:57,442 --> 00:53:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  In general, I just see everyone else as collaborators, not competitors. I don't-

00:53:03,042 --> 00:53:08,286
SPEAKER_0:  Think giving advice and helping other creators do well in any way harms me and I think it only brings more value to my life.

00:53:08,706 --> 00:53:09,598
SPEAKER_1:  How is it?

00:53:09,954 --> 00:53:18,445
SPEAKER_1:  jumping on TikTok and trying to understand that platform from scratch. Yeah. So from being a successful YouTuber to understand a totally different algorithm, fundamentally different algorithm.

00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:22,398
SPEAKER_0:  It's interesting. Well, not even just the algorithm, just the content. Like I'm going from.

00:53:22,754 --> 00:53:25,086
SPEAKER_0:  Basically 15 minutes short films.

00:53:25,474 --> 00:53:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  One.

00:53:26,146 --> 00:53:29,182
SPEAKER_0:  sub one minute vertical content. It's a whole different.

00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:30,334
SPEAKER_0:  Just ballpark.

00:53:30,754 --> 00:53:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and so.

00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  The first little while I was doing TikTok, it was just kind of figuring out.

00:53:36,098 --> 00:53:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  What does Mr. Beast look like in this short form content? But recently we've really started to catch our stride and come up with some original concepts and figure out.

00:53:44,162 --> 00:53:46,174
SPEAKER_0:  how to innovate over there, just like we did on YouTube. because

00:53:46,434 --> 00:53:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't want it to just be shitty YouTube videos, you know? So, like an example is um...

00:53:53,218 --> 00:53:59,038
SPEAKER_0:  We played the rock for 100K and rock paper scissors and the loser had to donate 100K to charity. We did um...

00:53:59,362 --> 00:54:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  We went to random people on a campus and we offered them.

00:54:02,818 --> 00:54:08,862
SPEAKER_0:  So I said, I'll give you a hundred dollars if you fly to Paris and give me a baguette. And then they said, no. And I was like, I'll give you $300.

00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:13,854
SPEAKER_0:  If a lot of parents give me a picket, I was expecting this person to say no, and it'd go up to like 10 grand. And he's like, yes.

00:54:14,242 --> 00:54:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  And so he flew to Paris.

00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  got a baguette and brought it back and gave it to me.

00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:27,454
SPEAKER_0:  And that across everything got like 450 million views. Cause it's just really cool just to see this random guy get on a plane, spend a day in Paris, and we cut it up real nicely and bring it back.

00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:31,102
SPEAKER_0:  And so we're starting to find just tons of original content over there.

00:54:31,266 --> 00:54:33,141
SPEAKER_1:  but it seems like an epic video to make for a-

00:54:33,141 --> 00:54:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  a minute. No one on short form is doing it. That's the thing. It's like...

00:54:37,218 --> 00:54:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  It's just so funny because like TikTok has been big for a while now, years.

00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:42,174
SPEAKER_0:  And then, um...

00:54:42,626 --> 00:54:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  You know, as we started to really figure out things on the YouTube channel and get it cranking where I have some free time.

00:54:48,162 --> 00:54:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  We set our sights on TikTok and like, okay.

00:54:51,586 --> 00:54:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  What are people not doing? How do we make it better, put in more effort, make it good?

00:54:55,938 --> 00:55:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  And we did the same thing we did at YouTube, just different over on TikTok and it worked. And now we're the fastest growing or most followed TikTok account in 2022.

00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:04,894
SPEAKER_0:  And it's just funny that...

00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  No one else did that.

00:55:06,498 --> 00:55:07,623
SPEAKER_0:  And you're not afraid to do epi-

00:55:07,623 --> 00:55:10,270
SPEAKER_1:  stuff, which also during the brainstorming.

00:55:10,914 --> 00:55:13,022
SPEAKER_1:  some of the ideas you like, that's better as a short.

00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:14,750
SPEAKER_1:  That's crazy.

00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:18,225
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, can you remember one? Cause I remember I said that a bunch, but I can't think of one. Previously.

00:55:18,225 --> 00:55:19,006
SPEAKER_1:  Remember

00:55:19,266 --> 00:55:20,254
SPEAKER_1:  is that they were like

00:55:20,578 --> 00:55:21,950
SPEAKER_1:  Epic Videos.

00:55:22,882 --> 00:55:26,110
SPEAKER_1:  Like really, you're going to do that for a one minute video?

00:55:26,338 --> 00:55:30,590
SPEAKER_1:  That's crazy. So like, are you posting similar content to a YouTube short as a TikTok?

00:55:30,818 --> 00:55:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, those we just double up. It's just hard. You know, what's actually pretty fascinating and people who do social media listening to this will probably find this pretty interesting is.

00:55:38,914 --> 00:55:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  Picture like the Consecration meta three years ago versus now where you can make sub one minute vertical content and it go viral on TikTok.

00:55:46,946 --> 00:55:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  and go viral on YouTube shorts.

00:55:48,322 --> 00:55:51,518
SPEAKER_0:  go viral on Instagram Reels, it goes viral on Facebook, it goes viral on Instagram Reels, it goes viral on Facebook,

00:55:51,778 --> 00:55:57,598
SPEAKER_0:  Reddit, you know, you swipe through vertical content now, and Twitter when you click on a video and you flip through it. So this is actually.

00:55:57,890 --> 00:56:06,974
SPEAKER_0:  Very weird. This is the first time in the history of, I guess, Western social media that one form of content could actually go super viral on every single platform. It's never been like that before.

00:56:07,202 --> 00:56:09,077
SPEAKER_1:  So they're going viral individual.

00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:29,630
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, like I can post something on TikTok that'll get 100 million views and then post it on shorts and it'll get 200 million views and then post it on Instagram and it get 50 million views and then, you know, I haven't yet, but you know, you can then turn around and tweet it and get tens of millions of views and you can post on Reddit and get tens of millions of views and Facebook and get tens of millions of views. And that just wasn't a thing. Three years ago, Twitter didn't have...

00:56:29,858 --> 00:56:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  Because a lot of you probably don't even know this, but when you tap on a video now and you swipe down, it just turns into TikTok. That wasn't a thing even a year ago.

00:56:36,962 --> 00:56:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  Reddit, that wasn't a thing a year ago.

00:56:38,786 --> 00:56:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  probably two years ago, that wasn't a thing on Instagram.

00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:49,470
SPEAKER_0:  Three years ago, that wasn't a thing on YouTube, right, with YouTube shorts. So this is all new. And I don't, it's weird, I haven't heard a single person talk about it.

00:56:50,178 --> 00:56:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  This is the first time where...

00:56:51,682 --> 00:56:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  content can actually.

00:56:53,730 --> 00:57:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  Go viral on every single platform. And you don't have to write or film a video for Facebook, film a 12 minute video for YouTube, film a sub 60 second video for TikTok, write a tweet for Twitter and post this on Reddit. You can just do the same thing on every platform.

00:57:07,586 --> 00:57:12,030
SPEAKER_1:  And the fact that your content has gone viral on multiple platforms regularly means that

00:57:12,994 --> 00:57:14,942
SPEAKER_1:  Virality is not accidental.

00:57:15,362 --> 00:57:17,237
SPEAKER_1:  Sometimes it can be of course.

00:57:17,237 --> 00:57:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  But it's just not it can be engineered. It's yeah, so many people say it's luck and they're like, you're just lucky or this or that but

00:57:24,098 --> 00:57:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  What do we have to probably like a thousand videos over 10 million views. Like we don't ever have a dud. Like you can call it luck, but I think it can be trained. I counsel YouTubers all the time and show them how to.

00:57:34,114 --> 00:57:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  Go from getting a couple million views a month to 10 million views a month very easily.

00:57:38,306 --> 00:57:39,614
SPEAKER_0:  even certain ones like

00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  just one of my friends, like he was just really struggling. And so I just started showing him.

00:57:44,514 --> 00:57:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  Basically everything I know and just doing like.

00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:48,734
SPEAKER_0:  once every week, sometimes once every two weeks calls.

00:57:49,026 --> 00:57:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  Anyone from-

00:57:49,826 --> 00:57:54,334
SPEAKER_0:  $10,000 a month on YouTube to over $400,000. Just doing these little counseling calls. And so...

00:57:54,818 --> 00:57:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, people can make excuses all they want and say it's just luck or say, you know.

00:57:58,562 --> 00:57:59,006
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:58:00,194 --> 00:58:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  Anyways, I don't even want to quote all the other stuff, but...

00:58:02,722 --> 00:58:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  It's just...

00:58:03,682 --> 00:58:06,942
SPEAKER_0:  It is, it is a teachable skill, it's a learnable skill. You can.

00:58:07,554 --> 00:58:12,798
SPEAKER_0:  Study your way to consistently make viral videos, no matter how small your channel is, even if you have zero subscribers.

00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  you could if you actually studied hard enough. And like, basically if you knew what I knew and some of these.

00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  so I don't sound so arrogant. Also, like some of these other friends I have that I'd say are the smartest people in the world when it comes to content creation online. If you had the knowledge that was in-

00:58:26,178 --> 00:58:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  Our heads?

00:58:26,946 --> 00:58:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  You could do it very easily. I see people do it all the time.

00:58:30,178 --> 00:58:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  of.

00:58:30,914 --> 00:58:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  And what's even more interesting is I go on podcasts and I say everything I know. And these people are also very open. Some of them I know.

00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:39,166
SPEAKER_0:  It's all out there.

00:58:39,618 --> 00:58:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:58:40,386 --> 00:58:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of people, instead of just studying that and trying to absorb and apply it in their own way, they're just like, no, it's just luck, you know.

00:58:46,594 --> 00:58:49,310
SPEAKER_1:  You do lay it all out there, but I gotta push back to one.

00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:51,198
SPEAKER_1:  Interesting thing, I think.

00:58:51,426 --> 00:58:54,846
SPEAKER_1:  A crucial component of your success is the idea stage.

00:58:55,106 --> 00:58:55,998
SPEAKER_1:  the idea generation.

00:58:56,322 --> 00:58:59,774
SPEAKER_1:  the brainstorm that I heard today, but getting really good at generating ideas.

00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:00,766
SPEAKER_1:  This is not.

00:59:01,442 --> 00:59:03,102
SPEAKER_1:  It's not just.

00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:08,318
SPEAKER_1:  the selection of the thumbnail and the title, that creative process. It's also just the

00:59:09,122 --> 00:59:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  the engine of generating really good ideas. Of course. I mean, I.

00:59:13,922 --> 00:59:15,038
SPEAKER_1:  I would say that.

00:59:15,554 --> 00:59:20,830
SPEAKER_1:  is probably the thing that needs to be trained the most for most creators, right? That they just don't put enough ideas on paper.

00:59:21,218 --> 00:59:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, but also a lot of creators also just don't.

00:59:25,282 --> 00:59:30,933
SPEAKER_0:  You know, which I didn't either for the longest time, just didn't don't make enough content, you know, content that's worthy of getting 10 million.

00:59:30,933 --> 00:59:33,694
SPEAKER_1:  In the idea or the execution of the idea? Both.

00:59:34,082 --> 00:59:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, like, think about...

00:59:35,394 --> 00:59:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  how many people just make videos they film in under 20 minutes and they don't really put any effort into it and like you know

00:59:41,218 --> 00:59:41,662
SPEAKER_0:  It's like.

00:59:41,986 --> 00:59:57,886
SPEAKER_0:  My first 500 videos didn't deserve to get a million views. Like there's a reason they did. They were terrible, you know? But at the time I thought they did, right? And I'm in the mindset of a lot of small YouTubers where I thought those videos deserved a million views and I thought that algorithm hated me. But I watch them back now and I can tell you exactly why. The videos were just fucking horrible. You know what I mean?

00:59:58,114 --> 01:00:02,494
SPEAKER_1:  So what was the breakthrough for you to start realizing, to start having a self-awareness, you know?

01:00:02,722 --> 01:00:03,166
SPEAKER_1:  about.

01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:07,925
SPEAKER_1:  these videos aren't good enough. You're probably still going through that. You're probably still growing to see.

01:00:07,925 --> 01:00:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  Every six months you should look back and hate your videos or at least see things you could improve and be like, Oh my gosh, I could have done this better, that better. If not, then you're not learning quick enough.

01:00:18,818 --> 01:00:19,943
SPEAKER_0:  In my opinion at least.

01:00:19,943 --> 01:00:22,046
SPEAKER_1:  Where's the source of that learning even for you now?

01:00:22,146 --> 01:00:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  It's rough.

01:00:23,298 --> 01:00:32,350
SPEAKER_0:  Just look at the metrics. I just got back from a mastermind where I just got like 10 of the smartest people I knew and we just locked ourselves in a cabin and taught each other stuff.

01:00:32,706 --> 01:00:33,918
SPEAKER_0:  Constantly, every day.

01:00:34,178 --> 01:00:38,494
SPEAKER_0:  Not every day now, probably every other day I go on a walk and I just call random people. I'll just say, yeah, teach me something.

01:00:38,754 --> 01:00:40,894
SPEAKER_0:  And I mean, it's just.

01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  You just have to have a never ending thirst for learning.

01:00:44,962 --> 01:00:52,926
SPEAKER_0:  Link, that's very imperative, especially if you want, like if you wanna get on top and then stay on top. The only way to do it is just to constantly be learning. Or someone who is learning is just gonna.

01:00:53,218 --> 01:00:54,846
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I'll have a leg up on you in the knowledge game.

01:00:55,554 --> 01:00:58,942
SPEAKER_1:  And what kind of stuff are you? Cause you've talked about offline that.

01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:01,790
SPEAKER_1:  You just love learning of all kinds. It doesn't matter.

01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  In terms of videos, are you studying videos, are you studying?

01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  Recently not as much, I'm more-

01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  Because to get to the videos I want, I have to build this business and scale up and hire. So more my recent time has been like my teenage years were spent studying virality and studying content creation. Now I'm studying how to build a content company so I can actually produce the crazy ideas I want to produce if that makes any sense.

01:01:22,594 --> 01:01:24,414
SPEAKER_1:  So yeah, and that's the business side.

01:01:24,642 --> 01:01:27,550
SPEAKER_1:  We talked about hiring. Do you have trouble firing people?

01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  No, I'm pretty sure almost every person...

01:01:29,954 --> 01:01:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, actually, every person I've ever fired, we just give them severance and

01:01:32,962 --> 01:01:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  I like to see it more as...

01:01:34,818 --> 01:01:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  It's no ill will. Like if I fired you, if there's some other job you want me to help you get, I'll DM them on Twitter.

01:01:41,986 --> 01:01:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  you know, if you want to go work for...

01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, insert whatever, MTV.

01:01:46,242 --> 01:01:52,895
SPEAKER_0:  Give me someone to DM, I'll DM him. Like, you know, I try to make it more like a transition and do whatever we can to make it as easy as possible.

01:01:52,895 --> 01:01:56,645
SPEAKER_1:  something was just not working for you. cuz you want people like you said super passionate.

01:01:56,645 --> 01:02:05,982
SPEAKER_0:  Because at the end of the day, if you hold someone that you onto someone that you don't see being here in 10 years, you're just doing them a disservice. You're just giving them more ingrained, more enroute and where they are.

01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:06,654
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:02:06,914 --> 01:02:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  And the sooner you do it and help them move on to their new life, the better.

01:02:12,482 --> 01:02:16,190
SPEAKER_1:  given all the wisdom you have now, if you were to give advice to somebody or if you were

01:02:16,514 --> 01:02:17,630
SPEAKER_1:  to start over again.

01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:18,782
SPEAKER_1:  out.

01:02:19,298 --> 01:02:20,446
SPEAKER_1:  You had no money.

01:02:20,706 --> 01:02:23,230
SPEAKER_1:  What would be the first 10 videos you tried to make?

01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:26,494
SPEAKER_1:  on a new channel. I guess that's advice for a new person.

01:02:26,722 --> 01:02:27,847
SPEAKER_1:  And nobody knows you.

01:02:27,847 --> 01:02:30,097
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, nobody knows me. Yeah, I have a mask.

01:02:30,097 --> 01:02:32,126
SPEAKER_1:  And you also I guess don't have the wisdom.

01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  But if I don't have what I have in my head then.

01:02:34,498 --> 01:02:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  I would say just.

01:02:36,098 --> 01:02:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  fail. Like just a lot of people get analysis paralysis and they'll just sit there and

01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  They'll plan their first video for three months. I'm

01:02:43,266 --> 01:02:48,158
SPEAKER_0:  any of you listening, especially if you have zero viewers on your channel, your first video is not going to give views.

01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:52,510
SPEAKER_0:  It's not, your first 10 are not gonna give you. I can very confidently say that.

01:02:52,834 --> 01:02:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  So stop.

01:02:53,634 --> 01:02:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  sitting there and thinking for months and months on end and just get to work and start uploading.

01:02:58,402 --> 01:03:04,126
SPEAKER_0:  All you need to do, this applies to people who have not uploaded videos, but have dreams of being a YouTuber, is make 100 videos.

01:03:04,418 --> 01:03:09,854
SPEAKER_0:  and improve something every time. Do that. And then on your 101st video, we'll start talking. Like maybe you can get some views.

01:03:10,754 --> 01:03:13,918
SPEAKER_0:  You know, your first 100 are gonna suck. There are very freak cases like-

01:03:14,306 --> 01:03:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  Vysokosha or Emma Chamberlain who have really good personalities and it doesn't take them some as many videos.

01:03:19,778 --> 01:03:20,414
SPEAKER_0:  And it's just like.

01:03:20,738 --> 01:03:35,742
SPEAKER_0:  people who are seven foot five and making an NBA. Like, yes, there are free cases you can find, but for the average person like us, who don't have these exceptional personalities and backgrounds in filmmaking, just make 100 videos, improve something each time, and then talk to me on your 101st video.

01:03:36,194 --> 01:03:40,414
SPEAKER_1:  Well, the improve something is times the tricky one. How do you improve something each time?

01:03:40,514 --> 01:03:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  The second one just.

01:03:41,954 --> 01:03:46,654
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, put more effort into the script. The third one, try to learn a new editing trick. The fourth one.

01:03:46,882 --> 01:04:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  Try to figure out a way that you can have better inflections in your voice. The fifth one, try to study a new thumbnail tip and implement it. The sixth one, try to figure out a new title. There's infinite ways. That's the beauty of content creation online. There's literally infinite ways, from the coloring to the frame rate to the editing to the filming to the production to the jokes to the pacing to every little thing can be improved and they can never not be improved. There's literally no such thing as a perfect video.

01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:09,694
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:11,742
SPEAKER_1:  If you knew everything you know now.

01:04:12,226 --> 01:04:12,990
SPEAKER_1:  but no money.

01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  Step one, I just brainstorm like.

01:04:15,234 --> 01:04:16,350
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, I don't have money.

01:04:16,674 --> 01:04:18,110
SPEAKER_0:  What are some viral things? What are some viral things?

01:04:18,402 --> 01:04:18,782
SPEAKER_0:  I mean...

01:04:19,298 --> 01:04:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  The first thing that comes to mind is something as simple as when I count to 100,000, which is what I did do when I was poor. And I like that work, but like what's something like that I could do that would be even more...

01:04:29,794 --> 01:04:30,919
SPEAKER_0:  attention grabbing. maximum time to explore that word,

01:04:30,919 --> 01:04:32,574
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, as part of the brainstorm.

01:04:33,186 --> 01:04:38,782
SPEAKER_1:  You would throw out a lot of ideas, people throw out a bunch of ideas, and one of the questions is, is this even doable?

01:04:39,234 --> 01:04:39,550
SPEAKER_1:  Right? Yeah.

01:04:39,874 --> 01:04:46,654
SPEAKER_0:  First off, come up with ideas you think would do well, and then ask yourself later if they're doable. Because there's different ways you can accomplish something.

01:04:46,754 --> 01:04:49,054
SPEAKER_1:  Don't be cynical about the do-ability of stuff.

01:04:49,154 --> 01:04:51,710
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, because there really are so many different ways you can...

01:04:52,322 --> 01:04:54,366
SPEAKER_0:  Accomplish a goal like

01:04:55,426 --> 01:04:58,206
SPEAKER_0:  when we give away an island, like we gave our 100 million subscriber an island. subscribe

01:04:59,138 --> 01:05:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  You can't find private islands that, you know, don't look like shit for less than $10 million. So this isn't doable, right? All right. It doesn't exist, not doable.

01:05:07,298 --> 01:05:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  Exit off.

01:05:08,194 --> 01:05:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  But then, you know, you dig into it and you...

01:05:10,818 --> 01:05:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  you know, find different alternatives and you find, okay, what if we just buy a $2 million Island that sucks?

01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:22,302
SPEAKER_0:  and then spend a million dollars, you know, importing some sand, let's build a beach, let's import 300 trees, let's build a little bit of canals, let's set some paths.

01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:22,846
SPEAKER_0:  Boom.

01:05:23,234 --> 01:05:25,310
SPEAKER_0:  Now it's a really nice island.

01:05:25,666 --> 01:05:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  but it's actually affordable because we don't have $10 million to spend on a video, but we can afford to spend three and a half and lose whatever, a million dollars on that video. So like, that's an example of like...

01:05:34,274 --> 01:05:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, if you just went off the gut test, you'd be like, this isn't doable. Every island's $10 million, we're screwed. If we go cheaper, it's just a-

01:05:40,546 --> 01:05:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  Terrible Island, no.

01:05:41,794 --> 01:05:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  And so if you like.

01:05:43,746 --> 01:05:49,470
SPEAKER_0:  There are so many different ways you can achieve what you want. You really got to push through notes, which not a lot of people do. You have to have like a...

01:05:49,698 --> 01:05:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  more of a dominant personality and just a willingness to.

01:05:53,154 --> 01:05:55,198
SPEAKER_0:  Um, when people tell you it's not possible, just.

01:05:55,586 --> 01:05:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  actually go through all the variables and eliminate them all yourself.

01:05:59,746 --> 01:06:00,894
SPEAKER_1:  have a stubbornness.

01:06:01,602 --> 01:06:03,454
SPEAKER_1:  and resilience to failure maybe.

01:06:03,554 --> 01:06:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  For what we do and creators online, it's very imperative that you have

01:06:08,674 --> 01:06:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  A no isn't a no deal. You really have to like think and just

01:06:13,506 --> 01:06:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  Like we take a personality test and like just having a dominant personality is a better indicator that when someone tells you, oh, there's no way you're gonna build a brick wall for under a hundred grand, you know, you'll be like, okay, and then still go check the next 10 vendors and figure it out.

01:06:27,490 --> 01:06:36,126
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, what advice would you give to an already established channel like with one, two, three, four million subscribers, how to like 10 exit.

01:06:36,418 --> 01:06:37,502
SPEAKER_1:  Like increase it.

01:06:37,986 --> 01:06:38,494
SPEAKER_1:  Um f-

01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:41,278
SPEAKER_0:  without losing maybe. Yeah, that's where it's very specific. Like.

01:06:41,506 --> 01:06:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  channel by channel. You can't give general advice. Okay.

01:06:44,706 --> 01:06:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  Because if I do...

01:06:46,082 --> 01:06:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  millions of creators are gonna...

01:06:47,426 --> 01:06:50,051
SPEAKER_0:  see this and then they're gonna do it and I'm gonna fuck them over you know

01:06:50,051 --> 01:06:50,846
SPEAKER_1:  I say see

01:06:51,106 --> 01:06:55,134
SPEAKER_1:  So let's say I'd like two million subscribers on this podcast. Yeah. Thank you.

01:06:55,362 --> 01:06:57,598
SPEAKER_1:  10x that without sacrificing what it is.

01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:00,675
SPEAKER_1:  10X your stuff. Does it matter? You've talked about

01:07:00,675 --> 01:07:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  with success.

01:07:01,666 --> 01:07:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it's different for everyone. Like is 10Xing your definition of success? No.

01:07:06,146 --> 01:07:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  Well then.

01:07:06,818 --> 01:07:17,950
SPEAKER_0:  Right off the bat, it's hard because if you don't give a shit about 10X, it's even harder than 10X. He does this because he likes helping people. That's one thing I've found throughout this day. Every time I talk to Data, it's so funny with him.

01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:18,750
SPEAKER_0:  Cause it's like

01:07:18,978 --> 01:07:25,791
SPEAKER_0:  You know, you could do this to get more views and he'll just be like blank. I feel like that doesn't register anything. He just like doesn't care, which is it's really cool.

01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:28,574
SPEAKER_1:  nervous about that. I'm really nervous about the numbers affecting...

01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:30,110
SPEAKER_1:  Cause it's so fun.

01:07:30,498 --> 01:07:35,710
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's so fun to focus on the numbers and I'm really worried about that. But at the same time you should be

01:07:36,354 --> 01:07:37,470
SPEAKER_1:  cognizant of that because

01:07:37,698 --> 01:07:39,102
SPEAKER_1:  You've created not.

01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:43,774
SPEAKER_1:  just some of the most watched videos, but some of the most amazing videos ever. So it's...

01:07:44,066 --> 01:07:48,958
SPEAKER_1:  There's a strong correlation there. It's not like you're selling your soul to make a highly viewed video.

01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:51,166
SPEAKER_1:  is actually if you look at the metrics.

01:07:51,874 --> 01:07:54,334
SPEAKER_1:  It helps you understand what is compelling and not.

01:07:54,722 --> 01:07:55,614
SPEAKER_1:  And so I feel like.

01:07:56,194 --> 01:07:56,798
SPEAKER_1:  I am.

01:07:58,242 --> 01:07:58,814
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

01:07:59,778 --> 01:08:02,782
SPEAKER_1:  I feel like there's some value to investigate.

01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:05,470
SPEAKER_1:  What work when people tune out and when not.

01:08:05,762 --> 01:08:08,318
SPEAKER_1:  to be more data-driven, even on podcasts.

01:08:08,706 --> 01:08:12,414
SPEAKER_0:  But I'm really afraid of that. But on the flip side, I think part of the appeal is that you don't care about that kind of stuff.

01:08:13,282 --> 01:08:14,407
SPEAKER_0:  But there could be stuff...

01:08:14,407 --> 01:08:16,222
SPEAKER_1:  that doesn't have to do anything with that.

01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:19,486
SPEAKER_1:  and it has to do with stylistic choices of lighting and cameras.

01:08:19,714 --> 01:08:21,278
SPEAKER_1:  Or maybe with, uh...

01:08:22,594 --> 01:08:23,998
SPEAKER_1:  For example,

01:08:24,418 --> 01:08:25,086
SPEAKER_1:  topics.

01:08:26,050 --> 01:08:29,799
SPEAKER_0:  You know, like even what you've asked me here is like different than what most people ask me

01:08:29,799 --> 01:08:34,299
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so it could be that I mean, and it'd be nice to understand that. But yeah, again, I'm worried about it.

01:08:34,299 --> 01:08:40,318
SPEAKER_0:  polluting the creative process. At the end of the day, this is a true case of it's your own intuition. You know your viewers better than anyone else.

01:08:40,674 --> 01:08:41,799
SPEAKER_0:  It's whatever.

01:08:41,799 --> 01:08:43,614
SPEAKER_1:  See, I'd like to push back on that. I really don't.

01:08:43,746 --> 01:08:44,222
SPEAKER_0:  You do.

01:08:44,482 --> 01:08:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  Who else? Name one person who knows your viewers better than you.

01:08:48,066 --> 01:08:49,941
SPEAKER_1:  Somebody that looks at numbers of positive

01:08:49,941 --> 01:08:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  No, you know your viewers, you know

01:08:52,546 --> 01:09:01,367
SPEAKER_0:  You're the only how many episodes have you done? Uh, 350. Exactly. But I'm not paying attention. You're the only one who's watched every second of all 350 of them. Probably. It's not no-

01:09:01,367 --> 01:09:02,867
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I haven't, but the.

01:09:02,867 --> 01:09:05,694
SPEAKER_0:  Well, because you did it, so you do know what's in the album.

01:09:06,018 --> 01:09:08,350
SPEAKER_0:  It's your content, it's you people. I'm telling you.

01:09:08,610 --> 01:09:10,430
SPEAKER_0:  You do, and this is just one of those moments where...

01:09:10,786 --> 01:09:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  You're an intelligent guy and you just have to trust your like.

01:09:13,826 --> 01:09:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  Instincts like.

01:09:15,202 --> 01:09:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  Just think.

01:09:16,098 --> 01:09:18,398
SPEAKER_0:  What is the typical X viewer and what do they want?

01:09:18,658 --> 01:09:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think like that.

01:09:19,938 --> 01:09:24,469
SPEAKER_0:  But that's all you would have to do. And whatever your gut tells you, that would be the best guess.

01:09:24,469 --> 01:09:33,982
SPEAKER_1:  You don't know what the typical viewer is though. I don't, I don't, cause to investigate that would be very, very difficult. And then you have to start looking at the numbers. You have to start to consider demographics.

01:09:34,306 --> 01:09:43,422
SPEAKER_1:  The only way I know that anybody even watches it is because I'll sometimes run into people, like when I run along the river, and they'd be like, I love you, Lex. It's like, okay, well that.

01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:45,374
SPEAKER_1:  That's the data point.

01:09:45,602 --> 01:09:49,630
SPEAKER_1:  And they're like cool people, but you know, I don't know. I don't have any other.

01:09:50,498 --> 01:09:52,542
SPEAKER_1:  It's difficult man, it's difficult to know.

01:09:53,538 --> 01:10:00,094
SPEAKER_1:  It's difficult to know who listens to boxes. It's difficult to, do you have a sense of who's, I mean, like you're so huge that everybody watches.

01:10:00,194 --> 01:10:02,334
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, but no, I still do. I'd say.

01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:03,518
SPEAKER_0:  If you were to just

01:10:03,906 --> 01:10:11,486
SPEAKER_0:  put a gun to my head and you're like, all right, we're gonna pick a random person that watched your last video, and you have to roughly guess what they are, and if you're not close, we'll kill you.

01:10:11,714 --> 01:10:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  I would say probably like.

01:10:13,314 --> 01:10:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  a teenager that plays video games. Like that would be probably the typical one. And then there are people that are maybe a little bit younger, a lot of people that are older as well.

01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:25,982
SPEAKER_0:  And a random sample size? Yeah, it's probably like-

01:10:26,274 --> 01:10:29,278
SPEAKER_0:  I'm a male boy that plays video games. Like that's the best way I would describe it.

01:10:29,538 --> 01:10:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  But I don't try to pertain to them. I just make whatever I think is interesting and good content.

01:10:33,538 --> 01:10:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  And this is what we were talking about before, even though hypothetically 35 to 40% of my audience is women, which is less than a majority.

01:10:42,018 --> 01:10:45,630
SPEAKER_0:  If we get 100 million views a video, that's still 30 to 40 million females that watch every video.

01:10:45,858 --> 01:10:47,422
SPEAKER_0:  which is probably the largest.

01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:48,126
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:10:48,514 --> 01:10:49,726
SPEAKER_0:  you know, views per video.

01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:53,310
SPEAKER_0:  for women on the whole platform, but you wouldn't think that, you know?

01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  Like I can't think of a single

01:10:55,234 --> 01:10:58,046
SPEAKER_0:  other creator that gets more women to watch their videos than that.

01:10:58,370 --> 01:10:58,814
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:10:59,458 --> 01:11:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

01:11:00,514 --> 01:11:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  It's just anything, even like people above the age of 30, even if it's only like three or 4%.

01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:09,150
SPEAKER_0:  That's still three to 4% of 100 million views is a lot of people that age. So we …

01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:11,838
SPEAKER_0:  We hit a large group of, uh...

01:11:12,354 --> 01:11:14,014
SPEAKER_0:  of kind of every demographic.

01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:15,655
SPEAKER_0:  That makes sense. WHILE TO TAKE CARE OF M what do you say about so

01:11:15,655 --> 01:11:16,990
SPEAKER_1:  What if we look at other?

01:11:17,218 --> 01:11:19,902
SPEAKER_1:  maybe more challenging kinds of channels or not, but.

01:11:20,418 --> 01:11:23,326
SPEAKER_1:  If you look at educational, for example, like lectures, or free.

01:11:23,682 --> 01:11:26,782
SPEAKER_1:  Look, yeah, educational. It could be short videos. How would you?

01:11:27,778 --> 01:11:28,446
SPEAKER_1:  text that.

01:11:28,898 --> 01:11:30,046
SPEAKER_1:  like something on.

01:11:30,594 --> 01:11:34,718
SPEAKER_1:  of robotics and biology and science and engineering and all that.

01:11:35,522 --> 01:11:36,647
SPEAKER_1:  that's more educational focused.

01:11:36,647 --> 01:11:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  We would honestly just have to pull the day because it's the same way if you went to Gordon Ramsay you said

01:11:41,186 --> 01:11:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  How about a-

01:11:41,858 --> 01:11:45,109
SPEAKER_0:  New cook, cook better. You know, it's like, you gotta- Even then.

01:11:45,109 --> 01:11:46,609
SPEAKER_1:  that's not even a specific, you have to go channel.

01:11:46,609 --> 01:11:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  You really do or I'm giving horrible advice because if there was these just golden rules everyone would do it you know what I mean like if there's these magical little principles.

01:11:54,946 --> 01:11:57,406
SPEAKER_1:  how quickly do you get when you look at a channel can you kind of

01:11:57,762 --> 01:11:59,198
SPEAKER_0:  Give advice.

01:11:59,458 --> 01:12:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  It's like surface love at the start and then the more, if we watch 10 videos, I feel like I'd have a good profile and I could tell you.

01:12:04,706 --> 01:12:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  In my opinion.

01:12:05,698 --> 01:12:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  You know, especially once I look at the analytics and I get more ingrained in like, okay, the typical view is this, they're from here, here's how they're feeling.

01:12:12,098 --> 01:12:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  You know, because there are people.

01:12:14,242 --> 01:12:22,846
SPEAKER_0:  make videos for rednecks. And like the rednecks taste of content is just so much different than obviously women watching makeup videos, they're so much different than, you know.

01:12:23,074 --> 01:12:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  teenage boys watching a Minecraft video. They're just all different. So the biggest thing you have to do is put your head in the head space of the viewer and see the content how they would. Because if you just try to only give your taste, which is what a lot of people do, and things from your perspective.

01:12:37,122 --> 01:12:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  It's very biased and it's just not gonna work for everyone. And that's actually how you do more harm than good, which is something I'm very careful of.

01:12:43,490 --> 01:12:50,462
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, but at the same time, just generating a lot of ideas. I think the first time I've talked to you was on Clubhouse, actually. I mentioned something about robots.

01:12:50,722 --> 01:12:53,347
SPEAKER_1:  And like almost immediately you went to generating a bunch of ideas.

01:12:53,347 --> 01:12:54,270
SPEAKER_0:  Oh yeah, he's like...

01:12:54,626 --> 01:13:00,251
SPEAKER_0:  It's just a hundred robots versus a hundred humans. Yeah. Yeah, how far can a robot throw a potato? I think your idea like

01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:03,742
SPEAKER_1:  I think the first idea was, you just said so many ideas I never even thought of.

01:13:04,514 --> 01:13:06,622
SPEAKER_1:  but it shows the value of.

01:13:07,458 --> 01:13:09,333
SPEAKER_1:  basically brainstorming with people that think.

01:13:09,333 --> 01:13:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  But at the end of the day, my ideas are probably, you know...

01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:13,630
SPEAKER_0:  might lean towards.

01:13:13,986 --> 01:13:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  some people a little bit younger than your audience. some of the stuff.

01:13:16,674 --> 01:13:17,799
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, there's still ideas.

01:13:17,799 --> 01:13:20,798
SPEAKER_1:  I think the first one you said, cause we're talking about a quadruped like.

01:13:21,058 --> 01:13:21,982
SPEAKER_1:  I wrote by dogs.

01:13:22,242 --> 01:13:23,678
SPEAKER_1:  You said to replace.

01:13:23,938 --> 01:13:25,118
SPEAKER_1:  a biological dog.

01:13:25,506 --> 01:13:30,381
SPEAKER_1:  with the robot dog and see if the owner notices something. You were just quickly brainstorming different ideas of how to do things

01:13:30,381 --> 01:13:31,881
SPEAKER_0:  This was years ago, I remember that.

01:13:31,881 --> 01:13:37,502
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. Which is just, I mean, it's like, oh yeah, I never really thought about that kind of, sorry, it's the basic.

01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:45,950
SPEAKER_1:  the tension between what does it take for a robot in our AI system to replace the biological systems that we, the biological creatures that we love.

01:13:46,338 --> 01:13:47,134
SPEAKER_1:  And a lot is there.

01:13:47,778 --> 01:13:49,598
SPEAKER_1:  But that was the...

01:13:50,754 --> 01:13:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  pace of idea generation.

01:13:53,698 --> 01:13:56,990
SPEAKER_1:  was the thing that struck me today and in general.

01:13:57,506 --> 01:13:59,006
SPEAKER_1:  It's like, that's how you get it.

01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:00,510
SPEAKER_1:  good videos as you keep.

01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  It makes it much easier to

01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:07,838
SPEAKER_0:  make a video around a good idea, obviously, then a bad one. You just send yourself up for success.

01:14:08,130 --> 01:14:09,255
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, so that's for...

01:14:09,255 --> 01:14:11,902
SPEAKER_1:  10x seniority popular channel.

01:14:12,386 --> 01:14:14,046
SPEAKER_1:  What's the hardest number? You said, uh...

01:14:14,914 --> 01:14:19,262
SPEAKER_1:  the numbers that matters, click through rate, average view duration, and surveys.

01:14:19,938 --> 01:14:21,310
SPEAKER_1:  What's the hardest number to uh...

01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:22,206
SPEAKER_1:  optimized for.

01:14:22,498 --> 01:14:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  Probably surveys, you know.

01:14:24,226 --> 01:14:26,851
SPEAKER_1:  Do you have any, do you have an insight into the service at all? No.

01:14:26,851 --> 01:14:30,750
SPEAKER_0:  Not really, but if you just click on a bunch of random videos online, you'll eventually get a survey.

01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  What's this video? It's informative, heartwarming, inspiring.

01:14:33,826 --> 01:14:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  What people rate does make a difference.

01:14:36,418 --> 01:14:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  And it's like you can.

01:14:37,762 --> 01:14:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  give people a click of it, you can get them to watch it, but you can't really fake whether or not they're satisfied. Like they don't lie, the service, you know?

01:14:44,226 --> 01:14:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  You know, maybe one person here, they're my troll but once you aggregate enough, it's a pretty clear telltale of the video.

01:14:50,562 --> 01:14:52,350
SPEAKER_0:  So either you're making a great video or you're not.

01:14:53,538 --> 01:14:54,622
SPEAKER_1:  What is it?

01:14:55,362 --> 01:14:56,734
SPEAKER_1:  minimizing the none.

01:14:57,986 --> 01:14:58,910
SPEAKER_1:  Regrettability.

01:14:59,330 --> 01:15:01,955
SPEAKER_0:  I think Elon tweeted that that's what he's tried to do.

01:15:01,955 --> 01:15:07,038
SPEAKER_1:  for Twitter. And that's interesting. That's basically the survey metric, how happy you are that you've been using the platform. Well, that's about at 18%.

01:15:07,138 --> 01:15:11,646
SPEAKER_0:  Elon tweeted, we want to limit the amount of regrettable minutes people spend on Twitter.

01:15:12,002 --> 01:15:17,694
SPEAKER_0:  And the first thing I thought is like, that's something YouTube already has a lot. Like their whole survey system and feedback loop.

01:15:18,114 --> 01:15:19,934
SPEAKER_1:  How tough is it to take on you, do you think?

01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:23,582
SPEAKER_1:  Like, uh... For Twitter? Yeah, for Twitter, for anybody else.

01:15:24,034 --> 01:15:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:15:24,674 --> 01:15:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  I mean.

01:15:25,346 --> 01:15:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  It's gonna be basically impossible. I mean YouTube's not going anywhere and

01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:30,046
SPEAKER_0:  Alright.

01:15:30,754 --> 01:15:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, I don't think anyone's gonna do what YouTube does better than them.

01:15:34,402 --> 01:15:36,094
SPEAKER_0:  uh... at least not in the next ten years

01:15:38,210 --> 01:15:43,870
SPEAKER_1:  You asked on Twitter, would you rather have $10 million or 10 million subscribers on YouTube?

01:15:44,482 --> 01:15:44,862
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:15:45,314 --> 01:15:48,062
SPEAKER_1:  What would your own answer be at various stages in your...

01:15:48,162 --> 01:15:49,086
SPEAKER_0:  If I...

01:15:49,506 --> 01:15:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  If I had nothing, I would say $10 million.

01:15:52,418 --> 01:15:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  Because with $10 million, you can hire some people.

01:15:55,618 --> 01:15:56,478
SPEAKER_0:  pump out content.

01:15:57,026 --> 01:16:00,734
SPEAKER_0:  with like a million or two, get 10 million subscribers and then keep the other eight million.

01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:05,375
SPEAKER_1:  So that's if you believe in your ability to grow a channel. That is if you—

01:16:05,375 --> 01:16:08,702
SPEAKER_0:  But if you don't believe in your ability to grow a channel.

01:16:08,962 --> 01:16:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  then you shouldn't take the 10 million subscribers because you're just gonna kill the chance. So the 10 million is definitely, a better question would be, would you rather have a million dollars for 10 million subscribers? That's where it gets a little tricky.

01:16:19,618 --> 01:16:20,702
SPEAKER_0:  Because now it's like, hmm.

01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,262
SPEAKER_0:  you know, a million dollar is a life changing amount of money.

01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  But you know if you semi-know what you're doing, you probably make a million dollars off a 10 million subscriber channel.

01:16:29,506 --> 01:16:30,631
SPEAKER_0:  There is a little bit of risk.

01:16:30,631 --> 01:16:33,630
SPEAKER_1:  a million dollars might not be enough to build a strong team.

01:16:33,986 --> 01:16:35,861
SPEAKER_1:  because you don't know how to do it, so you might waste all

01:16:35,861 --> 01:16:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  of that money. Yeah, or they just keep it and retire. Yeah. Okay, that's true. Yeah, because 10 million is just so high. It's like just

01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  Never work again, who cares? For the average human, that's so much money.

01:16:44,642 --> 01:16:47,998
SPEAKER_1:  It's interesting to me also to the value of the subscriber versus the value of the dollar.

01:16:49,282 --> 01:16:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:52,254
SPEAKER_1:  I suppose how valuable is a subscriber?

01:16:52,482 --> 01:16:52,926
SPEAKER_1:  for.

01:16:54,146 --> 01:16:57,822
SPEAKER_1:  What percentage of the videos like how active the subscribers in watching the video?

01:16:58,146 --> 01:16:58,590
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:16:59,522 --> 01:16:59,966
SPEAKER_1:  for you.

01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  That's hard, I don't know. I was actually thinking more about the subscriber to dollar. Like if someone has 10 million subscribers, have they made $10 million? I don't know why that kind of popped in my head.

01:17:09,794 --> 01:17:10,430
SPEAKER_0:  transitioning.

01:17:10,722 --> 01:17:11,070
SPEAKER_1:  thought.

01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:13,854
SPEAKER_1:  uh... do you ever

01:17:14,114 --> 01:17:19,614
SPEAKER_1:  when you analyze videos, do you ever analyze videos like we've talked about offline of other?

01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:24,415
SPEAKER_1:  videos across the two in general to understand trans and since also be

01:17:24,415 --> 01:17:29,278
SPEAKER_0:  All your, not all, but a lot of the questions are analytics based. Yeah. Yeah, it's so funny.

01:17:29,506 --> 01:17:33,886
SPEAKER_1:  I mean it's just a giant social experiment, right? Like what people like to watch, what people share.

01:17:34,146 --> 01:17:35,390
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's like a fascinating.

01:17:35,522 --> 01:17:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  So I hate that. So like I said before, what percentage of your audience do you think care about this kind of stuff?

01:17:40,706 --> 01:17:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  like this deeply about YouTube Analytics.

01:17:43,394 --> 01:17:43,806
SPEAKER_1:  I think.

01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:45,214
SPEAKER_1:  A large amount.

01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:46,142
SPEAKER_1:  care about.

01:17:47,586 --> 01:17:47,998
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:17:48,514 --> 01:17:54,933
SPEAKER_1:  curiosity and exploration of interesting ideas. So in that sense, yeah, this would fit it.

01:17:54,933 --> 01:18:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  I love it. This is funny. This isn't me like trying to make, I love you. I love your Magnus one and even your Hikaru one was really good, a bunch of other ones. But I think we're getting to the point now where only analytics junkies would want to keep hearing more analytics talk. And the normie is probably like...

01:18:12,514 --> 01:18:15,326
SPEAKER_0:  They've had their dose of YouTube talk for the next three years.

01:18:16,002 --> 01:18:24,309
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe I'm wrong. Hey, comment if I'm wrong. I could be. I don't know your audience. See, this is where you would tell me, shut up, I know my audience, you dumb ass.

01:18:24,309 --> 01:18:28,350
SPEAKER_1:  I don't at all. I actually, I just follow the thread of curiosity.

01:18:28,994 --> 01:18:31,422
SPEAKER_1:  And I think there's just a lot of curious humans in the world.

01:18:31,906 --> 01:18:33,598
SPEAKER_1:  And to me, it's like.

01:18:35,042 --> 01:18:37,598
SPEAKER_1:  So the question about analytics is the question of.

01:18:38,338 --> 01:18:39,806
SPEAKER_1:  basically stepping away.

01:18:40,514 --> 01:18:47,102
SPEAKER_1:  stepping outside of yourself and thinking, why the hell do I like TikTok so much? Why do I like Twitter so much? Why do I like YouTube so much?

01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:51,998
SPEAKER_1:  And getting, even if you're not a creator, getting an insight into that is really interesting.

01:18:53,378 --> 01:18:54,014
SPEAKER_1:  What?

01:18:54,786 --> 01:18:55,326
SPEAKER_1:  because

01:18:55,714 --> 01:18:57,822
SPEAKER_1:  because all these platforms are fundamentally changing.

01:18:58,306 --> 01:18:59,294
SPEAKER_1:  the nature of content.

01:18:59,810 --> 01:19:03,230
SPEAKER_1:  People are reading books less, they're probably going to be watching movies less and less.

01:19:03,554 --> 01:19:05,758
SPEAKER_1:  They're probably going to be watching Netflix less and less.

01:19:06,690 --> 01:19:09,854
SPEAKER_1:  Do you ever think about the sort of the darker side of YouTube?

01:19:10,498 --> 01:19:10,942
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:13,886
SPEAKER_1:  with shadow banning of censorship and all the kind of topics.

01:19:14,146 --> 01:19:16,286
SPEAKER_1:  especially if you see it on other platforms like Twitter.

01:19:16,546 --> 01:19:16,894
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:19:17,218 --> 01:19:18,142
SPEAKER_1:  that uh...

01:19:19,042 --> 01:19:20,254
SPEAKER_1:  Elon recently...

01:19:20,482 --> 01:19:22,942
SPEAKER_1:  highlighted the shadow banning that was happening.

01:19:23,330 --> 01:19:27,326
SPEAKER_1:  and in general the censorship that was happening on those platforms. Do you think about the role?

01:19:28,322 --> 01:19:31,934
SPEAKER_1:  of centralized control which information isn't or isn't.

01:19:32,610 --> 01:19:34,366
SPEAKER_1:  are made available through search and discovery.

01:19:35,010 --> 01:19:35,646
SPEAKER_0:  I'll be honest.

01:19:36,226 --> 01:19:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  I never really think about it.

01:19:38,786 --> 01:19:39,911
SPEAKER_0:  Uh... Just uh...

01:19:39,911 --> 01:19:41,411
SPEAKER_1:  We just try to make fun videos that.

01:19:41,411 --> 01:19:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I'm more I'm kind of more in my own lane, but it's not like that. I don't just specifically think about I just like a lot of stuff in general. I just kind of my own lane thinking about my own stuff.

01:19:51,778 --> 01:19:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  You know, now that you asked, I'm curious, what are your thoughts on YouTube and that kind of stuff?

01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:56,999
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I'm generally against-

01:19:56,999 --> 01:19:58,430
SPEAKER_1:  centralized.

01:19:59,426 --> 01:19:59,806
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:20:00,066 --> 01:20:02,494
SPEAKER_1:  censorship or shadow ban shadow ban is the worst one.

01:20:02,914 --> 01:20:03,454
SPEAKER_1:  Because...

01:20:04,002 --> 01:20:04,894
SPEAKER_1:  Not that.

01:20:05,314 --> 01:20:09,342
SPEAKER_1:  the goal of creating a healthy platform where you're having great conversations.

01:20:09,890 --> 01:20:10,302
SPEAKER_1:  uh

01:20:10,562 --> 01:20:14,334
SPEAKER_1:  videos that are not spreading misinformation, that sounds like an admirable goal.

01:20:14,818 --> 01:20:18,193
SPEAKER_1:  But that's too difficult of a job for a centralized entity. That's too big of a...

01:20:18,193 --> 01:20:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, there's the misinformation stuff and then there's also just like...

01:20:21,826 --> 01:20:22,686
SPEAKER_0:  The videos were...

01:20:22,978 --> 01:20:26,942
SPEAKER_0:  they do something that causes a what happened back there that work

01:20:27,618 --> 01:20:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  at apocalypse, you know, a lot of creators revenue plummets because people are

01:20:32,482 --> 01:20:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  doing videos that advertisers don't seem acceptable. And then now all these big advertisers are pulling and the little guys are getting hit because ad rates dropped by 30%. And the person who just quit his job to go full-time conjugation.

01:20:43,298 --> 01:20:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  now can't sustain it.

01:20:44,642 --> 01:20:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  So it's also...

01:20:45,794 --> 01:20:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  It's like a lot of different variables as well. That makes it so complicated.

01:20:49,506 --> 01:20:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I think the big thing is transparency, especially around shadow banning.

01:20:53,282 --> 01:20:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  I agree. On Shadow of Anning, you should be transparent. You should let people know.

01:20:58,466 --> 01:21:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  It, you know, obviously there has to be some type of controls. People can't just post whatever. And so if you're

01:21:03,554 --> 01:21:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  pulling those levers, they should at least know.

01:21:05,986 --> 01:21:08,158
SPEAKER_1:  Yesterday Noah had to...

01:21:08,386 --> 01:21:11,422
SPEAKER_1:  improve their content they can understand that they can be a

01:21:11,682 --> 01:21:13,758
SPEAKER_1:  If it's a wrong shadow banning.

01:21:14,146 --> 01:21:19,021
SPEAKER_1:  Like as a society that we should not shadow ban this kind of content that means you should be publicly glamorous

01:21:19,021 --> 01:21:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  discussing it and having that. If it's not known.

01:21:21,794 --> 01:21:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  then it's just kind of like, well, then who's pulling the strings and like.

01:21:25,058 --> 01:21:30,046
SPEAKER_0:  How do we know they're not just manipulating things to get whatever message they want out there and silence other ones?

01:21:30,370 --> 01:21:34,910
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, that could be sort of in the background government influence, which is where actual freedom of speech.

01:21:35,522 --> 01:21:38,238
SPEAKER_1:  comes into play that the government should not have any control.

01:21:38,594 --> 01:21:41,246
SPEAKER_1:  or be able to put pressure on censorship.

01:21:41,634 --> 01:21:42,302
SPEAKER_1:  of speech.

01:21:42,818 --> 01:21:46,334
SPEAKER_1:  And it gets weird if none of that is being, there's no transparency around it.

01:21:46,626 --> 01:21:47,038
SPEAKER_1:  That's it.

01:21:47,714 --> 01:21:48,414
SPEAKER_1:  To be fair...

01:21:48,930 --> 01:21:51,486
SPEAKER_1:  That's a huge responsibility. The amount of-

01:21:52,130 --> 01:21:54,494
SPEAKER_1:  content that YouTube is uploaded on YouTube.

01:21:54,946 --> 01:21:55,422
SPEAKER_1:  It is.

01:21:55,682 --> 01:21:56,807
SPEAKER_1:  shared by YouTube.

01:21:56,807 --> 01:22:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  But even more of a reason why it would probably make sense to be transparent.

01:22:01,410 --> 01:22:03,006
SPEAKER_0:  because then people can help fact check it.

01:22:03,810 --> 01:22:07,070
SPEAKER_1:  That's right, but that requires building a platform that makes that easy.

01:22:07,650 --> 01:22:08,574
SPEAKER_1:  Right, like...

01:22:10,178 --> 01:22:12,702
SPEAKER_1:  to make fact checking easy to make the...

01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:16,222
SPEAKER_1:  like who Twitter now has, like being able to share context and all that kind of stuff.

01:22:16,610 --> 01:22:19,614
SPEAKER_1:  that crowdsource it. Crowdsources the way Wikipedia crowdsources.

01:22:19,874 --> 01:22:20,382
SPEAKER_1:  I mean there's...

01:22:21,058 --> 01:22:22,183
SPEAKER_1:  It's right.

01:22:22,183 --> 01:22:24,862
SPEAKER_0:  And then you open a random Wikipedia article.

01:22:24,994 --> 01:22:25,406
SPEAKER_1:  Thanks for watching!

01:22:25,634 --> 01:22:28,798
SPEAKER_1:  But like, you know, people criticize Wikipedia because there is...

01:22:29,058 --> 01:22:32,286
SPEAKER_1:  a political lean to the editors of Wikipedia and then they get

01:22:33,410 --> 01:22:39,294
SPEAKER_1:  There's some articles that definitely have a bias to them and all that kind of stuff. It's a difficult problem. It's a difficult problem to solve that.

01:22:39,586 --> 01:22:40,318
SPEAKER_1:  Ultimately.

01:22:40,674 --> 01:22:44,862
SPEAKER_1:  As much as possible, it would be nice for the viewer to have control of that versus the.

01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:47,166
SPEAKER_1:  the entity that's hosting it.

01:22:47,522 --> 01:22:48,647
SPEAKER_1:  So for the viewer to decide.

01:22:48,647 --> 01:22:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  that stuff out. I'm just gonna make

01:22:50,658 --> 01:22:54,366
SPEAKER_0:  Cool videos. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go to Antarctica again.

01:22:54,658 --> 01:22:55,783
SPEAKER_0:  How was that? How was going to you-

01:22:55,783 --> 01:22:58,366
SPEAKER_1:  I just came back from Antarctica. I watched the video.

01:22:58,914 --> 01:22:59,326
SPEAKER_1:  That was.

01:22:59,842 --> 01:23:02,014
SPEAKER_1:  That was fun. That was a really fun video.

01:23:02,402 --> 01:23:02,910
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

01:23:03,714 --> 01:23:07,089
SPEAKER_1:  There's a lot of things I can comment about that, but what was the hardest part?

01:23:07,089 --> 01:23:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  part of making that video.

01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  The hardest part was just getting out there. It's just so remote.

01:23:13,634 --> 01:23:21,694
SPEAKER_0:  and you know, you land the plane on just this ice runway and it's so sketchy. And then once the plane takes off, you're just there.

01:23:22,018 --> 01:23:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  You're the most remote place on the planet.

01:23:24,290 --> 01:23:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:23:25,506 --> 01:23:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  It's just very breathtaking. I don't-

01:23:28,738 --> 01:23:32,190
SPEAKER_0:  If you have the chance to ever go to Antarctica, I would recommend it.

01:23:32,706 --> 01:23:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  Probably like the, in the video we climbed a mountain that wasn't named so we can name it.

01:23:37,154 --> 01:23:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  and like standing on top of that mountain and just seeing.

01:23:39,778 --> 01:23:41,822
SPEAKER_0:  I'm telling nothing. Cause once you.

01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:46,494
SPEAKER_0:  get outside the outskirts and you get deep in Antarctica, there's no penguins, nothing lives there at all.

01:23:46,882 --> 01:23:54,366
SPEAKER_0:  And so there's just nothing in every direction. It's just snow and these crazy, beautiful mountains and some of them stick into the clouds and...

01:23:54,594 --> 01:24:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  If you go during summertime, the sun never goes down. So the sun's up 24 seven and it's just like spinning in circles at the top of the planet or whatever. It looks like the top.

01:24:03,682 --> 01:24:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, you guys commented several times how beautiful it was. Yeah, and so it's just, yeah, it was just very...

01:24:08,706 --> 01:24:11,614
SPEAKER_1:  What about shooting itself, like the technical aspects of shooting it?

01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, well, so.

01:24:13,666 --> 01:24:23,934
SPEAKER_0:  But somehow we lucked out one of the days was like the warmest day in like forever that's been in Antarctica. It was like, it was positive degrees, but at certain parts it was also like negative 20, negative 30.

01:24:24,162 --> 01:24:32,190
SPEAKER_0:  And that's where the cameras, you constantly have to be switching out the batteries and heating them up and like putting them basically in like your pants or they'll just get way too cold.

01:24:32,482 --> 01:24:33,182
SPEAKER_0:  And uh...

01:24:33,538 --> 01:24:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  We were prepared for much worse, but it ended up being much better than we thought.

01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:46,462
SPEAKER_1:  So for that video, but in general, maybe some other challenging videos, how do you go from the idea stage to the actual execution to the final video? Can you take me through like a full process of?

01:24:46,882 --> 01:24:50,878
SPEAKER_1:  Of course, we're talking about some crazy wild ideas today. How do you go from that?

01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:52,990
SPEAKER_1:  to a final video where you click publish.

01:24:53,186 --> 01:25:00,542
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I mean, obviously first things first, you gotta figure out the idea and then it just depends. I mean, pick any video you can think of on my channel. I can take you through it.

01:25:01,954 --> 01:25:02,750
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhh...

01:25:03,522 --> 01:25:08,931
SPEAKER_1:  Well, what about the, in a circle, you have to stay in a circle for 100 days.

01:25:08,931 --> 01:25:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, so for that one step one one of the most popular. Yeah, that video did really well. Yeah, so we

01:25:15,426 --> 01:25:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:25:16,482 --> 01:25:18,142
SPEAKER_0:  Promise, we have to...

01:25:18,370 --> 01:25:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  This is where you get really into the nuances of the company.

01:25:21,538 --> 01:25:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  We have a lot of videos going out. You can't just in a vacuum be like, all right, we're not doing anything for 100 days, we're only filming this. So step one is we had to build an independent crew that could actually do that for 100 days. That way everyone else could keep working on the normal videos and not just screw everything up. I had to, um.

01:25:35,458 --> 01:25:39,518
SPEAKER_0:  So step one, you build that team. Okay, we got the team. Now what do we need?

01:25:39,778 --> 01:25:40,126
SPEAKER_0:  Well...

01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  to do this, we need probably like.

01:25:42,722 --> 01:25:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  10 cameras at least rolling at all times. So.

01:25:45,410 --> 01:25:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  We're probably going to need to get a trailer and hook up a bunch of storage and stuff to

01:25:50,018 --> 01:25:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  just carry out the sheer volume of footage we're gonna have. so

01:25:52,994 --> 01:25:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  get a trailer, set up the cameras.

01:25:55,106 --> 01:25:59,422
SPEAKER_0:  go out in the field, paint a circle, now we need a house, go buy a house, bring it out there.

01:25:59,650 --> 01:26:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  And then it's like, oh wait

01:26:01,122 --> 01:26:08,839
SPEAKER_0:  I think it'd be funny if I brought the house in on the intro, but you know, find a crane that can lift up a house so I can drive it in and drop it in the intro. And that's like an iterative.

01:26:08,839 --> 01:26:12,589
SPEAKER_1:  process where you're like okay this will be funnier so this is not all up front these reunion

01:26:12,589 --> 01:26:17,438
SPEAKER_0:  Ideally it would be, but as you kind of see things you get inspired and then you think of more and more

01:26:17,762 --> 01:26:18,887
SPEAKER_0:  uh... and as a bit better

01:26:18,887 --> 01:26:19,550
SPEAKER_1:  with a crane.

01:26:19,682 --> 01:26:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:26:20,258 --> 01:26:21,383
SPEAKER_0:  It'd be better if I dropped out of that.

01:26:21,383 --> 01:26:22,462
SPEAKER_1:  the house. Yeah.

01:26:23,042 --> 01:26:24,862
SPEAKER_1:  That was crazy that you decided to do that.

01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:28,254
SPEAKER_1:  So fearless in the kind of crazy stuff you're willing to do.

01:26:28,450 --> 01:26:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  Exactly. I'm a broken record, but whatever makes the best video possible. Yeah. That's, that's all you, you focus on.

01:26:34,914 --> 01:26:36,446
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so...

01:26:36,962 --> 01:26:39,102
SPEAKER_1:  What about the delegation of like who gets to...

01:26:39,490 --> 01:26:42,526
SPEAKER_1:  What are the camera man, like the people operating the cameras, what uh...

01:26:42,882 --> 01:26:44,318
SPEAKER_1:  who's responsible for different things.

01:26:44,546 --> 01:26:45,671
SPEAKER_1:  This is like a distributed pro-

01:26:45,671 --> 01:26:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  Well that's where whoever the lead cam would be on that video would just decide it. We got one because we shot over 100 days.

01:26:52,130 --> 01:27:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of it was just Sean, the guy who was in the circle, just vlogging, I mean, just getting my camera and he figured it out and then we'd have like, for him, just set hours each day that a cameraman would come, so if he had any content, he needed extra hands instead of just having someone on standby 24-7.

01:27:06,402 --> 01:27:08,798
SPEAKER_0:  It made more sense to do set hours. Pick up the phone and click the red button to check these qualities with your SM<|id|><|translate|> There's a lot going on between us now, on social media

01:27:09,186 --> 01:27:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

01:27:10,338 --> 01:27:11,070
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

01:27:11,522 --> 01:27:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  It was hard, but explaining it in hindsight sounds so simple, you know?

01:27:16,098 --> 01:27:17,223
SPEAKER_0:  And I guess like the mo-

01:27:17,223 --> 01:27:17,662
SPEAKER_1:  more.

01:27:18,018 --> 01:27:21,393
SPEAKER_1:  Cause that one is relatively simple, I guess, because it's a low number.

01:27:21,393 --> 01:27:23,550
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, the hard part about that is just the time.

01:27:23,778 --> 01:27:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  Like, you know, I checked in on him so many different days and.

01:27:26,626 --> 01:27:29,182
SPEAKER_0:  It's like an hour here, two hours there, three hours there.

01:27:29,634 --> 01:27:32,062
SPEAKER_0:  over 100 days adds up to be a ton of time.

01:27:33,090 --> 01:27:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  And even then, like, you know, if you have a...

01:27:35,298 --> 01:27:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  10 person crew, you know, paying them daily rates for 100 days, it just all of it adds up.

01:27:40,066 --> 01:27:42,814
SPEAKER_1:  What about like the 100 vs 100? 100 uh...

01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:45,214
SPEAKER_1:  adults versus other kids.

01:27:45,986 --> 01:27:47,134
SPEAKER_1:  What was that? What was...

01:27:47,490 --> 01:27:50,238
SPEAKER_1:  uh... bring that to life that's a section challenging

01:27:50,434 --> 01:27:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, basically the thought process was we did 100 kids versus, or sorry, 100 boys versus 100 girls. Yeah. I loved it. Honestly, I didn't think they'd like it as much as they did.

01:27:57,730 --> 01:27:59,006
SPEAKER_0:  Video did really, really well.

01:27:59,266 --> 01:28:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  So the second I saw that video was crushing, I was like, all right.

01:28:01,698 --> 01:28:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  doing it again.

01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:14,046
SPEAKER_0:  But last time we did it, we did it in our studio. So we built a giant room, put 100 girls in it. Sounds bad when I explain it like this. And then a giant room, put 100 boys. And we're like, after 100 hours, whichever room has the most people, give them half a million dollars.

01:28:14,434 --> 01:28:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  So did well, so we're like, all right, we're gonna do it again.

01:28:17,122 --> 01:28:19,326
SPEAKER_0:  So we threw out all these different ideas. It was like...

01:28:19,618 --> 01:28:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  100 football players versus 100 cheerleaders, 100 this, 100 that.

01:28:22,882 --> 01:28:28,798
SPEAKER_0:  100 prisoners versus 100 cops, just craziest ideas. We settled on 100 kids versus 100 adults.

01:28:29,186 --> 01:28:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:28:29,890 --> 01:28:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  and then...

01:28:30,914 --> 01:28:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  The next step was like, how do we make it better? The kids versus adults, or the, sorry, boys versus girls, the first one we did was inside.

01:28:38,018 --> 01:28:42,302
SPEAKER_0:  The problem was every time it was night when we did these long time lapses, you couldn't see the sun go up and down.

01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:45,534
SPEAKER_0:  So we're like, okay, this time I want to do it outside. That's why the cubes are outside.

01:28:45,762 --> 01:28:48,734
SPEAKER_0:  And instead of doing circles, we want to make them cubes.

01:28:48,962 --> 01:28:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  And then.

01:28:49,922 --> 01:28:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  you know, is figure out do we want the

01:28:51,970 --> 01:28:52,670
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, just...

01:28:52,930 --> 01:28:57,805
SPEAKER_1:  Those videos came up at least today as ones that are like really complicated in terms of the audio in terms of how

01:28:57,805 --> 01:29:01,278
SPEAKER_0:  how to film it. Yeah that's the problem. We had a lot of audio issues because

01:29:01,698 --> 01:29:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  And the first one we didn't have a roof on it. The second one, there was a roof, so there's a lot of reverb.

01:29:06,498 --> 01:29:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  which then in editing made it brutal like

01:29:09,026 --> 01:29:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  half the shots weren't usable and it really screwed us over. So we had to do a lot of Frankensteining the editing to make up for it.

01:29:14,754 --> 01:29:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  Basically by ignorance.

01:29:16,162 --> 01:29:19,326
SPEAKER_1:  So you mentioned that you were surprised how well that one did.

01:29:20,002 --> 01:29:21,310
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of creators...

01:29:21,634 --> 01:29:23,262
SPEAKER_1:  Talk about getting depressed.

01:29:24,162 --> 01:29:25,022
SPEAKER_1:  when uh...

01:29:25,986 --> 01:29:29,182
SPEAKER_1:  the videos don't do as well as they kind of expected. There's a kind of feeling.

01:29:29,890 --> 01:29:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  You can get really worn out by that.

01:29:32,930 --> 01:29:35,230
SPEAKER_1:  Do you yourself feel that?

01:29:35,490 --> 01:29:37,278
SPEAKER_1:  and also give advice for others that.

01:29:37,602 --> 01:29:38,078
SPEAKER_1:  Feel this.

01:29:38,434 --> 01:29:38,814
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:29:39,394 --> 01:29:41,886
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it's weird because I am a numbers guy, but also.

01:29:42,306 --> 01:29:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  It used to.

01:29:43,586 --> 01:29:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  It used to very much, especially when I was like betting.

01:29:47,202 --> 01:29:49,246
SPEAKER_0:  everything I had on a video when it did bad.

01:29:49,602 --> 01:29:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  I was devastated, man. I'd cry and I'd be depressed for days.

01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:55,582
SPEAKER_0:  It really would have a severe impact on my mood, but.

01:29:56,002 --> 01:29:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, now it doesn't really matter. It's a-

01:29:58,530 --> 01:29:59,422
SPEAKER_0:  look for video displays.

01:29:59,746 --> 01:30:01,822
SPEAKER_0:  look at it and I'm like, oh, why'd this video do that?

01:30:02,178 --> 01:30:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  Probably, oh, there's a little retention dip there.

01:30:05,218 --> 01:30:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think people like the thumbnail, maybe we should switch it. I just look at it objectively, unemotional, and then just move on. And I feel like that's a much healthier way of going about it.

01:30:13,730 --> 01:30:16,350
SPEAKER_0:  If a creator is listening, like that is the ideal way.

01:30:16,642 --> 01:30:17,022
SPEAKER_0:  to.

01:30:17,282 --> 01:30:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

01:30:18,178 --> 01:30:19,678
SPEAKER_0:  respond to a video that's doing bad.

01:30:20,386 --> 01:30:24,181
SPEAKER_0:  remove a motion from the equation and just look at it and figure out how you can improve the next one.

01:30:24,181 --> 01:30:27,422
SPEAKER_1:  Is there tricks to being able to detach yourself from the?

01:30:28,034 --> 01:30:29,159
SPEAKER_1:  from that because...

01:30:29,159 --> 01:30:29,909
SPEAKER_0:  Because I can

01:30:29,909 --> 01:30:32,510
SPEAKER_1:  In your case, I mean that's true for creators, but in your case...

01:30:33,410 --> 01:30:35,285
SPEAKER_1:  This is like a lot of money on the line.

01:30:35,285 --> 01:30:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, well, this video cost my life. Yeah, so much time, but.

01:30:38,882 --> 01:30:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  No, I mean, you just...

01:30:40,482 --> 01:30:44,478
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I don't know, the only real answer is it's just a conscious effort. You just have to unemotionally.

01:30:44,802 --> 01:30:47,582
SPEAKER_0:  We'll get the video, determine the problems, and then move on.

01:30:47,810 --> 01:30:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  There is no secret, you know what I mean? It's just-

01:30:50,242 --> 01:30:55,454
SPEAKER_0:  That's it's that and if you really can't bring yourself to do it, then you're just screwed. Honestly, maybe you're not meant for this game.

01:30:56,706 --> 01:31:00,081
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so that's part of the development as a creator is like being able to be

01:31:00,081 --> 01:31:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  longevity. Yes, yeah. You have to unemotionally be able to...

01:31:03,298 --> 01:31:09,374
SPEAKER_0:  look at videos that flop and figure it out. Because if not, just can't, and not every video can be a one out of ten.

01:31:09,634 --> 01:31:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  So when a video does bad.

01:31:11,266 --> 01:31:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  you know, that just stress and depression, it's just going to eventually get to you in the long run.

01:31:15,874 --> 01:31:18,270
SPEAKER_1:  So you said you've failed in a bunch of videos.

01:31:19,042 --> 01:31:19,774
SPEAKER_1:  So

01:31:20,290 --> 01:31:22,654
SPEAKER_1:  taking them to completion. So what are some of the-

01:31:23,106 --> 01:31:23,838
SPEAKER_1:  biggest fails.

01:31:24,322 --> 01:31:31,006
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, weirdly enough, as we've matured and we've done this more, we don't have that problem as much, especially now that we're getting some multi-million dollar budgets per video.

01:31:31,362 --> 01:31:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  It's like, failure's not really an option anymore. So I'm a little more particular about what I do, but back in the day...

01:31:37,826 --> 01:31:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, like we would do a video where we spent 24 hours on a deserted island.

01:31:41,858 --> 01:31:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  and we filmed it, did it all and...

01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  I just.

01:31:44,994 --> 01:31:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't like it after the edit, so I just grabbed the voice and we went back to the deserted island and spent another 24 hours there and refilmed it.

01:31:51,778 --> 01:31:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  Oh.

01:31:52,674 --> 01:31:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  Or uh... Could that have been caught?

01:31:55,106 --> 01:31:57,406
SPEAKER_1:  and prevent it at the idea stage.

01:31:57,538 --> 01:32:01,534
SPEAKER_0:  No, it's a good idea. It was just poor execution. To be honest, when we were out there it was hot.

01:32:01,826 --> 01:32:05,635
SPEAKER_0:  We're just like, we all at one point just kind of wanted to die. It was just miserable.

01:32:05,635 --> 01:32:06,385
SPEAKER_1:  Hario

01:32:06,385 --> 01:32:14,345
SPEAKER_0:  avoid that these days. Well, I just went with what is a little cooler, to be honest. And then we had, literally, the amount of fun we had in the video was like 10 times higher.

01:32:14,345 --> 01:32:14,750
SPEAKER_1:  interesting.

01:32:15,138 --> 01:32:17,763
SPEAKER_1:  So you like there's some practical details that you just learned. Yeah.

01:32:17,763 --> 01:32:20,606
SPEAKER_0:  I don't- videos that where it's very hot.

01:32:20,962 --> 01:32:24,670
SPEAKER_0:  or it's on water, because I get super seasick. It's like a, kinda like.

01:32:25,090 --> 01:32:25,982
SPEAKER_0:  10 things that

01:32:26,274 --> 01:32:27,550
SPEAKER_0:  If they have these variables.

01:32:28,002 --> 01:32:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  I'm down to do it.

01:32:29,986 --> 01:32:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  My fun meter is.

01:32:31,746 --> 01:32:35,614
SPEAKER_0:  not as high as normal. Uh, like we tried to sp, um,

01:32:36,066 --> 01:32:40,030
SPEAKER_0:  Anytime we do anything on a boat, like when we spent 24 hours in a beer meter triangle.

01:32:40,258 --> 01:32:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  Or when I tried to spend like, which it didn't get upload, but I tried to spend like a hundred hours at sea or whatever, just like on a raft.

01:32:45,794 --> 01:32:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  It just like, it makes me want to throw up and I get so seasick I came in sea straight.

01:32:50,210 --> 01:32:53,950
SPEAKER_0:  But there are just some videos that require me to be on a boat. So just second up.

01:32:54,466 --> 01:32:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  Oh.

01:32:55,170 --> 01:32:57,310
SPEAKER_1:  to when you spend months in creating a video.

01:32:57,570 --> 01:32:59,806
SPEAKER_1:  I know this is probably stressful to some creators.

01:33:00,514 --> 01:33:00,894
SPEAKER_1:  uh

01:33:01,186 --> 01:33:02,622
SPEAKER_1:  Like how much stress?

01:33:02,882 --> 01:33:04,702
SPEAKER_1:  How do you feel when you have to click publish?

01:33:05,218 --> 01:33:07,495
SPEAKER_1:  video now not much here

01:33:07,495 --> 01:33:09,374
SPEAKER_0:  to detach yourself. Yeah.

01:33:09,954 --> 01:33:11,422
SPEAKER_0:  Again, and old me.

01:33:11,714 --> 01:33:13,150
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I'd be like...

01:33:13,538 --> 01:33:18,462
SPEAKER_0:  scratching and nervous and like my hands will be sweating like to the point where I'm almost about to puke I'm like

01:33:18,786 --> 01:33:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  I really hope people like this, but.

01:33:20,642 --> 01:33:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

01:33:21,602 --> 01:33:25,982
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, I think that's just part of maturing it. There's different, as a content creator, there's different phases and-

01:33:26,338 --> 01:33:26,686
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

01:33:27,106 --> 01:33:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  You just like, once you...

01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:38,270
SPEAKER_0:  Get over the fear that you're just gonna wake up one day and be irrelevant, you know, and you just, you know, accept that, like, you believe in yourself, you believe in your content, and that you can continue to be relevant.

01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  then you don't.

01:33:39,490 --> 01:33:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, you kind of, it's a little bit easier to attach yourself, I guess.

01:33:43,330 --> 01:33:47,422
SPEAKER_0:  And that's, it's a much healthier place to be. You can't do this for 10 years of every little-

01:33:47,682 --> 01:33:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  thing just.

01:33:48,546 --> 01:33:50,846
SPEAKER_0:  causes these huge emotional reactions. It's like-

01:33:51,074 --> 01:33:52,254
SPEAKER_0:  That's why I love it.

01:33:52,674 --> 01:33:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  creators go a little mentally insane.

01:33:55,298 --> 01:33:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  You have to get out of that game.

01:33:57,922 --> 01:33:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  because it really messes with you.

01:33:59,458 --> 01:34:00,958
SPEAKER_1:  We've talked about this a little bit, but...

01:34:01,314 --> 01:34:04,830
SPEAKER_1:  How do you define and how do you suggest others define success?

01:34:05,698 --> 01:34:06,823
SPEAKER_1:  I need you.

01:34:06,823 --> 01:34:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  Some people's success is retiring their mom.

01:34:11,138 --> 01:34:17,310
SPEAKER_0:  Literally, you know, for you, success is inspiring people and educating them and, you know, whatever, people seeing this, peak in their curiosity.

01:34:17,602 --> 01:34:18,174
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, um...

01:34:18,594 --> 01:34:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  For other people, it's just quitting their job.

01:34:20,706 --> 01:34:24,734
SPEAKER_1:  So you have to self-reflect on what your definition of success is. Because I think a lot of creators kind of...

01:34:25,442 --> 01:34:26,430
SPEAKER_1:  don't really think.

01:34:26,658 --> 01:34:27,070
SPEAKER_1:  Think.

01:34:27,522 --> 01:34:28,510
SPEAKER_1:  Don't introspect.

01:34:29,538 --> 01:34:29,982
SPEAKER_1:  Like...

01:34:30,466 --> 01:34:33,374
SPEAKER_1:  They kind of want to keep getting more and more subscribers kind of thing.

01:34:34,274 --> 01:34:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  But subscribers is just a vanity metric, you know?

01:34:37,314 --> 01:34:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  It doesn't.

01:34:38,082 --> 01:34:40,030
SPEAKER_0:  Subscribers don't correlate to views.

01:34:41,026 --> 01:34:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  Sure, or views. Yeah, I know, but that was more directed to you. That was more directed to people listening, because a lot of people do really care about subscribers or even followers, like on TikTok. But if you look...

01:34:50,722 --> 01:34:51,070
SPEAKER_0:  Thank you.

01:34:51,778 --> 01:34:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  Your view, on YouTube, very, very few percent.

01:34:55,362 --> 01:34:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  even a percent of your views come from the subfeed.

01:34:57,826 --> 01:35:02,334
SPEAKER_0:  They're almost all home feeders suggested. When's the last time you clicked on your sub feed to watch a video?

01:35:02,786 --> 01:35:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, almost never, yeah. Yeah, maybe five years ago. It used to be a thing. It's not anymore..

01:35:07,074 --> 01:35:09,699
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and it's getting harder and harder to find.

01:35:09,699 --> 01:35:11,199
SPEAKER_1:  to way too many channels I think.

01:35:11,199 --> 01:35:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, that's what everyone does. And you subscribe to 10 channels, they're great, but two years later, your taste evolves and it's a mess. And so.

01:35:18,114 --> 01:35:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:35:19,266 --> 01:35:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  Subscribers don't really matter.

01:35:21,218 --> 01:35:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  followers on TikTok don't really matter.

01:35:23,074 --> 01:35:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:35:24,290 --> 01:35:25,214
SPEAKER_0:  So anyways.

01:35:25,890 --> 01:35:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  They really are the definition of a vanity metric. But what about views?

01:35:30,498 --> 01:35:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  They do, obviously, because if people are showing up time and time again, that's what matters.

01:35:34,178 --> 01:35:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

01:35:34,754 --> 01:35:35,326
SPEAKER_1:  So that.

01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:40,286
SPEAKER_1:  That's a good thing to define a success. I just feel like.

01:35:41,058 --> 01:35:42,590
SPEAKER_1:  that too can be a problem.

01:35:43,330 --> 01:35:44,030
SPEAKER_1:  Cause, uh.

01:35:45,986 --> 01:35:46,942
SPEAKER_1:  I would say.

01:35:47,522 --> 01:35:58,334
SPEAKER_1:  You know, if I wanted to be successful, like as a young creator, I might start copying Mr. Beast or something like that, right? Like there's, you start trying to take shortcuts as opposed to find your own unique voice.

01:35:58,754 --> 01:35:59,070
SPEAKER_1:  Bye.

01:35:59,586 --> 01:36:02,942
SPEAKER_1:  So like chasing views is a problem too, it feels like.

01:36:03,490 --> 01:36:03,934
SPEAKER_1:  or no.

01:36:04,418 --> 01:36:06,293
SPEAKER_1:  Um, it's as long as you detach yourself.

01:36:06,293 --> 01:36:06,814
SPEAKER_0:  I mean...

01:36:07,106 --> 01:36:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  If you had the-

01:36:08,642 --> 01:36:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  sounds like you're lazy and you just want to copy someone else and not experiment and find your own way.

01:36:13,986 --> 01:36:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  But, I mean, you can't make that excuse for them. If someone just-

01:36:18,210 --> 01:36:24,926
SPEAKER_0:  isn't coming up with original stuff and putting in the effort. You can't just say, oh, it's because they're chasing views. We need some different metric for them to chase. No, they just need a.

01:36:25,154 --> 01:36:26,279
SPEAKER_0:  find their own way.

01:36:26,279 --> 01:36:28,222
SPEAKER_1:  It just feels like unique type of content.

01:36:28,738 --> 01:36:32,318
SPEAKER_1:  will often lead to sacrifice in the number of views in the short term.

01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  By the long term, you win.

01:36:36,546 --> 01:36:38,590
SPEAKER_0:  Or if you do win, you win more.

01:36:38,722 --> 01:36:39,934
SPEAKER_1:  I guess would be a better way of putting it.

01:36:41,218 --> 01:36:42,878
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think you will IPO miss-

01:36:43,234 --> 01:36:46,238
SPEAKER_1:  Mr. B's burger or feastables in the next 5, 10 years.

01:36:46,658 --> 01:36:48,958
SPEAKER_0:  Beast burger or Feastables? No, I kind of think...

01:36:50,274 --> 01:36:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  Actually, you know what? I just realized this is our first time talking about those.

01:36:54,786 --> 01:36:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  We're like an hour and a half in, that's so funny.

01:36:56,706 --> 01:36:58,581
SPEAKER_1:  We started talking about what...

01:36:58,581 --> 01:37:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, my retention brain kicked in.

01:37:03,522 --> 01:37:05,397
SPEAKER_1:  I wonder if you have retention brain for like la-

01:37:05,397 --> 01:37:06,078
SPEAKER_0:  itself.

01:37:06,626 --> 01:37:10,581
SPEAKER_0:  I do every time I'm talking to someone I can I'm like, okay

01:37:10,581 --> 01:37:11,230
SPEAKER_1:  loved ones.

01:37:11,682 --> 01:37:11,998
SPEAKER_1:  Like.

01:37:12,546 --> 01:37:16,350
SPEAKER_1:  spending time with Lava thinking like, we could be doing something much better right now.

01:37:16,546 --> 01:37:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, no, that is a serious problem.

01:37:19,426 --> 01:37:25,150
SPEAKER_0:  with... well, so we'll pause the vSpr question, yes, but that's why my current girlfriend...

01:37:25,474 --> 01:37:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  uh... which i was telling you before when we were talking about this is

01:37:28,418 --> 01:37:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  She has a genuine love for learning. And that's something I have. Like I always feel like I need to be learning something to justify.

01:37:34,402 --> 01:37:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  the time I'm spending. And so that's why it's such a nice trait because

01:37:39,426 --> 01:37:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  feel like the time is being used optimally, because whether we're watching a documentary or we're going and you know...

01:37:45,058 --> 01:37:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  taking IQ tests or reading about whatever, just why modern art is a thing, I don't know, whatever weird thing we decide to do. I'm always learning and improving, so it justifies the time.

01:37:54,498 --> 01:37:56,734
SPEAKER_1:  to maximize retention in your relationship.

01:37:57,538 --> 01:38:00,163
SPEAKER_1:  You want to spend that time learning as much as possible.

01:38:00,163 --> 01:38:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, which...

01:38:01,858 --> 01:38:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  Conveniently, I don't have to force, right? Or I want to be recharging. So when I do work, I can hit the ground harder. And luckily, we're into a lot of the same things, which

01:38:11,618 --> 01:38:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  you know, having to be learning, sometimes it's not learning, like maybe watching an anime or something like that.

01:38:15,778 --> 01:38:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  Oh.

01:38:16,738 --> 01:38:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  I'm a big believer in your either.

01:38:18,850 --> 01:38:19,582
SPEAKER_0:  If you will.

01:38:20,226 --> 01:38:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  If your goal is to be like a super successful entrepreneur, you need to either be working,

01:38:24,770 --> 01:38:26,110
SPEAKER_0:  or you need to be doing something that.

01:38:26,434 --> 01:38:30,334
SPEAKER_0:  decompresses and recharges you so you can work again. If your goal is to be like a really-

01:38:30,690 --> 01:38:32,286
SPEAKER_0:  Kickass opportunity. To r pendant

01:38:32,578 --> 01:38:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  boring this down to like a very basic thing. And so

01:38:35,650 --> 01:38:37,310
SPEAKER_0:  the things you're doing and you're doubtful.

01:38:37,826 --> 01:38:40,670
SPEAKER_0:  time when you're not working if it doesn't recharge you, you're screwed.

01:38:41,218 --> 01:38:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  You're just a ticking time bomb waiting to implode.

01:38:43,970 --> 01:38:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and so.

01:38:45,218 --> 01:38:45,790
SPEAKER_0:  You gotta like.

01:38:46,210 --> 01:38:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  heavily recharged and like, so like.

01:38:48,450 --> 01:38:52,254
SPEAKER_0:  watching for me anime or whatever it is playing a board game.

01:38:52,962 --> 01:38:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  that is actually kind of crucial to my success, which...

01:38:56,162 --> 01:38:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  It takes a lot of maturing to...

01:38:58,018 --> 01:39:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  to that conclusion because I used to be the kind of guy that wanted to work.

01:39:01,538 --> 01:39:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  every hour of the day.

01:39:03,138 --> 01:39:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  tried to train myself to not need that stuff and I, you know, and I

01:39:07,586 --> 01:39:15,390
SPEAKER_0:  almost resented like that. I have to do these kinds of things and it would piss me off because it's not optimal. And you know, I just really want to make content to entertain people.

01:39:15,842 --> 01:39:16,190
SPEAKER_0:  but.

01:39:16,898 --> 01:39:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  As someone who's gone down that road and you just work every day for two, three months straight and every hour of the day and then you just bomb waiting to explode and lose your mind.

01:39:26,626 --> 01:39:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  And the only real sustainable thing is to just like.

01:39:29,794 --> 01:39:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  Give yourself time to recharge in between working.

01:39:32,578 --> 01:39:34,453
SPEAKER_1:  So there's a kind of balance you have to.

01:39:34,453 --> 01:39:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  to find. You have to. I hate it more than anyone else.

01:39:39,490 --> 01:39:40,446
SPEAKER_0:  You hate not working.

01:39:40,866 --> 01:39:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, because it's just not optimal for time. Like it's, it's, it's.

01:39:45,410 --> 01:39:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  as a human.

01:39:46,370 --> 01:39:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  I do need to occasionally watch a mindless show and play a board game.

01:39:51,074 --> 01:39:54,878
SPEAKER_0:  And it took me a very long time to like come to peace with that and not.

01:39:55,458 --> 01:39:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  I would have like.

01:39:56,546 --> 01:39:58,974
SPEAKER_0:  borderline panic attacks when I do it because I just...

01:39:59,362 --> 01:40:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  What am I doing right now? Why am I doing this? I should be, you know, like.

01:40:03,234 --> 01:40:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  What if one day I have to lay off an employee because we're not doing so well? How could I justify watching this show or whatever I'm doing right now? There's a lot of things like that that go on in your head, but...

01:40:13,474 --> 01:40:14,142
SPEAKER_0:  That's sir.

01:40:14,338 --> 01:40:16,862
SPEAKER_1:  before we return to Mr. Beast Burger.

01:40:17,762 --> 01:40:19,966
SPEAKER_1:  Well, what is like a-

01:40:20,322 --> 01:40:22,014
SPEAKER_1:  Since we're on the topic, what is the.

01:40:22,402 --> 01:40:25,438
SPEAKER_1:  Perfect day in the life, perfectly productive day in the life of MrBeastLookLike.

01:40:26,562 --> 01:40:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  Oh boy. Well, I mean. Or like a standard. I mean, the perfectly productive day as we film a main channel video.

01:40:31,714 --> 01:40:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  because those

01:40:32,866 --> 01:40:35,806
SPEAKER_0:  get 100 million to pop, I mean, it doesn't really get any better than that.

01:40:36,578 --> 01:40:39,326
SPEAKER_1:  What about like the average day when you're not on the set?

01:40:39,586 --> 01:40:40,286
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:40:40,578 --> 01:40:42,453
SPEAKER_1:  Like, because you're running a lot of

01:40:42,453 --> 01:40:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  things right yeah so right now we have

01:40:44,418 --> 01:40:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  our snack brand Feastables, we have a Russian chain feast burger.

01:40:47,362 --> 01:40:55,710
SPEAKER_0:  And then we basically, which we haven't even really launched any products yet, but we have the data company that I was showing you where we're going to roll out some tools for creators.

01:40:56,066 --> 01:41:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  And then we have the REACT channel, the gaming channel, the main channel, and then we have my charity, which also has a channel.

01:41:01,154 --> 01:41:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:41:02,082 --> 01:41:02,590
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

01:41:02,978 --> 01:41:03,358
SPEAKER_0:  Kinda.

01:41:03,618 --> 01:41:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  Wow, I've structured my life right now.

01:41:06,050 --> 01:41:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:41:07,010 --> 01:41:09,854
SPEAKER_0:  is whenever I have free time, we just kind of go, Hey guys.

01:41:10,178 --> 01:41:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  Jimmy's got an hour.

01:41:11,586 --> 01:41:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  From 2 p.m. to...

01:41:12,898 --> 01:41:21,214
SPEAKER_0:  3pm and everyone's just like, I need this, I need this. And this channel's like, I need this thing filmed or, you know, whatever, the guy who runs my TikTok's like, I need this TikTok filmed or...

01:41:21,570 --> 01:41:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  You know, Beast Burger's like, I need this menu item approved. Do we need to talk about this marketing thing? And then we kind of just look at-

01:41:26,626 --> 01:41:27,806
SPEAKER_0:  what everyone needs and we're like.

01:41:28,162 --> 01:41:30,782
SPEAKER_0:  That one looks like the most important, we'll do that. And then, so.

01:41:31,426 --> 01:41:32,286
SPEAKER_0:  It's just kind of like.

01:41:32,706 --> 01:41:39,934
SPEAKER_0:  You know, if I just did that for every company in a day, then that's optimal. If I just kind of like an optimal day for me would be going down the eight companies and just.

01:41:40,194 --> 01:41:44,839
SPEAKER_0:  whatever their like two to three biggest pain points or things they need from me and just doing those.ветов Marsha

01:41:44,839 --> 01:41:49,287
SPEAKER_1:  priority and then try to keep it as short as possible. Yeah. To just the things that you.

01:41:49,287 --> 01:41:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  needed on it doesn't get more often than that if I clear the bottlenecks or some bottlenecks for all my companies then

01:41:55,298 --> 01:41:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  It's...

01:41:56,066 --> 01:41:57,406
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, that's a perfect day.

01:41:57,826 --> 01:41:59,646
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean, even just me, because you're like...

01:42:00,194 --> 01:42:03,454
SPEAKER_1:  You show me around and you're being a great and gracious host.

01:42:03,810 --> 01:42:06,435
SPEAKER_1:  But on top of that, you're just doing all these meetings. technician.

01:42:06,435 --> 01:42:11,953
SPEAKER_0:  I felt bad at some point. I was like, oh, I just tricked him into going to meetings with me. He's like my little meeting buddy.

01:42:11,953 --> 01:42:12,350
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:42:12,610 --> 01:42:16,190
SPEAKER_1:  I guess it was fun. It was fun to see it. It was fun to see how

01:42:16,802 --> 01:42:18,910
SPEAKER_1:  effectively you've delegated.

01:42:19,586 --> 01:42:25,374
SPEAKER_1:  You basically trust the team to do a really good job on the various things and there's just a strong team that's able to...

01:42:26,434 --> 01:42:28,094
SPEAKER_1:  carry the five on all the different tasks.

01:42:28,418 --> 01:42:31,390
SPEAKER_1:  From the brainstorming in the main channel to the reacts and so on.

01:42:32,002 --> 01:42:33,534
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's really interesting. I mean, it's.

01:42:33,794 --> 01:42:40,126
SPEAKER_1:  It's really interesting what it takes to build a team like that, because you very quickly build a very large team that's able to scale.

01:42:40,258 --> 01:42:42,302
SPEAKER_0:  which is very scary because this is my first

01:42:42,754 --> 01:42:43,166
SPEAKER_0:  you know

01:42:43,426 --> 01:42:44,062
SPEAKER_0:  R- uh-

01:42:44,290 --> 01:42:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  I'm 24, you know, and I think I was telling you this earlier.

01:42:47,170 --> 01:42:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  It's funny because six years ago I had to raise my hand to use the bathroom, and now I'm in charge of hundreds of people.

01:42:51,906 --> 01:42:52,638
SPEAKER_0:  and entertain.

01:42:52,962 --> 01:42:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  hundreds of millions of people.

01:42:54,178 --> 01:42:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  And so it is crazy just how quick it comes up.

01:42:57,890 --> 01:42:59,326
SPEAKER_0:  I wish I was a-

01:42:59,810 --> 01:43:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  little bit older so I could

01:43:01,538 --> 01:43:07,262
SPEAKER_0:  have ran a couple of companies and failed a few companies in the past and like learn from those and apply those here. Cause I know for a fact.

01:43:07,810 --> 01:43:09,918
SPEAKER_0:  When I'm 34, I'm 24 now, when I'm 34.

01:43:10,530 --> 01:43:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  I'll know so much more about running a business and scaling and hiring and, and how to lead people and better effectively communicate and all these different skillsets that will make me a better leader.

01:43:18,626 --> 01:43:19,294
SPEAKER_0:  That, uh...

01:43:19,970 --> 01:43:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  That's the only thing that sucks is I just don't have those because I just haven't been through the lessons and

01:43:25,282 --> 01:43:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  I just have such a lucrative thing.

01:43:27,458 --> 01:43:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  on my plate right now and it just sucks that I have to learn the lessons of the lucrative thing you know I mean

01:43:31,746 --> 01:43:35,198
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, because you already have so much influence, so much impact.

01:43:36,354 --> 01:43:41,950
SPEAKER_1:  You have effectively scaled what what what lessons do you draw from that how to effectively scale as a 24 year old.

01:43:42,434 --> 01:43:53,950
SPEAKER_0:  Like you. Yeah, that's something I feel like I actually could give a lot of value to, to young people who are doing it. Like older people who've built five companies or whatever they do. Um, I probably couldn't, you know, they're going to be like, Oh, this is so obvious, but.

01:43:54,306 --> 01:43:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:43:55,330 --> 01:43:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  nu damn it

01:43:56,066 --> 01:43:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  uh, younger first time business owners.

01:43:58,818 --> 01:43:59,422
SPEAKER_0:  You got it.

01:43:59,810 --> 01:44:05,726
SPEAKER_0:  just experiment to be honest. And for us, like it's just a new space. No one had really ever scaled up.

01:44:05,954 --> 01:44:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  100 person team to build big content on YouTube. So there wasn't no, uh,

01:44:10,658 --> 01:44:11,774
SPEAKER_0:  I spent all this time like...

01:44:12,322 --> 01:44:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  I hired one person from Disney at one point to come in and help.

01:44:16,610 --> 01:44:19,870
SPEAKER_0:  Obviously that was a dumb idea looking back on it, but you know I thought, oh they make-

01:44:20,130 --> 01:44:23,678
SPEAKER_0:  great stuff people want to watch and they come over here and help me build a team.

01:44:24,002 --> 01:44:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  and you know that bill that more the traditional way not like how should be online and

01:44:28,290 --> 01:44:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  And so then it's like, okay.

01:44:30,050 --> 01:44:35,806
SPEAKER_0:  Now I'm not trying to trash people, like they all tried their best, but then I hire this one person who does this.

01:44:36,066 --> 01:44:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  different type of media and runs a hundred person team. And then you come in here and they try to build it that way. And they don't really listen to you or value or see the difference. And I tried.

01:44:45,538 --> 01:44:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  Basically.

01:44:46,690 --> 01:44:50,142
SPEAKER_0:  building this company with like four or five different people worked in different

01:44:50,370 --> 01:44:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  Veins of

01:44:51,330 --> 01:44:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  Media.

01:44:52,130 --> 01:44:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:44:53,218 --> 01:44:54,462
SPEAKER_0:  You know, every single time.

01:44:54,690 --> 01:44:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  It's just like, they just don't get it. And they don't understand my world.

01:44:58,114 --> 01:44:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

01:44:59,074 --> 01:45:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  The eventual solution was just like to roll up my sleeves and do it myself, you know, with like James or a hitman and.

01:45:04,450 --> 01:45:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  Just like.

01:45:05,090 --> 01:45:11,103
SPEAKER_0:  No, no one's ever done this and like, no one's going to just give us a golden carrot and tell us how to build this company. We got to figure the fuck out ourselves.

01:45:11,103 --> 01:45:12,603
SPEAKER_1:  you have to kind of build up people from scratch.

01:45:12,603 --> 01:45:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, exactly. All the stuff I was talking about earlier and all the lessons I learned along the way.

01:45:17,442 --> 01:45:20,958
SPEAKER_0:  And so for me, that was a big part of like, stop.

01:45:21,410 --> 01:45:22,526
SPEAKER_0:  trying to have someone.

01:45:23,170 --> 01:45:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  build this company for me and just.

01:45:24,802 --> 01:45:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  do it myself, because it's scary. Like I spent my whole life studying YouTube videos virality, not business building.

01:45:29,826 --> 01:45:32,862
SPEAKER_0:  But fuck it, I was like, I guess we just gotta do it ourselves then.

01:45:33,122 --> 01:45:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  And that's where things really start to click and we got the exponential growth. And we started getting the right people and training them the right way. And, you know, just throwing conventional stuff out the door and focusing on what's actually practical for YouTube, which is.

01:45:45,762 --> 01:45:46,750
SPEAKER_0:  completely different than.

01:45:47,234 --> 01:45:47,998
SPEAKER_0:  traditional media.

01:45:48,866 --> 01:45:52,606
SPEAKER_1:  So you train people and then those people train people and so on.

01:45:52,802 --> 01:45:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I mean, it's just even like.

01:45:54,594 --> 01:45:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  you know, how you do the lighting on sets or like how you do the audio or

01:45:58,786 --> 01:45:59,230
SPEAKER_0:  or um.

01:45:59,714 --> 01:46:01,822
SPEAKER_0:  you know, not writing scripts. So, you know.

01:46:02,114 --> 01:46:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  we're just not as efficient with our filming. Sometimes I have to have 30 cameras running.

01:46:06,210 --> 01:46:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  Why? Because it's not scripted.

01:46:07,842 --> 01:46:09,790
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know what Chris is gonna do when we start.

01:46:10,050 --> 01:46:16,095
SPEAKER_0:  filming, he might run over there. But guess what? We gotta have it planned, because there's only one shot. I can't tell him not to do that.

01:46:16,095 --> 01:46:18,494
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, that's the shooting, but then there's also the editing.

01:46:18,658 --> 01:46:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, and then the editing as well and not having guardrails and kind of.

01:46:21,986 --> 01:46:25,246
SPEAKER_0:  You know, at the end of the day, it's whatever I want. The video.

01:46:25,474 --> 01:46:28,926
SPEAKER_0:  Their job is to make a video that they think I'll like because it's my channel, but...

01:46:29,154 --> 01:46:32,286
SPEAKER_0:  You can achieve that kind of however.

01:46:32,610 --> 01:46:37,054
SPEAKER_0:  And so it's just, everything's just different. You know, it's much more, I guess, like a startup as opposed to.

01:46:37,378 --> 01:46:40,350
SPEAKER_1:  Are you often surprised like with the result like?

01:46:41,282 --> 01:46:44,446
SPEAKER_1:  You think a certain, like we watched a video today, those really nice.

01:46:44,706 --> 01:46:51,646
SPEAKER_1:  that was different than you would have potentially edited it. Are you sometimes surprised by a decision that it makes? It's like, okay.

01:46:51,970 --> 01:46:54,750
SPEAKER_1:  That's not the way I would have done it, but it's actually this is a cool idea.

01:46:55,170 --> 01:46:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, of course. Yeah, no, um.

01:46:57,186 --> 01:47:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  The thing, my biggest fear is I don't ever want to get trapped in like a...

01:47:01,026 --> 01:47:07,390
SPEAKER_0:  bubble of, you know, because we are getting 100 million views of video on the main channel. Like, but I don't want to get in this feedback loop of just.

01:47:07,906 --> 01:47:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  My ideas are greater. I do not have feedback loop, but stop learning and improving.

01:47:12,354 --> 01:47:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  because it

01:47:13,602 --> 01:47:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  It's easy sometimes to be like, what we're doing is working. We need to just keep doing it. I want to keep learning and trying.

01:47:18,818 --> 01:47:19,678
SPEAKER_0:  new things and

01:47:20,418 --> 01:47:21,694
SPEAKER_0:  I guess one way I'd put it is like...

01:47:22,146 --> 01:47:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  You don't... when you're on a...

01:47:25,026 --> 01:47:27,678
SPEAKER_0:  a come up where you're growing. You don't want to, uh,

01:47:28,034 --> 01:47:28,926
SPEAKER_0:  test new things.

01:47:29,154 --> 01:47:32,286
SPEAKER_0:  Once you start to plateau or have a downtrend.

01:47:32,514 --> 01:47:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  Because if you're like, you know, you're skyrocketing, right, you're up, up, up, and then you level off, you start to go down and you're like, oh, this isn't working anymore, let's start experimenting. Well, if you have a bad experiment.

01:47:42,722 --> 01:47:48,382
SPEAKER_0:  Now you're in like a tailspin, you're nose diving and you have one more bad experiment, you're like screwed, kinda, I'm over simplified.

01:47:48,738 --> 01:47:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  You wanna test things while you're still growing to keep the growing.

01:47:52,450 --> 01:47:58,686
SPEAKER_0:  from happening because once you have, again, very oversimplifying that like, you know, kind of level off.

01:47:58,914 --> 01:48:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  You do a couple of tests, they go wrong. You're like screwed. You're already out the door, and now you're just confirming that you're out the door.

01:48:04,898 --> 01:48:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  and online entertainment. So that's.

01:48:06,978 --> 01:48:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  Kinda how I see it.

01:48:08,194 --> 01:48:13,790
SPEAKER_0:  So I think it's very imperative that you're constantly always experimenting and trying things even if you're getting crazy unheard of growth.

01:48:14,626 --> 01:48:15,262
SPEAKER_1:  And so that.

01:48:15,682 --> 01:48:16,862
SPEAKER_1:  Outside of the thing.

01:48:17,602 --> 01:48:20,798
SPEAKER_1:  that brought you to the dance you just dived right into.

01:48:21,346 --> 01:48:25,086
SPEAKER_1:  Mr. Beast burger and feastables. This is a whole nother industry

01:48:25,602 --> 01:48:27,902
SPEAKER_0:  Like what was that like? What's up, Beast Burger?

01:48:28,130 --> 01:48:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  We kind of...

01:48:30,114 --> 01:48:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  It was supposed to be like just a-

01:48:31,522 --> 01:48:35,134
SPEAKER_0:  Like we just partnered with someone who had 300 restaurants and we were just like

01:48:35,650 --> 01:48:36,094
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

01:48:36,514 --> 01:48:36,926
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:48:37,186 --> 01:48:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  Let's just sell Beastburgers for a day or two. Let's see what happens. But first I wanna show my family some more race on保 hå prię Baik.

01:48:41,666 --> 01:48:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  really think it would be as big as it was, but those...

01:48:44,642 --> 01:48:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  first like that first day, you know, we do six figures in sales.

01:48:47,906 --> 01:48:51,358
SPEAKER_0:  and they all sell out and they're running to local Walmart, they can't keep up with the demand.

01:48:51,778 --> 01:48:52,734
SPEAKER_0:  And it's like, okay, well.

01:48:53,122 --> 01:48:54,270
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe let's just leave it open.

01:48:54,786 --> 01:48:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  a week, whatever, and we're just doing.

01:48:57,762 --> 01:48:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  crazy revenue and it's like, okay, well.

01:48:59,906 --> 01:49:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  Let's add some more restaurants and let's just leave them open for a month.

01:49:02,722 --> 01:49:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  And we're just still doing six figures a day. And it kind of just went from this thing that was.

01:49:07,554 --> 01:49:12,318
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know. It wasn't really, I didn't really plan on running a restaurant chain, but here I am.

01:49:12,578 --> 01:49:13,703
SPEAKER_0:  But it did not ins...

01:49:13,703 --> 01:49:16,830
SPEAKER_1:  some sense also open your mind to something like festivals.

01:49:17,058 --> 01:49:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  Feastable is something I've always wanted to do. Cause I, I think,

01:49:19,970 --> 01:49:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  Just in general, American snacks are just.

01:49:23,490 --> 01:49:24,158
SPEAKER_0:  full of so much.

01:49:25,218 --> 01:49:27,230
SPEAKER_0:  horrible ingredients to be honest and they're not.

01:49:27,650 --> 01:49:32,190
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know. I feel like there also just hasn't been any innovation in American snacks in quite a while.

01:49:32,546 --> 01:49:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:49:33,442 --> 01:49:40,862
SPEAKER_0:  And so that's just something I've always been pretty passionate about. The thing we built that from scratch. So we hired the CEO and built a team around them and we spent.

01:49:41,442 --> 01:49:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  probably over two and a half years before we even launched. Just like building the right team, figuring things out and making sure it was actually ran the way I wanted.

01:49:48,866 --> 01:49:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:49:49,794 --> 01:49:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  which festivals has just been crushing is.

01:49:52,930 --> 01:49:56,254
SPEAKER_0:  It's very interesting. This is something I've never talked about publicly, but-

01:49:56,546 --> 01:49:58,622
SPEAKER_0:  Having products in retail, it's like.

01:49:58,850 --> 01:50:05,150
SPEAKER_0:  Before Feastables, everything I had done was online. So if you wanted to, you know, anything from the Cocoa Peace brand.

01:50:05,378 --> 01:50:07,742
SPEAKER_0:  you'd have to buy it online and ship it to you. But...

01:50:08,162 --> 01:50:15,294
SPEAKER_0:  festivals now that you know, because our first product chocolate bars, we started putting that in retail locations. So like for example Walmart

01:50:15,714 --> 01:50:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  It's-

01:50:16,834 --> 01:50:20,414
SPEAKER_0:  It's crazy. Like it's just, it doesn't make sense. How if you're

01:50:20,770 --> 01:50:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  Which I guess it does.

01:50:22,114 --> 01:50:32,190
SPEAKER_0:  for, because we get a hundred million views videos. So a lot of people know us. If I go stay in a Walmart, those people recognize me and ask for photos. Like if I stood there long enough, I could take 150 photos today in Walmart, 200, whatever it is.

01:50:32,482 --> 01:50:39,422
SPEAKER_0:  So obviously it makes sense those people go to festivals, but then you just multiply that by every woman in America it just gets so crazy.

01:50:39,682 --> 01:50:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't think we'd be doing the kind of revenue we are.

01:50:42,370 --> 01:50:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  And we're about to...

01:50:43,970 --> 01:50:48,254
SPEAKER_0:  Launching some other I don't know if I'm allowed to say so whatever but other big retail

01:50:48,482 --> 01:50:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  locations and convenience stores and

01:50:50,786 --> 01:50:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  Like by the end of next year, we could be in like 40, 50,000.

01:50:53,794 --> 01:50:54,494
SPEAKER_0:  locations.

01:50:55,394 --> 01:50:58,019
SPEAKER_0:  the numbers just don't make sense.

01:50:58,019 --> 01:50:59,518
SPEAKER_1:  interesting challenges about scaling there.

01:50:59,874 --> 01:51:00,606
SPEAKER_1:  that surprised you.

01:51:00,930 --> 01:51:04,158
SPEAKER_0:  The biggest problem, which I didn't think would be, was just keeping the sh-

01:51:04,386 --> 01:51:16,030
SPEAKER_0:  shelves and Walmart stock, to be honest. So that supply chain. It was brutal. Well, even then sometimes like, you know, you get them the stuff and they're like, it takes them like a day or two to put it out in that specific location.

01:51:16,450 --> 01:51:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:51:17,442 --> 01:51:20,958
SPEAKER_0:  I had to stop promoting it because every time I'd mention it.

01:51:21,186 --> 01:51:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  like 40% of people would just be like.

01:51:23,650 --> 01:51:27,646
SPEAKER_0:  It's not there. It's not in Walmart or I can't buy it. And so there's like a

01:51:28,450 --> 01:51:28,958
SPEAKER_0:  3D.

01:51:29,346 --> 01:51:30,782
SPEAKER_0:  ish month period where I just

01:51:31,362 --> 01:51:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  didn't promote feastables because I was scared that someone would go by it and it's just not there. It took us a very long time to catch up to the demand.

01:51:39,746 --> 01:51:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  Also, it's not like we have unlimited money. But now we're relatively caught up in keeping up, but it's gonna be interesting because now this year in 2023, we're gonna...

01:51:50,146 --> 01:51:50,846
SPEAKER_0:  Basically.

01:51:51,298 --> 01:51:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

01:51:52,450 --> 01:52:00,254
SPEAKER_0:  10x the amount of locations we're in. So we're, and we're going to try to launch new products. So we're in for an interesting ride, but.

01:52:00,898 --> 01:52:02,590
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I just hate, I hate when I-

01:52:02,978 --> 01:52:03,550
SPEAKER_0:  help people.

01:52:03,810 --> 01:52:09,374
SPEAKER_0:  you know, like, hey, go try this product. And then they go on their local Walmart and eventually other places and it's not there. It's just so brutal.

01:52:09,666 --> 01:52:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  You know, they made that whole journey out there and they can get it. And so

01:52:13,442 --> 01:52:14,782
SPEAKER_0:  That's really it.

01:52:15,682 --> 01:52:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  Besides that...

01:52:16,610 --> 01:52:19,134
SPEAKER_0:  No, it's been doing way better than I ever thought.

01:52:19,234 --> 01:52:19,710
SPEAKER_1:  Yes.

01:52:20,386 --> 01:52:22,686
SPEAKER_1:  You've talked to a couple places about

01:52:22,978 --> 01:52:25,982
SPEAKER_1:  maybe doing mobile games or computer games in the future.

01:52:26,210 --> 01:52:28,094
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. Is that something you're still considering?

01:52:28,610 --> 01:52:29,406
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

01:52:29,666 --> 01:52:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  Because

01:52:30,370 --> 01:52:33,982
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, you know, do you normally talk with people as much as we talked beforehand?

01:52:34,466 --> 01:52:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  Is that a-

01:52:35,170 --> 01:52:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  No.

01:52:35,778 --> 01:52:48,734
SPEAKER_0:  No, that was the problem. We spent all day today talking about this. I just looked in my head, everything you asked me is stuff we already talked about. Not really. Well, no, no, no, not everything. I take it back, but sorry. The last two questions, yes. And so it's just funny.

01:52:49,090 --> 01:52:50,823
SPEAKER_0:  Cause what? No, I tried.

01:52:50,823 --> 01:52:56,707
SPEAKER_1:  So there's a different style of asking those questions because I on purpose didn't dig further

01:52:56,707 --> 01:53:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  you I could tell yes I can tell you okay this is by the way okay all right this is the

01:53:03,330 --> 01:53:06,238
SPEAKER_1:  First time I've ever talked to somebody.

01:53:07,298 --> 01:53:08,830
SPEAKER_1:  as much as I did with you.

01:53:09,698 --> 01:53:10,462
SPEAKER_1:  beforehand.

01:53:11,522 --> 01:53:13,758
SPEAKER_0:  On the same day

01:53:14,050 --> 01:53:18,654
SPEAKER_0:  We spent all day together and I only slept one hour. Yeah, so yeah...

01:53:18,946 --> 01:53:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  Literally, it's funny. This is a w-

01:53:21,762 --> 01:53:25,950
SPEAKER_0:  hilarious and awesome social experiment. I picked him up from his hotel and I just like-

01:53:26,434 --> 01:53:32,071
SPEAKER_0:  harassed him all day to hang out with me. And then here we are now. I love it. I was secretly recording.

01:53:32,071 --> 01:53:33,630
SPEAKER_1:  the whole time just saying I'm just kidding.

01:53:33,922 --> 01:53:35,797
SPEAKER_1:  Anyway, so what was the question?

01:53:35,797 --> 01:53:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  So the interesting thing is with Beast Burger and Feastables.

01:53:40,866 --> 01:53:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  that um

01:53:41,890 --> 01:53:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  There's physical goods.

01:53:43,554 --> 01:53:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  as opposed to like making mobile games or PC game, which everyone may end up doing, which is software.

01:53:48,834 --> 01:53:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  and I actually have a giant international audience.

01:53:52,610 --> 01:53:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  Most of my audience is obviously outside of America.

01:53:55,554 --> 01:53:59,102
SPEAKER_0:  And so the problem we're running into is it just takes time to build up the supply chain and

01:53:59,330 --> 01:54:07,454
SPEAKER_0:  get feastables in Southeast Asia, get feastables in India, get feastables in Brazil and Mexico and all these other places where we have giant pockets of our audience.

01:54:07,874 --> 01:54:10,046
SPEAKER_0:  And same thing with Beast Spur, it's just, it's gonna take...

01:54:10,402 --> 01:54:14,366
SPEAKER_0:  Probably years, unless we partner with someone who already has the distribution, which we're figuring out.

01:54:14,818 --> 01:54:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  Beauty of software.

01:54:16,162 --> 01:54:19,742
SPEAKER_0:  is I can make a hypothetical game or whatever we end up doing.

01:54:20,418 --> 01:54:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  All my fans can...

01:54:21,698 --> 01:54:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

01:54:22,498 --> 01:54:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  Use it tomorrow.

01:54:23,682 --> 01:54:25,598
SPEAKER_0:  uh... the day i mentioned it and so

01:54:26,018 --> 01:54:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  If I promote something in a video to 100 million people and it's like a, you know, basically like a game, they can all download it. So there, you know.

01:54:33,410 --> 01:54:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:54:34,114 --> 01:54:35,998
SPEAKER_0:  But if I promote a feastables bar...

01:54:36,258 --> 01:54:46,014
SPEAKER_0:  Right now it's only in America because we're struggling just to keep up with American demand. We haven't even gotten the chance to go outside of America. So I alienate a majority of my audience and it feels sort of shitty.

01:54:46,306 --> 01:54:50,558
SPEAKER_0:  to just mention something that most of them can't buy. But on the flip side, you can't just...

01:54:51,170 --> 01:54:53,630
SPEAKER_0:  spawn this crazy infrastructure and just have

01:54:54,210 --> 01:54:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  tens of millions of bars.

01:54:56,130 --> 01:54:59,710
SPEAKER_0:  and all your products in every single store across the world before you promote it so you can't put the

01:54:59,938 --> 01:55:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  egg before the chicken. And so...

01:55:01,602 --> 01:55:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:55:02,210 --> 01:55:05,214
SPEAKER_0:  It's like that's, that's what I'm excited about. I want to get into-

01:55:05,474 --> 01:55:07,358
SPEAKER_0:  less physical stuff and more

01:55:07,650 --> 01:55:10,275
SPEAKER_0:  Stuff that everyone can actually use. It's the proper answer.

01:55:10,275 --> 01:55:12,062
SPEAKER_1:  there's a social element to the gaming too.

01:55:12,418 --> 01:55:15,239
SPEAKER_1:  because it's not unlike feastables, that's a product you consume.

01:55:15,239 --> 01:55:18,526
SPEAKER_0:  You missed it when you're setting up for this we were doing some

01:55:18,978 --> 01:55:20,254
SPEAKER_0:  Basically just laying out every-

01:55:20,578 --> 01:55:26,878
SPEAKER_0:  everything that we're planning for. So our interface is where we're want to start hiring the team to build it. And we're kind of just laying out the game and

01:55:27,106 --> 01:55:29,502
SPEAKER_0:  I was actually really curious to get your thoughts, but I can't say it.

01:55:29,730 --> 01:55:30,622
SPEAKER_0:  Because whatever I say...

01:55:30,850 --> 01:55:35,271
SPEAKER_0:  Someone's just gonna take it and run with it. But I have a pretty good idea. About the kind of games you-

01:55:35,271 --> 01:55:39,021
SPEAKER_1:  You're thinking about? Yeah, I mean, I can imagine. We also talked a little bit about it.

01:55:39,021 --> 01:55:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  Super awesome. So much good talk. I have the juicy talks having you. She's like, I gotta go set up.

01:55:44,706 --> 01:55:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  Well...

01:55:45,186 --> 01:55:48,670
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I already heard a lot of awesome stuff, but that is a different.

01:55:49,058 --> 01:55:50,398
SPEAKER_1:  kind of team you need to hire.

01:55:50,818 --> 01:55:52,734
SPEAKER_1:  Is that a little?

01:55:53,090 --> 01:55:55,294
SPEAKER_1:  Never acting like going into a new

01:55:55,522 --> 01:55:55,966
SPEAKER_1:  field.

01:55:56,322 --> 01:55:57,447
SPEAKER_1:  and trying to a little bit.

01:55:57,447 --> 01:56:01,886
SPEAKER_0:  But then I remember stuff like Steve Jobs didn't know how to code, right? And you know, he just...

01:56:02,114 --> 01:56:10,467
SPEAKER_0:  You just knew what a good product was. And I feel like as someone who wasted so much of his life playing video games, I have a good sense of it. And that might be ignorance. Well, that's really important, right? It's not a-

01:56:10,467 --> 01:56:11,967
SPEAKER_1:  about coatings about what makes for a.

01:56:11,967 --> 01:56:15,582
SPEAKER_0:  good game. Exactly. And again, that might genuinely be ignorance. Maybe I end up

01:56:15,874 --> 01:56:18,526
SPEAKER_0:  you know, can bend the butt because of what I'm saying now, but.

01:56:18,946 --> 01:56:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

01:56:19,746 --> 01:56:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  Just like with YouTube, I just want to obsess over making a great product and things that I think my audience will love. I think as long as I keep that as my North Star, it will do well.

01:56:29,282 --> 01:56:32,478
SPEAKER_1:  What is the path to being worth a hundred billion look like?

01:56:33,250 --> 01:56:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  There's a path to being worth a hundred billion look like.

01:56:35,586 --> 01:56:36,711
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know. Okay.

01:56:36,711 --> 01:56:38,622
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, let me just pause, you're 24.

01:56:38,914 --> 01:56:40,862
SPEAKER_1:  And there's so much awesome scaling.

01:56:41,090 --> 01:56:42,430
SPEAKER_1:  So many great ideas.

01:56:42,818 --> 01:56:44,862
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think about different trajectories?

01:56:45,442 --> 01:56:46,974
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. With those.

01:56:47,266 --> 01:56:48,414
SPEAKER_1:  possible trajectory might look like.

01:56:49,314 --> 01:56:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I mean, if the goal was to just be worth $100 billion, yes. I am andother

01:56:54,274 --> 01:57:03,390
SPEAKER_0:  My goal, I'm a broken record, is to make the best video possible because I know whatever else I want will come, obviously. You heard that. So the video is the foundation. Yeah, exactly, so.

01:57:03,618 --> 01:57:05,022
SPEAKER_0:  to a path to $100 billion.

01:57:05,442 --> 01:57:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  keep getting 100 million views a video, you know what I mean?

01:57:07,426 --> 01:57:12,382
SPEAKER_0:  Um, but, or more or more, exactly. If we can keep growing, but you know, if we can.

01:57:13,538 --> 01:57:23,902
SPEAKER_0:  keep Feastables growing, right? And we eventually expand international and one day we're in a hundred thousand retail locations and we're selling the same amount of skews or units per skews like we're currently doing.

01:57:24,130 --> 01:57:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  uh... i mean that would crush and then

01:57:26,498 --> 01:57:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  Obviously, ideally one day we open up hundreds of beast burgers. We get it where we churn out, you know, like Supercell, a couple hit games. I don't want to make.

01:57:33,794 --> 01:57:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  dozens or hundreds of games. I just want to make games that are just great and you know we rarely drop them but we do their bangers.

01:57:40,034 --> 01:57:40,478
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:57:40,738 --> 01:57:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  and just, you know, whatever other stuff we end up doing.

01:57:43,266 --> 01:57:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  All that combined, I mean...

01:57:44,578 --> 01:57:45,022
SPEAKER_0:  It's just-

01:57:45,378 --> 01:57:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  Interesting because like what what's a show that's pulled 100 million views per episode basically

01:57:50,850 --> 01:57:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  Nice.

01:57:51,714 --> 01:57:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  like we're doing.

01:57:52,578 --> 01:57:52,894
SPEAKER_0:  Thank you.

01:57:53,186 --> 01:57:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I mean, like the Super Bowl gets praised because they get 100 million viewers, but I can't think of a show.

01:57:57,410 --> 01:57:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:57:58,114 --> 01:57:59,989
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe it reruns or something.

01:57:59,989 --> 01:58:01,758
SPEAKER_1:  show that has a

01:58:02,242 --> 01:58:05,493
SPEAKER_1:  has a singular kind of figure that you can now use.

01:58:05,493 --> 01:58:10,206
SPEAKER_0:  I don't have a network telling me what to do. I don't have anyone. I can do it every once.

01:58:10,498 --> 01:58:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  It's a very interesting position because.

01:58:12,546 --> 01:58:23,102
SPEAKER_0:  I put out content and 100 million people show up. And then I also have a gaming channel. I put out content and 15 million people show up. And a reaction, I put out content and 10 million people show up. I have a TikTok and I put out content and on average 20 million people show up.

01:58:23,362 --> 01:58:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  And like.

01:58:24,034 --> 01:58:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  And I, so.

01:58:25,442 --> 01:58:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  As long as I can keep that going and then we build these businesses, it's like.

01:58:29,090 --> 01:58:29,918
SPEAKER_0:  It's honestly...

01:58:30,242 --> 01:58:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  I'm pretty scared to see what will happen over the years because Feastables launched.

01:58:35,298 --> 01:58:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  You know, last year, 2022, so it's a relatively new thing. And Beast Warrior, we just started scaling up the physical side and we haven't obviously even launched any mobile games yet. So.

01:58:42,818 --> 01:58:44,222
SPEAKER_0:  Think about the antithesis of it.

01:58:44,514 --> 01:58:49,278
SPEAKER_0:  I don't see a world where my YouTube channel is irrelevant in the next couple of years. I just, this is what I live for.

01:58:49,538 --> 01:58:53,982
SPEAKER_0:  And so if I can keep that going and then really start to expand these businesses that leverage off of it.

01:58:54,306 --> 01:58:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  then.

01:58:55,330 --> 01:58:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I mean, hopefully there's a day when, or I can give away a billion dollars in a video, honestly.

01:59:00,226 --> 01:59:02,782
SPEAKER_1:  That would be one hell of a video.

01:59:03,010 --> 01:59:07,230
SPEAKER_1:  Let me ask you the ridiculous question since you went from being broke.

01:59:07,618 --> 01:59:08,222
SPEAKER_1:  to being.

01:59:08,994 --> 01:59:10,270
SPEAKER_1:  Rich, although you keep...

01:59:11,042 --> 01:59:16,350
SPEAKER_1:  spending all your money. Does money buy happiness?

01:59:16,834 --> 01:59:19,198
SPEAKER_1:  How has money changed sort of your?

01:59:20,578 --> 01:59:22,462
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, man. Your contentment, your happiness in life.

01:59:23,042 --> 01:59:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  Money by happiness.

01:59:25,698 --> 01:59:26,974
SPEAKER_0:  No, not, I mean...

01:59:27,554 --> 01:59:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  To a point, yes. Once you can take care of your-

01:59:30,178 --> 01:59:30,558
SPEAKER_0:  Health.

01:59:30,882 --> 01:59:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  You can take care of like.

01:59:32,386 --> 01:59:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  any immediate dangers and you can take care of your family relatively.

01:59:36,098 --> 01:59:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  No, it doesn't. But those things do. When I first came into money, one of the first things I did was retire my mom.

01:59:41,346 --> 01:59:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  And like that brought me tons of happiness, you know what I mean?

01:59:43,682 --> 01:59:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  then like.

01:59:44,450 --> 01:59:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  you know, if my brother had a medical emergency and...

01:59:46,818 --> 01:59:53,950
SPEAKER_0:  and we couldn't afford it and I made money to afford it, that brings tons of happiness, you know? So once you take care of those basic necessities, so we'll say makeover hypothetically a million dollars.

01:59:54,210 --> 01:59:59,422
SPEAKER_0:  No, it really doesn't. Like adding an extra zero, going from 10 million to a hundred million or whatever it is.

01:59:59,778 --> 02:00:00,606
SPEAKER_0:  makes no difference.

02:00:01,346 --> 02:00:02,046
SPEAKER_1:  So you're.

02:00:02,754 --> 02:00:04,926
SPEAKER_1:  given that I was just fearless in spending the money.

02:00:05,058 --> 02:00:08,190
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, well, let me reframe. I guess it could for some people if-

02:00:08,482 --> 02:00:09,310
SPEAKER_0:  If you really...

02:00:09,954 --> 02:00:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, you spent your whole life obsessing over cars. It probably would bring you a little bit of joy to buy a nice Lamborghini. I'm coming more from the frame of mind of an entrepreneur, someone who's really obsessed with business building. For me and a lot of my friends and people I hang around.

02:00:21,858 --> 02:00:25,086
SPEAKER_0:  What brings us happiness is winning and building companies and

02:00:25,570 --> 02:00:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  do, you know, changing the world. Like that.

02:00:28,322 --> 02:00:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  That is fun. It's a complex problem you can wake up every day and it gives you something to obsess over and devote your life to.

02:00:33,570 --> 02:00:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  Where it's just...

02:00:34,434 --> 02:00:36,094
SPEAKER_0:  Having money doesn't, you know.

02:00:36,738 --> 02:00:37,246
SPEAKER_1:  I wanna-

02:00:37,762 --> 02:00:40,638
SPEAKER_1:  Interesting question for you psychologically, so because you...

02:00:41,762 --> 02:00:46,174
SPEAKER_1:  have become wealthy and because you give, like part of your work is giving away a lot of money.

02:00:46,530 --> 02:00:46,974
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

02:00:47,554 --> 02:00:49,310
SPEAKER_1:  Do you find it hard to find people you can trust?

02:00:50,306 --> 02:00:55,509
SPEAKER_1:  Do people see you basically as a source of money? As opposed to another human being?

02:00:55,509 --> 02:00:58,622
SPEAKER_0:  It's weird because you would think yes, but I think

02:00:59,042 --> 02:01:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like I also know the right places to look.

02:01:01,826 --> 02:01:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  But yeah, if I just walked into Target and try to make friends with 10 random people, of course.

02:01:07,458 --> 02:01:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  You gotta...

02:01:08,962 --> 02:01:09,598
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhh...

02:01:09,922 --> 02:01:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  So you can kind of sense who has the right thing in their heart.

02:01:14,754 --> 02:01:17,598
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it's so obvious. I don't even want to go into it.

02:01:18,114 --> 02:01:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  descriptions but

02:01:19,618 --> 02:01:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  But honestly, a lot of my friends are like Chandler.

02:01:23,330 --> 02:01:25,630
SPEAKER_0:  I played Little League with him.

02:01:26,082 --> 02:01:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  and Tyler, the guy, I mean, I went to school with him.

02:01:29,410 --> 02:01:30,942
SPEAKER_0:  Chris, he was my first subscriber.

02:01:31,394 --> 02:01:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  Carl was here after we got big, but whatever, he's just friends with the boys.

02:01:35,938 --> 02:01:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  It is a lot of.

02:01:37,890 --> 02:01:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  my closer friends, even like my YouTube friends, I knew before I was big. So.

02:01:43,938 --> 02:01:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe there is some merit to that. Maybe it is. I don't know. I've never really put too much thought into it. Maybe there's a reason I hang around a lot of these people I knew before I got Hiiya!

02:01:51,394 --> 02:01:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  It's much easier.

02:01:52,450 --> 02:01:55,870
SPEAKER_1:  and they help you keep like your radar sharp of.

02:01:56,386 --> 02:01:58,622
SPEAKER_1:  who can and can't be trusted, because you know you can trust them.

02:01:59,074 --> 02:02:02,078
SPEAKER_1:  It's difficult you become richer and richer and more powerful

02:02:02,434 --> 02:02:02,750
SPEAKER_1:  Well.

02:02:03,010 --> 02:02:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  One thing you'll also find when you get

02:02:04,834 --> 02:02:09,246
SPEAKER_0:  Not even richer, but more famous. One thing I thought is, as I climbed this like-

02:02:09,506 --> 02:02:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  ladder of YouTube and got bigger. I thought there would be tons of people like me.

02:02:12,930 --> 02:02:13,278
SPEAKER_0:  people.

02:02:14,498 --> 02:02:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  Like that takes like the kamikaze approach to building a business. You just throw all your money in it. You throw all your time, you throw all your energy, you throw everything. You're just like, fuck it. It's this or I'm dead. I thought there would be hundreds of me. And there isn't. There isn't. There's like maybe one or two.

02:02:29,538 --> 02:02:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  and I talk to those motherfuckers every single day. I'm sick and tired of talking to them, but I love them.

02:02:34,434 --> 02:02:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  but

02:02:35,426 --> 02:02:39,422
SPEAKER_0:  It's just so interesting because like every level I got up, like I'd get a million subscribers. Like.

02:02:40,002 --> 02:02:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  Where's all these guys with the million subscribers that are fucking psychopaths? And then you don't-

02:02:43,810 --> 02:02:44,935
SPEAKER_0:  You know, they're like.

02:02:44,935 --> 02:02:47,742
SPEAKER_1:  become conservative as they get.

02:02:48,034 --> 02:02:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  Especially as they get bigger, yeah.

02:02:49,922 --> 02:02:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  and you know, 20 million subscribers, 30. It's like every step of the way, it's like.

02:02:54,530 --> 02:02:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  I just got more and more lonely to be honest.

02:02:58,818 --> 02:03:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  Sounds cliche and you hear that kind of shit in movies and you're like, yeah, that's not how it works, but.

02:03:03,330 --> 02:03:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  It is like there's there's just not many people that just want to give up everything goal in then obsess over making the greatest goddamn videos every single day of their life like.

02:03:11,362 --> 02:03:12,414
SPEAKER_0:  They're really hard to find.

02:03:12,674 --> 02:03:15,486
SPEAKER_1:  and be able to sacrifice everything for that video.

02:03:15,746 --> 02:03:19,253
SPEAKER_1:  Like basically you put all the money right back in.

02:03:19,253 --> 02:03:25,086
SPEAKER_0:  people doing it, they're on just a small scale and if I talk to them, it's just 99.9% of the time I'm teaching them things.

02:03:25,634 --> 02:03:26,110
SPEAKER_0:  It's like.

02:03:26,210 --> 02:03:27,678
SPEAKER_1:  So it's lonely because there's not.

02:03:28,098 --> 02:03:28,990
SPEAKER_1:  too many people.

02:03:29,538 --> 02:03:31,774
SPEAKER_1:  especially in the creative space that is crazy as you.

02:03:32,098 --> 02:03:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it is 100%. It's so.

02:03:34,690 --> 02:03:37,854
SPEAKER_0:  It's not what I was expecting. I was expecting there would be a lot of people like me.

02:03:39,170 --> 02:03:40,295
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I guess.

02:03:40,295 --> 02:03:45,438
SPEAKER_1:  the guy we talked to Elon Musk is a bit like you in that sense. Yeah, just in a different domain. Yeah.

02:03:45,666 --> 02:03:47,710
SPEAKER_1:  Exactly. Just willingness to put it all.

02:03:47,874 --> 02:03:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  And that's why I found right now a lot of the people I relate to don't even make YouTube videos. I'm just like, I'm viewing more and more.

02:03:56,130 --> 02:03:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  away from fellow content creators and more to just.

02:03:58,658 --> 02:04:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  I'm just looking for those other people who just share a little bit of it so I don't feel so fucking crazy all the time. Like, you know what I mean?

02:04:05,602 --> 02:04:10,046
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and like people I feel normal around and they tend to just be doing the randomest things, but you know.

02:04:10,434 --> 02:04:10,878
SPEAKER_0:  loving it.

02:04:11,106 --> 02:04:13,598
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I think that's really inspiring. It's uh.

02:04:14,946 --> 02:04:18,494
SPEAKER_1:  I think the Bukowski line, where you love and let it kill you, is really-

02:04:18,818 --> 02:04:19,774
SPEAKER_1:  Put everything.

02:04:21,282 --> 02:04:22,654
SPEAKER_1:  put everything into the thing you love.

02:04:22,882 --> 02:04:27,007
SPEAKER_1:  And that's like the way to really create special stuff, but it's also the way to.

02:04:27,007 --> 02:04:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  Live out your life mostly. You have to be careful giving this advice because

02:04:31,106 --> 02:04:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  They're like, they're like.

02:04:33,154 --> 02:04:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  bodybuilders will be like.

02:04:34,786 --> 02:04:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  Go to the gym, be disciplined. I'm disciplined, go to the gym.

02:04:38,210 --> 02:04:38,782
SPEAKER_0:  I would argue.

02:04:39,042 --> 02:04:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  For those people.

02:04:40,226 --> 02:04:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  It's like, it's not even discipline. They just enjoy weightlifting.

02:04:43,394 --> 02:04:49,342
SPEAKER_0:  Right? Because there are people who are jacked, but they don't make much money or run a business. Right? In the McClinton area in Thailand.

02:04:49,698 --> 02:04:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  they would be hitting every area of their life. They just really like business. And there's people.

02:04:53,698 --> 02:05:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  Like me, who just to an extreme level, love building companies, right? It's not even discipline for me. It's just in my blood. It's what I wake up, I don't think about it. I don't push myself. I don't need to watch a fucking motivational video to go work.

02:05:05,250 --> 02:05:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  I just do it, it's programmed in me at this point. And I couldn't imagine a world where I don't wake up and do it every day.

02:05:10,690 --> 02:05:11,166
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:05:11,746 --> 02:05:13,022
SPEAKER_0:  But I think that...

02:05:13,698 --> 02:05:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  A little bit of it is genetics and just how you're hardwired. Not that it can't be trained or taught and not that, you know, and obviously the friend group you're in influences these things. And over time, I think can change it, but someone's just not going to be able to flip a switch.

02:05:27,554 --> 02:05:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  and then just.

02:05:28,290 --> 02:05:30,366
SPEAKER_0:  start doing a kamikaze approach to building a business.

02:05:30,626 --> 02:05:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  Just like a lot of people try to flip a switch and start bodybuilding and then quit majority of the time.

02:05:35,426 --> 02:05:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  That's just not innate to them.

02:05:37,442 --> 02:05:40,350
SPEAKER_1:  I think a lot of us have the capacity to do that in some domain.

02:05:40,642 --> 02:05:43,390
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I think if you went about it strategically, if you surrounded yourself with...

02:05:43,650 --> 02:05:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  fellow like-minded people and slowly over time switched it.

02:05:47,682 --> 02:05:50,718
SPEAKER_0:  But if you just try to like hardcore do it, you're just gonna lose your mind

02:05:52,098 --> 02:05:54,174
SPEAKER_1:  Do you ever worry about your mental health?

02:05:54,658 --> 02:05:57,310
SPEAKER_1:  Did you take steps to protect it?

02:05:58,626 --> 02:06:02,001
SPEAKER_1:  to like for the long run to make sure you have the mental strength to go.

02:06:02,001 --> 02:06:14,014
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, weirdly enough, the best thing for my mental health was giving into my nature to work. The most depressed I get is when I try to restrict it and like, I don't work weekends or I don't work this day.

02:06:14,242 --> 02:06:17,342
SPEAKER_0:  What's best for me is just to work when I feel like working and then.

02:06:18,018 --> 02:06:22,846
SPEAKER_0:  just not work when I don't, and just have no constraints. Because there are just some nights where I don't want to sleep.

02:06:23,458 --> 02:06:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  whatever reason I feel compelled to go all night.

02:06:25,762 --> 02:06:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  Whatever, like just do it, you know, do whatever you want.

02:06:28,706 --> 02:06:30,206
SPEAKER_0:  is what I told my like.

02:06:31,106 --> 02:06:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  working brain.

02:06:32,962 --> 02:06:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  and I just give into it. And I feel that's where I feel the happiest.

02:06:36,098 --> 02:06:38,014
SPEAKER_0:  And then, you know, it's typically like.

02:06:38,338 --> 02:06:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  But when I'm really in the grind mode, it'll be like seven or eight days, just nonstop going going.

02:06:43,202 --> 02:06:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  And it's like.

02:06:44,258 --> 02:06:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  I'll realize like, oh.

02:06:45,986 --> 02:06:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  I need some recharge time and then go fucking binge a season of anime. Yeah. But, but that's the thing. Like people will tell you don't work weekends or don't do this or don't work past this or blah, blah, give you all these constraints, but for me.

02:06:57,858 --> 02:07:00,999
SPEAKER_0:  and it's unconventional, I just give into it. I think there's something-

02:07:00,999 --> 02:07:02,142
SPEAKER_1:  really to be said.

02:07:02,562 --> 02:07:05,214
SPEAKER_1:  for that, I try to surround myself with people that.

02:07:05,858 --> 02:07:10,238
SPEAKER_1:  Like when I pull an all-nighter, they don't go like you should get more sleep.

02:07:10,690 --> 02:07:15,742
SPEAKER_1:  There's a reason I pulled that all nighter. Like if I'm really passionate about something, they say they basically encourage it.

02:07:16,130 --> 02:07:18,206
SPEAKER_1:  I have no problem.

02:07:18,626 --> 02:07:20,030
SPEAKER_1:  getting sleep and getting rest.

02:07:20,578 --> 02:07:26,142
SPEAKER_1:  What I need in my life is people that encourage you to kind of keep going, keep going with the stuff that you're passionate about.

02:07:26,242 --> 02:07:30,366
SPEAKER_0:  Normal people, they don't want that life and they probably shouldn't. It's not good for you.

02:07:30,626 --> 02:07:34,814
SPEAKER_0:  But yeah, if you hang around people, just what different people.

02:07:35,522 --> 02:07:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  you're gonna feel crazy and it's gonna wear on you whereas if you're around similar people

02:07:39,586 --> 02:07:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  It's just so much easier. Like, if you-

02:07:43,714 --> 02:07:48,638
SPEAKER_0:  You know, um, I've started weightlifting more and like one thing that's helped is just having Jack.

02:07:48,962 --> 02:07:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  people around me because they naturally just eat healthier. They do. They naturally just have.

02:07:53,666 --> 02:08:04,574
SPEAKER_0:  freaking grilled chicken and all this shit and high protein meals. And it's just like easier for me to just piggyback and be like, oh, can you just order me whatever you're getting? And they're like, I gotta go to the gym. I'll be like, oh shit, I'll just join you, you know?

02:08:04,802 --> 02:08:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  And it's like, it's just, it's cheat codes, you know, you just surround yourself with people that you want to be. And it makes it like 70% easier, in my opinion. It's like, that is the cheat code to life.

02:08:13,634 --> 02:08:14,014
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:08:14,498 --> 02:08:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  And I wish...

02:08:15,746 --> 02:08:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  Obviously your audience is definitely a lot older, but you know, two of the older people listening, like if you've

02:08:20,802 --> 02:08:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  are in a place of mentorship for someone younger or have influence over younger people.

02:08:24,802 --> 02:08:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  you should really try to drill that in their heads. Like the people they are around 100% dictates the outcome. I would not be on 120 million subscribers if.

02:08:32,802 --> 02:08:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't find when I was around a million.

02:08:35,394 --> 02:08:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  I had a couple friends that were just also psychopaths.

02:08:37,954 --> 02:08:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

02:08:38,594 --> 02:08:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  I outgrew them, but at the time it was great. I wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for them.

02:08:43,458 --> 02:08:43,806
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:08:44,418 --> 02:08:47,102
SPEAKER_0:  and just all along the way the friends that

02:08:47,330 --> 02:08:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  I hung out with had such a dramatic impact on where I am.

02:08:51,618 --> 02:08:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  I probably have.

02:08:52,898 --> 02:08:58,523
SPEAKER_0:  80 million less subscribers. You know, if I wasn't so strategic about hanging out with people that I add value to and they also.

02:08:58,523 --> 02:09:01,598
SPEAKER_1:  So the advice for young people would be to...

02:09:02,530 --> 02:09:04,405
SPEAKER_1:  be very selective about the people you're signing.

02:09:04,405 --> 02:09:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  So selective. It's crazy.

02:09:07,522 --> 02:09:08,926
SPEAKER_0:  Chris, you know, he's...

02:09:09,666 --> 02:09:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  He's really funny and that's why he's great for the videos. And part of why he's so funny is he consumes copious amounts of cartoons and just funny content.

02:09:17,282 --> 02:09:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  And so I'll find, like when I spend more time with Chris, I'll start just quoting these weird cartoons and shows. Like my speech will literally change just after like a week of spending more time with him. It has like, it's like that click out of effect.

02:09:30,658 --> 02:09:35,326
SPEAKER_0:  Now picture that over the course of years. I mean, yeah, it has such a huge influence.

02:09:35,618 --> 02:09:35,966
SPEAKER_0:  Like.

02:09:36,354 --> 02:09:38,814
SPEAKER_0:  pluck one of their friends out and hypothetically put me in there and...

02:09:39,170 --> 02:09:40,030
SPEAKER_0:  You know, there's...

02:09:40,354 --> 02:09:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  no doubt if they're trying to become a content creator, there are odds of success is 10X, right? Obviously you can't do that, but you gotta find your closest version of it.

02:09:48,322 --> 02:09:49,758
SPEAKER_1:  And just be selective. Yeah.

02:09:50,050 --> 02:09:52,606
SPEAKER_1:  But this also applies not just to younger, to older people too.

02:09:53,026 --> 02:09:55,294
SPEAKER_0:  Okay. But they, it's, it's even more.

02:09:55,778 --> 02:09:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  I like.

02:09:57,058 --> 02:10:04,702
SPEAKER_0:  When I was a teenager, I just, you know, I couldn't relate to many people. I just thought it was like a fucking freaking nature because no one was obsessed with building businesses or any of this kind of stuff.

02:10:05,026 --> 02:10:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  And so like back then.

02:10:06,498 --> 02:10:09,982
SPEAKER_0:  you know, that advice would have been helpful. Maybe not that particularly, but just knowing that...

02:10:10,498 --> 02:10:15,167
SPEAKER_0:  There are, it's not that you're a freaking nature, you just haven't found people that have the same interest..

02:10:15,167 --> 02:10:15,614
SPEAKER_1:  because.

02:10:16,002 --> 02:10:18,627
SPEAKER_1:  Not if you're sorry for yourself or somehow change yourself, it's more-

02:10:18,627 --> 02:10:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  to find the people you fit in with. Yeah. Assuming you're not getting complimented.

02:10:25,762 --> 02:10:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  and assume it's not something bad. Right? Like if you're hobby is shooting things, or shooting things you shouldn't be shooting, don't find people that encourage that.

02:10:35,778 --> 02:10:38,686
SPEAKER_1:  But outside of that for sure.

02:10:39,074 --> 02:10:42,526
SPEAKER_1:  actually as an answer to what is the best advice someone ever gave you, you said.

02:10:42,850 --> 02:10:45,598
SPEAKER_1:  You're crazy until you're successful, then you're a genius.

02:10:45,794 --> 02:10:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  100% all along the way.

02:10:47,842 --> 02:10:49,214
SPEAKER_0:  People gave me so much.

02:10:50,786 --> 02:10:51,134
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

02:10:51,682 --> 02:10:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  advice on why I shouldn't be doing it, why I'm crazy. Every step of the way people wanted to tell me why I shouldn't be doing this and should get a live should.

02:10:58,786 --> 02:11:01,534
SPEAKER_0:  stop being too obsessed, everything under the book.

02:11:01,890 --> 02:11:03,902
SPEAKER_0:  And then once I'm successful, those same people are like, dang.

02:11:04,866 --> 02:11:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  Thank you.

02:11:05,538 --> 02:11:08,995
SPEAKER_0:  You're a genius. Wow, you really, you pulled that off. Those are prob-

02:11:08,995 --> 02:11:10,974
SPEAKER_1:  the same people that will give you advice now.

02:11:11,554 --> 02:11:14,238
SPEAKER_1:  you're the most successful video creator.

02:11:14,594 --> 02:11:16,030
SPEAKER_1:  of all time, stick to that.

02:11:16,322 --> 02:11:20,446
SPEAKER_1:  Anytime you want to do something new, right? Don't worry, there'll be another channel here!

02:11:20,674 --> 02:11:22,686
SPEAKER_1:  pressure you not to do the um...

02:11:23,522 --> 02:11:28,318
SPEAKER_1:  you know, feastables or mobile gaming or whatever lays beyond.

02:11:28,994 --> 02:11:30,430
SPEAKER_1:  It's funny how people don't.

02:11:30,658 --> 02:11:35,422
SPEAKER_0:  Well, honestly, they're the type of people I just don't talk to anymore. Yeah, sure. I don't even know what they have to say now.

02:11:35,650 --> 02:11:36,775
SPEAKER_0:  So most people on the team.

02:11:36,775 --> 02:11:40,126
SPEAKER_1:  are like yes and they're like whatever the idea you got they

02:11:40,354 --> 02:11:40,990
SPEAKER_1:  They're with it.

02:11:41,186 --> 02:11:43,422
SPEAKER_0:  No, I mean, it's weird. We actually have a-

02:11:43,810 --> 02:11:50,014
SPEAKER_0:  My team pushes back on me pretty hardcore. Which I want. I don't want Yes Man. And they're like uh...

02:11:50,402 --> 02:11:50,814
SPEAKER_0:  Third.

02:11:51,554 --> 02:11:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  James, you know, the CEO who helped me build all this.

02:11:55,074 --> 02:12:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  He's very adamant, like we're not yes men. And he trains people to really think for themselves. And even when I give them orders, like really think like, is this optimal? Is there context or information Jimmy could be missing that I can provide that could help him make a more updated decision? Like I'm not.

02:12:07,554 --> 02:12:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  God, you know what I mean? Like I'm human and I make errors. And so.

02:12:11,234 --> 02:12:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  Don't take what I say as the Bible.

02:12:14,146 --> 02:12:16,478
SPEAKER_1:  So even like in the brainstorming and so on, they can.

02:12:16,610 --> 02:12:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  that can push back. Yeah, you can see it, like Tyler, anytime I said something, he would give me feedback and push back, which is what I want. I don't want him just to be like, yes, you're a fucking genius, good job, Jimmy. You know, I don't need that, you know, I need negatives.

02:12:28,258 --> 02:12:29,086
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhhhhh

02:12:29,634 --> 02:12:32,254
SPEAKER_1:  You talked about being in a relationship. What role?

02:12:32,738 --> 02:12:35,038
SPEAKER_1:  Jimmy does love playing the human condition.

02:12:36,482 --> 02:12:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

02:12:38,082 --> 02:12:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  Well, all this love. The big thing is that love can be scary, because this is-

02:12:41,954 --> 02:12:43,710
SPEAKER_0:  you know, the human you're gonna spend the most amount of time with.

02:12:44,226 --> 02:12:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  in your life.

02:12:45,442 --> 02:12:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  You know, and so for project that over 50 years, they can be a liability art asset. You know, I love, no, but seriously, it's gotta be someone that makes you better for me. I can't truly love someone that.

02:12:55,042 --> 02:13:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  doesn't make me better because in the long run across the years. Because if not, then it's like, it's a negative, you know, to everything I spent my life building.

02:13:03,874 --> 02:13:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  But luckily I'm very happy with the partner I have like we were talking about before. I do think she makes me better. There's a lot of actually positives I've noticed, even things as simple as like.

02:13:12,834 --> 02:13:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I struggle to turn off my brain at night because I'm just thinking about all the businesses and how we could do better or whatever weird thing I have on my mind, but you know, just chatting with her and hanging out with her helps me. Like.

02:13:23,170 --> 02:13:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  Basically just.

02:13:24,354 --> 02:13:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  shut my brain off and like mellow out. And even like, there's just a ton of little things like that that I've noticed are positives, especially when you really look for them.

02:13:31,778 --> 02:13:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  that are easy to gloss over if you're not.

02:13:34,242 --> 02:13:34,686
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:13:35,202 --> 02:13:35,806
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

02:13:36,162 --> 02:13:45,918
SPEAKER_0:  For me, yeah, I have someone who I think is very beautiful, very intelligent, makes me better, is constantly pushing me, okay with me, working hard, makes me smarter and just all these different things that...

02:13:46,178 --> 02:13:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

02:13:46,882 --> 02:13:47,998
SPEAKER_0:  For me, love.

02:13:48,834 --> 02:13:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  just makes me a better person, you know what I mean? Which makes me love her even more. Does that make sense?

02:13:53,378 --> 02:13:54,503
SPEAKER_0:  Absolutely what advice

02:13:54,503 --> 02:13:57,310
SPEAKER_1:  would you give on finding somebody like that?

02:13:57,730 --> 02:13:58,238
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:13:59,202 --> 02:13:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  Just.

02:13:59,874 --> 02:14:03,102
SPEAKER_0:  Really, don't give up until you find someone that, you know.

02:14:03,714 --> 02:14:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  There's so many people on the planet. I mean, there really is. There's billions of- The odds are in your favor. Of, yeah, like just don't settle and find someone that, you know-

02:14:14,050 --> 02:14:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  Makes you happy.

02:14:17,922 --> 02:14:19,838
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, just like you said, surround yourself with people.

02:14:20,546 --> 02:14:26,171
SPEAKER_1:  that make you a better person. In the same case, surround yourself with that one special person that really makes you a better person.

02:14:26,171 --> 02:14:33,438
SPEAKER_0:  And maybe that's just an entrepreneur brain looking at it. Not everyone wants to hyper-optimize their life like me, but for me to like truly love someone, they have to.

02:14:33,538 --> 02:14:35,198
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe a better person. In every way, yeah.

02:14:36,738 --> 02:14:37,662
SPEAKER_1:  Well, what do you hope?

02:14:37,922 --> 02:14:40,958
SPEAKER_1:  You're 24. We started talking about death. Let's- let's-

02:14:41,346 --> 02:14:43,998
SPEAKER_1:  Let's finish talking about death. What do you hope your legacy is?

02:14:44,322 --> 02:14:44,670
SPEAKER_1:  when you

02:14:45,090 --> 02:14:49,470
SPEAKER_1:  When we look 100 years from now and the alien, the AI has completely taken over.

02:14:49,730 --> 02:14:51,998
SPEAKER_1:  and the aliens visit and discuss with the AI.

02:14:52,514 --> 02:14:58,398
SPEAKER_1:  what this last of special humans that existed on Earth was like. What do you hope they say about you?

02:14:59,106 --> 02:14:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:15:08,834 --> 02:15:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  It's a deep one.

02:15:09,858 --> 02:15:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

02:15:11,586 --> 02:15:12,158
SPEAKER_0:  Travis, just.

02:15:12,482 --> 02:15:12,798
SPEAKER_0:  that.

02:15:14,018 --> 02:15:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  Because it's hard, right? Like I said before, Elon.

02:15:17,762 --> 02:15:19,678
SPEAKER_0:  Over double my age, I could live every second.

02:15:19,906 --> 02:15:23,806
SPEAKER_0:  I've lived up to this point in my life and still not even be Elon's age. So I have so much time.

02:15:24,098 --> 02:15:25,598
SPEAKER_0:  I just hope whatever it is that-

02:15:25,922 --> 02:15:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  It's a net positive on the world and it impacts billions of people.
