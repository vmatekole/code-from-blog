00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:03,742
SPEAKER_0:  Why weren't we pushing towards economic fusion and new materials and new...

00:00:04,098 --> 00:00:08,542
SPEAKER_0:  methods of heat extraction and so forth because everybody knew fusion was 40 years away.

00:00:09,602 --> 00:00:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  and now it's four years away.

00:00:13,442 --> 00:00:14,567
SPEAKER_0:  following is a conversation.

00:00:14,567 --> 00:00:15,614
SPEAKER_1:  with Dennis White.

00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,758
SPEAKER_1:  nuclear physicist at MIT.

00:00:17,986 --> 00:00:21,438
SPEAKER_1:  and the Director of the MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center.

00:00:22,274 --> 00:00:24,158
SPEAKER_1:  This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

00:00:24,418 --> 00:00:27,070
SPEAKER_1:  to support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:00:27,618 --> 00:00:28,926
SPEAKER_1:  And now, to your friends.

00:00:29,314 --> 00:00:30,110
SPEAKER_1:  Here's Dennis.

00:00:30,658 --> 00:00:31,102
SPEAKER_1:  white.

00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:33,566
SPEAKER_1:  Let's start with a big question.

00:00:33,794 --> 00:00:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  What is nuclear fusion? It's the underlying process that powers the universe.

00:00:38,658 --> 00:00:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  So as the name implies.

00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  It fuses together or brings together.

00:00:43,522 --> 00:00:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  to.

00:00:44,354 --> 00:00:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  different elements.

00:00:46,178 --> 00:00:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  technically nuclei.

00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  that come together.

00:00:49,122 --> 00:00:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  and if you can...

00:00:50,306 --> 00:00:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  push them together close enough that you can trigger essentially a reaction.

00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:56,478
SPEAKER_0:  What happens is that the

00:00:56,866 --> 00:01:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  The element typically changes, so this means that you change from one element to another, chemical element to another.

00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  Underlying what this means is that you change the nuclear structure.

00:01:06,626 --> 00:01:10,846
SPEAKER_0:  This rearrangement through E equals MC squared releases large amounts of energy.

00:01:11,202 --> 00:01:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  So Fusion...

00:01:12,482 --> 00:01:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  is the fusing together.

00:01:14,178 --> 00:01:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  of lighter elements into heavier elements.

00:01:17,154 --> 00:01:21,214
SPEAKER_0:  And when you go through it, you say, oh, look, so here were the initial elements.

00:01:21,442 --> 00:01:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  Typically hydrogen.

00:01:23,106 --> 00:01:25,630
SPEAKER_0:  They had a particular mass, rest mass.

00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  which means just the mass with no kinetic energy. And when you look at the product afterwards, it has less rest mass.

00:01:33,442 --> 00:01:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  And so you go, well, how is that possible? Because you have to keep mass, but mass and energy are the same thing.

00:01:38,818 --> 00:01:41,086
SPEAKER_0:  which is what E equals MC squared means.

00:01:41,378 --> 00:01:42,110
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  The conversion of this comes into kinetic energy, namely energy that you can use in some way.

00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  And that's what happens in the center of stars.

00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:55,134
SPEAKER_0:  So fusion is literally the reason life is.

00:01:55,554 --> 00:01:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  is viable in the universe.

00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,206
SPEAKER_1:  So fusion.

00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,030
SPEAKER_1:  It's happening in our sun.

00:02:00,322 --> 00:02:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  And what are the elements?

00:02:01,762 --> 00:02:02,878
SPEAKER_0:  The elements are hydrogen.

00:02:03,394 --> 00:02:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  that are coming together.

00:02:05,122 --> 00:02:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  It goes through a process which is probably gets a little bit.

00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:09,694
SPEAKER_0:  too detailed but...

00:02:09,954 --> 00:02:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  It's a somewhat-

00:02:11,874 --> 00:02:15,678
SPEAKER_0:  complex catalyzed process that happens in the center of stars.

00:02:16,098 --> 00:02:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  But in the end, stars are big balls of hydrogen, which is the lightest, the simplest element, the lightest element, the most abundant element, most of the universe is hydrogen.

00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  and it's essentially a sequence through which

00:02:28,514 --> 00:02:30,974
SPEAKER_0:  these processes occur that you end up with helium.

00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  So those are the primary things. And the reason for this is because...

00:02:35,586 --> 00:02:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  helium has features as a nucleus, like the interior part of the atom.

00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  that is extremely stable.

00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:50,238
SPEAKER_0:  And the reason for this is helium has two protons and two neutrons. These are the things that make up nuclei that make up all of us.

00:02:50,786 --> 00:02:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  along with electrons and because it has two pairs.

00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  it's extremely stable.

00:02:56,258 --> 00:02:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  And for this reason, when you convert...

00:02:59,202 --> 00:03:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  the hydrogen into helium, it just wants to stay helium and it wants to release kinetic energy. stars are

00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:10,686
SPEAKER_0:  basically conversion engines of hydrogen into helium.

00:03:11,298 --> 00:03:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  And this also tells you why you love fusion. I mean-

00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:20,190
SPEAKER_0:  because our sun will last 10 billion years approximately.

00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,238
SPEAKER_0:  That's along the fuel last.

00:03:22,978 --> 00:03:25,603
SPEAKER_1:  But to do that kind of conversion, you have to have extremely high temp-

00:03:25,603 --> 00:03:25,982
SPEAKER_0:  temperatures.

00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:32,126
SPEAKER_0:  It is one of the criteria for doing this, but it's the easiest one to understand. Why is this? It's because...

00:03:33,954 --> 00:03:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  Effectively what this requires is that these

00:03:36,738 --> 00:03:37,470
SPEAKER_0:  hydrogen.

00:03:37,986 --> 00:03:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  ions, which is really the barenucleus. So they have a positive charge. Everything has a positive charge of those ones.

00:03:45,154 --> 00:03:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  is that to get them to trigger this reaction, they must approach within.

00:03:49,858 --> 00:04:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  distances which are like the size of the nucleus itself because the nature, in fact, what it's really using is something called the strong nuclear force. There's four fundamental forces in the universe. This is the strongest one.

00:04:01,794 --> 00:04:03,678
SPEAKER_0:  But it has a strange property is that it.

00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  While it's the strongest force by far, it only has impact over distances, which are the size of a nucleus. So to get-

00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,758
SPEAKER_0:  put that into what does that mean? It's a...

00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  millionth of a billionth of a meter.

00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:21,630
SPEAKER_0:  incredibly small distances, but because the distances are small.

00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:23,262
SPEAKER_0:  and the particles have charge.

00:04:23,618 --> 00:04:28,286
SPEAKER_0:  They want to push strongly apart, namely they have repulsion that wants to push them apart.

00:04:28,642 --> 00:04:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  So it turns out when you go through the math of this.

00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  the average velocity or energy of the particles must be very high.

00:04:36,354 --> 00:04:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  to have any significant probability of the reactions happening.

00:04:40,258 --> 00:04:42,526
SPEAKER_0:  And so the center of our sun is that.

00:04:42,786 --> 00:04:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  about 20 million degrees Celsius.

00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  And on Earth, this means it's one of the first things we teach, you know, entering graduate students. Real quick.

00:04:52,098 --> 00:04:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  You can do a quick basically power balance and you can determine that on Earth it requires a minimum temperature.

00:04:58,786 --> 00:05:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  of about 50 million degrees Celsius on Earth.

00:05:02,274 --> 00:05:03,102
SPEAKER_0:  to perform fusion.

00:05:03,746 --> 00:05:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  to get enough fusion that you would be able to make, get energy gain out of it.

00:05:10,914 --> 00:05:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  So you can trigger fusion reactions at lower energy, but they become almost vanishingly small at lower temperatures than that.

00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:20,862
SPEAKER_1:  First of all, let me just link on some crazy ideas.

00:05:21,282 --> 00:05:25,342
SPEAKER_1:  uh... one the strong force just stepping out and looking at all the physics

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,190
SPEAKER_1:  Is it weird to you that there's these...

00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,462
SPEAKER_1:  forces and they're very particular.

00:05:30,882 --> 00:05:35,134
SPEAKER_1:  like it operates at a very small distance then gravity operates at a very large distance

00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,846
SPEAKER_1:  and they're all very specific than the standard model describes.

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:46,366
SPEAKER_1:  uh... three of those forces extremely well and there's and this is one of them dis особuls

00:05:46,754 --> 00:05:48,318
SPEAKER_1:  There's a big part of you that's...

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,342
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:05:49,762 --> 00:05:50,814
SPEAKER_1:  you know, an engineer.

00:05:51,426 --> 00:05:54,174
SPEAKER_1:  Did you step back and almost look at the philosophy of physics?

00:05:54,978 --> 00:06:04,542
SPEAKER_0:  So it's interesting because as a scientist, I see the universe through that lens of essentially the interesting things that we do are through the forces that get used around those.

00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  and everything works because of that.

00:06:07,682 --> 00:06:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  Richard Feynman had, I don't know if you've ever read Richard Feynman, it's a little bit of a tangent, but. He's never been on the podcast. He's never been on the podcast. He was unfortunately passed away, but one of, like a, like a hero to almost all, all physicists.

00:06:19,554 --> 00:06:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  And part of it was because of what you said, he kind of looked through a different lens at these.

00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  typically look like very dry like equations and relationships and he kind of

00:06:30,562 --> 00:06:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  I think he brought out the wonder of it in some sense, right, for those.

00:06:34,498 --> 00:06:37,566
SPEAKER_0:  he posited what would be, if you could write down a single.

00:06:38,242 --> 00:06:41,150
SPEAKER_0:  Not even really a sentence, but a single concept.

00:06:41,698 --> 00:06:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  That was the most important thing scientifically that we knew about. That in other words, you had only one thing that you could transmit like a future or past generation.

00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:57,886
SPEAKER_0:  It was very interesting. It's not what you think. It wasn't like, oh, strong nuclear force or fusion or something like this.

00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:00,670
SPEAKER_0:  And it's very profound, which was...

00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:01,278
SPEAKER_0:  Here's.

00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  the reason that matter.

00:07:04,386 --> 00:07:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  operates the way that it does is because

00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:08,542
SPEAKER_0:  All matter is made up of.

00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:12,414
SPEAKER_0:  individual particles that interact each other through forces.

00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:13,278
SPEAKER_0:  That was it.

00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  So just that atomic theory, basically. Yeah.

00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:19,230
SPEAKER_0:  Which is like, wow, that's like so simple.

00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  but it's not so simple.

00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  It's because like who thinks about atoms that they're made of?

00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:24,926
SPEAKER_0:  Like.

00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  This is a good question I give to my students. How many atoms are in your body? Like almost no students can answer this. But to me that's like a fundamental thing.

00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  By the way, it's about 10 to the 28.

00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:38,014
SPEAKER_0:  So that's, you know.

00:07:38,338 --> 00:07:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  trillion.

00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,275
SPEAKER_0:  million, trillion, trillion or something like that. Yes, yes.

00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:44,958
SPEAKER_1:  One thing is to think about the number and the other is to start to really...

00:07:45,474 --> 00:07:46,174
SPEAKER_1:  under the fag.

00:07:46,562 --> 00:07:51,701
SPEAKER_1:  that it all holds together. Yeah, it all holds together and you're actually that. You're more that than you are anything else.

00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, exactly. Yeah.

00:07:53,442 --> 00:07:58,686
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, there are people who do study such things of the fact that if you look at the...

00:07:59,138 --> 00:08:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  For example, the ratios between those fundamental forces.

00:08:02,594 --> 00:08:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  people have figured out, oh, if this ratio was different by some factor, like a factor of two or something, I was like, oh, this would all like not work.

00:08:10,082 --> 00:08:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  And you look at the sun, right? So it turns out that there are key.

00:08:14,498 --> 00:08:19,038
SPEAKER_0:  reactions that if they had slightly lower probability, no star would ever ignite.

00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:26,015
SPEAKER_0:  and then life wouldn't be possible. It does seem like the universe set things up for us.

00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:28,926
SPEAKER_1:  that it's possible to do some cool things.

00:08:29,186 --> 00:08:30,206
SPEAKER_1:  but it's challenging.

00:08:30,754 --> 00:08:32,830
SPEAKER_1:  so that it keeps it fun for us.

00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, yeah, that's the way I look at it. I mean the-

00:08:35,618 --> 00:08:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  know the multiverse model is an interesting one because there are you know quantum scientists who look at it and figure it out. It's like oh yeah.

00:08:42,914 --> 00:08:47,038
SPEAKER_0:  like quantum science perhaps tells us that there are almost an infinite variety of

00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:48,382
SPEAKER_0:  Other universes?

00:08:48,802 --> 00:08:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  But the way that it works probably is it's almost like a form of natural selection. It's like, well...

00:08:54,082 --> 00:08:56,350
SPEAKER_0:  the universes that didn't have the correct

00:08:56,802 --> 00:09:00,318
SPEAKER_0:  or interesting relationships between these forces, nothing happens in them.

00:09:01,026 --> 00:09:03,966
SPEAKER_0:  So almost by definition, the fact that we're having this conversation.

00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,814
SPEAKER_0:  means that we're in one of the interesting ones by default.

00:09:07,618 --> 00:09:17,534
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, one of the somewhat interesting, but there's probably super interesting ones where we, I tend to think of humans as incredible creatures. Our brain is an incredible creature.

00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:18,910
SPEAKER_1:  computing device but...

00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,806
SPEAKER_1:  I think we're also extremely cognitively limited, as I can imagine.

00:09:24,578 --> 00:09:27,742
SPEAKER_1:  alien civilizations that are much, much, much, much more intelligent.

00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,550
SPEAKER_1:  in ways we can't even comprehend. In terms of their ability to comprehend.

00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  to.

00:09:32,674 --> 00:09:36,318
SPEAKER_1:  construct models of the world, to do physics, and mathematics.

00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  I would see it in a slightly different way. It's actually because we have

00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  Um, we have.

00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  we have creatures that live with us on the earth that have cognition.

00:09:47,074 --> 00:09:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  that understand and move through their environment.

00:09:49,826 --> 00:09:52,254
SPEAKER_0:  but they actually see things.

00:09:52,642 --> 00:09:57,438
SPEAKER_0:  in a way, or they sense things in a way which is so fundamentally different, it's really hard.

00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:04,542
SPEAKER_0:  Like the problem is the translation, not necessarily intelligence, so it's the perception of the world. I don't know if that's what zap's supposed to be called by that name.

00:10:05,026 --> 00:10:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  And when I go and I see my dog smelling things.

00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  There's a realization that I have that he...

00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  Seize.

00:10:12,386 --> 00:10:16,798
SPEAKER_0:  or senses the world in a way that I can never, like I can't understand it because I can't.

00:10:17,026 --> 00:10:18,366
SPEAKER_0:  translate my way to this.

00:10:18,594 --> 00:10:22,014
SPEAKER_0:  We get little glimpses of this as humans though by the way because they're

00:10:22,242 --> 00:10:26,686
SPEAKER_0:  some parts of it, for example, optical information, which comes from light,

00:10:26,914 --> 00:10:31,102
SPEAKER_0:  is that now because we've developed the technology, we can actually see things.

00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  I get this as one of my areas of research is spectroscopy, so this means the study of light.

00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  And I get to quote unquote see things or representations of them from.

00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the far infrared all the way to like hard, hard X-rays, which is.

00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:49,150
SPEAKER_0:  several orders of magnitude of the

00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  of the light intensity but our own human eyes?

00:10:52,322 --> 00:10:55,166
SPEAKER_0:  Like see, a teeny teeny little sliver of this.

00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  so that even bees, for example, see a different.

00:10:58,818 --> 00:11:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  place in video so I don't.

00:11:00,418 --> 00:11:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  I think if you think of.

00:11:02,498 --> 00:11:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  there's already other intelligences around us in a way, in a limited...

00:11:07,618 --> 00:11:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  way.

00:11:08,482 --> 00:11:15,111
SPEAKER_0:  because of the way they can communicate. But it's like, those are already baffling. In many ways, yeah. It's a, if we just.

00:11:15,111 --> 00:11:18,014
SPEAKER_1:  focusing on the census there's already a lot of diversity.

00:11:18,338 --> 00:11:21,822
SPEAKER_1:  but there's probably things we're not even considering unique possibilities.

00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:22,878
SPEAKER_1:  For example,

00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,598
SPEAKER_1:  whatever the heck consciousness is.

00:11:27,362 --> 00:11:35,358
SPEAKER_1:  could actually be a door into understanding some physical phenomena we haven't even begun understanding. So just like you said, spectroscopy.

00:11:35,586 --> 00:11:38,590
SPEAKER_1:  there could be a similar kind of spectrum for consciousness that we're just like

00:11:39,234 --> 00:11:40,126
SPEAKER_1:  Or like these dumb

00:11:40,674 --> 00:11:41,374
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhh...

00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:46,398
SPEAKER_1:  descendants of apes walking around, it sure feels like something to experience the color red.

00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:47,774
SPEAKER_1:  But like we don't have...

00:11:48,386 --> 00:11:54,078
SPEAKER_1:  It's the same as in the ancient times you experience physics, you experience light. It's like, oh, it's bright and you know.

00:11:54,402 --> 00:11:56,062
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, yeah. And you construct kind of.

00:11:56,354 --> 00:12:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, semi-prolative kind of explanations. We might actually experience this faster than we thought, because we might be building.

00:12:02,594 --> 00:12:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  another kind of intelligence.

00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,678
SPEAKER_1:  and that that intelligence will explain to us.

00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  How silly we are. There was an email thread going around.

00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:19,646
SPEAKER_0:  the professors in my department already of, so what is it going to look like to figure out students have actually written their term papers?

00:12:19,874 --> 00:12:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  or it's chat, the chat GPT.

00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,566
SPEAKER_0:  Um, uh, it was.

00:12:25,986 --> 00:12:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  So as usual, we tend to be empiricists in my field. So of course they were in there like trying to figure out if it could answer like questions for a qualifying exam to get into the PhD program at MIT, which was...

00:12:40,578 --> 00:12:46,203
SPEAKER_0:  They didn't do that well at that point, but of course, this is just the beginning of it. So we have some interesting ones to go.

00:12:46,203 --> 00:12:50,703
SPEAKER_1:  and eventually both the students and the professors will be replaced by Chad GPT. Yeah.

00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  Sit on the beach.

00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  I really recommend, I don't know if you've ever seen them, it's called The Day the Universe Changed.

00:12:57,378 --> 00:12:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  Is that a movie? James Burke?

00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  He's a science historian based in the UK. He had a fairly famous series on...

00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  public television called Connections, I think it was, but the one that I really enjoyed was the day the universe changed.

00:13:12,994 --> 00:13:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  And the reason for the title of it was that...

00:13:17,058 --> 00:13:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:13:18,018 --> 00:13:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  It says the universe is what we know and perceive of it.

00:13:22,722 --> 00:13:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  So when there's a fundamental insight as to something new...

00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  The universe for us changes. Of course, the universe from an objective point of view is the same as it was before, but for us it has changed.

00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  So he walks through these.

00:13:35,362 --> 00:13:42,110
SPEAKER_0:  these moments of perception in the history of humanity that changed what we were, right?

00:13:42,818 --> 00:13:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:13:43,682 --> 00:13:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  So as I was thinking about coming to discuss this, people see fusion, oh it's still far away or we've been...

00:13:49,922 --> 00:13:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  It's been slow progress. It's like when my

00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:54,622
SPEAKER_0:  when my godmother was born.

00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,790
SPEAKER_0:  Like people had no idea how stars work.

00:13:59,394 --> 00:14:03,262
SPEAKER_0:  So you talk about like that day, that insight, the universe change is like, oh.

00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:09,502
SPEAKER_0:  This is the, I mean, and they still didn't understand all the parts of it, but you know, they basically got it. It was just like, oh.

00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  because of the... because of...

00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:17,886
SPEAKER_0:  the understanding of these processes, it's like we unveiled the reason that there can be life in the universe.

00:14:18,306 --> 00:14:23,779
SPEAKER_0:  That's probably one of those days the universe changed, right? Yeah. And that was around the 1930s. Yeah.

00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,910
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like technology is developing faster and faster and faster.

00:14:28,194 --> 00:14:32,350
SPEAKER_1:  I tend to think that just like with chat GPT, I think this year might be extremely interesting.

00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,622
SPEAKER_1:  just with how rapid

00:14:34,882 --> 00:14:38,686
SPEAKER_1:  and how profitable the efforts in artificial intelligence are.

00:14:39,714 --> 00:14:43,646
SPEAKER_1:  Just stuff will happen where our whole world is transformed like this.

00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:48,734
SPEAKER_1:  and there's a shock and then next day you kind of go on and you adjust immediately.

00:14:49,282 --> 00:14:54,494
SPEAKER_1:  uh... you probably won't have a similar kind of thing with uh... nuclear fusion with energy because there's

00:14:55,234 --> 00:15:02,846
SPEAKER_1:  probably going to be an opening ceremony and stuff. It's gonna be us. And the announcement will take months. But with digital technology, you can just have a.

00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,278
SPEAKER_1:  immediate transformation of society.

00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:06,398
SPEAKER_1:  and it would be this.

00:15:06,882 --> 00:15:13,854
SPEAKER_1:  gasp and then you kinda just, like we always do, and then you don't even remember, just like with the internet and so on, how the days were before.

00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  and how it worked before, right?

00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:17,182
SPEAKER_0:  I mean Fusion will be...

00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  because its energy, its nature is that it will be, and anything that has to do with energy use tends to be a slower transition.

00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  But they're the most.

00:15:26,306 --> 00:15:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  I would argue some of the most profound. Yes.

00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  transitions that we make. I mean the reason

00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:39,230
SPEAKER_0:  that we can live like this and sit in this building and have this podcast and people around the world at its heart is energy use.

00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  and its intense energy use.

00:15:41,378 --> 00:15:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  that came from the evolution of starting to use intense energies at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution up to now.

00:15:47,042 --> 00:15:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  It's like, it's a bedrock actually of.

00:15:49,986 --> 00:15:51,230
SPEAKER_0:  all of these, but it doesn't.

00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,638
SPEAKER_0:  tend to come overnight.

00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:15:53,634 --> 00:15:59,259
SPEAKER_1:  and some of the most important some of the most amazing technologies when we don't notice could we take it for granted is it enables the

00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:00,254
SPEAKER_0:  whole thing.

00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,718
SPEAKER_0:  Exactly, which is energy, which is...

00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:09,918
SPEAKER_0:  Amazing for how fundamental it is to our society and way of life is very poorly understood.

00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:13,982
SPEAKER_0:  concept actually, just even energy itself, people confuse.

00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  energy sources, with energy storage, with energy transmission, these are different.

00:16:20,034 --> 00:16:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  physical phenomena.

00:16:21,794 --> 00:16:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  which are very important. So for example,

00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  You know, you buy an electric car and you go, oh good, I have an emission free car.

00:16:30,146 --> 00:16:30,558
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:16:31,106 --> 00:16:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  Ah, ah, but it's like so-

00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  So why do you say that? Well, it's because if I draw the circle around the car, I have electricity and it doesn't emit anything.

00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,166
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, but you plug that into a grid where you follow that wire back.

00:16:43,394 --> 00:16:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  there could be a coal power plant.

00:16:45,122 --> 00:16:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  or a gas power plant.

00:16:46,594 --> 00:16:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  at the end of that.

00:16:47,522 --> 00:16:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, really?

00:16:48,738 --> 00:16:50,782
SPEAKER_0:  You mean so this isn't like carbon free? I don't know.

00:16:51,426 --> 00:16:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  And it's not their fault, they don't.

00:16:54,914 --> 00:17:00,638
SPEAKER_0:  Like the car isn't a source of energy. The underlying source of energy was the combustion of the fuel back somewhere.

00:17:00,898 --> 00:17:03,230
SPEAKER_1:  Plus there's also a story of how the

00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:05,342
SPEAKER_1:  Raw materials are mine.

00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,038
SPEAKER_1:  in which parts of the world.

00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,854
SPEAKER_1:  uh... with the sort of basic respect or

00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:18,238
SPEAKER_1:  or a deep disrespect of human rights that happens in that money. So the whole supply chain, there's a story there that's deeper than just a particular electric car with a circle around it.

00:17:18,498 --> 00:17:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  in the physics or the science of it too is the energy use.

00:17:21,538 --> 00:17:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  that it takes to do that digging up, which is also important in all that.

00:17:25,314 --> 00:17:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, anyway, so.

00:17:26,882 --> 00:17:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. We wandered away from fusion, but yes. Oh, it's a beautiful stroll. It's very important actually in the context of this just because

00:17:34,626 --> 00:17:37,342
SPEAKER_0:  Now those of us who work in infusion and these...

00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  other kinds of disruptive energy.

00:17:41,154 --> 00:17:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  technologies.

00:17:42,306 --> 00:17:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  It's interesting that I do think about like what would it, what is it going to mean to society to have an energy source that is like this.

00:17:49,922 --> 00:17:55,102
SPEAKER_0:  that would be like fusion, which has such completely different characteristics.

00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,550
SPEAKER_0:  For example, free unlimited access to the fuel.

00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  but it has technology implications. So what does this mean geopolitically? What does it mean?

00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  for how we distribute wealth within our society.

00:18:09,474 --> 00:18:10,878
SPEAKER_0:  It's very difficult to know.

00:18:11,362 --> 00:18:13,237
SPEAKER_0:  but probably profound. yeah

00:18:13,237 --> 00:18:15,134
SPEAKER_1:  have to find another reason to start wars.

00:18:15,746 --> 00:18:18,311
SPEAKER_1:  uh... numbers instead of resources

00:18:18,311 --> 00:18:23,561
SPEAKER_0:  We've done a pretty good job of that over the course of our history.

00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:35,678
SPEAKER_1:  So we talked about the forces of physics and again sticking to the philosophical before we get to the specific technical stuff. E equals MC squared you mentioned. How amazing is that to you? That energy and mass are the same.

00:18:36,706 --> 00:18:38,174
SPEAKER_1:  And what does that have to do with nuclear fusion?

00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  So it has to do with everything we do. It's the fact that energy and mass are equivalent to each other. They're just.

00:18:44,898 --> 00:18:49,086
SPEAKER_0:  The way we usually comment to it is that they're just energy just in different forms.

00:18:49,506 --> 00:18:50,526
SPEAKER_0:  Can you intuitively?

00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:51,774
SPEAKER_1:  Understand that?

00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:52,382
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  But it takes a long time.

00:18:55,778 --> 00:18:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  Hi.

00:18:57,186 --> 00:19:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  I haven't for a while, but often I teach the...

00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:04,158
SPEAKER_0:  the introductory class for.

00:19:04,386 --> 00:19:06,398
SPEAKER_0:  incoming nuclear engineers and

00:19:06,722 --> 00:19:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  And so we put this up as an equation and we go through many...

00:19:09,762 --> 00:19:11,934
SPEAKER_0:  iterations of using this.

00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,582
SPEAKER_0:  how you derive it, how you use it, and so forth.

00:19:16,002 --> 00:19:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  And then usually in the final exam, I would give, I would basically take all the equations that I've used before and I flip it around. Like basically...

00:19:24,194 --> 00:19:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  instead of thinking about energy is equal to mass, it's sort of mass is equal to energy. I ask the question in a different way.

00:19:30,818 --> 00:19:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  And usually about half the students don't get it. It takes a while.

00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,030
SPEAKER_0:  is to get that intuition, yeah.

00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  Um, so.

00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  So in the end, it's interesting is that this is actually the source of all free energy because that energy that we're talking about is kinetic energy if it can be transformed for mass. So is it about even...?

00:19:49,378 --> 00:19:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  Even though we used equals MC squared, this was burning coal.

00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:58,110
SPEAKER_0:  and burning gas and burning wood is actually still equals MC squared.

00:19:58,594 --> 00:20:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  The problem is that you would never know this because the relative change in the mass is incredibly small.

00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  By the way, which comes back to fusion, which is that.

00:20:07,234 --> 00:20:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  E equals MC squared. Okay, so what does this mean? It tells you that the

00:20:10,754 --> 00:20:15,934
SPEAKER_0:  the amount of energy that is liberated in a particular reaction when you change mass.

00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  has to, because C squared is that's the speed of light squared. It's a large number. It's a very large number and it's totally constant everywhere in the universe, which is. Which is another weird thing. Which is another weird thing. And in all rest frames and the, actually, the relativity stuff gets more difficult conceptually until you get through. Anyway, so you go, you go to that and.

00:20:35,682 --> 00:20:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  And what that tells you is that it's the relative change in the mass will tell you about the relative amount of energy that's liberated.

00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  And this is what makes fusion and you asked about fission as well too. This is what makes.

00:20:47,426 --> 00:20:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  them extraordinary. It's because the relative change in the mass is very large.

00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  as compared to what you get, like in a chemical reaction.

00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,878
SPEAKER_0:  In fact, it's about 10 million times larger.

00:21:00,386 --> 00:21:05,726
SPEAKER_0:  And that is at the heart of why you use something like Fusion. It's because...

00:21:06,018 --> 00:21:09,790
SPEAKER_0:  That is a fundamental of nature. Like you can't beat that.

00:21:10,466 --> 00:21:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  So of whatever you do, if you're thinking about, and why do I care about this? Well, because mass is like the fuel.

00:21:17,538 --> 00:21:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  So this means gathering.

00:21:19,266 --> 00:21:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  the resources that it takes to gather a fuel, to hold it together, to deal with it, is the environmental impact it would have.

00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:29,438
SPEAKER_0:  and fusion will always have 20 million times.

00:21:29,698 --> 00:21:32,382
SPEAKER_0:  the amount of energy released per reaction.

00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,654
SPEAKER_0:  that you can do those. So this is why.

00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  We consider it the ultimate environmentally friendly energy source, it was because of that.

00:21:40,226 --> 00:21:41,246
SPEAKER_1:  So is it...

00:21:41,698 --> 00:21:44,030
SPEAKER_1:  Is it correct to think of mass broadly?

00:21:44,354 --> 00:21:46,398
SPEAKER_1:  as a kind of storage of energy. Yes problem.

00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:49,822
SPEAKER_1:  You mentioned its environmentally friendly soil.

00:21:50,914 --> 00:21:54,430
SPEAKER_1:  Nuclear fusion is a source of energy. It's cheap, clean, safe.

00:21:54,882 --> 00:21:59,134
SPEAKER_1:  So easy access to fuel and virtual unlimited supply, no production of greenhouse gases.

00:21:59,426 --> 00:22:01,950
SPEAKER_1:  little radioactive waste produced.

00:22:02,274 --> 00:22:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  allegedly. Can you sort of elaborate?

00:22:05,794 --> 00:22:07,454
SPEAKER_1:  why it's cheap, clean, and safe.

00:22:07,682 --> 00:22:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  I'll start with the easiest one, cheap. It is not cheap yet.

00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:17,342
SPEAKER_0:  because it hasn't been made at a commercial scale. Mine flies when you're having fun. Yes.

00:22:18,434 --> 00:22:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  But yes, not yet. We'll talk about it. We'll come back to that because this is-

00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  cheaper or more technically correct term that is economically interesting is

00:22:30,786 --> 00:22:34,686
SPEAKER_0:  is really the primary challenge actually of fusion at this point.

00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:38,641
SPEAKER_0:  But I think we can get back to that. So what were the other ones you said?

00:22:38,641 --> 00:22:43,038
SPEAKER_1:  So actually when we're talking about cheap, we're thinking like asymptotically.

00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,766
SPEAKER_1:  You take it forward.

00:22:45,186 --> 00:22:47,166
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. It's a hundred years.

00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:48,510
SPEAKER_1:  that's sort of

00:22:48,898 --> 00:22:49,598
SPEAKER_1:  because of

00:22:50,274 --> 00:22:53,649
SPEAKER_1:  how much availability there is of resources to use. of the fuel.

00:22:53,649 --> 00:22:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  the fuel. We should separate those two. The fuel is already cheap. It's basically free.

00:23:00,258 --> 00:23:02,206
SPEAKER_0:  What do you mean by basically free?

00:23:02,626 --> 00:23:06,974
SPEAKER_0:  If we were to be using fusion fuel sources to power.

00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  your, and it's like, that's all we had was fusion power plants around and we were doing it.

00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  The fuel cost per person are something like 10 cents a year.

00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  It's like, it's free.

00:23:17,474 --> 00:23:19,742
SPEAKER_0:  This is why it's hard to, in some ways, I think.

00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  It's hard to understand fusion because people see this and go, oh, if the fuel is free, this means the energy source is free because we're used to energy sources like this. So we, you know, we spend resources and drill to get gas or oil or we chop wood or we make coal, or these things, right?

00:23:38,114 --> 00:23:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  So fusion, this is what makes fusion. And it's also.

00:23:41,986 --> 00:23:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  It's not an intermittent renewable energy source like wind and solar.

00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:51,262
SPEAKER_0:  This makes it hard to understand. So as you're saying, the fuel is free. Why isn't the-

00:23:51,714 --> 00:23:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  Like why isn't the energy source free?

00:23:53,762 --> 00:23:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  And it's because...

00:23:55,106 --> 00:23:59,358
SPEAKER_0:  of the necessary technologies which must be applied.

00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  to basically recreate the conditions which are in stars.

00:24:03,362 --> 00:24:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  In the center of stars in fact. So there's only one natural place in the universe that fusion energy occurs.

00:24:10,594 --> 00:24:12,382
SPEAKER_0:  that's in the center of stars.

00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  So that's going to bring a price to it, depending on.

00:24:16,738 --> 00:24:23,911
SPEAKER_0:  the cost and sorry, the size and complexity of the technology that's needed to recreate those things. We'll talk about the details.

00:24:23,911 --> 00:24:29,911
SPEAKER_1:  of technologies and which parts might be expensive today and which parts might be expensive in two hundred years

00:24:29,911 --> 00:24:30,462
SPEAKER_0:  Exactly.

00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  it will have a revolution, I'm certain of it.

00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  So about clean, so clean is.

00:24:36,962 --> 00:24:45,182
SPEAKER_0:  At its heart, what it does is convert, it basically converts hydrogen into its heavier forms of hydrogen.

00:24:45,506 --> 00:24:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:24:46,242 --> 00:24:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  predominant one that we use on earth.

00:24:48,418 --> 00:24:50,366
SPEAKER_0:  and converts it into helium.

00:24:50,594 --> 00:24:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  and some other products but primarily helium is the product that's left behind. Department of Health.

00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  safe inert gas, you know.

00:24:57,794 --> 00:25:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  In fact, that's actually what our sun is doing, is eventually going to extinguish itself because it'll just make so much helium.

00:25:03,682 --> 00:25:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  It doesn't do that.

00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  in that sense, clean because there's no

00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:09,790
SPEAKER_0:  There's no emissions of...

00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  of carbon or pollutants that come

00:25:12,322 --> 00:25:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  directly from the combustion of the fuel itself.

00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  and safe. Safe, yeah.

00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  We're talking about very high temperatures. Yeah. Yeah. So this is also the counterintuitive thing. So I told you temperatures, which like 50 million degrees or

00:25:26,786 --> 00:25:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  It actually tends to be more like about 100 million degrees is really what we aim.

00:25:31,234 --> 00:25:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  So how can 100 million degrees be safe?

00:25:33,794 --> 00:25:36,254
SPEAKER_0:  And it's safe because it is.

00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  This is so much hotter than anything on Earth, where everything on Earth is at around 300 Kelvin, that's around a few tens of degrees Celsius.

00:25:46,434 --> 00:25:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:25:47,138 --> 00:25:51,646
SPEAKER_0:  What this means is that in order to get a medium to those temperatures

00:25:51,938 --> 00:25:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  You have to completely isolate it from anything to do with terrestrial environment.

00:25:56,866 --> 00:26:00,574
SPEAKER_0:  It can have no contact like with anything on earth basically.

00:26:00,898 --> 00:26:04,702
SPEAKER_0:  So this means, this is the technology that I just described.

00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  is it fundamentally what it does is it takes this fuel.

00:26:08,674 --> 00:26:17,347
SPEAKER_0:  And, uh, it isolates it from any terrestrial conditions so that it has no idea it's on earth. It's not touching any object that's at room temperature in.

00:26:17,347 --> 00:26:18,097
SPEAKER_1:  walls of the

00:26:18,097 --> 00:26:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  Even including the walls of the containment building or containment device or even air or anything like this.

00:26:25,826 --> 00:26:27,838
SPEAKER_0:  So it's that part.

00:26:28,098 --> 00:26:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  that makes it safe and there's actually another aspect to it.

00:26:32,482 --> 00:26:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  That fundamental part makes it so safe.

00:26:35,426 --> 00:26:37,886
SPEAKER_0:  In the main lines.

00:26:38,658 --> 00:26:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  approach diffusion is also that it's very hot.

00:26:42,242 --> 00:26:44,606
SPEAKER_0:  where there's very, very few particles.

00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  in at any time in the thing that would be the power plant. Actually the more correct way to do it is you say, there's very...

00:26:52,002 --> 00:26:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  few particles.

00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,846
SPEAKER_0:  per unit volume.

00:26:55,074 --> 00:26:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  cubic centimeter and cubic meter, so we can do this. So right now we're.

00:26:59,074 --> 00:27:03,870
SPEAKER_0:  Although we don't think of air really as a, there's atoms floating around us and there's a density.

00:27:04,162 --> 00:27:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  because if I wave my hand, I can feel the air pushing against my face. That means we're in a fluid or a gas which is around us.

00:27:11,554 --> 00:27:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  that has a particular.

00:27:13,058 --> 00:27:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  number of atoms per cubic meter.

00:27:16,834 --> 00:27:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  So it's about, this actually turns out to be 10 to the 25th. So this is one with 25 zeros behind it.

00:27:22,882 --> 00:27:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  per cubic meter. So we can figure out like cubic meters about like this, the volume of this table, like the whole volume of this table.

00:27:30,018 --> 00:27:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  Um, okay, very good. So like fusion.

00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  There's a few of those. So fusion, like the mainstream one of fusion, like what we're working on at MIT will have a hundred thousand times less particles.

00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  per unit volume than that.

00:27:45,282 --> 00:27:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  This is very interesting because it's extraordinarily hot, 100 million degrees.

00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  but it's very tenuous.

00:27:52,418 --> 00:27:55,454
SPEAKER_0:  and what matters from the engineering and safety point of view.

00:27:55,778 --> 00:27:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  is the amount of

00:27:57,218 --> 00:27:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  Energy which is stored.

00:27:59,074 --> 00:28:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  per unit volume.

00:28:00,514 --> 00:28:02,334
SPEAKER_0:  because this tells you about the

00:28:02,562 --> 00:28:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  the scenarios and that's what you worry about because when those kinds of energies are released.

00:28:08,194 --> 00:28:11,262
SPEAKER_0:  Suddenly, it's like what would be the consequences, right?

00:28:11,618 --> 00:28:14,078
SPEAKER_0:  So the consequences of this are essentially zero.

00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,222
SPEAKER_0:  because that's less.

00:28:16,514 --> 00:28:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  energy content than boiling water.

00:28:20,162 --> 00:28:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  Because of the low density. Because of the low density. So if you take.

00:28:24,194 --> 00:28:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  water is at about a hundred million to a billion times more dense.

00:28:28,866 --> 00:28:29,438
SPEAKER_0:  than this.

00:28:29,986 --> 00:28:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  So even though it's at much lower.

00:28:32,162 --> 00:28:32,862
SPEAKER_0:  temperature.

00:28:33,154 --> 00:28:35,614
SPEAKER_0:  It's actually still, it has more energy content.

00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,374
SPEAKER_0:  So if for this reason...

00:28:37,762 --> 00:28:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  One of the ways that I explain this is that if you imagine a power plant that's like powering Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:28:44,962 --> 00:28:51,262
SPEAKER_0:  If you were to, which you wouldn't do this directly, but if you went like this on it, it actually extinguishes the fusion.

00:28:52,162 --> 00:28:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  because it gets too cold.

00:28:54,146 --> 00:28:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  immediately.

00:28:55,682 --> 00:28:55,998
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:28:56,322 --> 00:29:02,046
SPEAKER_0:  That's the other one. The other part is that it does not, because it works by staying hot.

00:29:02,402 --> 00:29:07,678
SPEAKER_0:  rather than a chain reaction, it can't run out of control. That's the other part of it. So by the way, this is what-

00:29:08,226 --> 00:29:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  very much distinguishes it from fission. It's not a process that can run away from you because it's basically thermally stable.

00:29:15,266 --> 00:29:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  What does thermostable mean? That means is that you want to run it at the optimization in temperature such that if it deviates away from that temperature, the reactivity gets lower.

00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:31,879
SPEAKER_0:  And the reason for this is because it's hard to keep the reactivity going. Like it's a very hard fire to keep going basically.

00:29:31,879 --> 00:29:37,095
SPEAKER_1:  doesn't run away from you. It can't run away from you. How difficult is the control there to keep it at that?

00:29:37,095 --> 00:29:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  It varies from concept to concept, but in general it's fairly easy to do that. And the easiest thing, it can't physically run away from you because the other part of it is that there's just...

00:29:49,442 --> 00:29:52,894
SPEAKER_0:  at any given time there's a very, very small amount of fuel.

00:29:53,154 --> 00:29:56,542
SPEAKER_0:  available to fuse it anyway. So this means that

00:29:56,898 --> 00:30:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  That's always intrinsically limited to this. So even if the power consumption of the device goes up, it just kind of burns itself out immediately. Yeah.

00:30:05,442 --> 00:30:11,774
SPEAKER_1:  So you are the, just to take another tangent on a tangent, you're the director of MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Center.ánh

00:30:12,226 --> 00:30:12,798
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,174
SPEAKER_1:  we'll talk about.

00:30:14,594 --> 00:30:18,174
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe you can mention some interesting aspects of the history of the center.

00:30:18,786 --> 00:30:20,254
SPEAKER_1:  in the broader history.

00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:30,750
SPEAKER_1:  of MIT and maybe brought a history of science and engineering and the history of human civilization, but also just the link on the safety aspect.

00:30:32,738 --> 00:30:34,366
SPEAKER_1:  How do you prevent?

00:30:34,914 --> 00:30:38,014
SPEAKER_1:  some of the amazing reactors that you're designing.

00:30:38,978 --> 00:30:42,622
SPEAKER_1:  How do you prevent from destroying all of human civilization in the process?

00:30:42,914 --> 00:30:44,039
SPEAKER_1:  What's the safety problem?

00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  Fusion is interesting because it's not really directly weaponizable because

00:30:50,274 --> 00:30:58,878
SPEAKER_0:  What I mean by that is that you have to work very hard to make these conditions which you can get energy gain from fusion.

00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:07,422
SPEAKER_0:  And this means that when we design these devices with respect to application in the energy field.

00:31:07,906 --> 00:31:08,926
SPEAKER_0:  is that they...

00:31:09,346 --> 00:31:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  You know, you...

00:31:10,978 --> 00:31:13,278
SPEAKER_0:  while they will...

00:31:13,506 --> 00:31:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  Because they're producing large amounts of power and they will have hot things inside of them, this means that they have like a level of industrial hazard, which is very similar to what you would have like in a chemical processing plant.

00:31:25,154 --> 00:31:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  anything like that and any kind of energy plant actually has these as well too.

00:31:29,378 --> 00:31:32,510
SPEAKER_0:  but the underlying, underneath it core technology.

00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:40,318
SPEAKER_0:  like can't be directly used in a nefarious way because of the power that's being emitted. Just basically..

00:31:40,962 --> 00:31:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  If you try to do those things, typically it just stops working.

00:31:43,586 --> 00:31:48,542
SPEAKER_1:  So the safety concerns have to do with just regular things that, uh, like equipment malfunctioning.

00:31:48,994 --> 00:31:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:31:50,594 --> 00:31:54,238
SPEAKER_1:  melting of a quick like all all this kind of stuff that has nothing to do with fusion.

00:31:54,402 --> 00:32:00,926
SPEAKER_0:  necessarily. I mean, usually what we worry about is the viability because in the end we build pretty complex objects.

00:32:01,346 --> 00:32:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  to realize these requirements. So what we try.

00:32:04,738 --> 00:32:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  really hard to do is like not damage those components, but those are things which are internal to the

00:32:10,498 --> 00:32:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  to the Fusion device and this is not something that you would...

00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  consider about like it would, as you say, destroy human civilization because that release of energy is just inherently limited because of the fusion process.

00:32:23,778 --> 00:32:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  So it doesn't say that there's zero.

00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  So you asked about the other feature of it that it's safe. So it is.

00:32:28,834 --> 00:32:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  The process itself is intrinsically safe.

00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:37,662
SPEAKER_0:  but because it's a complex technology, you still have to take into consideration aspects of the safety.

00:32:38,018 --> 00:32:41,406
SPEAKER_0:  So it produces ionizing radiation instantaneously.

00:32:41,698 --> 00:32:44,254
SPEAKER_0:  So you have to take care of this, which means that you shield it.

00:32:44,706 --> 00:32:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  Think of like your dental x-rays or treatments for cancer and things like this. We always shield ourselves from this.

00:32:50,946 --> 00:32:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  So we get the beneficial effects, but we minimize the harmful effects of those.

00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  So there are all those aspects of it as well too.

00:32:58,146 --> 00:33:04,766
SPEAKER_1:  So we'll return to MIT's Plasma Science and Field Center, but let us linger on the destruction of human civilization.

00:33:05,154 --> 00:33:08,382
SPEAKER_1:  Which brings us to the topic of nuclear fission. What is that?

00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,334
SPEAKER_1:  What are some of the process?

00:33:10,754 --> 00:33:13,502
SPEAKER_1:  that is inside nuclear weapons.

00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:14,951
SPEAKER_1:  and current nuclear power.

00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  plants.

00:33:16,098 --> 00:33:19,134
SPEAKER_0:  So it relies on the same underlying.

00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:22,206
SPEAKER_0:  physical principle, but it's exactly the opposite.

00:33:22,562 --> 00:33:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  which actually the names imply. Fusion means bringing things together. Fission means splitting things apart.

00:33:28,866 --> 00:33:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:32,702
SPEAKER_0:  Fission requires the heaviest.

00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  instead of the lightest.

00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  and the most unstable versus the most stable.

00:33:38,114 --> 00:33:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  elements. So this tends to be uranium.

00:33:40,834 --> 00:33:44,254
SPEAKER_0:  or plutonium, primarily uranium. So take uranium.

00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:50,366
SPEAKER_0:  So uranium-235 is one of the, this is one of the heaviest unstable elements. And what happens?

00:33:50,882 --> 00:33:58,398
SPEAKER_0:  is that this is, and fission is triggered by the fact that one of these subatomic particles, is a neutron which has no electric charge.

00:33:58,978 --> 00:34:01,630
SPEAKER_0:  basically gets in proximity enough to this.

00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:06,654
SPEAKER_0:  and triggers an instability effectively inside of this.

00:34:07,106 --> 00:34:09,502
SPEAKER_0:  on the border of instability.

00:34:09,794 --> 00:34:11,262
SPEAKER_0:  and basically splits it apart.

00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:14,782
SPEAKER_0:  And that's the fission, right? The fissioning.

00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  And so when that happens...

00:34:17,442 --> 00:34:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  because the products that are

00:34:20,578 --> 00:34:27,742
SPEAKER_0:  and it roughly splits in two, but it's not even that. It's actually more complex. It splits into this whole array of lighter elements and nuclei.

00:34:28,194 --> 00:34:29,726
SPEAKER_0:  And when that happens...

00:34:30,146 --> 00:34:32,094
SPEAKER_0:  there's less rest mass.

00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  laugh than the original one. So it's actually the same, so it's again, it's rearrangement of the strong nuclear force.

00:34:41,186 --> 00:34:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  that's happening.

00:34:42,434 --> 00:34:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:51,806
SPEAKER_0:  But that's the source of energy. And so in the end, it's like, so this is a famous graph that we show everybody is basically, it turns out every

00:34:52,066 --> 00:34:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  element that exists in the periodic table, all the things that make up everything.

00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:57,118
SPEAKER_0:  how...

00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  Remember you asked a good question. It was like, so should we think of mass as being the same as stored energy?

00:35:03,138 --> 00:35:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  So you can make a plot that basically shows the relative amount of stored energy.

00:35:10,146 --> 00:35:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  and all of the elements that are stable and make up basically the world, okay, and the universe.

00:35:15,426 --> 00:35:17,854
SPEAKER_0:  And it turns out that this one has...

00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  a maximum amount of stability or storage at iron.

00:35:24,162 --> 00:35:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  So it's kind of in the middle of the periodic table because this goes from, you know, it's roughly that.

00:35:29,698 --> 00:35:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  And so what that means is that if...

00:35:33,602 --> 00:35:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:35:34,402 --> 00:35:39,774
SPEAKER_0:  If you take something heavier than iron, like uranium, which is more than twice as heavy than that...

00:35:40,098 --> 00:35:45,054
SPEAKER_0:  and you split apart, somehow just magically, you just split apart as constituents when you get something that's lighter.

00:35:45,314 --> 00:35:50,782
SPEAKER_0:  that will, because it moves to a more stable energy state, it releases kinetic energy. That's the energy that we use.

00:35:51,074 --> 00:35:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  Kinetic energy meaning the movement of things. So it's actually an energy you can do something with.

00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  And fusion.

00:35:57,314 --> 00:36:04,638
SPEAKER_0:  It sits on the other side of that because it's also moving towards iron, but it has to do it through fusion together.

00:36:05,218 --> 00:36:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  So this leads to some pretty profound differences. As I said, they have some underlying.

00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:12,574
SPEAKER_0:  physics or science.

00:36:13,186 --> 00:36:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  proximity to each other, but they're literally the opposite. so fusion

00:36:18,018 --> 00:36:23,422
SPEAKER_0:  Why is this? It actually goes into practical implications of it, which is that fission can happen at room temperature.

00:36:24,162 --> 00:36:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  It's because this neutron has no

00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  electric charge and therefore it's literally room temperature neutrons.

00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  that actually trigger the reaction. So this means.

00:36:34,242 --> 00:36:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  in order to establish.

00:36:36,802 --> 00:36:39,646
SPEAKER_0:  what's going on with it and it works by chain reaction.

00:36:39,874 --> 00:36:43,806
SPEAKER_0:  is that you can do this at room temperature. So Enrico Fermi did this like on a-

00:36:44,066 --> 00:36:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  on a university campus, University of Chicago campus.

00:36:47,202 --> 00:36:48,254
SPEAKER_0:  The first sustained.

00:36:48,546 --> 00:36:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  you know chain reaction was done underneath a squash core.

00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  with a big blocks of graphite, it was still, don't get me wrong, an incredible human achievement, right?

00:36:57,794 --> 00:37:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  But that's, you know, and then you think about fusion, I have to build a contraption of some kind that's going to get to a hundred million degrees. Okay, wow, that's a big difference.

00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  The other one is about the chain reaction that namely fission.

00:37:10,338 --> 00:37:11,518
SPEAKER_0:  works by the fact that

00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  When that fission occurs, it actually produces free neutrons.

00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  free neutrons, particularly if they get slowed down to room temperature.

00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  can trigger other fission reactions if there's other uranium nearby or fissometers.

00:37:26,434 --> 00:37:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  So this means that the way that it releases energy is that you set this up in a very careful way.

00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:35,742
SPEAKER_0:  such that every, on average, every reaction that happens.

00:37:36,002 --> 00:37:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  exactly releases enough neutrons and slows down that they actually make another reaction, exactly one.

00:37:42,402 --> 00:37:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  And what this means is that because each reaction releases a fixed amount of energy, you do this and then in time, this looks like just a constant power output. So that's how our fission power plant.

00:37:52,066 --> 00:37:56,191
SPEAKER_1:  And so their control of the chain reactions is extremely difficult and extremely important.

00:37:56,191 --> 00:38:01,790
SPEAKER_0:  It's very important. And when you intentionally design it, that it creates more than one,

00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  vision reaction.

00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:07,006
SPEAKER_0:  per starting reaction that it exponentiates away.

00:38:08,162 --> 00:38:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  But which is what a nuclear weapon is.

00:38:10,402 --> 00:38:15,614
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so how does an atomic weapon work? How does a hydrogen bomb work? Asking for a friend.

00:38:15,746 --> 00:38:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, so at its heart, what you do is you very quickly put together.

00:38:23,842 --> 00:38:27,998
SPEAKER_0:  enough of these materials that can undergo fission with room temperature neutrons.

00:38:28,386 --> 00:38:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  and you put them together fast enough that what happens is that the

00:38:31,746 --> 00:38:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  this process can essentially grow mathematically like very fast.

00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  And so this releases large amounts of energy. That's the underlying.

00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  reason that it works.

00:38:42,466 --> 00:38:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  So you've heard of a fusion weapon.

00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:49,918
SPEAKER_0:  This is interesting, but it's dislike fusion energy in the sense that what happens

00:38:50,306 --> 00:38:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  is that you're using.

00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:59,774
SPEAKER_0:  fusion reactions, but it simply increases the gain actually of the weapon rather than it's not a pure.

00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  at its heart it's still a fission.

00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:09,278
SPEAKER_0:  You're just using fusion reactions as a sort of intermediate catalyst basically to get even more energy out of it.

00:39:10,242 --> 00:39:14,046
SPEAKER_0:  but it's not directly applicable to be used in energy source.

00:39:14,818 --> 00:39:16,158
SPEAKER_1:  Does it terrify you?

00:39:16,514 --> 00:39:20,158
SPEAKER_1:  Just again, to step back at the philosophical, the humans.

00:39:20,578 --> 00:39:22,142
SPEAKER_1:  I've been able to use physics and...

00:39:23,234 --> 00:39:24,926
SPEAKER_1:  engineering to create.

00:39:25,346 --> 00:39:26,334
SPEAKER_1:  such powerful.

00:39:26,658 --> 00:39:27,262
SPEAKER_0:  weapons.

00:39:28,418 --> 00:39:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  I wouldn't say terrify, I mean we should be...

00:39:32,482 --> 00:39:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  This is the progress of humanity. Every time that we've gone-

00:39:37,026 --> 00:39:39,710
SPEAKER_0:  access the day the universe changed.

00:39:40,098 --> 00:39:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  This was really changed when we got access to new kinds of energy sources. But every time you get access, and typically what this meant was you get access.

00:39:48,866 --> 00:39:54,622
SPEAKER_0:  to more intense energy, right? And that's what that was. And so the ability to move from burning wood.

00:39:55,234 --> 00:39:56,990
SPEAKER_0:  to using coal, to using...

00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  gasoline and petrol and then finally to use this is that

00:40:02,114 --> 00:40:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  is that both the potency and the consequences are elevated.

00:40:06,754 --> 00:40:08,629
SPEAKER_0:  around those things. It's just like you.

00:40:08,629 --> 00:40:09,758
SPEAKER_1:  said the.

00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:14,046
SPEAKER_1:  the way that fusion, nuclear fusion, would change the world.

00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:15,646
SPEAKER_1:  I don't think.

00:40:16,194 --> 00:40:22,046
SPEAKER_1:  Unless we think really deeply, we'll be able to anticipate some of the things we can create. There's going to be a lot of amazing stuff.

00:40:22,338 --> 00:40:24,510
SPEAKER_1:  But then that amazing stuff is going to enable.

00:40:25,026 --> 00:40:26,622
SPEAKER_1:  more amazing stuff and more.

00:40:26,978 --> 00:40:27,902
SPEAKER_1:  unfortunately or

00:40:28,578 --> 00:40:31,678
SPEAKER_1:  Depending how you see it more powerful weapons

00:40:31,874 --> 00:40:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  Well, yeah, but see, that's the thing.

00:40:33,858 --> 00:40:36,094
SPEAKER_0:  Fusion breaks that trend.

00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  in the following way.

00:40:38,626 --> 00:40:41,150
SPEAKER_0:  one of them so fusion doesn't work on a chain.

00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:44,062
SPEAKER_0:  There's no chain reaction, zero.

00:40:44,578 --> 00:40:48,638
SPEAKER_0:  So this means it cannot physically exponentiate away on you because it works.

00:40:49,154 --> 00:40:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  And actually this is why stars, by the way, we know this already, it's why stars are so stable, why most stars and suns are so stable.

00:40:57,026 --> 00:40:57,758
SPEAKER_0:  It's because...

00:40:58,082 --> 00:41:01,886
SPEAKER_0:  They are regulated through their own temperature when they're heating.

00:41:02,722 --> 00:41:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  because what's happening is not that there's some probability of this exponentiating away, is that the energy that's being released by fusion basically is keeping the fire hot.

00:41:11,746 --> 00:41:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  And these tend to be, you know, and when it comes down to thermodynamics and things like this, there's a reason, for example, it's pretty easy to keep a constant temperature like in an oven and things like this. It's the same thing.

00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  infusion.

00:41:24,546 --> 00:41:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  So this is actually one of the features that I would argue fusion breaks the

00:41:29,346 --> 00:41:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  What breaks the trend of this is that it's...

00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  It has more energy intensity than fission on paper.

00:41:36,706 --> 00:41:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  but it actually does not have the consequences of control and sort of rapid release of the energy because it's actually

00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  The physical system just doesn't want to do that.

00:41:47,746 --> 00:41:48,871
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, we're gonna have to look else-

00:41:48,871 --> 00:41:49,502
SPEAKER_1:  I swear.

00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:52,382
SPEAKER_1:  the weapons with which we fight World War III.

00:41:53,602 --> 00:41:54,142
SPEAKER_1:  Fair enough.

00:41:54,434 --> 00:41:55,262
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, so...

00:41:56,834 --> 00:41:57,982
SPEAKER_1:  What is plasma?

00:41:58,306 --> 00:42:05,086
SPEAKER_1:  That you may have may have not mentioned you mentioned ions and electrons and so on so what is plasma? What is the role of plasma in nuclear fusion?

00:42:06,018 --> 00:42:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  So plasma is a phase of matter or state of matter.

00:42:10,626 --> 00:42:12,350
SPEAKER_0:  Unfortunately, our schools don't.

00:42:12,802 --> 00:42:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  It's like, I'm not sure why this is the case, but it all-

00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  children learn the three phases of matter.

00:42:18,978 --> 00:42:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  And what does this mean? So we'll take water as an example.

00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:26,430
SPEAKER_0:  If it's cold, it's ice, it's in a solid phase.

00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  And then if you heat it up, it's the temperature that typically depends.

00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:33,534
SPEAKER_0:  sets the phase, although it's not only temperature.

00:42:33,954 --> 00:42:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  So you heat it up.

00:42:35,106 --> 00:42:40,798
SPEAKER_0:  And you go to a liquid and obviously it changes its physical properties because it can, you can pour it and so forth, right?

00:42:41,122 --> 00:42:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  And then if you heat this up enough, it turns into a gas.

00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:46,110
SPEAKER_0:  and a gas behaves differently because

00:42:46,434 --> 00:42:56,990
SPEAKER_0:  There's a very sudden change in the density, actually that's what's happening. So it changes by about a factor of 10,000 in density from the liquid phase into when you make it into steam at atmospheric pressure.

00:42:57,346 --> 00:42:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  All very good.

00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:02,942
SPEAKER_0:  except the problem is they forgot like what happens if you just keep elevating the temperature

00:43:03,426 --> 00:43:04,551
SPEAKER_0:  You don't want to give kids ideas.

00:43:04,551 --> 00:43:07,551
SPEAKER_1:  is. I'm gonna start experimenting and I'm gonna start...

00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:16,510
SPEAKER_0:  heating up the gas. It's good to start doing it anyway. So you, it turns out that once you get above it's approximately five or ten thousand degrees Celsius.

00:43:16,866 --> 00:43:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  then you hit a new phase of matter. And actually that's the phase of matter that is for all.

00:43:21,378 --> 00:43:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  pretty much all the temperatures that are above that as well too.

00:43:24,706 --> 00:43:25,246
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:43:25,698 --> 00:43:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  and so what does that mean? So it actually changes, so it's a different state of matter. And the reason...

00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  that it becomes a different state of matter is that it's hot enough.

00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  that what happens is that the atoms that make up, remember go back to Feynman, right? Everything's made up of these.

00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  individual things, these atoms.

00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:46,654
SPEAKER_0:  atoms can actually themselves be

00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  which are made of.

00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  nuclei which contain the positive

00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:55,198
SPEAKER_0:  particles in the neutrons and then the electrons.

00:43:55,554 --> 00:44:00,382
SPEAKER_0:  which are very, very light, very much less mass than the nucleus.

00:44:00,642 --> 00:44:02,750
SPEAKER_0:  and that surrounds us. This is what makes up an atom.

00:44:03,234 --> 00:44:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  So a plasma is what happens when you start.

00:44:05,954 --> 00:44:09,310
SPEAKER_0:  pulling away enough of those electrons that they're free.

00:44:09,762 --> 00:44:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  from the ions, so almost all the atoms that make us up and this water and all that, the electrons are in tightly bound states and basically they're extremely stable. Once you're at about 5,000 or 10,000 degrees, you start pulling off the electrons.

00:44:23,554 --> 00:44:25,214
SPEAKER_0:  And what this means is that now...

00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  the medium that is there.

00:44:27,426 --> 00:44:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  its constituent particles mostly have net charge.

00:44:31,714 --> 00:44:34,398
SPEAKER_0:  So why does that matter? It's because now-

00:44:34,754 --> 00:44:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  This means that the particles can interact.

00:44:37,346 --> 00:44:42,686
SPEAKER_0:  through their electric charge. In some sense they were when it was in the atom as well too. But now that they're free particles.

00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:50,590
SPEAKER_0:  This means that they start, it fundamentally changes the behavior. It doesn't behave like a gas, it doesn't behave like a solid or a liquid, it behaves like a plasma.

00:44:51,394 --> 00:44:51,806
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:44:52,194 --> 00:44:59,230
SPEAKER_0:  So why is it disappointing that we don't speak about this? Because 99% of the universe is in the plasma state.

00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  is called stars.

00:45:01,346 --> 00:45:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  and in fact our own son.

00:45:03,138 --> 00:45:06,014
SPEAKER_0:  At the center of the sun is clearly a plasma.

00:45:06,434 --> 00:45:11,678
SPEAKER_0:  But actually the surface of the sun, which is around 5500 Celsius, is also a plasma.

00:45:12,866 --> 00:45:19,006
SPEAKER_0:  it's hot enough that is that. In fact, the things that you see, sometimes you see these pictures from the surface of the sun, amazing.

00:45:19,618 --> 00:45:22,814
SPEAKER_0:  like satellite photographs of like those big arms of.

00:45:23,106 --> 00:45:27,198
SPEAKER_0:  things in of light coming off of the surface of the sun and solar flares, those are plasmas.

00:45:27,682 --> 00:45:29,470
SPEAKER_1:  What are some interesting ways that this...

00:45:29,858 --> 00:45:31,806
SPEAKER_1:  force theta matter is different than gas.

00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  Let's go to how a gas works. Right. So the reason a gas, and it goes back to Feynman's brilliance in saying that this is the most important concept.

00:45:39,618 --> 00:45:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  The reason actually solid, liquid and gas phases work is because the nature of the interaction between the atoms changes.

00:45:47,714 --> 00:45:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  And so in a gas...

00:45:49,186 --> 00:45:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  You can think of this as being

00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:53,470
SPEAKER_0:  this room and the things, although you can't see them.

00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:55,102
SPEAKER_0:  is that the molecules are

00:45:55,874 --> 00:45:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  flying around.

00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  but then with some frequency they basically bounce into each other.

00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  and when they bounce into each other, the exchange.

00:46:04,034 --> 00:46:05,182
SPEAKER_0:  momentum and energy.

00:46:05,826 --> 00:46:06,494
SPEAKER_0:  around on this.

00:46:07,362 --> 00:46:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  And so it turns out that the probability and the distances and the scattering.

00:46:12,322 --> 00:46:14,046
SPEAKER_0:  of those and what they do.

00:46:14,274 --> 00:46:19,070
SPEAKER_0:  It's those interactions that set the, about how a gas behaves.

00:46:19,362 --> 00:46:21,854
SPEAKER_0:  So what do you mean by this? For example, if I take a-

00:46:22,242 --> 00:46:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  an imaginary test particle of some kind, like I spray.

00:46:26,466 --> 00:46:30,366
SPEAKER_0:  something into the air that's got a particular color. In fact, you can do it in liquids as well too.

00:46:31,074 --> 00:46:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  how it gradually will disperse.

00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:35,646
SPEAKER_0:  away from you? This is

00:46:35,874 --> 00:46:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  This is fundamentally sad.

00:46:37,858 --> 00:46:41,233
SPEAKER_0:  because of the way that those particles are bouncing into each other.

00:46:41,233 --> 00:46:41,983
SPEAKER_1:  more celebrities of those?"

00:46:41,983 --> 00:46:46,430
SPEAKER_0:  The rate that they go at and the distance that they go at and so forth.

00:46:46,658 --> 00:46:51,998
SPEAKER_0:  So this was figured out by Einstein and others at the beginning of the Brownian motion, all these kinds of things.

00:46:52,258 --> 00:46:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  These were set up at the beginning of the last century and was really like...

00:46:56,834 --> 00:47:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  this great revelation, wow, this is why matter behaves the way that it does. like wow lively.

00:47:01,762 --> 00:47:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:47:03,042 --> 00:47:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  So, but it's really like, and also in liquids and in solids, like what really matters is

00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:12,478
SPEAKER_0:  is how you're interacting with your nearest neighbor.

00:47:13,474 --> 00:47:19,230
SPEAKER_0:  So you think about that one, the gas particles are basically going around until they actually hit into each other though.

00:47:19,522 --> 00:47:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  They don't really exchange information. And it's the same in a liquid, you're kind of beside each other, but you can kind of move around. In a solid, you're literally like stuck beside your neighbor, you can't move.

00:47:29,826 --> 00:47:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  Plasmas are weird in the sense that it's not like that.

00:47:34,146 --> 00:47:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  So it is because the particles have electric charge.

00:47:37,762 --> 00:47:40,446
SPEAKER_0:  This means that they can push against each other.

00:47:40,706 --> 00:47:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  without actually being in close proximity to each other.

00:47:44,322 --> 00:47:47,422
SPEAKER_0:  That's not an infinitely true statement.

00:47:47,682 --> 00:47:55,102
SPEAKER_0:  If he goes get this a little bit more technical, but basically this means that you can start having action or exchange of information at a distance.

00:47:55,938 --> 00:48:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  And that's in fact the definition of a plasma, that it says, these have a technical name, it's called a Coulomb collision, which just means that it's dictated by this.

00:48:03,362 --> 00:48:04,894
SPEAKER_0:  force which is being pushed between.

00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  charge particles.

00:48:06,594 --> 00:48:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  is that the definition of a plasma is a medium.

00:48:10,626 --> 00:48:15,390
SPEAKER_0:  in which the collective behavior is dominated by these collisions at a distance.

00:48:16,066 --> 00:48:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  So you can imagine, then this starts to give you some strange.

00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:20,734
SPEAKER_0:  behaviors.

00:48:21,474 --> 00:48:22,078
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:27,998
SPEAKER_0:  which I could quickly talk about like, one of the most counterintuitive ones is

00:48:28,354 --> 00:48:29,630
SPEAKER_0:  as plasmas get

00:48:29,858 --> 00:48:31,070
SPEAKER_0:  More hot.

00:48:31,586 --> 00:48:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  as they get higher in temperature.

00:48:33,634 --> 00:48:35,870
SPEAKER_0:  then the collisions happen less frequently.

00:48:37,218 --> 00:48:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  Like what?

00:48:38,306 --> 00:48:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  That doesn't make any sense. When particles go faster, you think they would collide more often.

00:48:43,426 --> 00:48:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  But because...

00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  the particles are interacting through their electric field.

00:48:48,418 --> 00:48:51,230
SPEAKER_0:  When they're going faster, they actually spend less time.

00:48:51,714 --> 00:48:57,886
SPEAKER_0:  in the influential field of each other, and so they talk to each other less in an energy and momentum exchange point of view.

00:48:58,466 --> 00:49:03,934
SPEAKER_0:  It's just, we're just one of the count, one of the counterintuitive aspects of plasmas, which is probably very.

00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:04,414
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:49:04,866 --> 00:49:05,991
SPEAKER_1:  relevant for nuclear f-

00:49:05,991 --> 00:49:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, exactly.

00:49:07,394 --> 00:49:09,566
SPEAKER_1:  So if I can try to summarize.

00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:12,030
SPEAKER_1:  What a nuclear fusion reactor.

00:49:12,386 --> 00:49:13,406
SPEAKER_1:  is supposed to do.

00:49:14,402 --> 00:49:14,942
SPEAKER_1:  So...

00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:17,662
SPEAKER_1:  You have what a couple of elements.

00:49:18,018 --> 00:49:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  what are you doing the elements using deuterium and tritium which are the heavy forms of hydrogen

00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:24,574
SPEAKER_1:  hydrogen. You have those and you start heating it.

00:49:25,666 --> 00:49:28,291
SPEAKER_1:  And then as you start heating it, I forgot the temperatures.

00:49:28,291 --> 00:49:36,855
SPEAKER_0:  said, but it becomes plasma. No, first, first it becomes. Oh, first it becomes plasma. So it's a gas and then it turns into a plasma at about 10,000 degrees. And then.

00:49:36,855 --> 00:49:39,486
SPEAKER_1:  We have a bunch of electrons and ions flying around.

00:49:39,874 --> 00:49:41,438
SPEAKER_1:  and then you keep heating the thing.

00:49:42,306 --> 00:49:50,181
SPEAKER_1:  And I guess as you heat the thing, the ions hit each other rarer and rarer. Yes. Oh man, that's not fun. You have to keep.

00:49:50,181 --> 00:49:50,931
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

00:49:50,931 --> 00:49:51,710
SPEAKER_1:  eating it.

00:49:52,034 --> 00:49:52,638
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:49:53,154 --> 00:49:57,694
SPEAKER_1:  such that you have to keep hitting into the probability of them colliding.

00:49:58,498 --> 00:49:59,774
SPEAKER_1:  becomes reasonably high.

00:50:00,098 --> 00:50:00,542
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:50:00,834 --> 00:50:02,709
SPEAKER_0:  So also on top of that and sorry to

00:50:02,709 --> 00:50:03,294
SPEAKER_1:  interrupt.

00:50:03,938 --> 00:50:04,670
SPEAKER_1:  You have to.

00:50:05,186 --> 00:50:07,811
SPEAKER_1:  prevent them from hitting the walls of their

00:50:07,811 --> 00:50:08,702
SPEAKER_0:  reactor.

00:50:09,186 --> 00:50:10,526
SPEAKER_0:  So you asked about the root.

00:50:10,754 --> 00:50:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  the definitions of the requirements for fusion.

00:50:13,922 --> 00:50:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  So the most famous one, or in some sense, the most intuitive one is the temperature.

00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,582
SPEAKER_0:  And the reason for that is that

00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:24,254
SPEAKER_0:  you can make many, many kinds of plasmas that have zero fusion going on.

00:50:24,962 --> 00:50:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  And the reason for this is that the

00:50:27,106 --> 00:50:31,806
SPEAKER_0:  average, so you can make a plasma at around 10,000. Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  By the way, you're welcome to come to our laboratory at the PSFC, I can show you a demonstration of a plasma that you can see with your eyes and sit at about 10,000 degrees.

00:50:42,082 --> 00:50:46,526
SPEAKER_0:  You can put your hand up beside it and all this and it's like, and nothing, there's zero fusion going on.

00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:48,615
SPEAKER_0:  So you have, as I will.

00:50:48,615 --> 00:50:50,865
SPEAKER_1:  was the temperature of the plasma? About 10,000 degrees. So that means city chyba moldipSIK13 is a nuclear reaction.

00:50:50,865 --> 00:50:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  stick your hand in? Well, you can stick your hand into it, but there's a glass tube. You can basically see this. See it right there....

00:50:56,866 --> 00:51:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  And you can put your hand on the glass too, because it's. What's the colors?

00:51:00,514 --> 00:51:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  It's purple.keeping it for theOOOOOOм

00:51:02,402 --> 00:51:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  Let's move from.

00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  It is kind of beautiful. Yeah, plasmas are actually quite astonishing sometimes in their beauty.

00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  Actually, one of the most amazing forms of plasma is lightning, by the way, which is an instantaneous form of plasma that exists on Earth but immediately goes away because everything else around it is at room temperature.

00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, so there's different requirements in this. So making a plasma takes a-

00:51:25,378 --> 00:51:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  about this, but at 10,000 degrees, even at a million degrees...

00:51:29,858 --> 00:51:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  there's almost no probability of the fusion reactions occurring. and this is because

00:51:35,394 --> 00:51:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  While the charged particles can hit into each other.

00:51:38,818 --> 00:51:41,822
SPEAKER_0:  If you go back to the very beginning of this, remember I said...

00:51:42,146 --> 00:51:43,646
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, these charged particles.

00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:47,102
SPEAKER_0:  have to get to within distances which are like this.

00:51:47,874 --> 00:51:50,718
SPEAKER_0:  size of a nucleus because of the strong nuclear force.

00:51:51,202 --> 00:51:51,902
SPEAKER_0:  Well...

00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,662
SPEAKER_0:  Unfortunately...

00:51:54,018 --> 00:51:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  as the particles get closer,

00:51:56,162 --> 00:51:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  This, the repulsion that comes from the

00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:00,542
SPEAKER_0:  Charge the coulomb force.

00:52:00,962 --> 00:52:04,094
SPEAKER_0:  increases like the inverse distance squared.

00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:08,542
SPEAKER_0:  So as they get closer, they're pushing harder and harder apart.

00:52:09,442 --> 00:52:14,206
SPEAKER_0:  Then it gets a little bit more exotic, which maybe you'll like though, that it turns out that people...

00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:15,806
SPEAKER_0:  understood this and um

00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  at the beginning of the...

00:52:18,626 --> 00:52:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  of the age after Rutherford discovered the nucleus. It was like, oh yeah, it was like, how's this going to work, right?

00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  Because how do you get anything within these distances? Inquire…

00:52:29,026 --> 00:52:33,598
SPEAKER_0:  extraordinary energy and it does and in fact when you look at those energies they're very, very high.

00:52:34,178 --> 00:52:34,654
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:52:34,946 --> 00:52:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  But it turns out quantum physics comes to the rescue.

00:52:38,434 --> 00:52:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  because the particles aren't

00:52:40,546 --> 00:52:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  aren't actually just particles, they're also waves. This is the point of quantum, right? You can treat them both as waves and as...

00:52:47,586 --> 00:52:48,414
SPEAKER_0:  as particles.

00:52:48,674 --> 00:52:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  And it turns out if you get

00:52:50,594 --> 00:52:53,214
SPEAKER_0:  if they get in close enough proximity to each other.

00:52:53,634 --> 00:52:54,174
SPEAKER_0:  Then

00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  The

00:52:55,778 --> 00:52:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  Dynasty

00:52:56,834 --> 00:52:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  pops through.

00:52:58,178 --> 00:53:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  basically this energy barrier through an effect called quantum tunneling.

00:53:02,818 --> 00:53:05,886
SPEAKER_0:  which is really just the transposition of the fact that it's a wave.

00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:08,350
SPEAKER_0:  so that it has a finite probability of this.

00:53:08,674 --> 00:53:28,894
SPEAKER_0:  It's, it's, by the way, you talk about like, do you have a hard time like conceptualizing this? These are, this is one of them. It's quantum tunnel is one of them. Yeah. This is like throwing a ping pong ball, like at a piece of paper and then every like, you know, 100 of them just like magically show up on the other side of the paper without seemingly breaking the paper. I mean, to use a physical analogy.

00:53:29,154 --> 00:53:34,779
SPEAKER_1:  And that phenomenon is critical for the function of nuclear fusion.

00:53:34,779 --> 00:53:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  for all kinds of fusions so this

00:53:37,378 --> 00:53:40,478
SPEAKER_0:  This is the reason why stars can work as well too. Like the pr-

00:53:40,802 --> 00:53:46,430
SPEAKER_0:  Stars would have to be much, much hotter actually to be able to... In fact, it's not clear that they would actually ignite.

00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:49,022
SPEAKER_0:  In fact, without this effect.

00:53:49,474 --> 00:53:57,182
SPEAKER_0:  So we get to that. So this is why there's another requirement. It's not, so you must make a plasma, but you also must get it very hot.

00:53:57,474 --> 00:54:01,534
SPEAKER_0:  in order for the reactions to have a significant probability to actually fuse.

00:54:01,858 --> 00:54:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  and it actually falls effectively almost to zero for lower temperatures.

00:54:05,666 --> 00:54:06,494
SPEAKER_0:  as well too.

00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:11,902
SPEAKER_1:  So there's some nice equation that gets you to 50 million degrees.

00:54:12,706 --> 00:54:14,238
SPEAKER_1:  or like a... Yeah,

00:54:14,466 --> 00:54:16,341
SPEAKER_1:  The order you said practically speak.

00:54:16,341 --> 00:54:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  making a hundred million. It's a really simple equation. It's the ideal gas law basically almost always in the end you've got a

00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  certain.

00:54:23,266 --> 00:54:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  number of these fusion particles in the plasma state. They're in the plasma state. There's a certain number of particles.

00:54:29,314 --> 00:54:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  And if the confinement is perfect, if you put in a certain content of energy, then basically, eventually they just...

00:54:35,234 --> 00:54:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  they come up in a temperature.

00:54:36,994 --> 00:54:40,126
SPEAKER_0:  and they go up to high temperature.

00:54:40,386 --> 00:54:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  This turns out to be, by the way, extraordinarily small amounts of energy.

00:54:45,666 --> 00:54:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  And you go, what? It's like I'm getting something to like a hundred million degrees. That's going to take the biggest.

00:54:50,626 --> 00:54:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  that I've ever seen.

00:54:52,546 --> 00:54:53,246
SPEAKER_0:  No.

00:54:54,242 --> 00:54:57,790
SPEAKER_0:  And the reason for this is it goes back to the energy content.

00:54:58,178 --> 00:54:59,038
SPEAKER_0:  of this.

00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  So yeah, you have to get it to high average energy.

00:55:03,458 --> 00:55:06,083
SPEAKER_0:  But there's very, very few particles.

00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:08,821
SPEAKER_1:  low density. How do you get it to be low density?

00:55:08,821 --> 00:55:16,030
SPEAKER_0:  in the reactor is this. So the way that you do this is primarily, again, this is not exactly true in all kinds of fusion, but

00:55:16,386 --> 00:55:29,310
SPEAKER_0:  And the, in the primary one that we work on magnetic fusion, this is all happening in a hard vacuum, so it's like it's happening in outer space. So basically you've gotten rid of all the other particles except for these specialized. So you had them one at a time.

00:55:30,018 --> 00:55:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  No, actually it's even easier than that. You connect a gas valve.

00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:37,982
SPEAKER_0:  and you basically leak gas into it in a controlled fashion. Yeah.

00:55:39,234 --> 00:55:43,070
SPEAKER_0:  This is beautiful. It's a gas cylinder. How do you get it from hitting the walls?

00:55:43,938 --> 00:55:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  So now you've touched on the other necessary requirements. So it turns out it's not just temperature that's required.

00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  You must also confine it.

00:55:51,778 --> 00:55:52,903
SPEAKER_0:  So what does this mean? What does this mean?

00:55:52,903 --> 00:55:55,903
SPEAKER_1:  And there's two types of confinement as you mentioned, you mentioned the magnetic.

00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  Magnetic one.

00:55:57,346 --> 00:55:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  There's one called inertial as well too.

00:55:59,906 --> 00:56:02,366
SPEAKER_0:  But the general principle actually has nothing to do with

00:56:02,882 --> 00:56:07,550
SPEAKER_0:  in particular with what the technology is that you use to confine it.

00:56:08,162 --> 00:56:09,278
SPEAKER_0:  It's because...

00:56:09,954 --> 00:56:15,518
SPEAKER_0:  This goes back to the fact that the requirement in this is high temperature and thermal content.

00:56:15,906 --> 00:56:17,182
SPEAKER_0:  So it's like building a fire.

00:56:18,178 --> 00:56:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  And what this means is that if you, when you release the energy...

00:56:22,914 --> 00:56:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  into this or apply heat to this.

00:56:25,858 --> 00:56:29,054
SPEAKER_0:  If it just instantly leaks out, it can never get hot, right?

00:56:29,378 --> 00:56:46,430
SPEAKER_0:  So you're familiar with this as like, you've got something that you're, you're, you're trying to apply heat to, but you're just throwing the heat away very quickly. This is why we insulate homes by the way, and things like this, right? It's like, you don't want the heat that's coming into this room to just immediately leave because you'll just start consuming infinite amounts of heat to try to keep it hot.

00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:52,446
SPEAKER_0:  So in the end, this is one of the requirements, and it actually has a name. We call the energy confinement time.

00:56:53,026 --> 00:56:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  So this means if you release a certain amount of energy into this fuel.

00:56:57,026 --> 00:56:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:56:57,794 --> 00:56:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  kind of.

00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  how long does it take for this energy to leave the system? So you could imagine that in this room...

00:57:05,506 --> 00:57:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  that these heaters are putting energy into the air in this room and you waited for a day, but all the heat have gone to outside. If I open up the windows, that's energy confinement time. Okay, so it's the same concept as that.

00:57:16,674 --> 00:57:20,542
SPEAKER_0:  So this is an important one. So all fusion must have confinement.

00:57:21,506 --> 00:57:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  There's another more esoteric reason for this, which is that

00:57:25,538 --> 00:57:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  people often confuse temperature and energy.

00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:29,918
SPEAKER_0:  So what I mean by that.

00:57:30,178 --> 00:57:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  So this is literally a temperature, which means that it is a-

00:57:33,954 --> 00:57:37,150
SPEAKER_0:  system in which all the particles, every particle...

00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  has high kinetic energy and is actually in a fully relaxed state, namely that entropy has been maximized. It gets a little bit more technical, but this means that basically it is.

00:57:47,618 --> 00:57:58,206
SPEAKER_0:  It is a thermal system. So it's like the air in this room, it's like the water, it's the water in this. These all have temperatures, which means that there's a distribution of those energies because the particles have collided so much that it's there.

00:57:58,562 --> 00:57:59,198
SPEAKER_0:  So we.

00:57:59,586 --> 00:58:05,918
SPEAKER_0:  This is distinguished from having high energy particles, like what we have in particle accelerators, like CERN and so forth.

00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:07,358
SPEAKER_0:  Those are...

00:58:08,002 --> 00:58:12,350
SPEAKER_0:  high kinetic energy but it's not a temperature so it actually doesn't count as confinement.

00:58:12,642 --> 00:58:13,694
SPEAKER_0:  So we go through all of those.

00:58:14,018 --> 00:58:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  You have temperature and then the other requirement, not too surprising is actually that there has to be enough.

00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  density of the fuel.

00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  Enough, but not too much. Enough, but not too much, yes. And so.

00:58:26,178 --> 00:58:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  in the end.

00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:35,742
SPEAKER_0:  The way that there's a fancy name for it is called the Lawson Criterion because it was formulated by scientists in the United Kingdom.

00:58:36,258 --> 00:58:39,102
SPEAKER_0:  about 1956 or 1957.

00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  And this was essentially the realization of, oh, this is what it's going to take, regardless of the confinement method.

00:58:45,506 --> 00:58:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  These are, this is the basic, what it is actually power balances just says

00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  Oh.

00:58:50,434 --> 00:58:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  There's a certain amount of heat coming in, which is coming from the fusion reaction itself.

00:58:54,882 --> 00:58:57,246
SPEAKER_0:  because the fusion reaction heats the fuel.

00:58:57,730 --> 00:58:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  versus how fast you would lose it.

00:59:00,354 --> 00:59:06,270
SPEAKER_0:  and it basically summarized by those three parameters, which is fairly simple. So temperature,

00:59:07,042 --> 00:59:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  And then the reason we say 100 million degrees is because...

00:59:11,042 --> 00:59:12,190
SPEAKER_0:  almost always in-

00:59:12,802 --> 00:59:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  And for this kind of fusion, deuterium tritium fusion, the minimum and the density and the confinement time product is at about a hundred million. So you almost always design your device around that minimum.

00:59:23,298 --> 00:59:25,310
SPEAKER_0:  and then you try to get it contained well enough.

00:59:25,666 --> 00:59:27,390
SPEAKER_0:  and you try to get enough density. So

00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:29,758
SPEAKER_0:  You know, so that temperature thing sounds.

00:59:29,986 --> 00:59:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  Crazy.

00:59:30,914 --> 00:59:34,814
SPEAKER_0:  That's what we've actually achieved in the laboratory, like our experiment here.

00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:37,854
SPEAKER_0:  at MIT when it ran its optimum configuration.

00:59:38,338 --> 00:59:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  It was at 100 million degrees.

00:59:40,482 --> 00:59:44,542
SPEAKER_0:  but it wasn't actually the product of the density in the confinement time.

00:59:44,802 --> 00:59:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  wasn't sufficient that we were at a place that we were getting.

00:59:47,522 --> 00:59:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  high net energy gain.

00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  but it was making fusion reactions.

00:59:51,458 --> 00:59:54,270
SPEAKER_0:  So this is the sequence that you go through, make a plasma.

00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  then you get it hot enough.

00:59:56,258 --> 01:00:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  and when you get it hot enough, the fusion reactions start happening so rapidly.

01:00:00,546 --> 01:00:04,702
SPEAKER_0:  that it's overcoming the rate at which it's leaking heat to the outside world.

01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:07,070
SPEAKER_0:  and at some point it just becomes like a star.

01:00:07,682 --> 01:00:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  Like a sun.

01:00:08,962 --> 01:00:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  and our own sun and a star doesn't have anything plugged into it. It's just keeping itself hot through its own fusion reactions.

01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:19,111
SPEAKER_0:  In the end, that's really close to what a fusion power plant would look like. What does it visually look like?

01:00:19,111 --> 01:00:22,302
SPEAKER_1:  like does it does it look like like you said like purple plasma

01:00:22,754 --> 01:00:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, actually it's invisible to the eye because it's so hot that it's basically emitting light in frequencies that we can't detect.

01:00:30,594 --> 01:00:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  It's literal, it's invisible.

01:00:32,418 --> 01:00:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  Ha ha!

01:00:33,442 --> 01:00:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  In fact, light goes through it, visible light goes through it so easy that if you were to look at it, what you would see...

01:00:39,106 --> 01:00:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  In our own particular configuration, what we make is in the end is a donut shaped, it's a vacuum vessel to keep the air out of it.

01:00:46,818 --> 01:00:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  And when you turn on the plasma, it gets so hot that most of it just disappears in the visible spectrum.

01:00:52,802 --> 01:00:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  You can't see anything.

01:00:54,018 --> 01:00:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  and there's very, very cold plasma.

01:00:56,834 --> 01:00:59,326
SPEAKER_0:  which is between 10 and 100,000 degrees.

01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  which is out in the very periphery of it, which is kind of...

01:01:02,658 --> 01:01:05,822
SPEAKER_0:  So the very cold plasma is allowed to interact with the...

01:01:06,434 --> 01:01:14,238
SPEAKER_0:  and kind of has to interact with something eventually at the boundary of the vacuum vessel. And this kind of makes a little halo around it and it glows this beautiful purple.

01:01:14,466 --> 01:01:21,607
SPEAKER_0:  light basically and these are that's the that's the that's what we can sense in the human spectrum. I remember..

01:01:21,607 --> 01:01:24,574
SPEAKER_1:  reading on the subreddit called Shower Thoughts.

01:01:25,282 --> 01:01:30,942
SPEAKER_1:  I wish people should check out. It's just fascinating philosophical ideas that strike you while you're in the shower.

01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:32,190
SPEAKER_1:  And one of them was

01:01:32,514 --> 01:01:36,382
SPEAKER_1:  It's lucky that fire, when it burns...

01:01:36,994 --> 01:01:41,630
SPEAKER_1:  communicates that it's hot using visible light. Otherwise, humans would be screwed.

01:01:42,306 --> 01:01:46,431
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if there's a deep profound truth to that, but nevertheless, I did find it in store.

01:01:46,431 --> 01:01:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  thought subreddit. Actually, I do have the- thanks for watching

01:01:49,154 --> 01:01:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  This goes off in a bit of, you're right, this is actually, it's interesting.

01:01:53,378 --> 01:02:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  Because as a scientist, you also think about evolutionary functions and how we got, like why do we have the senses that we do? Yeah. Interesting question.

01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:03,358
SPEAKER_0:  It's like why can bees see an ultraviolet and we can't?

01:02:03,906 --> 01:02:11,102
SPEAKER_0:  then you go, well, it's natural selection. For some reason, this wasn't really particularly important to us, right? Why can't we see in the infrared and other things can? It's like, hmm.

01:02:13,122 --> 01:02:23,326
SPEAKER_0:  It's a fascinating question, right? Obviously there's some advantage that you have there that isn't there and even color distinguishing, right? Of something safe to ease, whatever it would be.

01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:28,990
SPEAKER_0:  I'll actually go back to this because it's something that I tell all of my students when I'm teaching.

01:02:29,314 --> 01:02:32,350
SPEAKER_0:  ionizing radiation and radiological safety.

01:02:32,866 --> 01:02:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  Whatever you say, there's a cultural.

01:02:35,074 --> 01:02:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  concern or...

01:02:36,514 --> 01:02:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  than when people hear the word radiation. Like, what does this mean? It literally just means light.

01:02:41,346 --> 01:02:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  is what it means, right?

01:02:43,138 --> 01:02:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  but it's light in different parts of the spectrum.

01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  All right.

01:02:46,434 --> 01:02:51,262
SPEAKER_0:  And so it turns out besides the visible light that we can see here, we are immersed.

01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:54,718
SPEAKER_0:  in almost the totality of the electromagnetic spectrum.

01:02:55,426 --> 01:02:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  There's visible light, there's infrared light.

01:02:58,082 --> 01:03:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  There is microwaves going around, as that's how our cell phone works. It's way past our detection capability.

01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  but also higher energy ones, which have to do with ultraviolet light, how you get a sunburn.

01:03:10,818 --> 01:03:25,950
SPEAKER_0:  And even x-rays and things like this at small levels are continually being like from the concrete in the walls of this hotel, there's x-rays hitting our body continuously. I can bring out a, we can go down to the lab at MIT, you can bring out a detector and show you every single room we'll have.

01:03:26,242 --> 01:03:27,367
SPEAKER_0:  and have these by our bo-

01:03:27,367 --> 01:03:28,867
SPEAKER_1:  Why do you mean the 10th of the 28th?

01:03:28,867 --> 01:03:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  atoms and they're coming in and they're interacting with those things.

01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  And those particularly the ones where the light is at higher average energy per light particle.

01:03:39,682 --> 01:03:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  Those are the ones that can possibly have an effect on human health.

01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:44,190
SPEAKER_0:  So we...

01:03:44,482 --> 01:03:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  It's interesting humans and all animals of

01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  evolved on Earth where we're immersed in that all the time.

01:03:51,266 --> 01:03:55,966
SPEAKER_0:  There's natural source of radiation all the time, yet we have zero ability to detect it.

01:03:56,354 --> 01:03:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  like zero.

01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:58,695
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, and our ability.

01:03:58,695 --> 01:04:00,414
SPEAKER_1:  cognitive ability to filter it all out.

01:04:00,802 --> 01:04:01,182
SPEAKER_1:  and not

01:04:01,346 --> 01:04:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  It would probably overwhelm us actually, if we could see all of it. But my main point is, goes back to your thing about fire and self-protection.

01:04:08,482 --> 01:04:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  if ionizing radiation was such a critical aspect of the health of organisms on earth.

01:04:14,882 --> 01:04:18,366
SPEAKER_0:  We would almost certainly have evolved methods to detect it, and we have none.

01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  Ha ha ha!

01:04:20,226 --> 01:04:21,927
SPEAKER_0:  And yes, the physical world.

01:04:21,927 --> 01:04:26,846
SPEAKER_1:  that's all around is so incredible. You're blowing my mind Dr. Dennis White. Okay.

01:04:27,362 --> 01:04:34,110
SPEAKER_1:  Let's say you have experience with magnetic confinement. You have experience with inertial confinement. Most of your work has been in magnetic confinement.

01:04:34,594 --> 01:04:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  but let's sort of.

01:04:36,162 --> 01:04:36,830
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:04:37,218 --> 01:04:42,974
SPEAKER_1:  talk about the sexy recent thing for a bit of a time. There's been a breakthrough in the news.

01:04:43,618 --> 01:04:44,318
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:04:45,026 --> 01:04:49,022
SPEAKER_1:  that laser-based inertial confinement was used by DOEs.

01:04:49,506 --> 01:04:53,566
SPEAKER_1:  National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

01:04:53,826 --> 01:04:56,318
SPEAKER_1:  Can you explain this breakthrough that happened in December? 왔어

01:04:57,154 --> 01:05:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  So it goes to the set of criteria that I talked about before about getting.

01:05:02,594 --> 01:05:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  high energy gain.

01:05:04,642 --> 01:05:05,726
SPEAKER_0:  So in the end...

01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:09,150
SPEAKER_0:  What are we after in fusion is that we...

01:05:09,602 --> 01:05:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  We basically assemble this plasma fuel in some way.

01:05:13,506 --> 01:05:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  and we provided a starting amount of energy. Think of lighting the fire.

01:05:18,274 --> 01:05:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  And what you want to do is get back significant excess gain from the fact that the fusion is releasing the energy.

01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  So it's like the equivalent of like...

01:05:30,338 --> 01:05:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  We want to have a match, a small match, light a fire, and then the fire keeps us hot.

01:05:35,426 --> 01:05:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  very much like that.

01:05:37,538 --> 01:05:42,846
SPEAKER_0:  And so as I said, we've made many of the, and what do we mean by we? It's like the fusion community has pursued.

01:05:43,074 --> 01:05:46,878
SPEAKER_0:  aspects of this through a variety of different confinement methodologies.

01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  Um, is that the.

01:05:49,186 --> 01:05:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:05:50,082 --> 01:05:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  the key part about what happens.

01:05:52,834 --> 01:06:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  What was the threshold we had never gotten over before was that if you only consider the plasma fuel, not the total engineering system, but just the plasma fuel itself.

01:06:02,754 --> 01:06:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  We had not gotten to the point yet where...

01:06:05,282 --> 01:06:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  basically the size of the match

01:06:07,682 --> 01:06:11,902
SPEAKER_0:  was smaller than the amount of energy that we got from the future.

01:06:12,514 --> 01:06:13,662
SPEAKER_1:  Is there a good term for...

01:06:13,986 --> 01:06:15,390
SPEAKER_1:  when the output

01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:16,958
SPEAKER_1:  is greater than the input.

01:06:17,154 --> 01:06:22,878
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, yes, there is. Well, there's several special definitions of this. So one of them is that

01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:26,430
SPEAKER_0:  If you, if you like in a fire, if you laid a match.

01:06:26,818 --> 01:06:32,702
SPEAKER_0:  and you have it there and it's an infinitesimal amount of energy compared to what you're getting out of the fire. We call this ignition.

01:06:33,282 --> 01:06:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  Which makes sense, right? This is like what our own son is as well too.

01:06:37,474 --> 01:06:40,670
SPEAKER_0:  So that was not ignition in that sense as well too.

01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  So what we call this is scientific, the one that I just talked about, which is for some instance.

01:06:46,818 --> 01:06:48,158
SPEAKER_0:  when I get enough fusion.

01:06:48,418 --> 01:06:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  energy released compared to the size of the match.

01:06:51,778 --> 01:06:53,726
SPEAKER_0:  We call this scientific break even.

01:06:54,274 --> 01:06:58,974
SPEAKER_0:  Breakeven. Breakeven. And it's because you've gotten past the fact that this is Unity now.

01:06:59,266 --> 01:07:00,391
SPEAKER_0:  at this point.

01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:07,891
SPEAKER_1:  fusion gain or as using the notation Q from the paper overview of the Spark talk mark before using

01:07:07,891 --> 01:07:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  the same kind of term. Yeah actually so that is sorry the technical term is Q.

01:07:11,874 --> 01:07:13,278
SPEAKER_0:  capital Q.

01:07:13,666 --> 01:07:21,790
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, so people actually use Q. We actually use capital Q or somebody's is called Q. Q is taken. Q sub P or something like this. Okay, so this is.

01:07:22,114 --> 01:07:25,150
SPEAKER_0:  Which means, what it means is that it's in the plasma.

01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  So all we're considering is the energy balance or gain that comes from the plasma itself. We're not considering.

01:07:31,938 --> 01:07:35,710
SPEAKER_0:  the technologies which are around it, which are providing the containment and so forth.

01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  So why the excitement and so on? Well, because for one reason, it's a rather simple threshold to get over.

01:07:44,034 --> 01:07:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  to understand that you're getting more energy out from the fusion.

01:07:47,618 --> 01:07:58,078
SPEAKER_0:  even the theoretical sense than you were from the, you know, from the starting match. Do you mean conceptually simple? It's conceptually simple that you get past one that everyone under, like when you're less than one.

01:07:58,434 --> 01:08:02,559
SPEAKER_0:  That's much less interesting than getting past one. So that's a really big threshold.

01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:03,309
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah

01:08:03,309 --> 01:08:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  but it really is a scientific threshold because what QP.

01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:09,790
SPEAKER_0:  actually

01:08:10,178 --> 01:08:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  the notes.

01:08:11,298 --> 01:08:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  is the relative amount of self-heating.

01:08:14,754 --> 01:08:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  that's happening in the plasma.

01:08:17,314 --> 01:08:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  So what I mean by this.

01:08:18,786 --> 01:08:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  is that in the end in these systems...

01:08:21,282 --> 01:08:23,902
SPEAKER_0:  And what you want is...

01:08:24,258 --> 01:08:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  Something that where the.

01:08:26,242 --> 01:08:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  the relative amount of heating.

01:08:28,834 --> 01:08:32,062
SPEAKER_0:  which is keeping the fuel hot is dominated by

01:08:32,290 --> 01:08:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  from the fusion reactions themselves.

01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  And so it becomes...

01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  It's sort of like thinking like a bonfire is a lot more interesting physically than just holding a blowtorch to a wet log.

01:08:44,418 --> 01:08:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  There's a lot more dynamics, it's a lot more self-evolved and so forth.

01:08:48,130 --> 01:08:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  And what we're excited as scientists is that it's clear that in that experiment...

01:08:54,626 --> 01:08:58,558
SPEAKER_0:  that they actually got to a point where the fusion reactions themselves

01:08:58,978 --> 01:09:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  we're actually altering the state of the plasma.

01:09:03,138 --> 01:09:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  It's like, wow, I mean, we'd seen it in glimpses before in magnetic confinement at relatively small levels.

01:09:08,546 --> 01:09:12,446
SPEAKER_0:  But apparently it seems like in this experiment it's likely to be a dominant.

01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:16,305
SPEAKER_0:  dominated by self-heating. That's a very important, that's a very-

01:09:16,305 --> 01:09:17,805
SPEAKER_1:  So that makes it a salsa style.

01:09:17,805 --> 01:09:21,694
SPEAKER_0:  self-sustaining type of interaction. More self-sustaining, it's more self-referential system.

01:09:22,082 --> 01:09:23,166
SPEAKER_0:  uh... in innocence

01:09:23,426 --> 01:09:28,286
SPEAKER_0:  And it sort of self evolves in a way. Again, it's not that it's going to evolve to a dangerous state. It's just that.

01:09:28,514 --> 01:09:32,350
SPEAKER_0:  We want to see what happens when the fusion is the dominant heating source.

01:09:32,802 --> 01:09:33,927
SPEAKER_0:  And we'll talk about that but...

01:09:33,927 --> 01:09:37,502
SPEAKER_1:  So there's also another element which is the inertial confinement.

01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:41,854
SPEAKER_1:  uh... laser-based initial confinement is kind of a little bit of an underdog

01:09:42,466 --> 01:09:44,222
SPEAKER_1:  I guess so a lot of the...

01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:48,478
SPEAKER_1:  broad nuclear fusion community has been focused on magnetic confinement. rocks

01:09:49,058 --> 01:09:50,686
SPEAKER_1:  just how laser based.

01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:53,438
SPEAKER_1:  inertial confinement works. So it says, uh,

01:09:53,666 --> 01:09:55,838
SPEAKER_1:  192 laser beams.

01:09:56,162 --> 01:09:56,990
SPEAKER_1:  or lined.

01:09:57,314 --> 01:10:01,758
SPEAKER_1:  on a deuterium tritium DT targets smaller than a P.

01:10:02,146 --> 01:10:16,571
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, this is like, okay, well, you know, it depends. Not all P's are made the same, but, uh, this is like, uh, throwing a perfect strike in baseball from a pitch. This is like a journalist wrote to say, I think this is like, Oh, no, it's not a journalist. DOE.

01:10:16,571 --> 01:10:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, yeah, we try to use all these analogies.

01:10:20,066 --> 01:10:23,646
SPEAKER_1:  This is like throwing a perfect strike in baseball from a-

01:10:24,162 --> 01:10:26,814
SPEAKER_1:  pictures mount 350 miles away from the plate.

01:10:27,074 --> 01:10:27,582
SPEAKER_1:  There you go.

01:10:28,002 --> 01:10:31,358
SPEAKER_1:  Department of Energy, the United States Department of Energy wrote this.

01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:34,215
SPEAKER_0:  I can't explain it.

01:10:34,215 --> 01:10:34,965
SPEAKER_1:  What the?

01:10:34,965 --> 01:10:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  with the lasers. What actually happens, actually there's usually mass confusion about this.

01:10:40,514 --> 01:10:40,894
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:10:41,314 --> 01:10:43,422
SPEAKER_0:  So what's going on in this form of it? So I think what

01:10:43,746 --> 01:10:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  The fuel.

01:10:45,186 --> 01:10:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  is delivered in a discreet, the fusion fuel, the deuterium intradium.

01:10:50,082 --> 01:10:58,046
SPEAKER_0:  is in a discreet spherical, it's more like a BB, let's call it a BB, so it's a small one. And all the fuel that you're gonna try to burn is basically there.

01:10:59,202 --> 01:11:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  and it's about that size.

01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:03,454
SPEAKER_0:  So what's hap, so how are you going to get, and it's that.

01:11:03,682 --> 01:11:09,054
SPEAKER_0:  Literally, it's like 20 degrees above absolute zero because the deuterium and tritium are kept in

01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:12,291
SPEAKER_0:  in a liquid and solid state.

01:11:12,291 --> 01:11:15,291
SPEAKER_1:  the fuel is injected not as a gas as a solid

01:11:15,291 --> 01:11:20,414
SPEAKER_0:  It's actually, and these are particular experiments they can introduce one of these, you know,

01:11:20,802 --> 01:11:24,702
SPEAKER_0:  these targets once per day, approximately something like that. Cause it's very-

01:11:25,058 --> 01:11:31,358
SPEAKER_0:  It's very, it's kind of amazing technology actually that I know some of the people that worked on this back in the is.

01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:11:32,386 --> 01:11:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  They actually make these things at a BB size of this frozen fuel. It's actually at cryogenic temperatures.

01:11:38,818 --> 01:11:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  and they're almost like smooth to the atom level. I mean they're amazing pieces of technology.

01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  So what you do in the end is.

01:11:47,746 --> 01:11:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  think you, what you have is a spherical.

01:11:50,562 --> 01:11:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  assembly of this fuel like a ball.

01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:59,102
SPEAKER_0:  And what is the purpose of the lasers? The purpose of the lasers is to provide optical energy.

01:11:59,426 --> 01:12:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  to the very outside of this.

01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:03,486
SPEAKER_0:  And what happens is...

01:12:03,938 --> 01:12:05,918
SPEAKER_0:  that energy is absorbed.

01:12:06,242 --> 01:12:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  because it's in the solid phase of matter, so it's absorbed really in the surface.

01:12:10,946 --> 01:12:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  And then what happens is that when it's absorbed into something called the ablator, what does that mean?

01:12:16,034 --> 01:12:18,142
SPEAKER_0:  It means it goes instantly from.

01:12:18,594 --> 01:12:22,334
SPEAKER_0:  the solid phase to the gas phase. So it becomes like a rocket engine.

01:12:22,978 --> 01:12:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  but you hit it like very uniformly.

01:12:25,826 --> 01:12:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  So all, there's like rocket engines coming off the surface. Think of like an asteroid almost, there's like rockets coming off.

01:12:33,826 --> 01:12:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  So what does that do? Well, what does a rocket do? It actually pushes...

01:12:37,378 --> 01:12:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  by Newton's laws, right? It pushes the other thing on the other side of it, equal and opposite reaction, it pushes it in.

01:12:44,162 --> 01:12:47,038
SPEAKER_0:  So what it does is that the laser's actually.

01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  Don't heat. This is what was confusing. People think the lasers, oh, we're gonna get it to a hundred million degrees. In fact, you want the exact opposite of this. What you want to do.

01:12:55,650 --> 01:12:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  is get essentially a rocket going out like this.

01:12:58,722 --> 01:12:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  And then.

01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  What happens is that the sphere, like, and this is happening in a billionth of a second or less actually.

01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  this rapidly, that force like so rapidly.

01:13:08,738 --> 01:13:10,174
SPEAKER_0:  compresses the fuel.

01:13:10,530 --> 01:13:13,374
SPEAKER_0:  that what happens is that you're squeezing down on it and.

01:13:13,602 --> 01:13:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  And, you know, it's like, what was the...

01:13:16,290 --> 01:13:23,678
SPEAKER_0:  See BB, that's bad actually, I should have started with a basketball. Basket goes from like a basketball down to something like, like this.

01:13:24,130 --> 01:13:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  and a billionth of a second.

01:13:26,146 --> 01:13:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  And when that happens, I mean, scale that in your mind.

01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  So when that happens, and in this comes from...

01:13:33,698 --> 01:13:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  almost from classical physics, so there's some quantum in it as well too. But basically, if you can do this.

01:13:39,010 --> 01:13:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  like very uniformly and so-called adiabatically, like you're not actually heating the fuel. What happens is you get adiabatic compression.

01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:54,718
SPEAKER_0:  such that the very center of this thing all of a sudden just spikes up in temperature because it's actually done so fast.

01:13:55,138 --> 01:14:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  So why is it called inertial fusion? It's because you're doing this on such fast time scales that the inertia of the hot fuel basically isentropic.

01:14:03,618 --> 01:14:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  is still finite so it can't like push itself apart before the fusion happens.

01:14:08,674 --> 01:14:09,799
SPEAKER_0:  Oh wow.

01:14:09,799 --> 01:14:10,910
SPEAKER_1:  How do you make it so?

01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  how do you make it so fast? this is why you use lasers because

01:14:14,882 --> 01:14:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  You're applying.

01:14:16,098 --> 01:14:21,630
SPEAKER_0:  this energy in very, very short periods of time, like under a fraction of a billionth of a second.

01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  And so basically that, and then the force, which is coming from this, comes from the energy of the lasers.

01:14:27,234 --> 01:14:31,445
SPEAKER_0:  which is basically the rocket action which does the compression. which forces the force.

01:14:31,445 --> 01:14:36,053
SPEAKER_1:  is the inward facing force is that is that increasing the temperature

01:14:36,053 --> 01:14:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  No, you want to keep the fuel.

01:14:38,754 --> 01:14:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  cold.

01:14:40,002 --> 01:14:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  and then just literally just ideally compress it.

01:14:43,266 --> 01:14:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  and then in something which is at the very center of that compressed sphere.

01:14:47,490 --> 01:14:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  because you've compressed it so rapidly, the laws of physics basically require

01:14:52,034 --> 01:15:02,814
SPEAKER_0:  for it to increase in temperature. So the change in pressure. The effect is like, if you know the thing, so adiabatic cooling we're actually fairly familiar with. If you take a spray can, right, and you push the button.

01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:08,862
SPEAKER_0:  When it rapidly expands, it cools. This is the nature of a lot of cooling technology we use actually.

01:15:09,154 --> 01:15:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  Well the opposite is true that if you would take all of those particles and jam them together very fast back in they want to heat up.

01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:18,782
SPEAKER_0:  And that's what happens. And then what happens?

01:15:19,042 --> 01:15:22,814
SPEAKER_0:  is you basically have this very cold compressed.

01:15:23,106 --> 01:15:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  set of fusion fuel.

01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  And at the center of this...

01:15:26,242 --> 01:15:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  it goes to this hundred million degrees Celsius.

01:15:29,698 --> 01:15:33,918
SPEAKER_0:  And so if it gets to that 100 million degrees Celsius, the fusion fuel starts to burn.

01:15:34,338 --> 01:15:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  And when that fusion fuel starts to burn, it wants to heat up the other cold fuel around it and it just basically propagates out.

01:15:41,026 --> 01:15:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  so fast that what you would do ideally, you would actually burn in a fusion sense and most of the fuel that's in the pellet.

01:15:48,098 --> 01:15:50,590
SPEAKER_0:  So this was very exciting because what they had done was...

01:15:51,074 --> 01:15:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  It's clear that they propagated.

01:15:53,826 --> 01:15:56,190
SPEAKER_0:  this, they got this what they call a hotspot.

01:15:56,514 --> 01:15:59,710
SPEAKER_0:  And in fact that this heating had propagated out into the fuel.

01:15:59,938 --> 01:16:03,313
SPEAKER_0:  And that's the science behind inertial fusion.

01:16:03,313 --> 01:16:03,806
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:16:04,066 --> 01:16:06,302
SPEAKER_1:  behind a reactor that's based on this kind of inertial.

01:16:06,818 --> 01:16:08,638
SPEAKER_1:  uh... confinement

01:16:09,122 --> 01:16:10,846
SPEAKER_1:  is that you would have

01:16:11,522 --> 01:16:12,647
SPEAKER_1:  A new BB every-

01:16:12,647 --> 01:16:14,897
SPEAKER_0:  like 10 times a second or something like that.

01:16:14,897 --> 01:16:21,653
SPEAKER_1:  is there's some kind of, so there's a incredible device that you kind of implied that kind of has to create one of those BBs.

01:16:21,653 --> 01:16:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  So you have to make the BBs very fast.

01:16:24,866 --> 01:16:30,334
SPEAKER_0:  There's reports on this, but what does it mean? The starting point is can you make this game?

01:16:31,074 --> 01:16:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  So this was a scientific achievement primarily. Right. And the rest is just engineering. No, no, no. The rest is incredibly complicated engineering. Well, in fact, there's still physics hurdles to overcome. So

01:16:42,722 --> 01:16:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  So where does this come from? And it's actually because if you want to make an energy source out of this.

01:16:47,906 --> 01:16:54,878
SPEAKER_0:  uh... this had a gain of around one point five that namely the fusion energy was approximately was one point five times the

01:16:55,234 --> 01:16:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  the laser input energy. And it's a fairly significant threshold.

01:16:58,850 --> 01:17:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  However, from the-

01:17:00,418 --> 01:17:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  from the science of what I just told you is that there's two fundamental efficiencies which come into it which really come from physics really.

01:17:06,978 --> 01:17:10,750
SPEAKER_0:  One of them is hydrodynamic efficiency. What I mean by this is that it's a rocket.

01:17:11,426 --> 01:17:12,894
SPEAKER_0:  So this just has a fundamental.

01:17:13,698 --> 01:17:15,582
SPEAKER_0:  uh... efficiency uh... built into it

01:17:15,938 --> 01:17:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  which comes out to orders of like 10%.

01:17:19,074 --> 01:17:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  This means that your ability to do work on the system is just limited by that.

01:17:25,634 --> 01:17:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  And then the other one is the efficiency of laser systems themselves, which if their wall plug efficiency is 10%, you've done spectacularly well.

01:17:32,866 --> 01:17:34,430
SPEAKER_0:  In fact, the wall plug efficiency.

01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:37,662
SPEAKER_0:  of the ones using that experiments are like more like 1%.

01:17:38,114 --> 01:17:39,550
SPEAKER_0:  So when you go through all of this.

01:17:39,842 --> 01:17:47,678
SPEAKER_0:  The approximate place that you're ordering this is for a fusion power plant would be a gain of 100 not 1.5.

01:17:48,162 --> 01:17:50,718
SPEAKER_0:  So you still, you know, and hopefully we see experiments that keep

01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  climbing up towards higher and higher.

01:17:53,218 --> 01:17:53,630
SPEAKER_0:  game.

01:17:53,986 --> 01:17:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  But then the whole fusion power plant is a totally different thing.

01:17:58,242 --> 01:17:59,230
SPEAKER_0:  It's not one.

01:17:59,490 --> 01:18:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  It's not one BB and one laser pulse per day. It's like five or 10 times per second.

01:18:07,042 --> 01:18:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  Like, like that, right? So you're doing it there.

01:18:11,042 --> 01:18:15,806
SPEAKER_0:  And then comes the other aspect, so it's making the targets, delivering them.

01:18:16,258 --> 01:18:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  being able to repeatedly get them to burn.

01:18:19,682 --> 01:18:23,262
SPEAKER_0:  And then we haven't even talked about like, how do you then get the fusion energy out?

01:18:23,554 --> 01:18:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  which is mainly because these things

01:18:25,890 --> 01:18:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  basically micro implosions which are occurring. So this energy is coming out to some medium on the outside that you've got to figure out how to extract the energy.

01:18:35,426 --> 01:18:36,551
SPEAKER_0:  out of this thing.

01:18:36,551 --> 01:18:38,142
SPEAKER_1:  that energy to electricity.

01:18:38,338 --> 01:18:39,166
SPEAKER_0:  So in the end...

01:18:39,458 --> 01:18:42,654
SPEAKER_0:  you have to basically convert it into heat in some way. so

01:18:43,042 --> 01:18:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  most of the, in the end what fusion makes mostly is like high, very energetic particles from the fusion reaction.

01:18:49,634 --> 01:18:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  So you have to slow those down in some way and then make heat out of it.

01:18:53,986 --> 01:18:58,238
SPEAKER_0:  So basically the conversion of the kinetic energy of the particles into heating some

01:18:58,690 --> 01:19:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  engineered material that's on the outside of this.

01:19:01,314 --> 01:19:02,046
SPEAKER_1:  And that's...

01:19:02,306 --> 01:19:03,902
SPEAKER_1:  from a physics perspective.

01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:07,038
SPEAKER_1:  is a somewhat solved problem but from an engineering is

01:19:07,522 --> 01:19:08,647
SPEAKER_1:  It's still, it's still.

01:19:08,647 --> 01:19:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, physics, I can draw the, I can show you all the equations that tell you about how it slows down and converts.

01:19:14,882 --> 01:19:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  kinetic energy into heat.

01:19:16,610 --> 01:19:26,430
SPEAKER_0:  And then what that heat means, you can write out like an ideal thermal cycle, like a Carnot cycle. So the physics of that, yeah, great. The integrated engineering of this is a whole other thing.

01:19:26,562 --> 01:19:35,550
SPEAKER_1:  I'll ask you to maybe talk about the difference between inertial and magnetic, but first we'll talk about magnetic. But let me just linger on this breakthrough. You know, it's nice to have exciting things, but.

01:19:36,482 --> 01:19:40,286
SPEAKER_1:  in a deep human sense, there's no competition in science and engineering.

01:19:40,514 --> 01:19:42,526
SPEAKER_1:  world like you said we were broad.

01:19:42,786 --> 01:19:48,958
SPEAKER_1:  First of all, we are humanity altogether. And you talk about this, it's a bunch of countries collaborating. It's really exciting.

01:19:49,314 --> 01:19:50,430
SPEAKER_1:  others in nuclear

01:19:50,690 --> 01:19:57,630
SPEAKER_1:  Fusion community broadly. But then there's also MIT, there's colors and logos and it's exciting and you are.

01:19:57,858 --> 01:20:03,358
SPEAKER_1:  You have friends and colleagues here that work extremely hard and done some incredible stuff. Is there some?

01:20:03,778 --> 01:20:04,094
SPEAKER_1:  sort of.

01:20:04,386 --> 01:20:06,398
SPEAKER_1:  How do you feel seeing somebody else?

01:20:06,882 --> 01:20:10,750
SPEAKER_1:  get a breakthrough using a different technology. Is that exciting?

01:20:11,234 --> 01:20:14,878
SPEAKER_1:  Does the competitive fire get...

01:20:15,330 --> 01:20:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  All of the above. I mean, the ignition. I have, so, you know, just to wave the flag a little bit. So MIT was a central player.

01:20:25,570 --> 01:20:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  in this accomplishment.

01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  Interesting, I would say it showed some of our two best traits. So one of them was that the-

01:20:35,202 --> 01:20:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  How do you know that this happened?

01:20:37,794 --> 01:20:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  this measurement, right?

01:20:39,586 --> 01:20:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  One of the ways to do this is if I...

01:20:41,826 --> 01:20:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  told you is that in DT fusion.

01:20:44,450 --> 01:20:47,358
SPEAKER_0:  What it actually, the product that comes out is helium.

01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  We call it alpha, but it's helium.

01:20:49,986 --> 01:20:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  and a free neutron.

01:20:52,226 --> 01:20:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  So the neutron contains 80% of the energy released by the fusion reaction.

01:20:57,378 --> 01:21:04,830
SPEAKER_0:  And it also, because it lacks a charge, it basically tends to just escape and go flying out. So this is what we would use eventually for.

01:21:05,666 --> 01:21:07,742
SPEAKER_0:  That's mostly what fusion energy would be.

01:21:08,002 --> 01:21:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  So what my colleagues, my scientific colleagues at the Plasmas Science Infusion Center built were extraordinary measurement tools of

01:21:16,482 --> 01:21:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  being able to see the exact details of not only the number of neutrons that were coming out, but actually what energy that they're at.

01:21:24,354 --> 01:21:38,174
SPEAKER_0:  And by looking at that configuration, it reveals enormous, I'm not gonna scoop them because they need to publish the paper, but it reveals enormous amounts of scientific information about what's happening in that process that I just described.

01:21:38,434 --> 01:21:39,614
SPEAKER_0:  so excited I mean

01:21:39,906 --> 01:21:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  And I have, you know, I have...

01:21:42,114 --> 01:21:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  colleagues there that have worked like for 30 years on this for that moment.

01:21:46,146 --> 01:21:47,998
SPEAKER_0:  Of course you're excited for them. Time for a minute.

01:21:48,258 --> 01:21:59,870
SPEAKER_0:  And it's one of those, like, there is nothing, it's hard to describe to people who aren't, it's like almost addicting to be a scientist when you get to be at the forefront of research of anything.

01:22:00,706 --> 01:22:06,686
SPEAKER_0:  When you see like an actual discovery of some kind and you're looking at it, particularly when you're the person who did it, right?

01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  And you go, no human being has ever seen this or understood this. It's like, it's pretty thrilling, right?

01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:17,406
SPEAKER_0:  So even in proxy, it's incredibly thrilling to see this.

01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  It's not, I don't know, it's rivalry or jealousy. It's like...

01:22:21,506 --> 01:22:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  I can tell you already, fusion is really hard. So anything that keeps pushing the needle forward is a good thing.

01:22:27,650 --> 01:22:32,525
SPEAKER_0:  But we also have to be realistic about what it means, you know, to making a fusion energy system. That's the...

01:22:32,525 --> 01:22:36,350
SPEAKER_1:  And then, but that's the fun. I mean, these are the still the early.

01:22:36,866 --> 01:22:39,454
SPEAKER_1:  steps you maybe you can say the early leaps.

01:22:40,130 --> 01:22:42,622
SPEAKER_1:  So let's talk about the magnetic confinement.

01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:47,806
SPEAKER_1:  How does magnetic confinement work? What's a takamak?

01:22:48,226 --> 01:22:48,702
SPEAKER_1:  UGH

01:22:49,090 --> 01:22:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, how does it all work?

01:22:50,210 --> 01:22:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  to go back to that, so why inertial confinement works on the same principle that a star works.

01:22:55,586 --> 01:22:58,398
SPEAKER_0:  So like what is the confinement mechanism in the star?

01:22:58,914 --> 01:23:00,030
SPEAKER_0:  is gravity.

01:23:01,090 --> 01:23:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  because it's its own inertia.

01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  of the something the size of the sun

01:23:06,658 --> 01:23:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  basically pushes a force by gravity against the center.

01:23:11,234 --> 01:23:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  The center is very, very hot, 20 million degrees, and literally outside the sun it's essentially zero because it's the vacuum of space.

01:23:18,818 --> 01:23:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  How the hell does it do that?

01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:20,862
SPEAKER_0:  It does that.

01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  Why doesn't it just leak all of its heat? It doesn't leak its heat because it all is held together by the fact that it can't escape because of its own gravity.

01:23:30,434 --> 01:23:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  So this is why the fusion happens in the center of the star.

01:23:33,090 --> 01:23:36,478
SPEAKER_0:  Like we think of the surface of the sun as being hot. That's the coldest part of the story.

01:23:37,154 --> 01:23:41,182
SPEAKER_0:  So, over our own sun, this is about 5,500 degrees. Beautiful symmetry, by the way.

01:23:41,474 --> 01:23:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  So how do we know all this? Cuz...

01:23:43,362 --> 01:23:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  We can't of course see directly into the interior of the sun.

01:23:47,074 --> 01:23:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  By knowing the volume and the temperature of the surface of the sun, you know exactly how much power it's putting out.

01:23:52,354 --> 01:23:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  and by this you know that this is coming from fusion reactions occurring.

01:23:56,162 --> 01:23:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  at exactly the same rate.

01:23:57,954 --> 01:23:59,550
SPEAKER_0:  in the middle of the sun.

01:24:00,194 --> 01:24:02,334
SPEAKER_1:  Is it possible as a small tangent?

01:24:02,626 --> 01:24:03,358
SPEAKER_1:  to build.

01:24:04,066 --> 01:24:04,446
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:24:05,058 --> 01:24:05,886
SPEAKER_1:  inertial

01:24:06,114 --> 01:24:08,739
SPEAKER_1:  confinement system like the sun is it possible to create

01:24:08,739 --> 01:24:12,382
SPEAKER_0:  a sun. It is of course possible to make a sun, although you wouldn't have stars.

01:24:12,738 --> 01:24:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  but it is not impossible on earth because for the simple reason that it takes

01:24:17,314 --> 01:24:24,439
SPEAKER_0:  The gravitational force is extremely weak and so it takes something like the size of a star to make fusion occur in the center.

01:24:24,439 --> 01:24:28,574
SPEAKER_1:  I didn't mean on earth. I mean if you had to build like a second Sun

01:24:28,706 --> 01:24:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  How'd you do it?

01:24:29,666 --> 01:24:31,422
SPEAKER_0:  You can't, there's not enough hydrogen around.

01:24:32,354 --> 01:24:34,174
SPEAKER_1:  So the delimiting factor is the...

01:24:34,722 --> 01:24:35,678
SPEAKER_1:  just the hydrogen.

01:24:35,874 --> 01:24:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I mean the forces and energy that it takes to assemble that is just...

01:24:40,994 --> 01:24:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  Mind boggling.

01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:51,230
SPEAKER_0:  All right. So we wouldn't do that. To be continued. Yeah, to be continued. So what are we doing it with? So in the one that I just described, it's like you say, so you have to replace this with some force, which is

01:24:51,522 --> 01:24:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  better than that.

01:24:52,642 --> 01:24:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  And so what I mean by that is it's stronger than that.

01:24:56,226 --> 01:24:58,334
SPEAKER_0:  So when I talked about the laser fusion...

01:24:58,562 --> 01:25:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  This is coming from the force which is enormous compared to gravity.

01:25:02,402 --> 01:25:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  like from the rocket action of pushing it together.

01:25:05,346 --> 01:25:06,654
SPEAKER_0:  So in magnetic confinement...

01:25:07,522 --> 01:25:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  We use another force of nature, which is the electromagnetic force.

01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:12,862
SPEAKER_0:  And that's very, it's.

01:25:13,122 --> 01:25:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  orders and orders of magnitude stronger than the gravitational force.

01:25:17,602 --> 01:25:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  And the key force that matters here is that if you have a charged particle, namely it's a particle that has an electric net electric charge,

01:25:25,186 --> 01:25:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  and it's in the proximity of a magnetic field.

01:25:28,098 --> 01:25:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  then there is a force which is exerted on that particle.

01:25:32,866 --> 01:25:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  So this is called the Lorentz force for those who are keeping track. So that is the force that we use to replace physical containment.

01:25:40,642 --> 01:25:41,054
SPEAKER_0:  So...

01:25:41,378 --> 01:25:48,158
SPEAKER_0:  So this again, confused. How do you hold something at a hundred million degrees? It's impossible in a physical container.

01:25:48,386 --> 01:25:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  This is not like

01:25:49,570 --> 01:25:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  It's not this plastic bottle holding in this liquid or a gas chamber.

01:25:54,370 --> 01:25:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  What you're doing is you're immersing the fuel.

01:25:57,826 --> 01:25:59,070
SPEAKER_0:  in a magnetic field.

01:25:59,490 --> 01:26:10,718
SPEAKER_0:  that basically exerts a force at a distance. This comes back again to again, like why plazas are so strange. It's the same thing here. And if it's immersed in this magnetic field, you're not actually physically touching it.

01:26:10,946 --> 01:26:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  but you're making a force go onto it.

01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:17,758
SPEAKER_0:  So that's the inherent feature of magnetic confinement.

01:26:18,242 --> 01:26:22,558
SPEAKER_0:  And then magnetic confinement devices are like a Tokamak are basically.

01:26:22,946 --> 01:26:27,198
SPEAKER_0:  are configurations which exploit the features of that magnetic containment.

01:26:27,778 --> 01:26:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  There's several features to it. One is that the stronger the strength of the magnetic field, the stronger the force.

01:26:34,146 --> 01:26:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  And for this reason is that if you increase the strength of magnetic fields

01:26:38,530 --> 01:26:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  This means that the containment, because namely the force which you're pushing against it is more effective.

01:26:44,162 --> 01:26:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  And the other feature is that there is no force.

01:26:48,034 --> 01:26:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  So for those who remember magnetic fields, what are these things? They're also invisible. But, you know, if you think of a permanent magnets or your fridge magnet, there are, there are.

01:26:56,706 --> 01:27:00,510
SPEAKER_0:  field lines, which we actually designate as arrows, which are going around you sometimes.

01:27:00,770 --> 01:27:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  See this in school when you have the

01:27:03,202 --> 01:27:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  you know, the iron filings on a thing and you see the directions of the magnetic field lines.

01:27:07,554 --> 01:27:09,982
SPEAKER_0:  or when you use a compass.

01:27:10,210 --> 01:27:14,814
SPEAKER_0:  That's telling you because we're living in an immersed magnetic field made by the Earth.

01:27:15,138 --> 01:27:24,094
SPEAKER_0:  which is at very low intensity magnetic, but it's strong enough that we can actually see what direction is it. So this is the arrow that the magnetic field is pointing. It's always pointing north and for us.

01:27:24,738 --> 01:27:25,086
SPEAKER_0:  is out.

01:27:25,346 --> 01:27:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  So an interesting feature of this force is that there is no force along the direction of the magnetic field.

01:27:31,074 --> 01:27:33,854
SPEAKER_0:  There's only force in the directions orthogonal to the magnet.

01:27:34,882 --> 01:27:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  So this, by the way, is a huge deal in a whole other discipline of plasma physics, which is like the study of like our near atmosphere.

01:27:44,290 --> 01:27:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  So the study of aurora borealis.

01:27:46,370 --> 01:27:50,462
SPEAKER_0:  what's happening in the near atmosphere, what happens when solar flares hit the magnetic. In fact.

01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  Remember I said.

01:27:52,610 --> 01:27:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  Fusion is the reason that life is responsible.

01:27:56,098 --> 01:27:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  In the universe?

01:27:57,058 --> 01:28:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  Well, you could also argue so is magnetic confinement because...

01:28:00,610 --> 01:28:03,870
SPEAKER_0:  the charged particles which are being emitted from.

01:28:04,514 --> 01:28:06,686
SPEAKER_0:  from the galaxy and from our own star.

01:28:06,914 --> 01:28:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  would be very, very damaging on Earth. So we get two layers of protection. One is the atmosphere itself.

01:28:13,794 --> 01:28:21,805
SPEAKER_0:  But the other one is the magnetic field which surrounds the Earth and basically traps these charged particles so they can't get away. It's the same deal.

01:28:21,805 --> 01:28:23,966
SPEAKER_1:  How do you create a strong magnetic field? Yeah.

01:28:24,514 --> 01:28:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:28:25,730 --> 01:28:29,758
SPEAKER_0:  With a giant magnet. Giant magnet, yeah. So it's basically true.

01:28:30,626 --> 01:28:38,846
SPEAKER_0:  engineering is essentially essentially two ways to create a magnet so one of them is that we're familiar with like fridge magnets and so forth these are so-called permanent magnets

01:28:39,234 --> 01:28:40,190
SPEAKER_0:  And what it means is that...

01:28:40,770 --> 01:28:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  Within these, the atoms arrange in a particular way that it produces, the electrons basically arrange in a particular way, that it produces a permanent magnetic field that is set by the material.

01:28:50,530 --> 01:28:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  So those have a fundamental limitation, how strong they can be and they also tend to have.

01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:56,286
SPEAKER_0:  this.

01:28:56,834 --> 01:29:00,574
SPEAKER_0:  like circular shape like this. So we don't typically use those.

01:29:01,154 --> 01:29:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  So what we use are so-called electromagnets. And what is this? I don't know, I'm so sorry.

01:29:05,314 --> 01:29:10,558
SPEAKER_0:  So the other way to make a magnetic field is to also go back to your elementary school physics.

01:29:10,978 --> 01:29:12,254
SPEAKER_0:  uh... or science class

01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:18,654
SPEAKER_0:  is that you take a nail and you wrap a copper wire around it and connect it to a battery, then it can pick up iron filings.

01:29:18,914 --> 01:29:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  This is an electromagnet.

01:29:21,282 --> 01:29:26,942
SPEAKER_0:  And it's simplest what it is, it's an electric current which is going in a pattern around and around and around.

01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  And what this does is it produces a magnetic field which goes through it by the laws of electromagnetism.

01:29:32,642 --> 01:29:38,590
SPEAKER_0:  So that's how we make the magnetic field in these configurations.

01:29:39,106 --> 01:29:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  And the key there is that it's not limited by the magnetic property of the material.

01:29:45,506 --> 01:29:48,542
SPEAKER_0:  the magnetic field amplitude is set by the amount of

01:29:48,834 --> 01:29:52,766
SPEAKER_0:  the geometry of this thing and the amount of electric current that you're putting through.

01:29:53,154 --> 01:29:56,990
SPEAKER_0:  and the more electric current that you put through, the more magnetic field that you get.

01:29:57,538 --> 01:29:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  The closest one.

01:29:59,458 --> 01:30:01,758
SPEAKER_0:  that people maybe see is...

01:30:01,986 --> 01:30:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  Wanna move?

01:30:03,298 --> 01:30:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  One of my favorite skits actually was Super Dave Osborne on, mehr raining sun on, sc'nie the

01:30:08,738 --> 01:30:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  probably passed you is a show called Super Dave Osborne, which is a great comedian cult.

01:30:13,826 --> 01:30:25,246
SPEAKER_0:  He was a stunt man and one of his tricks was that he was, he gets into a car and then one of those things in the junkyard comes down, you know, and picks up the car and then puts it into the, into the crusher. This was his stunt, which is pretty hilarious.

01:30:25,474 --> 01:30:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  Anyway, but that thing that picks them up.

01:30:28,546 --> 01:30:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  Like how does that work? That's actually not a permanent magnet. It's an, it's an electro magnet.

01:30:33,186 --> 01:30:41,278
SPEAKER_0:  And so you can turn by turning off and on the power supply, it turns off and on the magnetic field. So this means you can pick it up and then when you switch it off,

01:30:41,602 --> 01:30:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  magnetic field goes away and the car drops. Okay. So that's, that's what it looks like.

01:30:46,626 --> 01:30:47,751
SPEAKER_0:  Speaking of giant magnets.

01:30:47,751 --> 01:30:48,798
SPEAKER_1:  MIT in...

01:30:49,282 --> 01:30:50,014
SPEAKER_1:  Commonwealth

01:30:50,242 --> 01:30:51,774
SPEAKER_1:  Fusion Systems CFS.

01:30:52,098 --> 01:30:53,150
SPEAKER_1:  built a.

01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:57,502
SPEAKER_1:  Very large, high temperature, superconducting electromagnet.

01:30:58,082 --> 01:31:04,638
SPEAKER_1:  that was ramped up to a fuel strength of 20 Tesla, the most powerful magnetic field of its kind ever created down on earth.

01:31:05,762 --> 01:31:09,182
SPEAKER_1:  because I enjoy this kind of thing. Can you please tell me about this magnet?

01:31:09,282 --> 01:31:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, sure.

01:31:10,754 --> 01:31:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  Oh it was.

01:31:11,842 --> 01:31:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  It's fun, yeah.

01:31:12,930 --> 01:31:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  There's a lot to parse there. So maybe.

01:31:15,682 --> 01:31:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  So we already explained an electromagnet which...

01:31:19,746 --> 01:31:20,734
SPEAKER_0:  in general is

01:31:21,090 --> 01:31:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  What you do is you take electric current and you force it to

01:31:24,418 --> 01:31:27,454
SPEAKER_0:  to follow a pattern of some kind, typically like a circular pattern.

01:31:27,874 --> 01:31:33,950
SPEAKER_0:  around and around and around and around. And it goes the more time, the more current and the more times it goes around, the stronger the magnetic field that you make.

01:31:35,426 --> 01:31:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  And as I pointed out, it's like really important in magnetic confinement because it is the force that's produced by that magnetic. In fact, technically it goes like the magnetic field squared.

01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  because it's a pressure which is actually being exerted on.

01:31:49,442 --> 01:31:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  the plasma to keep it.

01:31:51,170 --> 01:31:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  contained.

01:31:52,450 --> 01:31:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  Just so we know for magnetic confinement.

01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:56,926
SPEAKER_1:  What is usually the geometry of the magnet?

01:31:57,218 --> 01:32:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  What are we supposed to imagine? Yeah, so the geometry typically is what you do is

01:32:03,554 --> 01:32:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  you want to produce a magnetic field that loops back on itself.

01:32:07,330 --> 01:32:09,150
SPEAKER_0:  and the reason for this was

01:32:09,762 --> 01:32:12,254
SPEAKER_0:  goes down to the nature of the forest that I described.

01:32:13,858 --> 01:32:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  Which is that there's no-

01:32:15,490 --> 01:32:19,646
SPEAKER_0:  there's no containment or force along the direction of the magnetic field.

01:32:20,002 --> 01:32:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  So here's a magnetic field. In fact, what it's.

01:32:23,138 --> 01:32:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  more technically or more graphically what it's doing is that

01:32:26,626 --> 01:32:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  When the plasma is here, there's plasma particles here.

01:32:29,762 --> 01:32:30,942
SPEAKER_0:  There's a magnetic field.

01:32:31,266 --> 01:32:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  What it does is it forces all those, because of this, this Lorentz force.

01:32:35,682 --> 01:32:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  It makes all of those charged particles execute circular orbits around the magnetic field. And they go around like this.

01:32:43,042 --> 01:32:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  but they stream freely along the magnetic field.

01:32:46,594 --> 01:32:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  So this is why the nature of the containment is that if you can get that circle smaller and smaller, it stays further away from earth, temperature materials. That's why the confinement gets better.

01:32:57,922 --> 01:33:02,942
SPEAKER_0:  But the problem is that because it free streams along, so we just have a long straight magnetic field.

01:33:03,362 --> 01:33:06,398
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, it'll just keep leaking out the ends like really fast.

01:33:06,754 --> 01:33:09,246
SPEAKER_0:  So you get rid of the ends. So you basically loop it.

01:33:10,562 --> 01:33:13,566
SPEAKER_0:  So what these look like are typically donut shaped or.

01:33:14,210 --> 01:33:15,806
SPEAKER_0:  or technically toroidal shape it.

01:33:16,162 --> 01:33:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  donut shaped.

01:33:17,986 --> 01:33:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  things where this collection of magnetic fields loops back on itself, and it also for reasons which are more complicated to explain.

01:33:25,346 --> 01:33:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  Basically it also twists slowly around in this direction.

01:33:30,562 --> 01:33:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  So that's what it looks like. That's what the plasma looks like because that's what the fuel looks like.

01:33:35,362 --> 01:33:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  So then this means is that the.

01:33:37,954 --> 01:33:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  the electromagnets.

01:33:39,394 --> 01:33:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  are configured in such a way that it produces the desired magnetic fields around this. How precise does this have to be? You were probably listening to our conversation with some of my colleagues yesterday.

01:33:49,442 --> 01:33:53,982
SPEAKER_0:  So it's actually, it depends on the configuration about how you're doing it.

01:33:54,210 --> 01:33:59,326
SPEAKER_0:  configuration of the plasma. The configuration of the electromagnets and about how you're achieving this this requirement.

01:33:59,906 --> 01:34:00,414
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:34:00,898 --> 01:34:07,710
SPEAKER_0:  It's, it's, it's fairly precise, but it doesn't have to be in, particularly in something like a Tokamak. What we do is we produce.

01:34:08,258 --> 01:34:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  planar coils, which just mean they're flat.

01:34:10,434 --> 01:34:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  and we situate them. So if you think of.

01:34:13,698 --> 01:34:15,134
SPEAKER_0:  a circle like this.

01:34:15,746 --> 01:34:21,182
SPEAKER_0:  What does it produce if you put current through it? It produces a magnetic field which goes through the circle like this.

01:34:21,794 --> 01:34:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  So if you align many of them like this, this, this, this, there's things online, you can go see the picture of dude.

01:34:28,482 --> 01:34:31,358
SPEAKER_0:  You keep arranging these around in a circle itself.

01:34:31,618 --> 01:34:35,390
SPEAKER_0:  This forces the magnetic field lines to basically just keep executing around like this.

01:34:35,682 --> 01:34:36,478
SPEAKER_0:  So you tend to align.

01:34:36,866 --> 01:34:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  That one tends to, well, it requires.

01:34:39,778 --> 01:34:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  good alignment, it's not like insane alignment because you're...

01:34:44,290 --> 01:34:47,902
SPEAKER_0:  You're actually exploring the symmetry of the situation to help it.

01:34:48,226 --> 01:34:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  There's another kind of configuration of this kind of magnetic confinement called a stellarator which...

01:34:54,018 --> 01:35:07,102
SPEAKER_0:  We have these names for historic reasons. Which is different than a tokamak. It's different than a tokamak, but it actually works on the same physical principle that namely, in the end it produces a plasma which loops in magnetic fields, which loop back on themselves. parallel bodies.

01:35:07,778 --> 01:35:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  In that case, the totality of the confining magnetic field is produced.

01:35:13,826 --> 01:35:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  by external three dimensional magnets, so they're twisted.

01:35:17,730 --> 01:35:22,997
SPEAKER_0:  And it turns out the precision of those is more stringent.

01:35:22,997 --> 01:35:27,710
SPEAKER_1:  So are talkamags by far more popular for research and development currently than...

01:35:28,130 --> 01:35:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  Stellar Raiders.

01:35:29,314 --> 01:35:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  of the concepts which are there, the Tokamak is by far the most.

01:35:32,738 --> 01:35:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  mature in terms of its.

01:35:34,690 --> 01:35:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  breadth of performance and um and

01:35:38,146 --> 01:35:41,406
SPEAKER_0:  thinking about how it would be applied in a fusion energy system.

01:35:41,666 --> 01:35:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  The history of this was that many, in fact, you asked about this, if we go back to the history of the Piles, Science and Fusion Center.

01:35:47,426 --> 01:35:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  The history of fusion is that

01:35:49,314 --> 01:35:49,822
SPEAKER_0:  People.

01:35:50,626 --> 01:35:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  scientists had started to work on this in the 1950s. It was all hush-hush and cold war and all that kind of stuff.

01:35:57,154 --> 01:36:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  And it's like, they realized, holy cow, this is like really hard. Like we actually don't really know like what we're doing in this.

01:36:04,450 --> 01:36:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  because everything was at low temperatures, they couldn't get confinement.

01:36:08,226 --> 01:36:15,454
SPEAKER_0:  It was interesting. And then they declassified it. And this is one of the few places that the West and the Soviet Union.

01:36:16,002 --> 01:36:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  actually collaborated on was a science. Even during the cold war. Even during the middle of the cold war, it was really.

01:36:21,314 --> 01:36:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  And this actually perpetuates all the way till now for, we can talk about the project that that is sort of.

01:36:28,610 --> 01:36:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  captured it now.

01:36:31,362 --> 01:36:32,094
SPEAKER_0:  uh... but

01:36:32,514 --> 01:36:36,478
SPEAKER_0:  And the reason they declassified it is because like everything like

01:36:37,026 --> 01:36:42,206
SPEAKER_0:  kind of like sucked basically, you know, about trying to make this confinement high-temperature plasma.

01:36:42,818 --> 01:36:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  And then the Russians...

01:36:44,674 --> 01:36:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  then the Soviets came along with this device called a Tokamak, which is a Russian acronym, which basically means

01:36:52,258 --> 01:36:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  magnetic coils arranged in the shape of a doughnut.

01:36:57,314 --> 01:37:00,542
SPEAKER_0:  And they said, holy cow.

01:37:00,834 --> 01:37:05,118
SPEAKER_0:  Like everyone was stuck at like a meager, like half a million degrees.

01:37:05,506 --> 01:37:09,342
SPEAKER_0:  half a million degrees, which is like infusion terms of zero basically.

01:37:09,666 --> 01:37:15,038
SPEAKER_0:  And then they come along and they say, oh, we've actually achieved a temperature 20 times higher than everybody else.

01:37:15,426 --> 01:37:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  and it's actually started to make fusion reactions and everyone just go, oh.

01:37:19,106 --> 01:37:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  You know, no way, it's just hype from the, it's like, there's no way because we've failed at this.

01:37:23,970 --> 01:37:24,446
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:37:24,834 --> 01:37:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  It's a great story in the history of fusion is that then, but they insisted and said, no, look, you can see this from our data. It's like this thing is really hot.

01:37:32,066 --> 01:37:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  And it seems to be working. This is, you know, late 1960s.

01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:35,806
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:37:36,162 --> 01:37:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  there was a...

01:37:37,698 --> 01:37:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  There was a team that went from the United Kingdom's fusion development lab.

01:37:41,506 --> 01:37:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  and they brought this very fancy.

01:37:43,650 --> 01:37:46,174
SPEAKER_0:  amazing new technology called a laser.

01:37:47,842 --> 01:37:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  and they used this laser and they shot the laser beam through the plasma.

01:37:52,770 --> 01:37:55,070
SPEAKER_0:  And by looking at the scattered light that came from the...

01:37:55,362 --> 01:37:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  There you go.

01:37:56,034 --> 01:37:58,398
SPEAKER_0:  that basically the scattered light gets more.

01:37:58,786 --> 01:38:01,086
SPEAKER_0:  broadened in its spectrum if it gets hotter.

01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  So you could exactly tell the temperature of this. And even though you're not physically touching the plasma, it's like, holy cow, you're right. It is like, it is 10 million degrees.

01:38:10,562 --> 01:38:14,942
SPEAKER_0:  And so this was one of those explosions of like.

01:38:15,298 --> 01:38:18,782
SPEAKER_0:  Everyone in the world then wanted to build a tokamak because

01:38:19,170 --> 01:38:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  It was clearly like, wow, this is like so far ahead of everything else that we tried.

01:38:25,122 --> 01:38:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  So that actually has a part of the story to MIT in the Plosnice infusion center was

01:38:30,402 --> 01:38:35,998
SPEAKER_0:  why is there a strong fusion and a major fusion program at MIT? it was because

01:38:36,642 --> 01:38:41,918
SPEAKER_0:  we were host to the Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory, which is also the National High Field Magnet Laboratory.

01:38:42,498 --> 01:38:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  you can see where this goes. We're telling the stories backwards almost.

01:38:47,874 --> 01:38:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  you know, the, the, the advent of a Tokamak.

01:38:51,778 --> 01:39:04,126
SPEAKER_0:  along with the fact that you could make very strong magnetic fields with the technology that had been developed at that laboratory. That was the origins of sort of pushing together the physics of the plasma containment.

01:39:04,450 --> 01:39:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  and the magnet technology and put them together.

01:39:07,490 --> 01:39:12,318
SPEAKER_0:  in a way that I would say is a very typical MIT success story. We don't do just-

01:39:12,866 --> 01:39:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  just pure science or pure technology, we sort of set up this intersection between them and the room.

01:39:17,186 --> 01:39:18,654
SPEAKER_0:  several pioneers that.

01:39:19,074 --> 01:39:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  of my of the of people at m i t like brutal copy who's a professor in the physics department and ron parker was a

01:39:25,730 --> 01:39:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  professor of electrical engineering and nuclear engineering. It's like even the makeup of the people, right, has got this blends of science and engineering.

01:39:33,122 --> 01:39:37,310
SPEAKER_0:  And that actually was the origin of the Plot of Science Infusion Center, was doing those things. So anyway.

01:39:37,570 --> 01:39:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  back to this. So why, so yes, tokamaks have been.

01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:44,606
SPEAKER_0:  have achieved the highest in magnetic fusion by far like the

01:39:44,994 --> 01:39:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  the best amounts of these.

01:39:46,722 --> 01:39:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  of these conditions that I talked about. And in fact,

01:39:49,890 --> 01:39:53,310
SPEAKER_0:  pushed right up to the point where they were near QP of one.

01:39:53,666 --> 01:39:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  They just didn't quite get over one.

01:39:56,002 --> 01:39:57,127
SPEAKER_0:  So can we actually just linger?

01:39:57,127 --> 01:40:03,966
SPEAKER_1:  on the collaboration across different nations. Just maybe looking at the philosophical aspect of this.

01:40:05,954 --> 01:40:07,774
SPEAKER_1:  even in the cold war.

01:40:08,802 --> 01:40:11,486
SPEAKER_1:  There's something hopeful to me besides the energy.

01:40:11,970 --> 01:40:14,238
SPEAKER_1:  that these giant international projects

01:40:15,874 --> 01:40:16,350
SPEAKER_1:  are.

01:40:17,218 --> 01:40:22,558
SPEAKER_1:  a really powerful way to ease some of the geopolitical tension, even in military conflict across nations.

01:40:23,106 --> 01:40:23,870
SPEAKER_1:  There's a-

01:40:24,866 --> 01:40:26,174
SPEAKER_1:  War in Ukraine?

01:40:27,650 --> 01:40:28,318
SPEAKER_1:  and Russia.

01:40:28,994 --> 01:40:32,350
SPEAKER_1:  There's a brewing tension and conflict with China.

01:40:32,642 --> 01:40:34,590
SPEAKER_1:  Just the world is still.

01:40:35,394 --> 01:40:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:40:36,578 --> 01:40:38,270
SPEAKER_1:  seeking military conflict.

01:40:38,882 --> 01:40:39,614
SPEAKER_1:  cold or hot.

01:40:40,642 --> 01:40:45,694
SPEAKER_1:  uh... what can you say well sort of the lessons of the twentieth century in these giant projects

01:40:46,018 --> 01:40:47,143
SPEAKER_1:  in their ability to eat some.

01:40:47,143 --> 01:40:47,742
SPEAKER_0:  of this tension.

01:40:48,802 --> 01:40:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  It's a great question. So as I said, there was a reason because it was so hard. That was one of the reasons the

01:40:55,074 --> 01:41:00,766
SPEAKER_0:  they declassified it and actually they started working together in some sense on it as well too.

01:41:01,314 --> 01:41:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  And I think it was really, there was...

01:41:05,250 --> 01:41:11,486
SPEAKER_0:  you know, an heuristic or altruistic aspect to this. It's like...

01:41:11,746 --> 01:41:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  This is something that could-

01:41:13,218 --> 01:41:14,366
SPEAKER_0:  change, you know.

01:41:14,882 --> 01:41:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  the future of humanity and its nature and its relationship with energy. Isn't this something that we should work on together?

01:41:21,794 --> 01:41:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  Right, and.

01:41:23,170 --> 01:41:26,430
SPEAKER_0:  And that went along in those ones. And in particularly-

01:41:27,330 --> 01:41:31,678
SPEAKER_0:  any kind of place where you can actually have an open exchange of

01:41:32,098 --> 01:41:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  of people who are sort of at the intellectual frontiers of your society, this is a good thing, right? of the people who are sort of at the intellectual frontiers of your society, this is a good thing.

01:41:38,178 --> 01:41:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  being able to collaborate. I've had the

01:41:40,450 --> 01:41:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I have had an amazing career. I've worked with people from, it's like hard to throw a dart at a country on the map.

01:41:49,058 --> 01:41:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  and not hit a country of people that I've been able to work with.

01:41:51,618 --> 01:41:52,990
SPEAKER_0:  How amazing is that?

01:41:53,346 --> 01:41:57,694
SPEAKER_0:  and even just getting small numbers of people to bridge the cultural...

01:41:58,178 --> 01:42:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  and societal divides is a very important thing, even when it's a very teeny fraction.

01:42:05,698 --> 01:42:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  of the overall populations.

01:42:07,458 --> 01:42:09,854
SPEAKER_0:  It can be held up as an example of that.

01:42:10,434 --> 01:42:16,574
SPEAKER_0:  But it's interesting that if you look at then that continued collaboration, which continues to this day.

01:42:16,994 --> 01:42:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  that this actually played a major role in fact in East-West relations or like Soviet-West relations.

01:42:24,738 --> 01:42:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  is that back in the Reagan Gorbachev days, which of course were interesting in themselves of all.

01:42:32,162 --> 01:42:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  kinds of.

01:42:33,282 --> 01:42:36,094
SPEAKER_0:  is happening, you know, on both sides, right?

01:42:36,322 --> 01:42:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  but still like a desire to push down the stockpile of nuclear weapons and all that within that context.

01:42:44,578 --> 01:42:45,182
SPEAKER_0:  There was.

01:42:45,634 --> 01:42:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  a very fairly significant historic event that at one of the Reagan-Gorbachev summits.

01:42:52,642 --> 01:42:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  is that they didn't get there. Like they couldn't figure out how to.

01:42:56,802 --> 01:43:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  bargain to the point of some part of the treaty I can't remember the details of anymore.

01:43:02,146 --> 01:43:04,190
SPEAKER_0:  but they needed some kind of a symbol.

01:43:04,994 --> 01:43:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  Almost.

01:43:05,858 --> 01:43:10,718
SPEAKER_0:  to say, but we're still going to keep working towards something that's important for all of us.

01:43:11,042 --> 01:43:12,606
SPEAKER_0:  What did they pick? A fusion project.

01:43:14,402 --> 01:43:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  And that was in the mid 1980s and actually.

01:43:18,370 --> 01:43:19,390
SPEAKER_0:  Then after.

01:43:19,682 --> 01:43:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  So

01:43:20,322 --> 01:43:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  they basically signed an agreement that they would move forward to like literally collaborate on a project whose idea would be to show

01:43:27,554 --> 01:43:29,854
SPEAKER_0:  large net energy gain infusions.

01:43:30,242 --> 01:43:32,862
SPEAKER_0:  commercial viability and work together on that.

01:43:33,122 --> 01:43:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  and very soon after that Japan joined, as did the European Union.

01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  And now, um...

01:43:39,042 --> 01:43:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  that project, it evolved.

01:43:41,986 --> 01:43:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  over a long period of time and had some interesting political ramifications to it.

01:43:46,370 --> 01:43:48,382
SPEAKER_0:  In the end, this actually also had...

01:43:48,674 --> 01:43:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  South Korea, India.

01:43:50,626 --> 01:43:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  in China.

01:43:51,554 --> 01:43:52,734
SPEAKER_0:  join as well too.

01:43:53,250 --> 01:43:55,486
SPEAKER_0:  So you're talking about like major.

01:43:56,386 --> 01:44:01,022
SPEAKER_0:  a major fraction of, and now Russia of course, at the Soviet Union.

01:44:01,538 --> 01:44:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  And actually that coalition is holding together despite the obvious political.

01:44:06,338 --> 01:44:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  you know, a turmoil that's going around on all those things. And that's a project called ETER.

01:44:11,202 --> 01:44:14,110
SPEAKER_0:  which is under construction in the south of France right now.

01:44:14,434 --> 01:44:21,598
SPEAKER_1:  Can you actually look at it before we turn the giant magnet and maybe even talk about spark and the stuff going though all amazing stuff going on at MIT.

01:44:21,954 --> 01:44:25,758
SPEAKER_1:  What is Zeter? What is this international nuclear fusion megaproject?

01:44:26,146 --> 01:44:28,487
SPEAKER_1:  being built in the South of

01:44:28,487 --> 01:44:30,206
SPEAKER_0:  So its scientific purpose

01:44:30,434 --> 01:44:33,534
SPEAKER_0:  is a worthy one than it's essentially in any fusion device.

01:44:34,370 --> 01:44:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  The thing that you want to see is more and more relative amounts of self-heating.

01:44:38,594 --> 01:44:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  And this is something that had not been seen, although we had made fusion reactions and we'd seen small amounts of the self heating.

01:44:45,442 --> 01:44:48,926
SPEAKER_0:  We never got to a dominant, this actually goes to this QP business. Okay.

01:44:49,538 --> 01:44:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  the goal of Eater.

01:44:51,394 --> 01:44:59,454
SPEAKER_0:  And it shifted around a little bit historically, but very, you know, fairly quickly became we want to get to a large amount of self-heating. So this is why it has a

01:44:59,746 --> 01:45:03,102
SPEAKER_0:  Its primary feature is to get to QP of around 10.

01:45:03,490 --> 01:45:04,286
SPEAKER_0:  And through this...

01:45:04,610 --> 01:45:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  This is a way to study this plasma that has

01:45:08,354 --> 01:45:11,454
SPEAKER_0:  more higher levels of self-determination around on it.

01:45:12,450 --> 01:45:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  but it also has another feature which was

01:45:15,298 --> 01:45:18,814
SPEAKER_0:  let's produce fusion power at a relevant scale.

01:45:19,810 --> 01:45:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:45:20,386 --> 01:45:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  And actually they're linked together, which actually makes sense. What you think about is that-

01:45:23,906 --> 01:45:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  because the fusion power

01:45:25,666 --> 01:45:30,782
SPEAKER_0:  is the heating source itself, this means that they're linked together. And so Eater makes

01:45:31,298 --> 01:45:34,814
SPEAKER_0:  is projected to make about 500 million watts.

01:45:35,234 --> 01:45:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  Fusion power?

01:45:36,802 --> 01:45:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  So this is a significant amount like this is what you would use.

01:45:40,450 --> 01:45:42,325
SPEAKER_0:  You know, for powering cities.

01:45:42,325 --> 01:45:48,158
SPEAKER_1:  just the research that there really is the development of really trying to achieve scale here so self heating and scale

01:45:49,026 --> 01:45:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

01:45:49,794 --> 01:45:51,166
SPEAKER_0:  So this meant then...

01:45:51,586 --> 01:45:52,638
SPEAKER_0:  2 is the

01:45:52,930 --> 01:45:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  the development of an industrial base that can actually produce the technologies like the electromagnets and so forth.

01:45:59,106 --> 01:46:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  And to do it with, it is a tokamak. It is, it is.

01:46:02,146 --> 01:46:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, but very interesting. It also revealed limitations of this as well too.

01:46:07,586 --> 01:46:09,822
SPEAKER_0:  Well, it's interesting is that.

01:46:10,242 --> 01:46:11,838
SPEAKER_0:  It is clearly a.

01:46:12,386 --> 01:46:17,438
SPEAKER_0:  on paper and in fact in practice as well too, the world…

01:46:18,018 --> 01:46:26,174
SPEAKER_0:  the world, you know, in very different political systems and you consider at least geopolitical or economic rivals or whatever you want to use.

01:46:26,498 --> 01:46:29,118
SPEAKER_0:  like working towards a common cause.

01:46:29,474 --> 01:46:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  and one that we all think is worthy is very satisfying.

01:46:34,562 --> 01:46:35,998
SPEAKER_0:  But it's also interesting to see.

01:46:36,578 --> 01:46:38,494
SPEAKER_0:  the limitations of this, it's because

01:46:38,946 --> 01:46:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  Well, you've got seven chefs in the kitchen.

01:46:43,522 --> 01:46:45,726
SPEAKER_0:  So what is this meant in terms of...

01:46:46,114 --> 01:46:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  the speed of the project and the ability to govern it and so forth. It's just been a challenge, honestly, around us.

01:46:53,506 --> 01:46:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  This is

01:46:54,626 --> 01:46:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  I mean it's very hard technically what's occurring.

01:46:57,442 --> 01:47:05,918
SPEAKER_0:  But when you also introduce such levels of, I mean, this isn't just me saying it. There's like GEOO reports from the US government and so on. It's hard to like...

01:47:06,178 --> 01:47:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  steer all this around.

01:47:08,002 --> 01:47:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:47:09,122 --> 01:47:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  And what that's tended to do is make it.

01:47:11,554 --> 01:47:14,398
SPEAKER_0:  It's not the fastest decision making process.

01:47:14,754 --> 01:47:20,830
SPEAKER_0:  My own personal view of it was it was interesting because you asked me, you said about the magnet and common fusion systems.

01:47:21,634 --> 01:47:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  It was.

01:47:22,978 --> 01:47:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  I worked most of my career on Eater because when I came into the field in the early 1990s when I-

01:47:29,762 --> 01:47:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  completed my PhD and started to work.

01:47:32,450 --> 01:47:39,550
SPEAKER_0:  This was one of the most, like you can't imagine being more excited about something like we're going to change the world with this project. We're going to do these things.

01:47:39,938 --> 01:47:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  And we just like port like.

01:47:42,018 --> 01:47:48,510
SPEAKER_0:  An entire generation and afterwards as well too, has just poured their imagination and their creativity about making this thing work.

01:47:48,962 --> 01:47:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  Very good.

01:47:49,762 --> 01:47:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  But also at some point though when, you know.

01:47:52,674 --> 01:47:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  when it got to being another five years of delay or a decade of delay, you start asking yourself, well,

01:47:58,946 --> 01:48:03,678
SPEAKER_0:  Is this what I want to do? Right. Am I going to wait for this? So it was a part of-

01:48:03,970 --> 01:48:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  me starting to ask questions with my students.

01:48:07,170 --> 01:48:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  I was like...

01:48:08,706 --> 01:48:13,790
SPEAKER_0:  Is there another way that we can get to this extremely worthwhile goal that maybe

01:48:14,114 --> 01:48:20,094
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe it's not that pathway. And the other part that was clearly frustrating to me because I.

01:48:20,514 --> 01:48:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  I'm an advocate of fusion. You asked me about, was I, you know, I was like, well, it's laser fusion or inertial fusion or magnetic fusion.

01:48:28,290 --> 01:48:29,918
SPEAKER_0:  I just want fusion energy, okay?

01:48:30,178 --> 01:48:32,510
SPEAKER_0:  because I think it's so important to the world.

01:48:33,026 --> 01:48:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  is that.

01:48:34,210 --> 01:48:36,222
SPEAKER_0:  The other thing, if that's the case...

01:48:37,538 --> 01:48:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  then why do we have only one?

01:48:40,386 --> 01:48:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  attempt at it on the entire planet.

01:48:43,202 --> 01:48:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  which was Eater.

01:48:45,122 --> 01:48:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  It's like that makes no sense to me, right? We should have multiple attempts at this with different...

01:48:51,554 --> 01:49:00,702
SPEAKER_0:  levels of whatever you want to think about a technical schedule, scientific risk, which are incorporated in them, and that's going to give us a better chance of actually getting to the goal line.

01:49:01,314 --> 01:49:02,439
SPEAKER_0:  With that spirit.

01:49:02,439 --> 01:49:06,590
SPEAKER_1:  You're leading MIT's effort to design Spark, a compact high field.

01:49:07,298 --> 01:49:08,766
SPEAKER_1:  DT Burning Takamak.

01:49:09,698 --> 01:49:10,462
SPEAKER_1:  How does it work?

01:49:10,786 --> 01:49:12,542
SPEAKER_1:  What is it? What's the motivation?

01:49:12,802 --> 01:49:14,677
SPEAKER_1:  uh... what's the design what are they do

01:49:14,677 --> 01:49:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  behind. Yeah.

01:49:15,778 --> 01:49:18,366
SPEAKER_0:  At its heart, it's exactly the same concept as ITER.

01:49:18,818 --> 01:49:21,854
SPEAKER_0:  So it's basically a configuration of electromagnets.

01:49:22,242 --> 01:49:24,030
SPEAKER_0:  It's arranged in the shape of a donut.

01:49:24,418 --> 01:49:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  And within that we would do the same thing that happens in all the other token max and including an eater and in this one.

01:49:30,946 --> 01:49:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  is that namely you put in gas, make it into a plasma, you heat it up.

01:49:34,658 --> 01:49:36,446
SPEAKER_0:  It gets to about 100 million degrees.

01:49:37,250 --> 01:49:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  The differentiator in Spark is that

01:49:40,066 --> 01:49:42,494
SPEAKER_0:  We use the actual deuterium tritium fuel.

01:49:43,074 --> 01:49:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:49:44,194 --> 01:49:47,902
SPEAKER_0:  because of the access to very high magnetic fields.

01:49:48,258 --> 01:49:49,758
SPEAKER_0:  It's in a very compact.

01:49:50,082 --> 01:49:51,614
SPEAKER_0:  space. It's very-

01:49:52,322 --> 01:49:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  very small.

01:49:54,018 --> 01:49:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  What do I mean by small?

01:49:55,394 --> 01:49:55,966
SPEAKER_0:  So it's...

01:49:56,194 --> 01:49:59,134
SPEAKER_0:  40 times smaller in volume than Eater.

01:50:00,258 --> 01:50:04,894
SPEAKER_0:  but it uses exactly the same physical principles. So this comes from the high magnetic field.

01:50:05,122 --> 01:50:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  So in the end.

01:50:06,082 --> 01:50:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  Like what is, why does this matter? What it does is it does those things.

01:50:09,730 --> 01:50:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  And it should get to the point where it's producing over a hundred million watts of fusion power.

01:50:15,938 --> 01:50:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  But remember, it's 40 times smaller. So either was 500 megawatts.

01:50:20,002 --> 01:50:20,670
SPEAKER_0:  technically.

01:50:21,058 --> 01:50:27,454
SPEAKER_0:  Our design is around 150 megawatts. So it's only about a factor of three difference despite being 40 times smaller.

01:50:28,034 --> 01:50:29,630
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and we see.

01:50:30,402 --> 01:50:32,382
SPEAKER_0:  QP large.

01:50:33,666 --> 01:50:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  order of 10 or something like this at that state.

01:50:37,506 --> 01:50:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  is very important scientifically because this is basically matches what Eater is looking to do. The plasma is dominated by its own heating.

01:50:45,570 --> 01:50:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  is very, very important.

01:50:47,458 --> 01:50:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  And it does that for about 10 seconds.

01:50:50,786 --> 01:50:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  And the reason it's for 10 seconds is that in terms of that, that basically allows everything to settle in terms of.

01:50:56,994 --> 01:51:01,022
SPEAKER_0:  the fusion in the plasma equilibrium, everything is nice and settled.

01:51:01,250 --> 01:51:07,902
SPEAKER_0:  So you know, you have seen the physical state at which you would expect a power plant to operate basically for a

01:51:08,162 --> 01:51:09,054
SPEAKER_0:  for magnetic fusion.

01:51:09,410 --> 01:51:09,918
SPEAKER_0:  Like, wow.

01:51:11,394 --> 01:51:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  But it's more than that.

01:51:13,282 --> 01:51:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  And it's more than that, it's because about who's building it and why, and how it's being financed.

01:51:18,882 --> 01:51:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  So that scientific pathway was made possible by the fact that we had access to a next generation.

01:51:26,306 --> 01:51:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  of magnet technology.

01:51:28,610 --> 01:51:29,758
SPEAKER_0:  So to explain this real quick.

01:51:29,986 --> 01:51:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  Why do we call it, you said it in the words, a superconducting magnet? What does this mean?

01:51:34,818 --> 01:51:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  Superconducting magnet means that the materials which are in the electromagnet

01:51:38,626 --> 01:51:40,190
SPEAKER_0:  have no electrical resistance.

01:51:40,546 --> 01:51:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  Therefore, when the electric current is put into it...

01:51:44,130 --> 01:51:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  the current goes around unimpeded.

01:51:46,434 --> 01:51:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  So it could basically keep going around and around, you know, technically for infinity.

01:51:50,370 --> 01:51:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  and what that means is that the…

01:51:54,818 --> 01:52:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  when you energize these large electromagnets, they're using basically zero electrical power to maintain them.

01:52:01,634 --> 01:52:05,598
SPEAKER_0:  Whereas if you would do this in a normal wire, like copper,

01:52:05,858 --> 01:52:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  You basically make an enormous toaster oven.

01:52:08,290 --> 01:52:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  that's consuming enormous amounts of power and getting hot, which is the problem.

01:52:12,706 --> 01:52:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  That was the technical breakthrough.

01:52:14,882 --> 01:52:16,126
SPEAKER_0:  that was realized.

01:52:16,674 --> 01:52:21,950
SPEAKER_0:  by myself and at the time my students and post-docs and colleagues at MIT.

01:52:22,306 --> 01:52:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  was that we saw the advent of this.

01:52:25,410 --> 01:52:33,022
SPEAKER_0:  new superconducting material which would allow us to access much higher magnetic fields. It's basically a next generation of the technology.

01:52:33,474 --> 01:52:34,526
SPEAKER_0:  And, um.

01:52:34,818 --> 01:52:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  And it was quite disruptive to fusion that namely what it would allow that if we could if we could get to this point where we can make the round 20 Tesla

01:52:42,562 --> 01:52:48,702
SPEAKER_0:  we knew by the rules of tokimaks that this is going to allow us to vastly shrink.

01:52:49,058 --> 01:52:51,614
SPEAKER_0:  like the sizes of these devices, so it wouldn't take.

01:52:52,194 --> 01:52:58,878
SPEAKER_0:  Although it's a worthy goal, it wouldn't take a seven nation international treaty basically to build it.

01:52:59,202 --> 01:53:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  You could build it with a company and a university.

01:53:01,890 --> 01:53:05,265
SPEAKER_1:  So same kind of design, but now using the superconducting magnet.

01:53:05,265 --> 01:53:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:53:05,890 --> 01:53:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  And if in fact, if you look at it, it's like, it's.

01:53:08,450 --> 01:53:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  If you just expand the size of it, they're like, they look almost identical to each other because it's based on the, and actually that comes for a reason, by the way, is that it also looks like a bigger version.

01:53:18,434 --> 01:53:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  of the tokamak that we ran at MIT for 20 years.

01:53:22,178 --> 01:53:23,166
SPEAKER_0:  where we established

01:53:23,490 --> 01:53:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  the scientific benefits, in fact, of these higher magnetic fields.

01:53:27,362 --> 01:53:30,782
SPEAKER_0:  So that's the pathway that runs. So I always say, so what does this mean?

01:53:31,042 --> 01:53:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  The context is different.

01:53:33,730 --> 01:53:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  Because...

01:53:35,266 --> 01:53:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  It was made because it's primarily being made by a private sector company spun out of MIT.

01:53:41,698 --> 01:53:48,350
SPEAKER_0:  because the way that it raised money and the purpose of the entity which is there is to make commercial fusion power plants.

01:53:48,770 --> 01:53:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  not just to make a scientific experiment.

01:53:51,266 --> 01:53:52,894
SPEAKER_0:  This is actually why we have...

01:53:53,826 --> 01:53:59,166
SPEAKER_0:  That's why we have a partnership, right, is that our purpose at MIT is not to commercialize directly.

01:53:59,394 --> 01:54:05,653
SPEAKER_0:  But boy, do we want to advance the technology and the science that comes along this. And that's the reason we're sort of doing it together.

01:54:05,653 --> 01:54:12,446
SPEAKER_1:  MIT and Commonwealth Fusion Systems. So what's interesting to say about financing? And this seems like from a scientific view.

01:54:12,674 --> 01:54:17,662
SPEAKER_1:  perspective, maybe not an interesting topic, but it's perhaps an extremely interesting topic.

01:54:17,890 --> 01:54:19,742
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, you can just look at the texture between.

01:54:20,130 --> 01:54:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  SpaceX and NASA, for example. It's just clear that there's different financing mechanisms that actually significantly accelerate.

01:54:28,994 --> 01:54:31,166
SPEAKER_1:  the development of science and engineering.

01:54:32,098 --> 01:54:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  It's great that you brought that up. We use several historic.

01:54:35,106 --> 01:54:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  analogs and one of them is around SpaceX, which is an appropriate one because

01:54:39,842 --> 01:54:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  Space, you know.

01:54:41,282 --> 01:54:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  putting things into orbit has a, just to put.

01:54:43,522 --> 01:54:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  has a minimum size to it and

01:54:45,698 --> 01:54:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  integrated technological complexity and budget and things like this.

01:54:50,178 --> 01:54:50,526
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:54:50,786 --> 01:54:56,350
SPEAKER_0:  You know, our point when we were like talking about starting like a fusion commercialization, you know, company.

01:54:56,866 --> 01:55:00,766
SPEAKER_0:  people look at you like, isn't this still really just a science experiment?

01:55:01,218 --> 01:55:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  But one of the things that we pointed to was...

01:55:03,682 --> 01:55:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  SpaceX to say well.

01:55:05,218 --> 01:55:15,934
SPEAKER_0:  Tell me like 25 years ago, how many people would have voted that the leading entity on the planet to put things into orbit, it's a private company. People would have thought you were not so, right? It's like...

01:55:16,642 --> 01:55:22,558
SPEAKER_0:  And what is interesting about SpaceX was that it proved it's more than actually just finance.

01:55:23,490 --> 01:55:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  It's really the purpose of the organization.

01:55:26,690 --> 01:55:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  So the purpose of a gu-

01:55:28,354 --> 01:55:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  and I'm not against public finance or anything like that, but the purpose of a public entity like NASA.

01:55:35,554 --> 01:55:38,270
SPEAKER_0:  correctly speaks to the political...

01:55:39,010 --> 01:55:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  Because the cost comes from the political.

01:55:41,922 --> 01:55:43,422
SPEAKER_0:  you know, assembly.

01:55:43,682 --> 01:55:47,038
SPEAKER_0:  that is there and I guess from us eventually as well too.

01:55:47,394 --> 01:55:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  but its purpose wasn't about making a commercial product.

01:55:51,938 --> 01:55:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  It's about fundamental discovery and so forth, which is all rich is all really great.

01:55:56,450 --> 01:55:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  Like why did, why did space X

01:55:59,170 --> 01:56:02,014
SPEAKER_0:  It's interesting because why did SpaceX succeed so well?

01:56:02,242 --> 01:56:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  is because the idea was it's like the the focus that comes

01:56:06,562 --> 01:56:10,846
SPEAKER_0:  in the idea that you're going to relentlessly reduce costs.

01:56:11,362 --> 01:56:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  and increase efficiency is a drive that comes from the commercial.

01:56:15,586 --> 01:56:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  aspect of it, right?

01:56:17,218 --> 01:56:19,454
SPEAKER_0:  And this also then changes...

01:56:19,906 --> 01:56:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  the people in the teams which are doing as well too. In fact trickles throughout the whole thing because

01:56:25,378 --> 01:56:26,686
SPEAKER_0:  The purpose isn't.

01:56:26,978 --> 01:56:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  While you're advancing things, it's really good that we can put things in orbit a lot more cheaply. It advances science, which is an interesting synergy, right?

01:56:35,746 --> 01:56:46,174
SPEAKER_0:  It's the same thing that we think is going to happen in fusion, that namely, this is a bootstrap effect that actually, that when you start to push yourself to think about near term.

01:56:46,434 --> 01:56:47,582
SPEAKER_0:  commercialization.

01:56:47,874 --> 01:56:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  It allows the science to get in hand faster, which then allows the commercialization to go faster and up we go.

01:56:55,490 --> 01:56:58,334
SPEAKER_0:  By the way, we've seen this also in another, again, it's a.

01:56:58,626 --> 01:57:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  You have to watch out with analogies because they only can go so far but like biotech.

01:57:03,874 --> 01:57:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  is another one, like you look at the human genome project, which was...

01:57:08,130 --> 01:57:12,510
SPEAKER_0:  It's sort of like, to me, that's like mapping the human genome.

01:57:12,930 --> 01:57:17,182
SPEAKER_0:  Like that we can make net energy from fusion. Like it's one of those like.

01:57:17,538 --> 01:57:22,814
SPEAKER_0:  in your drawer that you go, this is a significant achievement by humanity, right, in the century.

01:57:23,170 --> 01:57:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:57:23,842 --> 01:57:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  There's the human genome project.

01:57:25,954 --> 01:57:27,262
SPEAKER_0:  Fully government funded.

01:57:27,874 --> 01:57:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  going to take 20, 25 years because we basically know the technology.

01:57:32,546 --> 01:57:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  We're just going to be really diligent. Keep going da-da-da-da.

01:57:35,490 --> 01:57:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  And then all of a sudden what comes along?

01:57:37,666 --> 01:57:39,518
SPEAKER_0:  disruptive technology.

01:57:39,746 --> 01:57:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  Right? You can sequence, you know, shotgun sequencing and computer, you know, recognition patterns and basically, oh,

01:57:46,882 --> 01:57:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  I can do this 100 times faster.

01:57:49,378 --> 01:57:50,014
SPEAKER_0:  Like, wow.

01:57:50,306 --> 01:57:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  Right. And so, so that's really the.

01:57:53,250 --> 01:57:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  uh, you know, to me that the story about why we started, why we launched common with fusion systems was more than

01:58:00,290 --> 01:58:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  just about another source of funding.

01:58:03,138 --> 01:58:06,654
SPEAKER_0:  which it is a different source of funding because it comes with... it's also a different purpose.

01:58:06,978 --> 01:58:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  which is very important.

01:58:08,162 --> 01:58:09,566
SPEAKER_1:  But there's also something about

01:58:10,114 --> 01:58:12,030
SPEAKER_1:  a mechanism that creates culture.

01:58:12,802 --> 01:58:20,830
SPEAKER_1:  So giving power to like a young student, ambitious student to have a tremendous impact on the progress of nuclear fusion.

01:58:21,314 --> 01:58:24,798
SPEAKER_1:  creates a culture that actually makes progress target slowly.

01:58:25,090 --> 01:58:27,358
SPEAKER_1:  Like you said, when seven nations collaborate...

01:58:27,874 --> 01:58:38,686
SPEAKER_1:  it gives more incentive to the bureaucracy to slow things down, to kind of have, let's first have a discussion and certainly don't give voice to the young, ambitious minds that are really pushing stuff forward.

01:58:38,946 --> 01:58:39,934
SPEAKER_1:  And there's something about.

01:58:40,482 --> 01:58:41,918
SPEAKER_1:  like the private sector that

01:58:42,914 --> 01:58:45,502
SPEAKER_1:  rewards, encourages, inspires.

01:58:45,890 --> 01:58:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  Young minds.

01:58:47,298 --> 01:58:51,518
SPEAKER_1:  to say in the most beautiful ways, F you to the.....

01:58:51,970 --> 01:58:53,598
SPEAKER_0:  It is, it is a little... The boss!

01:58:53,698 --> 01:58:58,174
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, just like we'll make it faster. We'll make it simpler. We'll make it better. We'll make it cheaper.

01:58:58,466 --> 01:59:05,758
SPEAKER_0:  And sometimes that brashness doesn't bear out. You know, that's an aspect that you just take a different risk profile as well too. But you're right. This

01:59:06,370 --> 01:59:07,454
SPEAKER_0:  You know, of the...

01:59:07,874 --> 01:59:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it was interesting, our own trajectory at the fusion center was.

01:59:12,482 --> 01:59:16,830
SPEAKER_0:  Like we were pushed into this place by necessity as well too, because

01:59:17,090 --> 01:59:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  I told you we had operated for a long time a tokamak.

01:59:21,442 --> 01:59:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  at on the MIT campus achieve these world records like 100 million degree plasma and stuff like wow this is fantastic

01:59:30,370 --> 01:59:33,534
SPEAKER_0:  you know, somewhat ironically I have to say is that it was like oh

01:59:33,826 --> 01:59:45,534
SPEAKER_0:  But we're not, this isn't the future of fusion anymore. Like we're not, we're just going to stop with small projects because it's too small, right? So we should need, we need to really move on to these much bigger projects because that's really the future of fusion.

01:59:45,922 --> 01:59:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  And so it was defunded.

01:59:47,746 --> 01:59:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  And this basically put at risk like we were going to essentially lose MIT in the ecosystem.

01:59:54,178 --> 01:59:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  really a fusion, both from the research but also from the research.

01:59:57,282 --> 01:59:59,134
SPEAKER_0:  clearly important from educational.

01:59:59,586 --> 02:00:00,030
SPEAKER_0:  part of it.

02:00:00,386 --> 02:00:04,126
SPEAKER_0:  So we, you know, we pushed back against this. We got a lifeline.

02:00:04,578 --> 02:00:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  We were able to go and it was in this time scale that we basically came up with this idea.

02:00:10,050 --> 02:00:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  we should do this and in the end it was

02:00:12,642 --> 02:00:13,822
SPEAKER_0:  All of those.

02:00:14,338 --> 02:00:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  the people who were in the C level of the company were all literally students who got caught in that. They were PhD students at the time.

02:00:21,954 --> 02:00:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  So you talk about enabling.

02:00:23,842 --> 02:00:27,527
SPEAKER_0:  another generation is like, yeah, there you go. Right.

02:00:27,527 --> 02:00:29,438
SPEAKER_1:  So Spark gave...

02:00:29,634 --> 02:00:31,509
SPEAKER_0:  A lifeline.

02:00:31,509 --> 02:00:33,759
SPEAKER_1:  to the the future set at MIT.

02:00:33,759 --> 02:00:39,422
SPEAKER_0:  But it's way more than that. It wasn't just about like surviving for the sake of surviving. It was like-

02:00:39,906 --> 02:00:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  In the end for me, it became like this. I remember the moment. Do we talk about these moments as a scientist and-

02:00:45,826 --> 02:00:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  We were just like, we were working so hard about figuring out like, does this really, will this really work? Like, and it's complex.

02:00:52,514 --> 02:00:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  Like does the magnet work? Does the interaction with the plasmid work? Does all these things work? And it was just a grind push, push, push, push.

02:00:59,106 --> 02:01:01,086
SPEAKER_0:  And I remember the moment because I was sitting.

02:01:02,082 --> 02:01:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  in my office in Brookline.

02:01:04,418 --> 02:01:10,750
SPEAKER_0:  And there was just like, I read like, and I was in, I don't know, whatever, the 20th or 40th slide or something into it.

02:01:11,106 --> 02:01:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  And it was sort of that moment, like it just came together.

02:01:13,826 --> 02:01:15,998
SPEAKER_0:  And I like, I got, I couldn't even sit down.

02:01:16,514 --> 02:01:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  Because all it was just like, my wife was like, why are you walking around the apartment like this? I just couldn't, I said it's going to work.

02:01:22,594 --> 02:01:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  like it's going to work.

02:01:23,810 --> 02:01:27,166
SPEAKER_0:  Like, holy cow, that moment of realization is like.

02:01:27,554 --> 02:01:32,429
SPEAKER_0:  kind of amazing, but it also brings the responsibility of making it work as well. How do you spell that?

02:01:32,429 --> 02:01:34,078
SPEAKER_1:  So you mean like that magic?

02:01:34,466 --> 02:01:40,126
SPEAKER_1:  Realization that you can have this this modern magnet technology and you can actually.

02:01:40,482 --> 02:01:42,846
SPEAKER_1:  Like why do we need to work with either we can do it here?

02:01:43,010 --> 02:01:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, yeah. But it's interesting that Eater is...

02:01:46,210 --> 02:01:46,654
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:01:47,170 --> 02:01:57,886
SPEAKER_0:  That one of the reasons that we started with a group of six of us at MIT, and then once we got some funding through the establishment of the company, it became a slightly larger.

02:01:58,210 --> 02:02:00,670
SPEAKER_0:  But in the end we had a rather small team.

02:02:01,058 --> 02:02:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  This was like a team of order of like 20 to 25 people line spark in

02:02:06,370 --> 02:02:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  like about two years.

02:02:08,258 --> 02:02:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  Right.

02:02:08,930 --> 02:02:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  How does that happen? Well,

02:02:10,530 --> 02:02:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  We're clever?

02:02:11,522 --> 02:02:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  But you have to give either it's due here as well too.

02:02:14,754 --> 02:02:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  Again, this is an aspect always of

02:02:17,122 --> 02:02:20,670
SPEAKER_0:  the boot strap up, like I go back to the human genome project.

02:02:21,058 --> 02:02:27,038
SPEAKER_0:  So modern day genomics would not be possible without the underlying basis that came from setting that up.

02:02:27,394 --> 02:02:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  It had to be there. It had to be curiosity driven, public program. It's the same with Eader, but because we had the tools.

02:02:34,146 --> 02:02:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  that we're there to understand Eader, we also have the tools to understand Spark.

02:02:37,794 --> 02:02:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  So we parlayed those in an extremely powerful way.

02:02:41,538 --> 02:02:43,422
SPEAKER_0:  to be able to tell us about what was going to happen.

02:02:43,778 --> 02:02:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  So these things are never simple, right? It's like people look at this go, Oh, this means we should.

02:02:47,938 --> 02:02:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  Like should we really have a public based program about Fusion or should we have it all in the private?

02:02:52,866 --> 02:02:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  No, the answer is neither way because in all these...

02:02:55,682 --> 02:02:59,358
SPEAKER_0:  complex technologies, you have to keep pushing on all the fronts to actually get it there.

02:03:00,226 --> 02:03:02,023
SPEAKER_0:  So, you know, the natural question.

02:03:02,023 --> 02:03:03,038
SPEAKER_1:  We hear breakthrough.

02:03:03,458 --> 02:03:06,590
SPEAKER_1:  with the inertial confinement, with the magnetic confinement.

02:03:07,042 --> 02:03:08,830
SPEAKER_1:  So when will we have commercial?

02:03:09,410 --> 02:03:09,918
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:03:10,434 --> 02:03:15,102
SPEAKER_1:  reactors power plants that are actually producing electricity. What's your sense?

02:03:15,906 --> 02:03:21,933
SPEAKER_1:  Looking out into the future, what do you think you can envision in the future where we have actual electricity coming from?

02:03:21,933 --> 02:03:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  nuclear fusion. Partly driven by us but in other places as well too. There's the advent what's so different now than three or four years.

02:03:30,914 --> 02:03:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  like we launched around four years ago.

02:03:33,826 --> 02:03:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  What's so different now is the advent of a very nascent but-

02:03:38,882 --> 02:03:40,798
SPEAKER_0:  seemingly robust like commercial

02:03:41,122 --> 02:03:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  you know, endeavor.

02:03:43,778 --> 02:03:47,358
SPEAKER_0:  So it's not just commonwealth fusion systems, there's something like 20 plus.

02:03:47,842 --> 02:03:57,886
SPEAKER_0:  you know, companies. There's a sector now. There's a sector. They actually, they actually have something called the fusion industry association, which if your viewers want to go see this, this describes the different.

02:03:58,146 --> 02:04:03,934
SPEAKER_0:  and they've got this plethora of approaches. Like I haven't even described all the approaches. I've basically described the mainline approaches.

02:04:04,482 --> 02:04:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  uh... you know

02:04:05,602 --> 02:04:09,502
SPEAKER_0:  And they're all at varying degrees of technical and scientific maturity with.

02:04:09,922 --> 02:04:12,798
SPEAKER_0:  very huge different balances between them.

02:04:14,274 --> 02:04:15,294
SPEAKER_0:  What they share.

02:04:16,098 --> 02:04:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  is that because they're going out and finding getting funding from the private sector.

02:04:20,130 --> 02:04:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  is that their stated goals

02:04:21,890 --> 02:04:22,334
SPEAKER_0:  or about.

02:04:23,554 --> 02:04:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  Getting Fusion.

02:04:25,026 --> 02:04:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  into place so that both it meets the investors demands, which are interesting, right? And the time skills of that, but also it's like, well,

02:04:33,474 --> 02:04:37,982
SPEAKER_0:  There's going to, and why? It's because it's easy. There's this enormous push.

02:04:38,626 --> 02:04:44,254
SPEAKER_0:  driver about getting carbon free energy sources out into the market and whoever.

02:04:44,610 --> 02:04:51,070
SPEAKER_0:  figures those out is going to be both very, it's going to be very important geopolitically but also economically as well too.

02:04:51,522 --> 02:04:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:04:52,354 --> 02:04:53,726
SPEAKER_0:  It's a different kind of...

02:04:54,690 --> 02:04:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  bat I guess or a different kind of gamble that you're taking with fusion but it's so disruptive.

02:05:00,002 --> 02:05:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  that it's like there's essentially a class of investors.

02:05:03,426 --> 02:05:06,078
SPEAKER_0:  and teams that are ready to go after it as well too.

02:05:06,466 --> 02:05:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  So what do they share in this?

02:05:08,322 --> 02:05:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  They typically share.

02:05:10,114 --> 02:05:13,022
SPEAKER_0:  getting after fusion on a timescale so that

02:05:13,378 --> 02:05:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  Could it have any relevance towards?

02:05:15,522 --> 02:05:17,406
SPEAKER_0:  Climate change, battling climate change.

02:05:18,018 --> 02:05:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  And I would say.

02:05:19,170 --> 02:05:20,414
SPEAKER_0:  This is difficult but-

02:05:20,738 --> 02:05:31,806
SPEAKER_0:  It's fairly easy because it's math. So what you do is you actually go to some target like 2050 or 2060, something like this, and say, I want to be blank percent of the world's market of electricity or something like that.

02:05:32,162 --> 02:05:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  And we know historically what it takes to...

02:05:35,426 --> 02:05:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  Evolve.

02:05:36,322 --> 02:05:47,742
SPEAKER_0:  and distribute these kinds of technologies. Cause every technology takes some period of time. It's so called S curve. It's basically everything follows a logarithmic curve, exponential type curve. That's a straight line of log plot.

02:05:48,162 --> 02:05:56,382
SPEAKER_0:  And like you look at wind, solar, fission, they all follow the same thing. So it's easy. You take that curve and you go that slope and you work backwards.

02:05:56,674 --> 02:05:59,550
SPEAKER_0:  And you go, if you don't start in the early 2030s, like.

02:06:00,354 --> 02:06:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  It's not gonna have a...

02:06:01,858 --> 02:06:04,350
SPEAKER_0:  It's not going to have a significant impact by that time.

02:06:04,738 --> 02:06:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:06:05,442 --> 02:06:08,990
SPEAKER_0:  All of them share this idea. And in fact, it's not just the companies now.

02:06:09,346 --> 02:06:11,710
SPEAKER_0:  The US federal government has a program.

02:06:11,970 --> 02:06:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  that was started last year that said.

02:06:14,242 --> 02:06:22,206
SPEAKER_0:  We should be looking to try to get like the first and what I mean by like, what does it mean to start that you've got something that's putting electricity on the grid, a pilot.

02:06:22,530 --> 02:06:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  Mukul.

02:06:24,194 --> 02:06:27,262
SPEAKER_0:  And if that can get started, like in the early 2030s.

02:06:27,586 --> 02:06:30,654
SPEAKER_0:  you know, the idea of ramping it up, you know, makes sense. math!

02:06:30,882 --> 02:06:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  Right.

02:06:31,682 --> 02:06:32,094
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:06:32,546 --> 02:06:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  that's the ambition, then the question is, and actually this is different because the government program

02:06:38,370 --> 02:06:44,574
SPEAKER_0:  and they vary around in this. So for example, the United Kingdom's government idea was to get the first one on by 2040.

02:06:45,538 --> 02:06:48,702
SPEAKER_0:  And China has ambitions probably middle.

02:06:48,930 --> 02:06:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  2030s.

02:06:50,434 --> 02:06:54,846
SPEAKER_0:  or maybe a little bit later and Europe, continental Europe.

02:06:55,330 --> 02:07:03,102
SPEAKER_0:  is a little bit, I'm not exactly sure where it is, but it's like later, it's like 2050 or 2060 because it's mostly linked to the Eater timeline as well too.

02:07:03,842 --> 02:07:04,286
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:07:04,898 --> 02:07:11,614
SPEAKER_0:  the fusion companies, which makes sense, it's like, of course they've got the most aggressive timelines, it's like, we're gonna map the human genome faster as well too, right?

02:07:12,130 --> 02:07:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  So it's interesting about where we are. And I think, you know, my-

02:07:16,770 --> 02:07:23,326
SPEAKER_0:  We're not all the way there, but my intuition tells me we're probably going to have a couple of cracks at it actually on that timeline.

02:07:24,482 --> 02:07:27,710
SPEAKER_0:  This is where we have to be careful though, you say commercial fusion.

02:07:28,098 --> 02:07:28,798
SPEAKER_0:  What does that mean?

02:07:29,410 --> 02:07:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  Commercial fusion to me means that you're actually...

02:07:32,290 --> 02:07:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  Have a...

02:07:33,634 --> 02:07:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  known quantity about what it costs, what it costs to build and what it costs to operate.

02:07:38,786 --> 02:07:42,686
SPEAKER_0:  the reliability of putting energy on the grid. That's commercial fusion.

02:07:43,362 --> 02:07:43,710
SPEAKER_0:  Sike.

02:07:43,938 --> 02:07:51,358
SPEAKER_0:  So it turns out that that's not necessarily exactly the first fusion devices that put electricity on the grid because there's a learning curve to get.

02:07:52,066 --> 02:07:53,150
SPEAKER_0:  better and better at it.

02:07:54,530 --> 02:07:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  That's probably, I would suspect the biggest hurdle is to get to the first one.

02:07:59,266 --> 02:08:00,222
SPEAKER_1:  The work I've done.

02:08:00,546 --> 02:08:06,206
SPEAKER_1:  other work I continue to do with autonomous vehicles and semi-autonomous vehicles. There's an interesting parallel there were a bunch of companies.

02:08:06,562 --> 02:08:07,294
SPEAKER_1:  announced.

02:08:07,650 --> 02:08:10,590
SPEAKER_1:  a deadline for themselves in 2020, 2021, 2022.

02:08:10,882 --> 02:08:14,174
SPEAKER_1:  and uh... only a small subset of those companies have actually

02:08:14,626 --> 02:08:17,214
SPEAKER_1:  really push that forward is Google with Waymo.

02:08:17,794 --> 02:08:22,110
SPEAKER_1:  or alphabet rather, and then there's...

02:08:22,882 --> 02:08:27,294
SPEAKER_1:  Tesla with semi-autonomous driving in their autopilot full-cell driving mode.

02:08:28,514 --> 02:08:30,334
SPEAKER_1:  and those are different approaches.

02:08:30,882 --> 02:08:33,438
SPEAKER_1:  So Tesla is achieving much, much higher scale.

02:08:33,922 --> 02:08:35,294
SPEAKER_1:  but sort of...

02:08:35,554 --> 02:08:37,566
SPEAKER_1:  the quality of the dry is semi-autonomous.

02:08:37,986 --> 02:08:46,238
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if there's a metaphor and analogy here. And then there's Waymo that's focusing on very specific cities but achieving real.

02:08:46,530 --> 02:08:49,950
SPEAKER_1:  full autonomy with actual passengers, but the scales are much smaller.

02:08:50,338 --> 02:08:50,942
SPEAKER_1:  So I wonder.

02:08:51,330 --> 02:08:54,590
SPEAKER_1:  Like, just like you said, there'll be these kinds of similar kind of really

02:08:55,394 --> 02:08:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  pushes.

02:08:56,418 --> 02:09:03,486
SPEAKER_0:  Absolutely. So actually this is what I, it's why I'm encouraged about fusion. So fusion's still hard. Let's let everyone be clear.

02:09:03,714 --> 02:09:08,830
SPEAKER_0:  because of the science underneath it of achieving the right conditions for the plasma.

02:09:09,154 --> 02:09:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  basically is a yardstick that you have to put up against all of them.

02:09:13,666 --> 02:09:17,886
SPEAKER_0:  What's encouraging that I see in this, and it's actually what happens when you sort of

02:09:18,306 --> 02:09:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  let loose the creativity of this is.

02:09:21,666 --> 02:09:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  maybe I'll go back to first principles. So fusion is also a fairly strange.

02:09:27,170 --> 02:09:33,630
SPEAKER_0:  So if you think about building a coal plant, like burning wood and coal and gas is actually not that much different from each other.

02:09:34,050 --> 02:09:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  because they're kind of about the same physical conditions and you get the fuel and you light it.

02:09:38,914 --> 02:09:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  Fusion is very, remember I told you that there's this condition of the temperature which is kind of universal.

02:09:44,930 --> 02:09:51,710
SPEAKER_0:  If you take the density of the fuel between magnetic fusion and inertial fusion, they're different by about a factor of 10 billion.

02:09:52,994 --> 02:09:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  So this.

02:09:53,890 --> 02:10:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  and the density of fuel really matters. And actually so does the, this means energy confinement time is also different by a factor of 10 billion as well too.

02:10:00,770 --> 02:10:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  because it's the product of those two. So one's really dense and short, not lived.

02:10:04,994 --> 02:10:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  And the other one's really long lived and actually under dense as well too.

02:10:09,634 --> 02:10:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  So what that means is that the way to the...

02:10:14,178 --> 02:10:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  The way to get the underlying physical state is so different among these different approaches.

02:10:19,778 --> 02:10:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  What it lends itself to is...

02:10:22,114 --> 02:10:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  Does this mean that eventual commercial products

02:10:25,474 --> 02:10:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  will actually fill different needs in the energy system. Sort of goes to your comment about

02:10:32,738 --> 02:10:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  have to suspect this because anything that is high-tech.

02:10:36,962 --> 02:10:39,678
SPEAKER_0:  and it's like a really important thing in our economy.

02:10:40,034 --> 02:10:46,334
SPEAKER_0:  tends to never find its way as only one manifestation. Like, look at transportation as well too.

02:10:46,626 --> 02:10:47,966
SPEAKER_0:  We have scooters.

02:10:48,674 --> 02:10:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  Vespas.

02:10:49,986 --> 02:10:52,254
SPEAKER_0:  you know, overland trucks.

02:10:52,482 --> 02:10:56,254
SPEAKER_0:  electric cars, of course we have these because they meet different demands.

02:10:56,962 --> 02:11:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  So what's interesting that I find fascinating now is that we have infusion is going to look like that.

02:11:03,042 --> 02:11:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  that probably there's

02:11:04,674 --> 02:11:12,606
SPEAKER_0:  While the near term focuses on electricity production, there might even be different kinds of markets that actually make sense in some places.

02:11:12,994 --> 02:11:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  less in others, it comes to trade-offs.

02:11:15,714 --> 02:11:19,230
SPEAKER_0:  Cause we haven't really talked about the engineering yet, but engineering really matters.

02:11:19,458 --> 02:11:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  like to the operation of the device.

02:11:22,338 --> 02:11:23,326
SPEAKER_0:  And so it could be.

02:11:23,714 --> 02:11:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  Um, that, that, you know, I suspect what we'll end up with is several different configurations, which have different features, which are trade-offs basically in the, in the energy market.

02:11:33,474 --> 02:11:35,230
SPEAKER_1:  What do you see as the major engineering?

02:11:36,162 --> 02:11:37,470
SPEAKER_1:  or general hurdles.

02:11:37,762 --> 02:11:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  that are in the way.

02:11:40,258 --> 02:11:45,534
SPEAKER_0:  So the first one is just the cost of building a single unit.

02:11:46,338 --> 02:11:51,806
SPEAKER_0:  So Fusion has, and it was actually interesting you talked about the different models that you have. So Fusion.

02:11:52,226 --> 02:11:53,246
SPEAKER_0:  has um

02:11:53,634 --> 02:11:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  One of its interesting limitations is that it's very hard.

02:11:58,050 --> 02:12:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  almost at some point becomes physically impossible to actually make small power units.

02:12:04,290 --> 02:12:14,398
SPEAKER_0:  like a kilowatt, a thousand watts, which is like a personal home, like this is about a thousand watts or your personal use of energy of electricity is about like a thousand watts.

02:12:14,882 --> 02:12:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  This is basically impossible for a single unit to do this.

02:12:20,194 --> 02:12:20,702
SPEAKER_0:  um...

02:12:21,026 --> 02:12:26,814
SPEAKER_0:  So like you're not going to have a fusion power plant like as your furnace or your electric heater in your home.

02:12:27,330 --> 02:12:42,110
SPEAKER_0:  And the reason for this comes from the fact that fusion relies on it being, it's not just that it's very hot, it says that the fusion power is the heating source to keep it hot. So if you, if you, if you go too small, it basically just cannot keep it hot. leap.

02:12:42,914 --> 02:12:48,222
SPEAKER_0:  So it's interesting is that this is one of the hard parts. So this means that the individual units

02:12:48,738 --> 02:12:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  It varies from concept to concept, but the National Academy's report that came out last year.

02:12:55,618 --> 02:12:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  sort of put the benchmark as being.

02:12:58,306 --> 02:13:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  Like probably the minimum size looks like around 50 million watts of electricity, which is like enough for like a small to-

02:13:06,210 --> 02:13:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

02:13:07,234 --> 02:13:08,862
SPEAKER_0:  Mid-sized city actually.

02:13:09,346 --> 02:13:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:13:09,954 --> 02:13:15,230
SPEAKER_0:  So that's sort of like a scale challenge. And in fact, it's one of the reasons why.

02:13:15,810 --> 02:13:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  in commonwealth and other private sector ones like

02:13:19,138 --> 02:13:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  They try to push this down actually of trying to get to these smaller units.

02:13:23,874 --> 02:13:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  just because it reduces the cost of it.

02:13:26,818 --> 02:13:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  then probably, obviously, I would say it's an obvious one like achieving the fusion state itself and high gain is

02:13:35,330 --> 02:13:45,022
SPEAKER_0:  is a hard one, what we already talked about. What kind of hurdle, what kind of challenges? Well, that's achieving the right temperature, density and energy confinement time in the fuel itself in the plasma itself.

02:13:45,506 --> 02:13:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  And so some of the...

02:13:47,746 --> 02:13:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  The configurations which are being chosen have

02:13:50,530 --> 02:13:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  are actually quite a ways to go in fact of seeing those. But.

02:13:55,362 --> 02:13:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  what their their consideration is all yes but

02:13:58,242 --> 02:14:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  By our particular configuration, the engineering simplicity confers like an economic advantage, even if we're behind in a, in sort of a science sense. Okay,

02:14:06,818 --> 02:14:07,646
SPEAKER_0:  Which is fine, that's the-

02:14:07,874 --> 02:14:09,374
SPEAKER_0:  This is also what you get when you get a.

02:14:09,762 --> 02:14:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  an explosion in the private sector, you basically are distributing risks in different ways, right?

02:14:16,066 --> 02:14:16,510
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:14:16,738 --> 02:14:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  All of that good.

02:14:18,050 --> 02:14:24,478
SPEAKER_0:  So what I would say is that the next hurdle to really overcome is about making electricity.

02:14:25,026 --> 02:14:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  So like we need to see.

02:14:27,010 --> 02:14:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  a unit or several units, like put using fusion in some way to put a meaningful amount of energy on the grid.

02:14:33,666 --> 02:14:35,742
SPEAKER_0:  because this starts giving us real...

02:14:36,034 --> 02:14:36,830
SPEAKER_0:  answers.

02:14:37,442 --> 02:14:45,054
SPEAKER_0:  Um, as to like what this is going to look like. The full end to end. The full end to end thing. So Commonwealth goal is that I'll

02:14:45,282 --> 02:14:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  I'll just comment to Commonwealth because I'll take some credit for this.

02:14:49,954 --> 02:14:50,462
SPEAKER_0:  is that.

02:14:50,978 --> 02:14:55,134
SPEAKER_0:  the origins of commonwealth were in fact in examining that.

02:14:55,490 --> 02:14:59,774
SPEAKER_0:  Like we could see this new technology coming forward, this new superconducting material

02:15:00,226 --> 02:15:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  And the origins of our thought process were really around designing, effectively, the pilot plant or the commercial unit. It's called ARC.

02:15:07,810 --> 02:15:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  which is actually the step forward after spark.

02:15:10,818 --> 02:15:16,222
SPEAKER_0:  And that was the origins of it. So all the things that were other parts of the plan, like spark and the magnet.

02:15:16,610 --> 02:15:17,246
SPEAKER_0:  We're actually.

02:15:17,730 --> 02:15:22,302
SPEAKER_0:  all informed totally by building something that's going to put net electricity on the grid.

02:15:22,786 --> 02:15:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  And the timing of that we still hope is actually the early 2030s.

02:15:26,050 --> 02:15:30,175
SPEAKER_1:  So Spark is the design of the Takamak and Arc is the actual full intent.

02:15:30,175 --> 02:15:36,734
SPEAKER_0:  is like a thing that actually puts the energy on the grid. So Spark is named intentionally, that it's like it's on for short.

02:15:37,090 --> 02:15:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  period of time.

02:15:38,338 --> 02:15:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  and it doesn't have a...

02:15:39,522 --> 02:15:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  It has, yeah, it's the spark of the fusion revolution or something like that, I guess we could call it.

02:15:46,946 --> 02:15:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, so those are sort of the programmatic challenges of doing that.

02:15:53,602 --> 02:15:57,214
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it's interesting, you asked about, you talked about SpaceX. So what is-

02:15:57,570 --> 02:16:02,686
SPEAKER_0:  evolved even in the last year or so was in fact in March of 2022.

02:16:02,978 --> 02:16:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  The White House announced that it was going to start a program.

02:16:06,306 --> 02:16:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  that kind of looks like a SpaceX analogy that namely, wow.

02:16:10,530 --> 02:16:16,222
SPEAKER_0:  We've got these things in the private sector. We should leverage the private sector and the advantages of what they obtain.

02:16:16,514 --> 02:16:21,694
SPEAKER_0:  but also with the things like this is going to be hard and it's going to take quite a bit of financing.

02:16:22,082 --> 02:16:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  So why don't we set up a program.

02:16:24,418 --> 02:16:30,654
SPEAKER_0:  where we don't really get in the way of the private sector fusion companies, but we help them finance these difficult things, which is how SpaceX.

02:16:30,946 --> 02:16:33,950
SPEAKER_0:  basically became successful through the COTS program. Fantastic.

02:16:34,466 --> 02:16:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  Right. And that's evolving as well too. so

02:16:37,026 --> 02:16:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  Like the fusion ecosystem is almost unrecognizable from where it was like five years ago.

02:16:41,858 --> 02:16:42,686
SPEAKER_0:  around those things.

02:16:42,946 --> 02:16:44,071
SPEAKER_0:  How important is it for...

02:16:44,071 --> 02:16:49,886
SPEAKER_1:  the heads of the companies that are working on nuclear fusion to have a twitter account

02:16:50,530 --> 02:16:53,155
SPEAKER_1:  and to be quite, you said you don't use Twitter. Paste the link to our characters!

02:16:53,155 --> 02:16:53,905
SPEAKER_0:  Thank you very much.

02:16:53,905 --> 02:16:54,526
SPEAKER_1:  Ha ha ha!

02:16:54,818 --> 02:16:59,934
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, there is some element to, and I don't think this should be discounted, whatever you think about.

02:17:00,354 --> 02:17:05,246
SPEAKER_1:  Figures like Jeff Bezos with Blue Origin or Elon Musk with SpaceX.

02:17:05,890 --> 02:17:06,622
SPEAKER_1:  There is...

02:17:07,586 --> 02:17:09,054
SPEAKER_1:  a science communication.

02:17:09,474 --> 02:17:11,934
SPEAKER_1:  to put it in nice terms.

02:17:12,290 --> 02:17:13,950
SPEAKER_1:  That's kind of required to really...

02:17:14,402 --> 02:17:21,694
SPEAKER_1:  educate the public and get everybody excited and sell the sexiness of it. I mean, just even the videos of SpaceX, just being able to kind of.

02:17:21,986 --> 02:17:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  get everybody excited about going out to space once again. I mean, there's all kinds of different ways of doing that, but.

02:17:27,650 --> 02:17:31,775
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I guess what the companies do well, you know, is to advertise themselves.

02:17:31,775 --> 02:17:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  that really sell themselves. It is, yeah. Well, actually it is, like I feel like one of the reasons on this podcast.

02:17:38,658 --> 02:17:41,662
SPEAKER_0:  Like I don't have an official role in the company.

02:17:42,018 --> 02:17:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  And one of the reasons for this was...

02:17:44,994 --> 02:17:46,110
SPEAKER_0:  Also that-

02:17:46,338 --> 02:17:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  It's interesting because when you come from like you're running a company, it makes sense that they're promoting their own product and their own vision which totally makes sense.

02:17:54,978 --> 02:17:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  But there's also a very important role for academics.

02:17:58,722 --> 02:18:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  who have knowledge about what's going on, but are.

02:18:01,826 --> 02:18:08,702
SPEAKER_0:  sufficiently distant from it that they're not fully only self motivated just by their own projects or so forth.

02:18:09,186 --> 02:18:10,494
SPEAKER_0:  And for me this is...

02:18:11,362 --> 02:18:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, we see particularly the problems of the distrust in technology.

02:18:16,642 --> 02:18:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and then honestly in the scientific community.

02:18:19,906 --> 02:18:20,702
SPEAKER_0:  as well too.

02:18:21,058 --> 02:18:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  It will be...

02:18:22,402 --> 02:18:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  that one of the greatest tragedies, I would say.

02:18:25,122 --> 02:18:29,758
SPEAKER_0:  that if we go through all of this and almost pull off what looks like a miracle, like

02:18:30,018 --> 02:18:33,470
SPEAKER_0:  technologic and scientific wise, which is to make a fusion power plant.

02:18:33,890 --> 02:18:35,966
SPEAKER_0:  and then nobody wants to use it.

02:18:36,386 --> 02:18:41,054
SPEAKER_0:  because they feel that they don't trust the people who are doing it or the technology.

02:18:41,538 --> 02:18:44,286
SPEAKER_0:  So we have to get so far out ahead of this. Just like-

02:18:44,738 --> 02:18:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  So I give lots of public lectures or things like this.

02:18:48,834 --> 02:18:51,454
SPEAKER_0:  of accessing a larger range of people.

02:18:51,682 --> 02:18:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  We're not trying to hide anything. You can come and see, you know, come do tours of our laboratory.

02:18:57,090 --> 02:18:59,966
SPEAKER_0:  In fact, I want to set those up virtually as well too. You might look at our

02:19:00,322 --> 02:19:07,102
SPEAKER_0:  plasmasized infusion center YouTube channel. So we are reaching out through those media and it's really important that we do those things.

02:19:07,490 --> 02:19:12,766
SPEAKER_0:  but also then setting up the realistic expectations of what we need to do.

02:19:13,186 --> 02:19:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

02:19:13,922 --> 02:19:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  We're not there. Like we don't have commercial fusion devices yet. You asked like, what are the challenges?

02:19:19,874 --> 02:19:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not going to get into any deep technical questions of what the challenges are.

02:19:24,642 --> 02:19:25,534
SPEAKER_0:  But it is.

02:19:26,018 --> 02:19:26,526
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

02:19:26,818 --> 02:19:29,054
SPEAKER_0:  the pathway, not just to make.

02:19:29,730 --> 02:19:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  work technically, but to make it economically competitive and viable so that it's actually used out in the private sector is a non-trivial task.

02:19:38,914 --> 02:19:39,934
SPEAKER_0:  And it's because...

02:19:40,162 --> 02:19:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  of the newness of it. Like we're simultaneously trying to evolve the technology and make it economically viable at the same time.

02:19:49,186 --> 02:19:50,750
SPEAKER_0:  Those are two

02:19:50,978 --> 02:19:52,478
SPEAKER_0:  difficult coupled tasks.

02:19:52,962 --> 02:19:57,278
SPEAKER_0:  So my own research and my own drive right now.

02:19:57,666 --> 02:20:00,254
SPEAKER_0:  is that fantastic commonwealth fusion systems is set up.

02:20:00,546 --> 02:20:06,558
SPEAKER_0:  We have a commercialization unit of that particular kind, which is gonna drive forward a token back. In fact, I was just...

02:20:07,106 --> 02:20:14,078
SPEAKER_0:  There's discussions, there's dialogues going on around the world with other kinds of ones like stellarators and which prefer different kinds of...

02:20:14,466 --> 02:20:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  challenges and economic advantages.

02:20:16,706 --> 02:20:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  But what we have to, I know what we have to have, what we have to have.

02:20:20,674 --> 02:20:22,590
SPEAKER_0:  is a new generation.

02:20:22,946 --> 02:20:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  of integrated scientists, technologists and engineers that understand what needs to get done to get all the way to the goal line.

02:20:31,202 --> 02:20:32,327
SPEAKER_0:  because we don't have them.

02:20:32,327 --> 02:20:36,478
SPEAKER_1:  like a multidisciplinary. Yeah, exactly. What's required? I mean, you've spoken about.

02:20:36,962 --> 02:20:39,870
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, you said that fusion is quote.

02:20:40,162 --> 02:20:40,990
SPEAKER_1:  the most.

02:20:41,538 --> 02:20:44,830
SPEAKER_1:  multidisciplinary field you can imagine. Yes. Yeah.

02:20:45,090 --> 02:20:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  Why is that? What are the differences? Yeah, well, because most of our discussion that we've had so far is really like a physics discussion really, so don't...

02:20:54,402 --> 02:20:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  neglect physics is at the origin of this.

02:20:57,090 --> 02:21:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  But already we touched on plasma physics and nuclear physics, which are.

02:21:01,634 --> 02:21:03,102
SPEAKER_0:  basically to, you know.

02:21:03,426 --> 02:21:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  somewhat overlap but independent disciplines.

02:21:06,114 --> 02:21:07,742
SPEAKER_0:  then when it comes to the engineering.

02:21:08,258 --> 02:21:13,630
SPEAKER_0:  It's almost everything. So, so why is this? Well, let's build, let's build an electromagnet together. Okay.

02:21:14,114 --> 02:21:16,126
SPEAKER_0:  What is this going to take? It's going to take, um...

02:21:16,706 --> 02:21:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  basically electrical engineering, computer so you understand how it goes together, what happens.

02:21:23,010 --> 02:21:25,278
SPEAKER_0:  computational engineering to model this.

02:21:25,506 --> 02:21:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  very complex integrated thing, materials engineering.

02:21:28,930 --> 02:21:39,166
SPEAKER_0:  because you're pushing materials to their limit with respect to stress and so forth. Takes cryogenic engineering, which is sort of a sub-discipline, but cooling things to extremely low temperatures.

02:21:39,522 --> 02:21:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  probably some kind of chemistry thing in there too. Well, actually, yeah, which tends to show up in the materials. And that's just one of the sub components of it.

02:21:47,202 --> 02:21:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  almost everything gets hit in this right so you're and you're also in a very integrated environment because in the end all these things

02:21:54,882 --> 02:22:01,790
SPEAKER_0:  while you isolate them from each other in a physics sense, in an engineering sense, they all have to work seamlessly together.

02:22:02,274 --> 02:22:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  So it's one of those, I mean.

02:22:05,058 --> 02:22:08,062
SPEAKER_0:  In my own career I've basically done atomic physics.

02:22:08,546 --> 02:22:11,326
SPEAKER_0:  spectroscopy, you know, plasma physics.

02:22:11,810 --> 02:22:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  Um

02:22:12,770 --> 02:22:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  iron etching.

02:22:15,554 --> 02:22:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  So this includes material science, something called MHD, maybe even magneto hydrodynamics.

02:22:23,522 --> 02:22:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  And now all the way through it like.

02:22:25,346 --> 02:22:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not even sure how many different careers I've had. It's also, by the way, this is also an M.

02:22:30,434 --> 02:22:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  a recruiting stage for like young scientists thinking to come in. Like my comment to sign is if you're bored in fusion, you're not paying attention because there's always something interesting to go.

02:22:40,674 --> 02:22:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  and do.

02:22:41,730 --> 02:22:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  So that's a really important part of what we're doing, which isn't new in Fusion actually, in fact is in the roots of...

02:22:49,506 --> 02:22:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  of what we've done at MIT. But holy cow, like the proximity.

02:22:53,794 --> 02:22:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  of possibility of commercial fusion is the new thing.

02:22:57,602 --> 02:22:59,198
SPEAKER_0:  You know, so my catchphrases.

02:22:59,554 --> 02:23:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  Like, you may wonder, like, why weren't we doing all these things? Like, why weren't we pushing towards economic fusion and new materials and new...

02:23:06,562 --> 02:23:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  methods of heat extraction and so forth.

02:23:08,674 --> 02:23:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  because everybody knew Fusion was 40 years away.

02:23:12,034 --> 02:23:13,374
SPEAKER_0:  And now it's four years away.

02:23:13,858 --> 02:23:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  You

02:23:14,466 --> 02:23:19,326
SPEAKER_1:  There is a history, like you said, 40, 30, whatever, the kind of old joke.

02:23:20,162 --> 02:23:21,790
SPEAKER_1:  There's a history of Fusion projects.

02:23:22,594 --> 02:23:23,326
SPEAKER_1:  that...

02:23:23,586 --> 02:23:26,782
SPEAKER_1:  you know, are characterized by cost overruns and delays. Yeah.

02:23:27,138 --> 02:23:27,646
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:23:27,938 --> 02:23:30,398
SPEAKER_1:  How do you avoid this? How do you minimize the chance of this?

02:23:30,498 --> 02:23:32,094
SPEAKER_0:  You have to build great teams.

02:23:32,386 --> 02:23:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  um, uh, is one of them.

02:23:34,690 --> 02:23:37,054
SPEAKER_0:  It tends to be that the smaller the

02:23:37,282 --> 02:23:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  There's sort of an, I'm not an expert in this, but I've seen this enough integrated engineering. Is there an equation? Yeah, well, there's almost, I've seen this from enough teams. Like I've seen also the futility of lone geniuses trying to solve everything by themselves. Yeah.

02:23:51,522 --> 02:23:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  but also organizations that have 10,000 people in them is just not, doesn't lend itself at all to innovation. So.

02:23:58,210 --> 02:24:04,094
SPEAKER_0:  Like one of our original sponsors and a good friend, Vinod Khosla, I don't know if you've ever talked to Vinod Khosla, he's a venture buyer-

02:24:04,386 --> 02:24:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  He's got.

02:24:05,282 --> 02:24:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  fantastic ideas about the right sizes of teams and.

02:24:08,770 --> 02:24:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  things that really innovate, right?

02:24:11,138 --> 02:24:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  And there is an optimum place in there is that you get enough.

02:24:14,146 --> 02:24:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  cross-discipline and ideas, but it doesn't become so overly bureaucratic that you can't execute on it.

02:24:19,490 --> 02:24:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:24:20,514 --> 02:24:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  So one of the ways, and this was one of the challenges of fusion, is that everything was leading towards something special.

02:24:25,922 --> 02:24:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  Like I have to have like, it's enormously large, like teams just to execute because of the scale of the project.

02:24:33,026 --> 02:24:34,270
SPEAKER_0:  The fact that now.

02:24:34,722 --> 02:24:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  through both technology and the argue financing innovation, we're driving to the point where it's smaller focused teams about doing those things. So that's one way to make it faster.

02:24:46,658 --> 02:24:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  The other way to make it faster is modularize the problem or parse the problem.

02:24:51,394 --> 02:24:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  So this is the other difficulty in fusion.

02:24:54,210 --> 02:25:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  is that you tend to look at this as like, oh, it's really just about making the plasma into this state here that you get this energy gain.

02:25:02,306 --> 02:25:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  No.

02:25:03,266 --> 02:25:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  because in the end, if you can...

02:25:05,378 --> 02:25:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  out the different problems of making that and then make it as separate as possible from extracting the energy and then converting it into electricity. The more separate those are, the better they are because you get parallel paths that basically mitigate risk.

02:25:17,954 --> 02:25:20,702
SPEAKER_0:  This is not new in Fusion by the way, this is the way that we attack.

02:25:20,962 --> 02:25:22,942
SPEAKER_0:  most complex technological.

02:25:23,938 --> 02:25:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  integrated technological challenges.

02:25:26,370 --> 02:25:28,926
SPEAKER_1:  Have you by any chance seen

02:25:29,154 --> 02:25:32,894
SPEAKER_1:  some of the application of artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning, a deep mind.

02:25:33,602 --> 02:25:36,446
SPEAKER_1:  has a nice paper, has a nice effort.

02:25:36,834 --> 02:25:37,214
SPEAKER_1:  on.

02:25:37,602 --> 02:25:44,606
SPEAKER_1:  basically using reinforcement learning for a learned control algorithm for controlling nuclear fusion. Do you find those kinds of...

02:25:45,058 --> 02:25:47,742
SPEAKER_1:  I guess you throw them under the umbrella of computational modeling.

02:25:48,066 --> 02:25:50,238
SPEAKER_1:  Do you find those interesting promising?

02:25:50,466 --> 02:25:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  directions. They're all interesting. So when people, you know.

02:25:53,730 --> 02:26:05,982
SPEAKER_0:  I'll pull back. Maybe a natural question is like, why is it different in fusion? Like, there's a long history diffusion, right? It was going on for, like I told you, like stories from the late 1960s. Like what's different now, right?

02:26:06,594 --> 02:26:07,614
SPEAKER_0:  So I think.

02:26:07,938 --> 02:26:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  From the technology point of view, there's two massive things which are different. So one of them, I'll be parochial, it's the advent of this new superconducting materials because

02:26:17,346 --> 02:26:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  the most mature ways that we understand about how we're going to get to fusion power plants or magnetic fusion. And by the fact that you've got access.

02:26:24,738 --> 02:26:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  to something which like changes the...

02:26:27,042 --> 02:26:31,006
SPEAKER_0:  economic equation by an over an order magnitude is just a totally.

02:26:31,394 --> 02:26:32,062
SPEAKER_0:  You know, and that.

02:26:32,322 --> 02:26:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  That wasn't that long ago, it was only September of 2021 that we actually demonstrated the technology. That changes the prospects there.

02:26:39,522 --> 02:26:40,894
SPEAKER_0:  and the other one is computing.

02:26:41,378 --> 02:26:45,054
SPEAKER_0:  and it's across the whole spectrum. It's not just in control.

02:26:45,314 --> 02:26:55,166
SPEAKER_0:  of the fusion device, it's actually in the, we actually use machine learning and things like this in the design of the magnet itself. It's an incredibly complex design space. So you use those tools.

02:26:55,490 --> 02:26:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  the simulation of the plasma itself is actually...

02:26:59,106 --> 02:27:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  we're at a totally different place than we were.

02:27:01,858 --> 02:27:11,006
SPEAKER_0:  So those are the two big drivers that I see actually that make it different. And it's interesting, both those things.

02:27:11,522 --> 02:27:17,854
SPEAKER_0:  self-enforce about what you asked about before, like how do you avoid delays and things? Well, it's by having smaller teams.

02:27:18,338 --> 02:27:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  that can actually execute on those.

02:27:20,226 --> 02:27:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  But now you can do this because.

02:27:22,850 --> 02:27:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  the new magnets make the devices all smaller.

02:27:25,986 --> 02:27:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  And computing means your human effectiveness about exploring.

02:27:30,498 --> 02:27:32,190
SPEAKER_0:  the optimization space is way better.

02:27:32,418 --> 02:27:34,293
SPEAKER_0:  like they're all interlinked to each other.

02:27:34,293 --> 02:27:39,543
SPEAKER_1:  cluster modularization, like you said, and everything just kind of works together to make smaller teams more effective.

02:27:39,543 --> 02:27:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  move faster. And it's actually, and it's through that learned experience. I mean.

02:27:43,586 --> 02:27:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  You know, of the things that I'm the most proud of about what came out. In fact...

02:27:47,490 --> 02:27:52,926
SPEAKER_0:  the origins of thinking about how we would use the high temperature superconducting magnets.

02:27:53,314 --> 02:27:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  came out of my design class.

02:27:55,394 --> 02:27:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  at MIT.

02:27:56,674 --> 02:28:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  And in the design class, like one of the features that I kept, I mean, it was interesting. I actually learned, I really learned along with the students about this, but like this insistence on the features, like...

02:28:06,338 --> 02:28:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  We can't have so many

02:28:08,194 --> 02:28:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  coupled integrated hard technology developments. We have to separate these somehow.

02:28:12,994 --> 02:28:24,286
SPEAKER_0:  So we worked and worked and worked at this. And in fact, that's what really, in my opinion, the greatest advantage of the arc design and built into the Commonwealth Fusion System idea.

02:28:24,514 --> 02:28:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  is like to parse out the problems. Like how can we attack these in parallel?

02:28:28,834 --> 02:28:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:28:29,634 --> 02:28:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, and so...

02:28:31,042 --> 02:28:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  It really comes to, we talked about philosophy. It's like a design philosophy, like how do you attack these kinds of problems?

02:28:37,698 --> 02:28:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  And you do it like that.

02:28:39,394 --> 02:28:42,430
SPEAKER_1:  And also like you mentioned offline that there's a power to.

02:28:43,522 --> 02:28:45,182
SPEAKER_1:  You know, as part of a class.

02:28:46,242 --> 02:28:48,798
SPEAKER_1:  to design a nuclear fusion.

02:28:49,058 --> 02:29:01,502
SPEAKER_0:  uh... well it's a big uh... well then it is reality and it's it's hard to imagine a more powerful force than like fifteen m i t p h t students like working together towards solving a problem

02:29:02,050 --> 02:29:02,878
SPEAKER_0:  And what I always-

02:29:03,202 --> 02:29:04,574
SPEAKER_0:  In fact, we just...

02:29:04,834 --> 02:29:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  We recently just taught the most recent, I say I teach it, I mean I guide it actually.

02:29:10,946 --> 02:29:17,118
SPEAKER_0:  the most recent version of this where they actually designed, you know, based on this National Academies report they actually designed.

02:29:17,378 --> 02:29:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  Like a pilot plant.

02:29:18,914 --> 02:29:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  that has basis and similarities to what we had done before.

02:29:22,402 --> 02:29:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I kept wanting to push the envelope and where they are.

02:29:25,858 --> 02:29:27,486
SPEAKER_0:  the creativity and the...

02:29:27,874 --> 02:29:29,854
SPEAKER_0:  uh... and uh... the energy

02:29:30,146 --> 02:29:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  that they bring to these things is kind of like, it keeps me going, like, I'm not gonna retire anytime soon, when I keep seeing that kind of dedication and it's wonderful.

02:29:39,362 --> 02:29:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  around on that. Um, it almost not to overuse a, um,

02:29:43,586 --> 02:29:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  uh, uh, or to paraphrase something right, which is

02:29:47,266 --> 02:29:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  that the famous quote by Margaret Mead.

02:29:51,330 --> 02:29:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  Never doubt that a-

02:29:53,442 --> 02:29:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  small group of dedicated persons will change the world. Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.

02:29:59,842 --> 02:30:03,710
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, that's just such a powerful and inspiring thing for an individual.

02:30:04,386 --> 02:30:09,758
SPEAKER_1:  Find the right team, be part of that, and then you, yourself, your passion, your efforts could actually make a big change.

02:30:10,274 --> 02:30:12,510
SPEAKER_1:  big impact. I gotta ask you...

02:30:12,802 --> 02:30:13,278
SPEAKER_1:  So it's.

02:30:14,690 --> 02:30:23,998
SPEAKER_1:  It's a whole nother different conversation I'm sure to have, but nuclear power is the currently stands. So using fission.

02:30:24,354 --> 02:30:26,997
SPEAKER_1:  is extremely safe despite public perception.

02:30:26,997 --> 02:30:29,247
SPEAKER_0:  It is the safest actually.

02:30:29,247 --> 02:30:33,246
SPEAKER_1:  It's a whole nother conversation, but almost like a human bureaucratic.

02:30:34,434 --> 02:30:35,198
SPEAKER_1:  physics.

02:30:35,810 --> 02:30:37,534
SPEAKER_1:  engineering.

02:30:37,794 --> 02:30:38,462
SPEAKER_1:  question of

02:30:38,690 --> 02:30:40,734
SPEAKER_1:  What lessons do you draw from the

02:30:41,090 --> 02:30:42,110
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:30:42,754 --> 02:30:44,926
SPEAKER_1:  catastrophic events where they.

02:30:45,826 --> 02:30:49,951
SPEAKER_1:  the pop plants did fail, so Chernobyl and Three Mile Island. Chernobyl, what lessons did you learn?

02:30:49,951 --> 02:30:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  draw. Three by Lyle wasn't really a disaster because nothing escaped from the thing but Chernobyl and Fukushima had obvious consequences in the populations.

02:31:00,386 --> 02:31:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  live nearby.

02:31:01,314 --> 02:31:05,598
SPEAKER_1:  What lesson do you draw from those that you can carry forward to Fusion?

02:31:05,922 --> 02:31:06,750
SPEAKER_1:  Now I know there's

02:31:06,978 --> 02:31:10,686
SPEAKER_1:  You can say that you're not going to have the same kind of issues, but it's possible that

02:31:11,330 --> 02:31:16,894
SPEAKER_1:  The same folks also said they're not gonna be, have those same kind of issues. We humans, the human factor.

02:31:17,282 --> 02:31:20,254
SPEAKER_1:  We haven't talked about that one quite as much, but it's still there.

02:31:20,450 --> 02:31:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  So to be clear, it's not, so fusion has intrinsic safety with respect to it can't run away. Those are physics bases.

02:31:29,538 --> 02:31:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  Technology and engineering basis of running a complex, again, anything that makes large amounts of power and heats things up is got intrinsic safety in it.

02:31:37,602 --> 02:31:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:31:38,498 --> 02:31:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  by the fact that we actually produce very energetic particles, this doesn't mean that there's no radiation involved in, ionizing radiation.

02:31:46,370 --> 02:31:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  be more accurate.

02:31:47,970 --> 02:31:52,766
SPEAKER_0:  infusion, it's just that it's in a very different order of magnitude basically.

02:31:53,314 --> 02:31:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  So what are the lessons?

02:31:55,266 --> 02:31:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  the infusion.

02:31:57,570 --> 02:31:59,038
SPEAKER_0:  So one of them is.

02:31:59,714 --> 02:32:04,350
SPEAKER_0:  Make sure that you're looking at aspects of the holistic.

02:32:04,642 --> 02:32:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  environmental

02:32:06,050 --> 02:32:09,214
SPEAKER_0:  and societal footprint that the technology will have.

02:32:09,474 --> 02:32:12,894
SPEAKER_0:  As technologists, we tend not to focus on these.

02:32:13,250 --> 02:32:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  and particularly in early stages of development.

02:32:15,842 --> 02:32:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  Like we just want something that works.

02:32:18,754 --> 02:32:22,878
SPEAKER_0:  But if we come with just something that works but doesn't actually satisfy...

02:32:23,170 --> 02:32:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  societal demands for safety.

02:32:25,602 --> 02:32:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  And for, I mean, we will have materials that we have to dispose of out of fusion. Just this is.

02:32:31,042 --> 02:32:34,462
SPEAKER_0:  But there's technological questions about what that looks like.

02:32:34,882 --> 02:32:40,222
SPEAKER_0:  So will this look like something that you have to put in the ground for 100 years or 5 years?

02:32:41,250 --> 02:32:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  And the consequences of those are both economic and societal acceptance and so forth.

02:32:46,338 --> 02:32:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  but don't bury those. Like, put the- bring these up front.

02:32:49,634 --> 02:32:53,150
SPEAKER_0:  talk to people about them and make people realize that you're actually

02:32:53,538 --> 02:33:00,414
SPEAKER_0:  The way I would look at it is that you're making fusion more economically attractive by making it more societally acceptable as well too.

02:33:00,994 --> 02:33:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:33:01,794 --> 02:33:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  And then realize is that, you know, I think there's a few interesting, you know, boundaries basically. So one of them, speaking of boundaries, that successful fusion devices.

02:33:11,650 --> 02:33:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  I'm-

02:33:12,226 --> 02:33:18,782
SPEAKER_0:  pretty sure will require that you don't have to have an evacuation plan for anybody who lives at the site.

02:33:20,226 --> 02:33:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  So this has implications for what we build.

02:33:24,066 --> 02:33:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  from a fusion engineering point of view.

02:33:26,178 --> 02:33:28,734
SPEAKER_0:  but has major implications for where you can site.

02:33:29,090 --> 02:33:30,622
SPEAKER_0:  Fusion devices.

02:33:30,946 --> 02:33:39,614
SPEAKER_0:  So in many ways it becomes more like, well, you know, we have fences around, you know, industrial heat sources and things like this for a reason, right, for personal safety. It looks more like that.

02:33:39,842 --> 02:33:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  It's not quite as simple as that, but that's what it should look like.

02:33:43,138 --> 02:33:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  And in fact, we have research projects going on right now at MIT that are.

02:33:46,850 --> 02:33:50,078
SPEAKER_0:  like trying to push the technologies to make it more look like that.

02:33:50,786 --> 02:33:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  I think that those are key.

02:33:53,058 --> 02:33:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  And then in the end, as I said.

02:33:55,074 --> 02:33:59,198
SPEAKER_0:  So Chernobyl is physically impossible actually in a fusion system.

02:33:59,650 --> 02:34:06,014
SPEAKER_0:  From a physics perspective, you can't run away like it did at Chernobyl, which was basically human error.

02:34:06,338 --> 02:34:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  of letting the reactors run out of control, essentially.

02:34:10,082 --> 02:34:11,207
SPEAKER_0:  Human error can still happen.

02:34:11,207 --> 02:34:12,707
SPEAKER_1:  nuclear fusion.

02:34:12,707 --> 02:34:16,670
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, so, but in that one, if human error occurs, then it just stops.

02:34:16,898 --> 02:34:17,694
SPEAKER_0:  And this is done.

02:34:18,306 --> 02:34:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  and all those things this is the requirement of of us as technologists and developers of this technology.

02:34:24,930 --> 02:34:30,942
SPEAKER_0:  to not ignore that dimension, in fact, of the design. And that's why me personally, I'm actually...

02:34:31,842 --> 02:34:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  pouring myself more and more into that area because this is going to be

02:34:35,746 --> 02:34:40,222
SPEAKER_0:  I actually really think it is an aspect of the economic viability of fusion because

02:34:40,482 --> 02:34:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  It clearly...

02:34:41,474 --> 02:34:49,278
SPEAKER_0:  differentiates ourselves and also sets us up to be about what we want fusion to be. That again on paper fusion can supply all of our energy.

02:34:49,602 --> 02:34:50,366
SPEAKER_0:  Like, all of it.

02:34:51,074 --> 02:34:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  So this means I want it to be like.

02:34:52,834 --> 02:34:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  like really environmentally benign.

02:34:55,362 --> 02:34:58,206
SPEAKER_0:  But this takes engineering ingenuity basically to do that.

02:34:58,946 --> 02:34:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  Let me ask you some.

02:35:00,066 --> 02:35:01,191
SPEAKER_1:  Wild Out there.

02:35:01,191 --> 02:35:01,758
SPEAKER_0:  Sure.

02:35:02,402 --> 02:35:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  We've been talking too much, you know.

02:35:07,778 --> 02:35:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  Simple.

02:35:08,642 --> 02:35:15,518
SPEAKER_1:  uh... practical things in everyday life now only revolutionizing the entire energy infrastructure of human civilization yes

02:35:15,746 --> 02:35:17,086
SPEAKER_1:  But, um...

02:35:17,474 --> 02:35:18,558
SPEAKER_1:  So cold fusion.

02:35:18,914 --> 02:35:21,118
SPEAKER_1:  This idea, this dream.

02:35:21,570 --> 02:35:22,526
SPEAKER_1:  This interesting...

02:35:23,778 --> 02:35:26,462
SPEAKER_1:  physical goals seem to be impossible.

02:35:26,946 --> 02:35:29,918
SPEAKER_1:  But perhaps it's possible. Do you think it is possible? Do you think?

02:35:30,338 --> 02:35:32,414
SPEAKER_1:  down the line so we're in...

02:35:33,442 --> 02:35:36,190
SPEAKER_1:  and the far distance is possible to achieve fusion.

02:35:36,674 --> 02:35:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  at low temperature.

02:35:39,170 --> 02:35:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  It's very, very, very unlikely.

02:35:41,954 --> 02:35:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  and this comes from, so this would.

02:35:45,826 --> 02:35:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  require a pretty fundamental shift in our understanding of.

02:35:50,658 --> 02:35:52,670
SPEAKER_0:  of physics as we know it now.

02:35:53,186 --> 02:35:57,246
SPEAKER_0:  And we know a heck of a lot about how nuclear reactions occur.

02:35:57,762 --> 02:35:58,334
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:35:58,722 --> 02:36:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  By the way, what's interesting is that they actually have a different name for it. They call it leaner, like low energy nuclear reactions.

02:36:05,570 --> 02:36:09,214
SPEAKER_0:  But we do have low energy nuclear reactions. We know these, it's because these come from-

02:36:09,858 --> 02:36:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  particularly the weak force, nuclear force.

02:36:15,298 --> 02:36:15,838
SPEAKER_0:  And

02:36:16,322 --> 02:36:18,654
SPEAKER_0:  So it's at this point.

02:36:19,426 --> 02:36:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  As a scientist you always keep yourself open, but you also demand proof.

02:36:23,874 --> 02:36:24,999
SPEAKER_0:  Right? And that's the thing.

02:36:24,999 --> 02:36:27,902
SPEAKER_1:  It almost requires a breakthrough on the theoretical physics side.

02:36:28,226 --> 02:36:33,470
SPEAKER_1:  So something, some deeper understanding about quantum mechanics of this. So the quantum tunneling, some weird...

02:36:33,634 --> 02:36:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, and people have looked at that, but...

02:36:36,514 --> 02:36:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  even something like quantum tunneling has a limit as to what it can actually do. So there are people.

02:36:41,762 --> 02:36:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  who are genuine, you know, that really want to see it make it, but...

02:36:45,890 --> 02:36:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it sort of goes to the extro... I mean...

02:36:48,354 --> 02:36:52,414
SPEAKER_0:  We know fusion happens at these high energies.

02:36:52,866 --> 02:36:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  when we know this extremely accurately and I can show you a plot.

02:36:56,802 --> 02:37:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  that shows that as you go to lower and lower energy, it basically becomes immeasurable.

02:37:00,738 --> 02:37:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:37:01,474 --> 02:37:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  If you're going down this other pathway, it means there's really a very...

02:37:06,498 --> 02:37:09,982
SPEAKER_0:  different physical mechanism involved.

02:37:10,530 --> 02:37:16,446
SPEAKER_0:  All I would say is that I actually poke in my head once in a while to see what's going on.

02:37:16,962 --> 02:37:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  in that area.

02:37:18,850 --> 02:37:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  and as scientists we should always try to make ourselves open.

02:37:22,082 --> 02:37:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and...

02:37:23,586 --> 02:37:26,110
SPEAKER_0:  But in this one, it's like, but show me...

02:37:26,594 --> 02:37:36,789
SPEAKER_0:  something that I can measure and that is repeatable and then it's going to take more extraordinary effort. And to date this has not met that threshold in my opinion.

02:37:36,789 --> 02:37:37,438
SPEAKER_1:  So I'm.

02:37:37,954 --> 02:37:39,966
SPEAKER_1:  even more so than just mentioning.

02:37:40,642 --> 02:37:45,214
SPEAKER_1:  or in that question, thinking about people that are claiming to have achieved cold fusion.

02:37:45,474 --> 02:37:47,006
SPEAKER_1:  I'm more thinking even about...

02:37:47,938 --> 02:37:52,542
SPEAKER_1:  people who are studying black holes and they're basically trying to understand.

02:37:53,378 --> 02:37:53,982
SPEAKER_1:  function of.

02:37:54,370 --> 02:37:56,062
SPEAKER_1:  you know, theoretical physicists.

02:37:56,418 --> 02:37:58,686
SPEAKER_1:  They're doing the long haul.

02:37:58,978 --> 02:38:03,550
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, we're trying to investigate like, okay, what is happening at the singularity? What is the-

02:38:03,778 --> 02:38:04,702
SPEAKER_1:  This kind of...

02:38:06,114 --> 02:38:09,182
SPEAKER_1:  uh, holographic projections on a plate. this weird

02:38:09,506 --> 02:38:15,131
SPEAKER_1:  freaking things that are out there in the universe and like somehow accidentally they start to figure out something we

02:38:15,131 --> 02:38:20,383
SPEAKER_0:  Weird, yeah. And then all of a sudden- There's weirdness all over the place already, yeah.

02:38:20,383 --> 02:38:26,494
SPEAKER_1:  how that weirdness will, I think on a timescale probably of a hundred years or so, that weirdness will open. gdEo

02:38:26,850 --> 02:38:29,022
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, it just seems like.

02:38:29,282 --> 02:38:36,894
SPEAKER_1:  nuclear fusion and black holes and all of this are too, they're next door neighbors a little bit too much for like you'll find something.

02:38:37,474 --> 02:38:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  interesting let me tell you storybook

02:38:39,426 --> 02:38:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  Yes. It's a real story..

02:38:42,626 --> 02:38:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  So they were really, really clever scientists in the end of the late 1800s.

02:38:49,986 --> 02:38:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  in the world. You talk about like James Clerk Maxwell and you talk about Lord Kelvin.

02:38:54,882 --> 02:38:58,526
SPEAKER_0:  And you talk about Lorentz actually who named after these other ones and

02:38:59,106 --> 02:39:04,958
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, on and on and on and like Faraday and they discovered electromagnetism, holy cow. And it's like.

02:39:05,378 --> 02:39:07,678
SPEAKER_0:  they figure out all these things and

02:39:08,002 --> 02:39:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  Yet there were these weird...

02:39:11,298 --> 02:39:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  things going on that you couldn't quite figure out. It's like, what the heck is going on with this, right?

02:39:17,570 --> 02:39:20,830
SPEAKER_0:  But we teach this all the time in physics classes, right?

02:39:21,378 --> 02:39:23,934
SPEAKER_0:  So what was going on? Well there's just a few.

02:39:24,866 --> 02:39:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  There's just a few kind of things.

02:39:26,786 --> 02:39:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  things unchecked, but basically we're at the end of discovery because we figured out how everything works.

02:39:31,874 --> 02:39:36,254
SPEAKER_0:  because we've got basically Newtonian mechanics and we've got Maxwell's equations.

02:39:36,482 --> 02:39:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  which describe basically how matter gets pushed around and how electromagnetism works. Holy cow, what a feat.

02:39:43,010 --> 02:39:44,926
SPEAKER_0:  But there are these few nagging things.

02:39:46,434 --> 02:39:51,806
SPEAKER_0:  For instance, there's certain kinds of rocks that for some reason, like if you put a photographic plate around it...

02:39:52,194 --> 02:39:54,462
SPEAKER_0:  it like it's burned or it gets an image on it.

02:39:56,002 --> 02:39:57,886
SPEAKER_0:  Well, where's the electromagnetism in that?

02:39:58,274 --> 02:40:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  There's no electromagnetic properties of this rock.

02:40:01,826 --> 02:40:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  Oh yeah, and the other thing too is that if I...

02:40:04,290 --> 02:40:09,342
SPEAKER_0:  if I take this wonderful classical derivation of something that is hot.

02:40:09,602 --> 02:40:11,262
SPEAKER_0:  about how it releases radiation.

02:40:12,674 --> 02:40:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  Everything looks fantastic. Perfect match.

02:40:15,330 --> 02:40:17,854
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, until I get high frequencies.

02:40:19,106 --> 02:40:22,846
SPEAKER_0:  of the light and then it basically just, the whole thing falls apart. In fact,

02:40:23,106 --> 02:40:26,174
SPEAKER_0:  it gives a physical explanation which is total nonsense.

02:40:26,466 --> 02:40:30,974
SPEAKER_0:  It tells you that every object should basically be producing an infinite amount of heat.

02:40:31,842 --> 02:40:32,702
SPEAKER_0:  And by the way...

02:40:33,090 --> 02:40:33,950
SPEAKER_0:  Here's the sun.

02:40:34,274 --> 02:40:35,614
SPEAKER_0:  and we can look at the sun.

02:40:35,970 --> 02:40:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  and we can figure out it's made out of hydrogen. And Lord Kelvin actually made a very famous calculation who was basically one of the founders of thermodynamics.

02:40:44,322 --> 02:40:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  So you look at the hydrogen.

02:40:46,050 --> 02:40:50,142
SPEAKER_0:  Hydrogen has a certain energy content, you know the latent heat basically of hydrogen.

02:40:50,370 --> 02:40:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  We know the mass of the sun because we knew the size of it. And he conclusively proved that basically

02:40:56,034 --> 02:41:00,542
SPEAKER_0:  The sun could only make net energy for about 2 or 3,000 years.

02:41:01,218 --> 02:41:07,102
SPEAKER_0:  So therefore all this nonsense about like deep, because clearly the sun can only last for two or three thousand years.

02:41:07,426 --> 02:41:11,006
SPEAKER_0:  if you think about the chemical and this is basically the chemical energy content of hydrogen.

02:41:11,394 --> 02:41:12,350
SPEAKER_0:  and what comes along.

02:41:12,642 --> 02:41:13,822
SPEAKER_0:  in one decade.

02:41:14,562 --> 02:41:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  basically one guy sitting in a postal office you know in switzerland

02:41:19,042 --> 02:41:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  figures out that all these, you know, Einstein of course, which was like figured out all of this, took these seemingly unconnected things and it's like boom, there it is. This is what it was, it wasn't just him, but it was like there's quantum physics, like this explains this other disaster.

02:41:34,946 --> 02:41:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  And then there's other guy, my hero.

02:41:36,962 --> 02:41:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  Ernest Rutherford, experimentalist.

02:41:39,906 --> 02:41:42,814
SPEAKER_0:  did the most extraordinary experiment, which is like...

02:41:43,490 --> 02:41:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  which was that, okay, they had these funny rocks. They emitted these particles. In fact, they called them alpha particles, alpha just A in the alphabet, right? Because it was the first thing that they discovered.

02:41:52,866 --> 02:41:54,366
SPEAKER_0:  what were they doing? So they were

02:41:54,626 --> 02:42:01,534
SPEAKER_0:  they were taking these alpha particles and I, by the way, I do this to all my students because it's a demonstration of what you should be as a good scientist.

02:42:02,242 --> 02:42:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  So he took these alpha things and he was a classically trained physicist, knew everything about momentum scattering and stuff like that.

02:42:09,058 --> 02:42:09,886
SPEAKER_0:  And he took this.

02:42:10,178 --> 02:42:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  And these alpha...

02:42:11,234 --> 02:42:18,462
SPEAKER_0:  which clearly were some kind of energy, but they couldn't quite figure out what it was. So let's try to figure that, and we'll actually use this to try to probe the nature of matter.

02:42:18,786 --> 02:42:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  So he took this.

02:42:20,226 --> 02:42:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  these alpha particles

02:42:22,114 --> 02:42:24,062
SPEAKER_0:  and a very, very thin gold foil.

02:42:24,482 --> 02:42:27,198
SPEAKER_0:  And so what you wanted to see was that as they were going through...

02:42:27,586 --> 02:42:30,974
SPEAKER_0:  the way that they would scatter based on classical, in fact, the coulomb collision.

02:42:31,394 --> 02:42:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  based on classical mechanics, this will tell me reveal something.

02:42:35,714 --> 02:42:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  about what the nature of the charge distribution is in matter because they didn't know where the hell is this stuff coming from?

02:42:42,050 --> 02:42:43,838
SPEAKER_0:  even though they'd solved that electromagnetism.

02:42:44,066 --> 02:42:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  They didn't know what made up charges.

02:42:46,786 --> 02:42:47,678
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, very interesting.

02:42:48,130 --> 02:42:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  On it through it goes.

02:42:50,050 --> 02:42:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  And so what did you set up? So it turns out in these experiments what you did was

02:42:55,010 --> 02:42:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  because if these al- these so-called alphas

02:42:57,986 --> 02:43:00,254
SPEAKER_0:  which actually now we know something else.

02:43:00,738 --> 02:43:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  As they go through, they would deflect. How much they deflect tells you how strong electric field they saw.

02:43:06,178 --> 02:43:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  So you put detectors, because if you put like a piece of glass in front of this...

02:43:10,498 --> 02:43:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  What will happen is that when the alpha particle hits, it literally gives a little...

02:43:13,730 --> 02:43:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  But a little bit of light like this. It's Syntellies.

02:43:16,674 --> 02:43:17,598
SPEAKER_0:  a little blue flash.

02:43:18,178 --> 02:43:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  So he would train his students or postdocs or whatever the heck they were at the time. You have to train yourself because you have to put yourself in the dark for like hours.

02:43:25,666 --> 02:43:34,398
SPEAKER_0:  get your eyes adjusted and then they would start the experiment and they would sit there and literally count the things. And they could see this pattern developing which was revealing about what was going on.

02:43:35,490 --> 02:43:37,886
SPEAKER_0:  But there was also another part to the experiment, which was that

02:43:39,138 --> 02:43:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  It's like, here's the.

02:43:40,642 --> 02:43:42,206
SPEAKER_0:  alphas. Here's the source.

02:43:42,530 --> 02:43:46,110
SPEAKER_0:  they're going this way, they could tell they were going in one direction only, they're going in this direction.

02:43:47,362 --> 02:43:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  And you put all these over here because you want to see how they deflect and bend through it.

02:43:50,818 --> 02:43:52,510
SPEAKER_0:  but you put a control in the experiment.

02:43:53,090 --> 02:43:54,718
SPEAKER_0:  but you basically put glass.

02:43:55,074 --> 02:43:57,758
SPEAKER_0:  part of glass plates back here.

02:43:58,274 --> 02:43:59,294
SPEAKER_0:  because obviously...

02:43:59,554 --> 02:44:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  Everything should just deflect, but nothing should bounce back.

02:44:02,658 --> 02:44:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  So it's the control of the experiment.

02:44:05,378 --> 02:44:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  But what did they see?

02:44:07,842 --> 02:44:09,822
SPEAKER_0:  They saw things bouncing back.

02:44:11,138 --> 02:44:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  Like what the hell?

02:44:12,866 --> 02:44:16,030
SPEAKER_0:  Like that fit no model of any idea.

02:44:16,866 --> 02:44:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  But Rutherford refused to ignore.

02:44:20,546 --> 02:44:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  What was the clearest, like they validated it.

02:44:23,234 --> 02:44:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  and he sat down and based on classical physics, he made the most extraordinary discovery.

02:44:28,610 --> 02:44:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  which was the nucleus.

02:44:30,562 --> 02:44:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  which is a very, very strange discovery.

02:44:33,474 --> 02:44:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  what I mean by that, because what he could figure out from this is that in order for these particles.

02:44:38,402 --> 02:44:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  to bounce back.

02:44:39,650 --> 02:44:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  and hit this plate.

02:44:40,834 --> 02:44:43,166
SPEAKER_0:  They were hitting something that must be...

02:44:43,522 --> 02:44:44,574
SPEAKER_0:  heavier than them.

02:44:45,218 --> 02:44:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  and that basically something like 99.999% of the mass.

02:44:50,498 --> 02:44:52,446
SPEAKER_0:  of the matter that was in this gold foil.

02:44:52,738 --> 02:44:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  who was in something that contained...

02:44:54,594 --> 02:44:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  about one trillionth of the volume.

02:44:58,626 --> 02:44:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  And that's called the nucleus.

02:45:00,802 --> 02:45:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  And until...

02:45:01,826 --> 02:45:04,350
SPEAKER_0:  And you talk about, so how revealing is this? It's like...

02:45:04,770 --> 02:45:08,798
SPEAKER_0:  This totally changes your idea of the universe because a nucleus.

02:45:09,026 --> 02:45:11,486
SPEAKER_0:  is a very unintuitive, non-intuitive thing.

02:45:11,874 --> 02:45:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  It's like, why is all the mass?

02:45:13,890 --> 02:45:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  in something that is like zero.

02:45:15,874 --> 02:45:18,654
SPEAKER_0:  Like, basically it was the realization that matter is empty.

02:45:19,362 --> 02:45:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  It's all empty space.

02:45:21,090 --> 02:45:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  And that changes everything. And it changes everything.

02:45:24,130 --> 02:45:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  until you had that, like you had steam engines, by the way, you had telegraph wires, you had all those things.

02:45:29,026 --> 02:45:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  But that realization, those two realizations opened up everything.

02:45:34,242 --> 02:45:37,854
SPEAKER_0:  Like lasers, all these things about the modern world of what we use.

02:45:39,042 --> 02:45:44,862
SPEAKER_0:  And that set it up. So all I would point out is that there's a story already that sometimes there's these nagging things.

02:45:45,218 --> 02:45:46,334
SPEAKER_0:  at the edge of science.

02:45:46,690 --> 02:45:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  that we pat ourselves on the back and we think we got everything under control.

02:45:52,386 --> 02:45:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  By the way, that was the origin of also, but.

02:45:54,914 --> 02:45:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  that it, think about this, that was 1908. It took like another.

02:45:59,106 --> 02:46:00,606
SPEAKER_0:  20 some years.

02:46:00,866 --> 02:46:04,190
SPEAKER_0:  before people put that together with, that's the process that's

02:46:04,418 --> 02:46:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  hiring stars.

02:46:06,722 --> 02:46:13,790
SPEAKER_0:  is the rearrangement of those nuclei, not atoms. That's why Kelvin wasn't wrong, he just was working with the wrong assumptions, right?

02:46:14,370 --> 02:46:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  So fast forward to today, like what would this mean, right? Well, there's a couple of things like this that sit out there in physics.

02:46:20,610 --> 02:46:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  and I'll point out one of them, which is very interesting. We don't know what the hell makes up 90% of the mass in the universe.

02:46:27,234 --> 02:46:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  So, you know, the search for dark matter, right? What is it?

02:46:30,402 --> 02:46:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  We still haven't discovered it. 90% of the mass.

02:46:34,242 --> 02:46:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  of the universe is undetectable.

02:46:37,154 --> 02:46:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  Like what?

02:46:38,274 --> 02:46:43,149
SPEAKER_1:  And then, you know, and dark energy and the again black holes are the window into this.

02:46:43,149 --> 02:46:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, sometimes black holes are way better understood than those things as well too.

02:46:49,154 --> 02:46:53,950
SPEAKER_0:  So all it tells us is that we shouldn't have hubris about the ideas that we understand everything.

02:46:54,402 --> 02:46:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  And when we, you know, who knows what the next...

02:46:57,346 --> 02:47:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  major intellectual insight will be about how the universe functions.

02:47:02,274 --> 02:47:03,399
SPEAKER_0:  And actually.

02:47:03,399 --> 02:47:09,374
SPEAKER_1:  I think Rutherford is the one who's attributed at least that quote that physics is the only

02:47:09,666 --> 02:47:11,870
SPEAKER_1:  Real science, everything else is stamp collecting.

02:47:12,290 --> 02:47:12,830
SPEAKER_1:  Alright, so...

02:47:13,090 --> 02:47:17,246
SPEAKER_0:  I'm sorry, he's my hero, but I'll slightly disagree with that. Yes.

02:47:17,570 --> 02:47:17,886
SPEAKER_0:  lol

02:47:18,786 --> 02:47:35,710
SPEAKER_1:  No offense to stamp collecting, that's very important too. But you have to have humility about the kind of disciplines that make progress at every stage in science. Physics did make a huge amount of progress in the 20th century, but it's possible that other disciplines start to step in.

02:47:35,810 --> 02:47:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, but Rutherford couldn't imagine, like, mapping the human genome because we didn't even know about DNA.

02:47:41,314 --> 02:47:43,189
SPEAKER_0:  Or computers, really. Or computers, really.

02:47:43,189 --> 02:47:44,689
SPEAKER_1:  probably didn't think deep about.

02:47:44,689 --> 02:47:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  No, it's just like, is it?

02:47:46,370 --> 02:47:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  Here's a wild one, what if like the next great...

02:47:49,954 --> 02:47:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  revelation to humanity about the universe is not done by the human mind.

02:47:54,658 --> 02:48:02,750
SPEAKER_1:  that seems increasingly more likely. And then you start to ask deep questions about what is the purpose of science. For example,

02:48:03,554 --> 02:48:03,966
SPEAKER_1:  if

02:48:04,514 --> 02:48:05,118
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:48:05,634 --> 02:48:07,486
SPEAKER_1:  AI system will design.

02:48:07,842 --> 02:48:09,502
SPEAKER_1:  a nuclear fusion reactor.

02:48:09,826 --> 02:48:12,574
SPEAKER_1:  better than humans do, but we don't quite understand how it works.

02:48:12,834 --> 02:48:15,582
SPEAKER_1:  and the AI can't, we know that it works.

02:48:15,906 --> 02:48:19,454
SPEAKER_1:  contested very thoroughly, but we don't know exactly.

02:48:19,874 --> 02:48:22,878
SPEAKER_1:  what the control mechanism is, maybe what the chemistry of the physics is.

02:48:23,298 --> 02:48:25,923
SPEAKER_1:  uh... a i can't quite explain it they just can't it

02:48:25,923 --> 02:48:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  It's impenetrable to our consciousness basically, trying to hold it all together.

02:48:30,210 --> 02:48:36,542
SPEAKER_1:  And then, okay, so now we're living in that world where many of the biggest discoveries are made by AI systems. Yeah.

02:48:39,010 --> 02:48:40,135
SPEAKER_1:  As if we weren't going back.

02:48:40,135 --> 02:48:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I say, you know, it's, again, I will point out like when my godmother was born, like none of this was in front of us, right? It's like we live in an amazing time.

02:48:50,946 --> 02:48:55,102
SPEAKER_0:  Right? Like my grandfather, you know, plowed fields with a horse.

02:48:56,130 --> 02:48:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  I get to work on designing Fusion Rear.

02:48:59,746 --> 02:49:00,510
SPEAKER_0:  Pretty amazing time.

02:49:00,962 --> 02:49:04,766
SPEAKER_1:  but still there's humans, so we'll see. We'll see if that's around 100 years.

02:49:05,186 --> 02:49:06,311
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe it'll be outside.

02:49:06,311 --> 02:49:09,311
SPEAKER_0:  I think we're pretty resilient actually.

02:49:09,311 --> 02:49:19,326
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I know. That's one lesson from life is it finds a way. Let me ask you a bigger question, as if those weren't big enough. Let's look out.

02:49:20,674 --> 02:49:23,294
SPEAKER_1:  maybe a few hundred years, maybe a few thousand years out.

02:49:24,066 --> 02:49:32,286
SPEAKER_1:  There's something called the Kardashev Scale. It's a method of measuring civilization's level of technological advancement based on the amount of energy it's able to use.

02:49:32,578 --> 02:49:33,982
SPEAKER_1:  So type one civilization.

02:49:34,594 --> 02:49:40,318
SPEAKER_1:  And this might be given all your work is not no longer a scale that makes quite make sense.

02:49:40,834 --> 02:49:41,310
SPEAKER_1:  but...

02:49:41,954 --> 02:49:44,478
SPEAKER_1:  It very much focuses on the source of fusion.

02:49:44,834 --> 02:49:47,742
SPEAKER_1:  natural source of fusion which is for us the sun.

02:49:48,130 --> 02:49:50,814
SPEAKER_1:  And type one civilizations are able to leverage.

02:49:51,490 --> 02:49:52,574
SPEAKER_1:  uh... to collect

02:49:52,962 --> 02:49:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  all the energy that hits Earth.

02:49:55,202 --> 02:49:59,262
SPEAKER_1:  And then type two civilizations are the ones that are able to leverage.

02:50:00,162 --> 02:50:04,839
SPEAKER_1:  the entirety of the energy that comes from the sun by maybe building something.

02:50:04,839 --> 02:50:06,339
SPEAKER_0:  Like a Dyson Sphere? Yeah!

02:50:06,339 --> 02:50:06,750
SPEAKER_1:  If...

02:50:07,266 --> 02:50:09,310
SPEAKER_1:  When will we reach type 1 status?

02:50:09,666 --> 02:50:15,070
SPEAKER_1:  is get to the level which we're, I think, maybe a few orders of magnitude away from currently.

02:50:15,682 --> 02:50:19,998
SPEAKER_1:  And in general, do you think about this kind of stuff is where energy is so fundamental to.

02:50:20,258 --> 02:50:22,910
SPEAKER_1:  this like of life on earth.

02:50:23,138 --> 02:50:25,598
SPEAKER_1:  but also the expansion of life into the universe.

02:50:25,986 --> 02:50:27,550
SPEAKER_0:  Oh yeah, so what-

02:50:27,970 --> 02:50:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  One of the fun, on a weekend when I sat down and figured out what would it mean for interstellar travel, like to have a DT.

02:50:36,738 --> 02:50:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  In fact, one of the-

02:50:38,594 --> 02:50:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  I talked about my design class. One of my design classes was how you use.

02:50:42,978 --> 02:50:50,078
SPEAKER_0:  essentially a special configuration of a fusion device for not only traveling to but colonizing Mars.

02:50:50,658 --> 02:50:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  So because what we're we're.

02:50:52,546 --> 02:50:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  You talk about energy use being at the heart of civilizations like-

02:50:56,738 --> 02:51:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  What if you want to go to Mars not to just visit it but actually leave people there and make it something happen?

02:51:02,530 --> 02:51:04,254
SPEAKER_0:  these massive amounts of energy.

02:51:04,610 --> 02:51:11,678
SPEAKER_0:  So what would that look like? And it actually transforms how you're thinking about doing that as well too. Oh yeah, so we do those kinds of fun.

02:51:11,906 --> 02:51:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  And actually it was a fairly, you know.

02:51:13,634 --> 02:51:15,509
SPEAKER_0:  Quasi-realistic actually.

02:51:15,509 --> 02:51:15,902
SPEAKER_1:  think.

02:51:16,514 --> 02:51:19,139
SPEAKER_1:  It'll be nuclear fusion that powers this.

02:51:19,139 --> 02:51:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  civilization on Mars?

02:51:20,450 --> 02:51:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  Well, what we considered was something, so it turns out that there's thorium.

02:51:25,122 --> 02:51:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  which is a heavy element.

02:51:26,882 --> 02:51:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  So it's a so-called fertile element.

02:51:29,090 --> 02:51:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  that we still know fairly little about the geology of Mars in a deep sense.

02:51:36,514 --> 02:51:41,406
SPEAKER_0:  and we know that there's a lot of this on the surface of Mars. So one of the things we considered was what would happen

02:51:41,762 --> 02:51:44,254
SPEAKER_0:  that it's basically a combination of a fusion

02:51:44,610 --> 02:51:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  device that actually makes fuel from the thorium.

02:51:48,898 --> 02:51:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  But the underlying energy one was vision itself as well too. This is one of the examples of trying to be clever.

02:51:57,250 --> 02:51:59,166
SPEAKER_0:  around those things or what is it you know

02:51:59,394 --> 02:52:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  This also means that in interstellar travel it's like, oh yeah, that looks almost like impossible basically from an energy balance point of view. It's just like the energy required that you have to transport to get there. The only things that would work are DT fusion and basically...

02:52:15,714 --> 02:52:16,606
SPEAKER_0:  annihilation.

02:52:16,898 --> 02:52:18,773
SPEAKER_0:  It's like Star Trek, right?

02:52:18,773 --> 02:52:23,273
SPEAKER_1:  Interstellar travel will require.

02:52:23,273 --> 02:52:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  fusion.

02:52:24,578 --> 02:52:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, it's almost even impossible with fusion power actually. So hard.

02:52:29,442 --> 02:52:32,382
SPEAKER_0:  It's so hard because you have to carry the fuel.

02:52:32,834 --> 02:52:36,670
SPEAKER_0:  with you and the rocket equation tells you about how much fuel you use.

02:52:37,026 --> 02:52:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  to take, so what you end up with is like, how long does it take to go to these places? And it's like...

02:52:42,466 --> 02:52:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  staggering, you know, periods of time.

02:52:44,930 --> 02:52:46,055
SPEAKER_0:  So I tend to believe.

02:52:46,055 --> 02:52:48,862
SPEAKER_1:  that there's alien civilizations dispersed.

02:52:49,186 --> 02:52:52,478
SPEAKER_0:  all throughout the universe. Yeah, but we might be totally isolated from it.

02:52:52,898 --> 02:52:55,166
SPEAKER_1:  So you think we're not, there's none in this galaxy.

02:52:56,194 --> 02:52:56,606
SPEAKER_1:  like.

02:52:56,834 --> 02:53:00,990
SPEAKER_1:  I guess, and the question I also have is what kind of, do you think they have nuclear fusion?

02:53:01,762 --> 02:53:02,887
SPEAKER_1:  Is it all?Yes.

02:53:02,887 --> 02:53:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  The physics is all the same? Yeah. Oh, the physics is all the same. Yeah. Right. So this is the, and this is the Fermi paradox. Like, where the hell is everybody?

02:53:10,210 --> 02:53:11,166
SPEAKER_0:  the universe.

02:53:11,906 --> 02:53:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  Well, the scariest one of those is that

02:53:16,642 --> 02:53:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  I would point out that there's been, you know, there's, you know, order of many tens of millions of species on the planet Earth.

02:53:23,778 --> 02:53:27,710
SPEAKER_0:  and only one ever got to the point of sophisticated tool use.

02:53:28,130 --> 02:53:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  that we could actually start.

02:53:29,506 --> 02:53:30,750
SPEAKER_0:  essentially leveraging.

02:53:31,138 --> 02:53:32,254
SPEAKER_0:  The power of...

02:53:32,738 --> 02:53:33,854
SPEAKER_0:  what's in nature.

02:53:34,082 --> 02:53:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  our own will.

02:53:35,522 --> 02:53:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  Does this mean that basically this means? So almost look.

02:53:38,786 --> 02:53:40,446
SPEAKER_0:  There is almost certainly life or-

02:53:40,898 --> 02:53:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  DNA equivalence or whatever would be somewhere. I mean, just because you just need a soup and you need energy and

02:53:46,338 --> 02:53:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  You get it.

02:53:47,138 --> 02:53:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  organics and whatever the equivalent of amino acids are.

02:53:50,946 --> 02:53:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  But most of the life on earth has been that those, still amazing, but it's still, it's not very interesting.

02:53:57,314 --> 02:54:03,870
SPEAKER_0:  Are we, are we actually the accident of history? This is a very interesting one. Super, super rare. Super rare.

02:54:04,226 --> 02:54:06,654
SPEAKER_0:  And then of course the other part is that also just

02:54:06,914 --> 02:54:11,102
SPEAKER_0:  The other scary part of it, which if you look at the fairy paradoxes.

02:54:11,522 --> 02:54:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  Good, good, we got to this point.

02:54:13,346 --> 02:54:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  How long has it been?

02:54:15,170 --> 02:54:18,462
SPEAKER_0:  in humans. So humans, homo sapien has been around for a long time.

02:54:18,722 --> 02:54:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  100,000 years, 200,000 years or something.

02:54:21,154 --> 02:54:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:54:21,762 --> 02:54:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  our ability in that timeline to actually make an imprint on the universe by emitting radio waves or by modifying nature in a significant way has only been for about a hundred of those hundred thousand years

02:54:35,874 --> 02:54:38,590
SPEAKER_0:  And, you know, are we, it's a good question. So-

02:54:38,914 --> 02:54:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  Is it by definition, by the fact that when you are able to reach that level?

02:54:43,906 --> 02:54:48,542
SPEAKER_0:  of being able to manipulate nature and for example, discover.

02:54:49,666 --> 02:54:50,782
SPEAKER_0:  discover like fission.

02:54:51,138 --> 02:54:55,454
SPEAKER_0:  or burning fossil fuels and all this.

02:54:55,842 --> 02:54:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  is that what it says, oh, you're doomed, because...

02:54:58,754 --> 02:55:05,310
SPEAKER_0:  By definition, any species that gets to a point that can modify their environment like that, they'll actually push themselves.

02:55:06,050 --> 02:55:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  you know, past, that's one of the most depressing scenarios that I can imagine. Yeah, so the... So basically, we will never line up in time.

02:55:13,698 --> 02:55:16,126
SPEAKER_0:  because you get this little teeny window in time over.

02:55:16,386 --> 02:55:20,062
SPEAKER_0:  civilization might occur and you can never see it because you never...

02:55:20,450 --> 02:55:26,075
SPEAKER_0:  these sort of like scatter like fireflies around the galaxy.

02:55:26,075 --> 02:55:29,075
SPEAKER_1:  is up is up is up is up and then explodes destroys itself because

02:55:29,075 --> 02:55:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  of the exponential. And when we say destroy ourselves, all we would have to do is that we basically go, if you

02:55:35,202 --> 02:55:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  Humans are all left and we're still living on the planet.

02:55:38,082 --> 02:55:39,774
SPEAKER_0:  But all we have to do is go to...

02:55:40,130 --> 02:55:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  the technology of like, you know, 1800. Yeah.

02:55:43,394 --> 02:55:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  and were invisible in the universe.

02:55:46,402 --> 02:55:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  So, when I listened to the podcast, I thought I wanted to talk about this as well too, because it comes from a science point of view actually of what it means.

02:55:55,170 --> 02:55:59,934
SPEAKER_0:  But also to me, it's like another compelling driver of telling us, like, why we should try.

02:56:00,162 --> 02:56:02,014
SPEAKER_0:  Really hard not to screw this up.

02:56:02,562 --> 02:56:06,622
SPEAKER_0:  Like we're in this unique place of our ability to discover and make it.

02:56:07,458 --> 02:56:10,718
SPEAKER_0:  I just don't want to give up about thinking that we can get through.

02:56:11,170 --> 02:56:19,838
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I tend to see that there is some kind of game theoretic force like with mutual assured destruction that ultimately in each human being there's a

02:56:20,706 --> 02:56:24,414
SPEAKER_1:  desire to survive and a willingness to cooperate.

02:56:25,186 --> 02:56:29,054
SPEAKER_1:  to have compassion for each other in order to survive. I think that's

02:56:29,602 --> 02:56:31,582
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, maybe not in humans.

02:56:32,034 --> 02:56:35,486
SPEAKER_1:  but I can imagine the nearly infinite number of species in which...

02:56:36,482 --> 02:56:37,694
SPEAKER_1:  that overpowers.

02:56:38,498 --> 02:56:39,710
SPEAKER_1:  Any, uh...

02:56:40,194 --> 02:56:42,046
SPEAKER_1:  technological advancement that can destroy.

02:56:42,306 --> 02:56:44,638
SPEAKER_1:  or rewind this piece. So I think...

02:56:44,994 --> 02:56:46,142
SPEAKER_1:  If humans fail.

02:56:46,818 --> 02:56:47,454
SPEAKER_1:  I hope they don't.

02:56:48,354 --> 02:56:49,822
SPEAKER_1:  I see a lot of evidence for them not.

02:56:50,562 --> 02:56:55,870
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like somebody will survive. And there you start to ask questions about why, why we haven't met yet.

02:56:56,386 --> 02:56:57,511
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe it's just the spaces.

02:56:57,511 --> 02:57:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, spaces, it's...

02:57:00,770 --> 02:57:03,390
SPEAKER_0:  I think in logarithms and I can't even.

02:57:03,650 --> 02:57:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  fathom space. This is extraordinary, right? Yes. It's extraordinarily large.

02:57:10,018 --> 02:57:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, there's so many places on Earth. I just recently visited Paris for the first time.

02:57:14,050 --> 02:57:15,175
SPEAKER_1:  and there's so many other places.

02:57:15,175 --> 02:57:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  There's so many other places. Well, I like to.

02:57:18,050 --> 02:57:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it's interesting that we have this fascination with alien life.

02:57:22,178 --> 02:57:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  We have

02:57:23,170 --> 02:57:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  What is essentially alien life on earth already? Like you think about the organisms that.

02:57:28,322 --> 02:57:34,238
SPEAKER_0:  develop around deep sea thermal vents. One of my favorite books of all time from Stephen Jay Gould.

02:57:34,690 --> 02:57:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  If you've never read that book, it kind of blows your mind. It's about the Cambrian explosion.

02:57:39,906 --> 02:57:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  of life and it's like, oh you look at these things and it's like

02:57:43,650 --> 02:57:47,102
SPEAKER_0:  are the chance of us existing as a species.

02:57:47,362 --> 02:57:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  the genetic diversity was larger.

02:57:50,306 --> 02:57:53,182
SPEAKER_0:  This is about 500 million years ago or something like that.

02:57:53,666 --> 02:57:59,291
SPEAKER_0:  It is a mind altering trip of thinking about our place in the universe, I have to say.

02:57:59,291 --> 02:58:00,062
SPEAKER_1:  itself.

02:58:01,026 --> 02:58:03,774
SPEAKER_1:  is a kind of alien with almost...

02:58:04,802 --> 02:58:08,958
SPEAKER_1:  almost a mystery to ourselves. We still don't understand it. The very mechanism that...

02:58:09,282 --> 02:58:11,518
SPEAKER_1:  helps us explore the world is still a mystery.

02:58:12,866 --> 02:58:13,246
SPEAKER_1:  That.

02:58:13,602 --> 02:58:15,998
SPEAKER_1:  Like understanding that will also unlock

02:58:16,226 --> 02:58:16,574
SPEAKER_1:  uh

02:58:17,058 --> 02:58:19,358
SPEAKER_1:  it quite quite possibly unlock.

02:58:19,746 --> 02:58:24,190
SPEAKER_1:  our ability to understand the world and maybe build machines that help us understand the world, build tools that...

02:58:24,450 --> 02:58:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  I mean it already has, I mean our ability to understand the world is...

02:58:28,866 --> 02:58:30,622
SPEAKER_0:  is ridiculous almost actually.

02:58:31,330 --> 02:58:32,190
SPEAKER_0:  My voice, bye000s!!!

02:58:32,802 --> 02:58:38,427
SPEAKER_0:  And, and post the bot on. It's almost unbelievable. Where we've gotten all this to. so

02:58:38,427 --> 02:58:40,510
SPEAKER_1:  What advice would you give?

02:58:40,834 --> 02:58:42,174
SPEAKER_1:  to young folks.

02:58:42,562 --> 02:58:48,702
SPEAKER_1:  or folks of all ages who are lost in this world looking for a way, looking for a career they can be proud of or looking.

02:58:49,154 --> 02:58:50,279
SPEAKER_1:  to have a life that can be proud.

02:58:50,279 --> 02:58:52,766
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. Oh, the first thing I would say is don't give up.

02:58:53,474 --> 02:58:57,118
SPEAKER_0:  I get to see multiple sides of this and you know there is...

02:58:57,378 --> 02:59:00,574
SPEAKER_0:  There seems to be a level of despair.

02:59:01,122 --> 02:59:02,686
SPEAKER_0:  in a young generation.

02:59:03,202 --> 02:59:04,894
SPEAKER_0:  It's like, no, it's...

02:59:05,538 --> 02:59:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  And it's almost like the Monty Python skit, like I'm not dead yet. Right. I mean, like we're not there. We're in a place that, you know.

02:59:13,954 --> 02:59:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  And don't say the world's going to end in 300 days or something. It's not, okay?

02:59:20,450 --> 02:59:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  And what we mean by this is that...

02:59:22,434 --> 02:59:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  We have a robust society that's figured out how to do like amazing things, and we're going to keep doing amazing things.

02:59:28,770 --> 02:59:30,974
SPEAKER_0:  but that shouldn't be complacency.

02:59:31,394 --> 02:59:35,326
SPEAKER_0:  about what our future is and the future for their children as well too.

02:59:35,746 --> 02:59:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  And in the end...

02:59:36,802 --> 02:59:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's a very, it's a staggering legacy to think of what we've built up.

02:59:41,538 --> 02:59:46,910
SPEAKER_0:  Primarily by basically using carbon fuels. Like people almost tend to think of this as an evil thing that we've done.

02:59:47,138 --> 02:59:49,246
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's an amazing thing that we've done.

02:59:49,666 --> 02:59:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  But we owe it to ourselves and to this thing that we've built. I mean, we're talking about the end of the world, which is just nonsense.

02:59:56,834 --> 03:00:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  What it is is it's the end of this kind of lifestyle.

03:00:00,386 --> 03:00:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  and civilization at this scale and the ability to execute on these kinds of things that we are talking about today.

03:00:06,978 --> 03:00:09,150
SPEAKER_0:  Like we are extraordinarily privileged.

03:00:09,602 --> 03:00:11,742
SPEAKER_0:  We're in a place where it's just, it's...

03:00:12,130 --> 03:00:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  It's almost unfathomable compared to most of the misery that humans have lived in for our history.

03:00:17,410 --> 03:00:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  So don't give up about this, okay?

03:00:19,778 --> 03:00:21,694
SPEAKER_0:  but also roll up your sleeves.

03:00:21,954 --> 03:00:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  and let's get going at getting real solutions to the problems that are in front of us.

03:00:26,946 --> 03:00:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  which are significant.

03:00:29,794 --> 03:00:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  I would argue most of them are linked to what we use in energy, but it's not just that. It's around all the aspects of like, what does it mean?

03:00:38,306 --> 03:00:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  What does it mean to have a distributed energy source that lifts billions of people out of poverty?

03:00:43,586 --> 03:00:46,526
SPEAKER_0:  you know, particularly outside of like the Western nations, right?

03:00:46,978 --> 03:00:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  That seems to me a pretty-

03:00:48,898 --> 03:00:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  compelling.

03:00:49,890 --> 03:00:51,134
SPEAKER_0:  in a moral goal.

03:00:51,554 --> 03:00:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  for all of us.

03:00:53,858 --> 03:00:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  but particularly for this upcoming

03:00:55,778 --> 03:00:56,254
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

03:00:56,866 --> 03:01:02,046
SPEAKER_0:  And then the other part is that we've got possible solutions in front of us.

03:01:02,338 --> 03:01:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  Apply your talents.

03:01:04,322 --> 03:01:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  In a way.

03:01:05,186 --> 03:01:08,286
SPEAKER_0:  that you're passionate about and...

03:01:08,610 --> 03:01:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  is gonna make a difference.

03:01:10,786 --> 03:01:11,911
SPEAKER_0:  And that's only possible.

03:01:11,911 --> 03:01:14,718
SPEAKER_1:  with optimism, hope and hard work.

03:01:15,874 --> 03:01:17,758
SPEAKER_1:  What, uh, easy question.

03:01:19,394 --> 03:01:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  It's certainly easier than nuclear fusion.

03:01:21,474 --> 03:01:22,599
SPEAKER_1:  What's the meaning of life?

03:01:22,599 --> 03:01:25,717
SPEAKER_0:  Why are we here? 42. Is it 42?

03:01:25,717 --> 03:01:26,142
SPEAKER_1:  No.

03:01:27,010 --> 03:01:27,614
SPEAKER_1:  And...

03:01:27,906 --> 03:01:34,622
SPEAKER_1:  We already discussed about the beauty of physics that there's almost a desire to ask a why question about why the parameters have these values Yeah

03:01:35,586 --> 03:01:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  It's very tempting, yeah. It's-

03:01:37,986 --> 03:01:38,782
SPEAKER_0:  It's an interesting.

03:01:39,426 --> 03:01:42,174
SPEAKER_0:  hole to go down as a scientist because we're

03:01:42,690 --> 03:01:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  A part of what

03:01:43,906 --> 03:01:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  people.

03:01:44,706 --> 03:01:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  have a hard time people who aren't scientists have a hard time understanding what scientists do to themselves

03:01:49,986 --> 03:01:51,262
SPEAKER_0:  and a great scientist.

03:01:51,490 --> 03:01:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  does a very non-

03:01:52,994 --> 03:01:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  intuitive or non-human thing.

03:01:55,010 --> 03:02:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  What we do is we train ourselves to doubt ourselves. Like how? Like that's a great scientist. We doubt everything we see.

03:02:01,698 --> 03:02:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  We doubt everything that we think.

03:02:03,426 --> 03:02:03,934
SPEAKER_0:  because

03:02:04,194 --> 03:02:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  We.

03:02:04,930 --> 03:02:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  We basically try to turn off the belief.

03:02:08,994 --> 03:02:11,934
SPEAKER_0:  right, that humans just naturally have.

03:02:12,610 --> 03:02:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:02:13,602 --> 03:02:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  So when it comes to these things, I can make my own comments to this. It's like personally.

03:02:18,914 --> 03:02:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  You see these things about the ratios of life. And I made a comment where I said, well, you know, a wrap, my

03:02:23,746 --> 03:02:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  Some part of my brain that just goes...

03:02:26,018 --> 03:02:32,510
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, well, yeah, cause we're the only interesting, you know, multiverse because by definition it has to look like this, you know.

03:02:33,410 --> 03:02:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  But I have to say there's other times, I can say in the history of the whole-

03:02:37,826 --> 03:02:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  of what has happened over the last 10 years.

03:02:40,066 --> 03:02:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  There have been some pretty weird coincidences, like coincidences

03:02:44,194 --> 03:02:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  that like you look at it and just go, is that really, was that really a coincidence? Was that tauh.

03:02:49,826 --> 03:02:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  is something like

03:02:51,298 --> 03:02:54,046
SPEAKER_0:  pushing us towards these things.

03:02:54,306 --> 03:03:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  And it's a natural, it's a human instinct because, you know, since the beginnings of humanity, we've always assigned

03:03:00,578 --> 03:03:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

03:03:01,570 --> 03:03:05,310
SPEAKER_0:  you know, human motivation and needs.

03:03:05,698 --> 03:03:09,073
SPEAKER_0:  to these somewhat empirical observations.

03:03:09,073 --> 03:03:10,430
SPEAKER_1:  some sense the stories.

03:03:11,682 --> 03:03:14,430
SPEAKER_1:  before we understand the real explanations.

03:03:14,722 --> 03:03:15,998
SPEAKER_1:  The stories, the myths.

03:03:16,610 --> 03:03:18,078
SPEAKER_1:  uh, service as a

03:03:18,434 --> 03:03:23,102
SPEAKER_1:  as a good approximation for the thing that we're yet to understand. Absolutely. In a net sense.

03:03:23,458 --> 03:03:27,550
SPEAKER_1:  You said the antithesis to sort of scientific Tao is having a faith.

03:03:28,066 --> 03:03:28,606
SPEAKER_1:  In this.

03:03:28,834 --> 03:03:30,238
SPEAKER_1:  stories they're almost

03:03:31,138 --> 03:03:36,126
SPEAKER_1:  silly when looked at from a scientific perspective, but just even the feelings of

03:03:36,418 --> 03:03:40,798
SPEAKER_1:  It seems that love is a fundamental fabric of human condition.

03:03:41,058 --> 03:03:42,183
SPEAKER_1:  And what the hell is that?

03:03:42,183 --> 03:03:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  Billها

03:03:43,650 --> 03:03:47,774
SPEAKER_0:  Why are we so connected to each other? As a physicist I go it's you know

03:03:48,002 --> 03:03:58,943
SPEAKER_0:  This is a repeatable thing that's due to a set of synapses that fire in a particular pattern and all this. That's kind of like, okay man, what a drag that is to think of it this way.

03:03:58,943 --> 03:04:02,823
SPEAKER_1:  and you can have an evolutionary biology explanation but there's still a magic to it.

03:04:02,823 --> 03:04:05,886
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I see scientists, some of my colleagues, you know.

03:04:06,146 --> 03:04:07,646
SPEAKER_0:  do this as well too, like where?

03:04:07,970 --> 03:04:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  What is spirituality compared to science and so forth?

03:04:12,482 --> 03:04:14,846
SPEAKER_0:  My own feeling in this is that...

03:04:16,354 --> 03:04:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  You know, as a scientist, cause I've had the pleasure of being able to like.

03:04:20,194 --> 03:04:27,230
SPEAKER_0:  both understand what my predecessors did, but I also had the privilege of being able to discover things, right as a scientist and

03:04:28,066 --> 03:04:32,862
SPEAKER_0:  And I see that in just the range of our conversations.

03:04:33,314 --> 03:04:36,766
SPEAKER_0:  That is my, in a weird way, it's the awe.

03:04:37,122 --> 03:04:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  that comes.

03:04:38,050 --> 03:04:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  From looking at that.

03:04:39,394 --> 03:04:40,030
SPEAKER_0:  That is...

03:04:40,258 --> 03:04:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  if you're not in awe.

03:04:42,018 --> 03:04:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  of the universe and nature. You haven't been paying attention. I mean my own personal feeling is that-

03:04:47,170 --> 03:04:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  I feel.

03:04:48,610 --> 03:04:53,246
SPEAKER_0:  If I go snorkeling on a coral reef.

03:04:53,538 --> 03:04:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  I feel more awe than I could ever feel like in a church.

03:04:56,962 --> 03:04:59,486
SPEAKER_1:  you kind of notice some kind of magic there.

03:05:00,034 --> 03:05:01,886
SPEAKER_0:  There's something about the way the whole...

03:05:02,114 --> 03:05:04,158
SPEAKER_0:  darn thing holds together that just

03:05:04,930 --> 03:05:07,390
SPEAKER_0:  sort of escapes your imagination and that's.

03:05:07,842 --> 03:05:09,502
SPEAKER_0:  to me that this thing of

03:05:09,826 --> 03:05:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  And then we have different words, we call them holistic or.

03:05:12,994 --> 03:05:18,110
SPEAKER_0:  spiritual, the way that it all hangs together. In fact, one of the issues you asked about, like what I think about.

03:05:18,338 --> 03:05:22,654
SPEAKER_0:  One of the craziest things that I think that how does it hold together is like our society.

03:05:23,778 --> 03:05:24,222
SPEAKER_0:  How does-

03:05:24,450 --> 03:05:26,974
SPEAKER_0:  What? Yeah. How ou-

03:05:27,394 --> 03:05:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  Because there's no way, like just think of the United States, there's 330 million people.

03:05:32,898 --> 03:05:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  kind of working like this engine.

03:05:35,586 --> 03:05:38,302
SPEAKER_0:  about going towards making all these things happen.

03:05:38,658 --> 03:05:43,646
SPEAKER_0:  But there's like no one in charge of this, really. Not really, yeah. How the heck does this happen?

03:05:44,066 --> 03:05:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  It's kind of like, it's...

03:05:45,762 --> 03:05:49,950
SPEAKER_0:  So these things, these are the kinds of things mathematically and organization wise.

03:05:50,242 --> 03:05:54,334
SPEAKER_0:  that I think of just because they're awe-inspiring.

03:05:54,530 --> 03:05:55,454
SPEAKER_1:  And there's different.

03:05:56,130 --> 03:05:59,166
SPEAKER_1:  ideas that we come up together and we share them and then there's

03:05:59,554 --> 03:06:10,019
SPEAKER_1:  There's teams of people that share different ideas and those ideas compete like there was the ideas themselves are these kinds of different Organisms and ultimately somehow we build bridges and nuclear reactors

03:06:10,019 --> 03:06:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  and do those things.

03:06:11,202 --> 03:06:22,270
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I have to give a shout out to my daughter, by the way, who's an applied math major and she's amazing at math and over the break she was showing me she's doing research. It's basically about how – – Fin –

03:06:22,594 --> 03:06:28,894
SPEAKER_0:  ideas and ethos are transmitted within a society. Nice. So she's building an applied math model.

03:06:29,346 --> 03:06:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  I was explaining like...

03:06:30,690 --> 03:06:35,390
SPEAKER_0:  She was showing me in this simulation, she goes, Oh, look, look at this. And I said, oh.

03:06:36,194 --> 03:06:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  That's like how political parties like evolve.

03:06:38,754 --> 03:06:44,542
SPEAKER_0:  And even though it was a rather, you know, quote unquote simple mathematical model, it wasn't really. It's like.

03:06:44,770 --> 03:06:45,150
SPEAKER_0:  Oh.

03:06:46,594 --> 03:06:47,719
SPEAKER_0:  What maybe

03:06:47,719 --> 03:06:55,390
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe she has a chance to derive mathematically the answer to what's the meaning of life. There we go. And maybe it is indeed 42. Sega is absolutely fearless.

03:06:55,938 --> 03:06:57,566
SPEAKER_1:  Dennis, thank you so much for just...

03:06:57,922 --> 03:06:59,326
SPEAKER_1:  doing.

03:06:59,554 --> 03:07:02,078
SPEAKER_1:  creating tools, creating systems, exploring.

03:07:02,338 --> 03:07:03,294
SPEAKER_1:  This idea.

03:07:04,226 --> 03:07:09,534
SPEAKER_1:  That's one of the most amazing magical ideas in all of human endeavor, which is

03:07:09,858 --> 03:07:11,733
SPEAKER_1:  nuclear fusion. I mean that's so-

03:07:11,733 --> 03:07:14,206
SPEAKER_0:  interesting. You know it's almost like my...

03:07:14,626 --> 03:07:25,086
SPEAKER_0:  One of my lifelong goals is like to make it, it's like, it's not magic. It's like, it's boring as all heck. And this means we're using it everywhere. Right? Yeah. Yeah.

03:07:25,442 --> 03:07:34,494
SPEAKER_1:  And the magic is then built on top of it. Well, thank you for everything you do. Thank you for talking to me. It's a huge honor. This was a fascinating and amazing conversation. Thank you.

03:07:35,522 --> 03:07:37,790
SPEAKER_1:  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Dennis White.

03:07:38,274 --> 03:07:41,534
SPEAKER_1:  To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

03:07:42,018 --> 03:07:42,526
SPEAKER_1:  And now...

03:07:42,882 --> 03:07:45,214
SPEAKER_1:  Let me leave you with some words from Albert Einstein.

03:07:46,370 --> 03:07:47,934
SPEAKER_1:  There are two ways to live your life.

03:07:48,770 --> 03:07:50,974
SPEAKER_1:  One is as though nothing is a miracle.

03:07:51,554 --> 03:07:52,094
SPEAKER_1:  The other.

03:07:52,386 --> 03:07:53,822
SPEAKER_1:  as though everything's a miracle.

03:07:54,914 --> 03:07:55,678
SPEAKER_1:  Thank you for listening.

03:07:55,938 --> 03:07:56,734
SPEAKER_1:  I hope to see you.

03:07:57,154 --> 03:07:57,630
SPEAKER_1:  next time.
