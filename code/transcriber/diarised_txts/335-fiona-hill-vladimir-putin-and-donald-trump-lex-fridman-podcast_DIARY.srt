00:00:00,194 --> 00:00:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  We've got to have strategic empathy about Putin as well. We've got to understand how the guy thinks and why he thinks like he does.

00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  You know, he has got his own context and his own frame.

00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  and his own rationale.

00:00:12,578 --> 00:00:14,814
SPEAKER_0:  And he is rational, he is a rational actor.

00:00:15,138 --> 00:00:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  in his own context, we've got to understand that. We've got to understand that he would take offense as something he would take action over something.

00:00:21,538 --> 00:00:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  It doesn't mean to say that.

00:00:22,978 --> 00:00:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we are.

00:00:24,322 --> 00:00:30,046
SPEAKER_0:  necessary to blame by taking actions, but we are to blame when we don't understand the consequences of things that we do.

00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:31,806
SPEAKER_0:  and act accordingly.

00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  or take preventative action or recognize that something might happen as a result of something.

00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:42,366
SPEAKER_1:  What is the probability that Russia attacks Ukraine with a tactical nuclear weapon?

00:00:45,026 --> 00:00:47,134
SPEAKER_1:  The following is a conversation with Fiona Hill.

00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:51,550
SPEAKER_1:  presidential advisor and foreign policy expert specializing in Russia.

00:00:52,194 --> 00:00:52,894
SPEAKER_1:  She has served.

00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:59,326
SPEAKER_1:  the Bush, Obama and Trump administrations, including being a top advisor on Russia to Donald Trump.

00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,630
SPEAKER_1:  She has made it to the White House.

00:01:01,922 --> 00:01:04,062
SPEAKER_1:  from humble beginnings in the North of England.

00:01:04,642 --> 00:01:05,246
SPEAKER_1:  story.

00:01:05,634 --> 00:01:07,070
SPEAKER_1:  She tells in her book.

00:01:07,554 --> 00:01:08,670
SPEAKER_1:  There's nothing for you here.

00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:12,382
SPEAKER_1:  This is the Lex Friedman podcast. Thanks for watching.

00:01:12,642 --> 00:01:14,782
SPEAKER_1:  Please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:15,710
SPEAKER_1:  And now...

00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:16,638
SPEAKER_1:  Dear friends.

00:01:17,058 --> 00:01:17,886
SPEAKER_1:  Here's Fiona.

00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:18,718
SPEAKER_1:  Hill.

00:01:19,778 --> 00:01:21,822
SPEAKER_1:  You came from humble beginning.

00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,222
SPEAKER_1:  in a coal mining town in Northeast England.

00:01:24,674 --> 00:01:27,614
SPEAKER_1:  So what were some formative moments in your young life?

00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:29,438
SPEAKER_1:  that made you the...

00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  woman you are today.

00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,022
SPEAKER_0:  I was born in 1965.

00:01:33,314 --> 00:01:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  And it was the period where...

00:01:35,202 --> 00:01:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  the whole coal sector in Britain was in decline already.

00:01:39,714 --> 00:01:40,222
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:01:40,482 --> 00:01:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  unabasically.

00:01:41,826 --> 00:01:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  My father, by the time I came along, had lost his job multiple times. Every coal mine he worked in was closing down.

00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:54,174
SPEAKER_0:  was looking constantly for the work and he had no qualifications because at age 14 he'd gone down the mines.

00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  His father had gone down the mines at 13, his great grandfather around the same kind of age.

00:01:59,842 --> 00:02:05,598
SPEAKER_0:  people at different points going down coal mines at 12, 13, 14, they didn't get educated.

00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  beyond that period because the expectation was, are you gonna go down the mine like everybody else in your family?

00:02:11,522 --> 00:02:13,982
SPEAKER_0:  And then he didn't really have any other qualifications.

00:02:14,626 --> 00:02:15,134
SPEAKER_0:  too.

00:02:15,394 --> 00:02:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  You know, basically find.

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  another job beyond something in manual labor. So I worked in a.

00:02:20,418 --> 00:02:25,950
SPEAKER_0:  steelworks, that didn't work out, a brickworks that closed down, and then he went to work in the local hospital.

00:02:26,274 --> 00:02:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  of the National Health Service in the United Kingdom as a porter, an orderly, physically somebody's just pushing people around.

00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  There was no opportunity to retrain.

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  So the big issue in my family was education.

00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  You've gotta have one.

00:02:39,298 --> 00:02:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  and you've got to have some qualifications.

00:02:41,346 --> 00:02:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  The world is changing, it's changing really quickly.

00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:46,206
SPEAKER_0:  And for you to kind of keep up with it, you're going to have to.

00:02:47,362 --> 00:02:48,190
SPEAKER_0:  Get educated.

00:02:48,738 --> 00:02:50,046
SPEAKER_0:  and find a way out of this.

00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  I'm very early on, my father had basically said to me.

00:02:53,314 --> 00:02:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  There's nothing for you here.

00:02:54,946 --> 00:02:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  you're going to have to, if you want to get ahead.

00:02:57,858 --> 00:03:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  And he didn't have any kind of idea that as a girl I wouldn't. I mean, actually, in many respects, I think I benefited from being a girl rather than a boy. There was no expectation that I would go into industry.

00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  There was some kind of idea that maybe if I got qualifications, I could be a nurse. My mother was a midwife.

00:03:13,922 --> 00:03:17,182
SPEAKER_0:  And so she'd at age 16 left school and gone to train.

00:03:17,506 --> 00:03:19,390
SPEAKER_0:  as a nurse and then as a midwife.

00:03:19,714 --> 00:03:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  I had other relatives who'd gone to teach in local schools.

00:03:23,842 --> 00:03:26,334
SPEAKER_0:  And so there was an idea that women could get educated.

00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  and there was a kind of a range of things that you could do.

00:03:29,506 --> 00:03:30,974
SPEAKER_0:  Well the expectation then was...

00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:32,702
SPEAKER_0:  Go out there.

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  Do something with your life.

00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,494
SPEAKER_0:  but also a sense that you'd probably have to leave. So all the thought was-

00:03:39,138 --> 00:03:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  circling around me, particularly in my teenage years, as I was trying to find my way through.

00:03:44,994 --> 00:03:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  life and.

00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,038
SPEAKER_0:  Looking forward.

00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,238
SPEAKER_1:  First of all, what does that even look like?

00:03:50,626 --> 00:03:56,094
SPEAKER_1:  getting educated, given the context of that place, you don't know, there's a whole world of mystery out there.

00:03:56,546 --> 00:03:58,590
SPEAKER_1:  So how do you figure out what to actually do out there?

00:03:58,978 --> 00:04:00,606
SPEAKER_1:  Poster moments.

00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,126
SPEAKER_1:  formative moments either challenging or just inspiring.

00:04:04,802 --> 00:04:07,614
SPEAKER_1:  where you wondered about what you wanna be.

00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  where you wanna go. Yeah, I mean, there are a number of things. I mean, I think like a lot of kids, you know, you talk to people, and particularly from blue collar backgrounds, so what did you wanna do? Boys might say I wanted to be a fireman.

00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,254
SPEAKER_0:  you know, all you got, you know, kind of.

00:04:20,706 --> 00:04:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  At one point, as a little girl, I wanted to be a nurse in a little nurse's uniform like my mother. I didn't really know what that meant, but I used to go around pretending to be a nurse. I even had a little magazine called Nurse Nancy, and I used to read this.

00:04:33,186 --> 00:04:42,078
SPEAKER_0:  And you know, kind of that was one of the formative ideas. We also, it was a rural area, semi-rural area. And, you know, I'd be out in the fields all the time and I'd watch farmers.

00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:50,142
SPEAKER_0:  with their animals and I'd see vets coming along and watching people deal with the livestock. And there was a kind of a famous story at the time.

00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:58,334
SPEAKER_0:  about a vet called James Herriot. It became here in the United States as well and was a sort of a TV mini series. He'd written a book and he was the vet for my.

00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,734
SPEAKER_0:  one of my great aunt's dogs.

00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,710
SPEAKER_0:  and people were always talking about him and I thought, oh, I could be a vet.

00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  And then one day I saw one of the local vets with his hand up the...

00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  backside of a cow in a field and he got his hand stuck and the cow was kicking him and I thought yeah.

00:05:11,682 --> 00:05:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe.

00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:15,454
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe not actually, no, I don't think I want to be a vet.

00:05:15,746 --> 00:05:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  So I cycled through all of these things about, okay, I could get an education. But the whole sense was you had to apply your education.

00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  It wasn't an education for education's sake.

00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:25,598
SPEAKER_0:  It was an education to do something.

00:05:26,146 --> 00:05:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  And when I was about 14 or 15, my local member of parliament came to the school.

00:05:31,138 --> 00:05:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  And it was one of these pep talks for kids in these deprived areas.

00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,590
SPEAKER_0:  He had been quite prominent in local education.

00:05:39,074 --> 00:05:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  And now he was a member of parliament. He himself had come from a really hard, scrabble background and had risen up through education. He had even gone to Oxford and done.

00:05:46,754 --> 00:05:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  philosophy, politics and economics.

00:05:49,122 --> 00:05:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  He basically told my class, even though it was highly unlikely any of us were really going to get ahead and go to elite institutions.

00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  Look, you can get an education, you don't have to be held back by your circumstances.

00:05:59,682 --> 00:06:03,006
SPEAKER_0:  But if you do get an education, it's a privilege and you need to do something with it.

00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  So then I'm thinking...

00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  what could I do? Okay, an education is a qualification, it's to do something. Most people around me I didn't.

00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  I knew he didn't have careers. I mean, my dad didn't really have a career. He had jobs.

00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:20,926
SPEAKER_0:  My mom thought of her nursing as a career though, and it genuinely was, and she was out there trying to help women.

00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  survive childbirth.

00:06:23,298 --> 00:06:24,030
SPEAKER_0:  My mother had these.

00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  Horrific stories.

00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:40,446
SPEAKER_0:  you know, basically over the dining room table, I wish she'd stop. She'd leave out her nursing books. And I tell you, if everyone had had my mum as a mother, there'd be no reproduction on the planet. It was just these grim, horrific stories of breached births and fistulas and all kinds of horrors.

00:06:40,706 --> 00:06:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  that my sister and I would just go, oh my god, you know what, please stop.

00:06:45,218 --> 00:06:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  So I thought, well, you know, I don't necessarily want to go in that term.

00:06:48,962 --> 00:06:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  in that direction.

00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:51,230
SPEAKER_0:  But it was the timing.

00:06:51,522 --> 00:06:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  that really...

00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:53,598
SPEAKER_0:  cinch things for me.

00:06:54,402 --> 00:07:00,990
SPEAKER_0:  I was very lucky that the region that I grew up, County Durham, despite the massive decline, industrialization and the...

00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  complete collapse of...

00:07:03,746 --> 00:07:07,902
SPEAKER_0:  local government system around me still maintain money for education.

00:07:08,482 --> 00:07:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  And they also paid for exchanges. We had exchange programs with.

00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  up.

00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  cities in Germany and France, also in Russia and Kostroma near Yaroslavl, for example, an old textile town, similar down in its region, but quite historic.

00:07:23,714 --> 00:07:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  the Russian context, in fact, the original birthplace of the Romanov dynasty in Kostroma, just as County Durham was quite a distinguished historic area in the British context. So there was an idea that I could go on exchanges, I could learn languages, I studied German, I studied French.

00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,302
SPEAKER_0:  And then in 1983...

00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  there was the war scare.

00:07:45,922 --> 00:07:52,638
SPEAKER_0:  basically provoked by the Euro missile crisis. So the stationing of new categories of strategic nuclear weapons and intermediate.

00:07:52,898 --> 00:07:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  nuclear weapons.

00:07:54,626 --> 00:07:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  in Western Europe.

00:07:56,322 --> 00:07:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  and in Eastern Europe.

00:07:57,954 --> 00:07:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  during the height of the Cold War.

00:07:59,874 --> 00:08:03,006
SPEAKER_0:  and the zero missile crisis over SS-20 and Pershing missiles.

00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  went on from 1977, so when I was about 11 or 12.

00:08:06,914 --> 00:08:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  all the way through into the later part of the 1980s.

00:08:11,234 --> 00:08:12,606
SPEAKER_0:  and in 1983.

00:08:12,866 --> 00:08:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  we came extraordinarily close.

00:08:15,298 --> 00:08:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  to.

00:08:16,098 --> 00:08:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  nuclear conflict. It was very much another rerun of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, 20 years on, same kind of thing.

00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  the Soviets misread, although I didn't know this at the time. I know a lot of this, you know, after the fact.

00:08:29,346 --> 00:08:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  See you next time.

00:08:30,114 --> 00:08:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  Tension was palpable, but what happened was the Soviets misread the intentions of a series.

00:08:35,074 --> 00:08:36,222
SPEAKER_0:  of exercises.

00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  Operation Able Archer that the United States was conducting and actually thought that the United States might be preparing for a first nuclear strike.

00:08:44,322 --> 00:08:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  and that then set up a whole set of literal chain reactions.

00:08:47,746 --> 00:08:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  in the Soviet Union.

00:08:49,538 --> 00:08:52,446
SPEAKER_0:  Eventually it was recognized that all of this was.

00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:54,494
SPEAKER_0:  really based on misperceptions.

00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,110
SPEAKER_0:  And of course, that later led to negotiations between.

00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:04,606
SPEAKER_0:  Gorbachev and Reagan for the Intermediate Nuclear Forces, the INF Treaty. But in 1983 that tension was just...

00:09:04,898 --> 00:09:05,406
SPEAKER_0:  acute.

00:09:05,986 --> 00:09:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  And for as a teenager, we were basically being prepped the whole time.

00:09:09,922 --> 00:09:10,878
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  the inevitability of nuclear Armageddon.

00:09:15,202 --> 00:09:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  TV series, films in the United States and the UK, threads the day after.

00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  We had all these public service announcements telling us to.

00:09:22,626 --> 00:09:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  Seek.

00:09:23,426 --> 00:09:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  sanctuary or cover.

00:09:24,962 --> 00:09:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  and the inevitability of a nuclear blast. And my house was so small, they said, look for a room without a window. There were no rooms without windows. My dad put on these really thick curtains over the window.

00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  You know, instead of there was a nuclear flash, you know, we'd have to get down on the floor, not look up, but the curtains would help. And we'd be like, this is ridiculous, Dad.

00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:47,742
SPEAKER_0:  and we would all try to see if we could squeeze in the space under the stairs, a cupboard under the stairs like Harry Potter.

00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  I was all just, you know, totally nuts.

00:09:49,954 --> 00:09:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  or you had to throw yourself in a ditch if you were outside.

00:09:53,538 --> 00:09:55,134
SPEAKER_0:  I thought, well, this isn't going to work.

00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  And one of my great uncles who had fought in World War II said, Well look, you're good at languages Fiona.

00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:07,774
SPEAKER_0:  Why don't you go and study Russian? Try to figure it out. Figure out why the Russians are trying to blow us up. Because you know, during the- Go talk to them. Exactly, during World War II.

00:10:08,002 --> 00:10:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:10:08,578 --> 00:10:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union had all been wartime allies and my uncle Charlie thought well there's something going wrong here maybe you can figure it out and as you said go talk to them.

00:10:18,466 --> 00:10:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  So I thought, okay.

00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  I'll study Russian.

00:10:20,706 --> 00:10:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  So that's really how this came about. Applying education.

00:10:24,898 --> 00:10:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  I'll just do my very best to understand everything I possibly can about the Russian language and the Soviet Union.

00:10:30,562 --> 00:10:35,582
SPEAKER_0:  and I'll see what I can do. And I thought, well, maybe I could become a translator. So I had visions of myself sitting around.

00:10:35,842 --> 00:10:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  you know, listening to things in a.

00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  big headset.

00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  and in a best view translating perhaps at some.

00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,910
SPEAKER_0:  you know, future arms control summits.

00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,542
SPEAKER_1:  So...

00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,494
SPEAKER_1:  How did the journey?

00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,406
SPEAKER_1:  continue with learning Russian.

00:10:50,338 --> 00:10:50,750
SPEAKER_1:  I mean...

00:10:51,074 --> 00:10:54,078
SPEAKER_1:  This is early dream of being a translator.

00:10:54,402 --> 00:10:55,966
SPEAKER_1:  and thinking how can I actually.

00:10:56,258 --> 00:10:56,830
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhh

00:10:57,218 --> 00:11:01,374
SPEAKER_1:  help understand or maybe help even deeper way with this conflict.

00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:04,062
SPEAKER_1:  that threatens the existence of the human species.

00:11:04,578 --> 00:11:05,086
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:11:05,506 --> 00:11:06,782
SPEAKER_1:  How did it actually continue?

00:11:07,522 --> 00:11:15,397
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I mean, I read everything I possibly could about nuclear weapons and nuclear war and I started to try to teach myself Russian a little bit.

00:11:15,397 --> 00:11:17,758
SPEAKER_1:  It was always in context of nuclear war. It was...

00:11:17,858 --> 00:11:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  very much in the context of nuclear war at this particular point.

00:11:20,418 --> 00:11:28,670
SPEAKER_0:  but also in historical context, because I knew that the United States and the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union had been wartime allies in World War II, so I'll try to understand all of that.

00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,254
SPEAKER_0:  And also, you know, I, like many other people.

00:11:33,058 --> 00:11:59,341
SPEAKER_0:  read Russian literature in translation, I'd read War and Peace. And I'd loved the book, actually. I mean, particularly the story parts of it. I wasn't one really at that time when I was a teenager. I thought Tolstoy went on a bit in terms of his theories of the great man and of history and kind of social change. Although now I appreciate it more. But when I was about 14, I was like, this man needed an editor. Could he have just gone on with the story? What an amazing story, what an incredible kind of book this is.

00:11:59,341 --> 00:12:00,841
SPEAKER_1:  I still think he needs an ender but.

00:12:00,841 --> 00:12:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I think his wife tried, didn't she? He got quite upset with her.

00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:15,934
SPEAKER_0:  And then I kind of thought to myself, well, how do I study Russian? Because there were very few schools in my region, you know, given the impoverishment of the region, where you could study Russian. It's not that tough to take.

00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:17,438
SPEAKER_0:  Russian from scratch.

00:12:18,082 --> 00:12:19,294
SPEAKER_0:  And this is where things get...

00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,702
SPEAKER_0:  really quite interesting.

00:12:21,858 --> 00:12:27,198
SPEAKER_0:  because there were opportunities to study Russian at universities, but I would need to have.

00:12:27,426 --> 00:12:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  First of all.

00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,006
SPEAKER_0:  an intensive Russian language course in the summer.

00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  and I didn't have the money for that.

00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,094
SPEAKER_0:  and the period is around the minus strike.

00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  in the United Kingdom in 1984.

00:12:40,738 --> 00:12:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  Now.

00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  The miners of County Durham.

00:12:43,682 --> 00:12:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  that very interestingly had exchanges and ties with the miners of Donbass.

00:12:48,482 --> 00:12:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  going back to the 1920s.

00:12:51,202 --> 00:12:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  And as I studied Russian history, I discovered there was lots of contacts.

00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  between.

00:12:55,618 --> 00:12:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  You know, Bolshevik.

00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:00,254
SPEAKER_0:  Soviet Union in the early period after the Russian Revolution, but even before that.

00:13:00,674 --> 00:13:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  during the imperial period in Russia between the Northern England.

00:13:03,938 --> 00:13:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  and the Russian Empire in the old industrial areas.

00:13:06,978 --> 00:13:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  Basically big industrial areas like the northeast of England.

00:13:10,242 --> 00:13:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  and plays like Don Bass were built up at the same time, often by the same sets of industrialists.

00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:15,806
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:13:16,066 --> 00:13:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  Donetsk.

00:13:16,994 --> 00:13:19,966
SPEAKER_0:  in the Donbass region used to be called Husevka.

00:13:20,514 --> 00:13:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  because it was established by a Welsh industrialist who brought in miners from Wales.

00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  to help develop the coal mines there and also the steelworks and others that we've been working with.

00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  we're hearing about all the time.

00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  So I got very fascinated in all these linkages and you know, famous.

00:13:36,354 --> 00:13:39,774
SPEAKER_0:  writers from the early parts of the Soviet Union like Yevgeny Zamyatin.

00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:43,582
SPEAKER_0:  I worked in the shipyards in Newcastle, Pontine.

00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:44,542
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  there was just this whole set of connections.

00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  And in 1984...

00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  When the miners strike took place, the miners of Donbass along with other miners from

00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  famous coal regions like the Ruhr Valley, for example, in Germany or miners in Poland.

00:14:02,786 --> 00:14:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  sent money in solidarity to the miners of Candidurum.

00:14:05,858 --> 00:14:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  And there've been these exchanges, as I said, going back and forth since the 1920s, formal exchanges between miners.

00:14:11,426 --> 00:14:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  the region of miners unions.

00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:18,174
SPEAKER_0:  I heard again from the same.

00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  great uncle who told me to...

00:14:20,354 --> 00:14:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  study Russian.

00:14:21,602 --> 00:14:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  So there were actually scholarships for the children of minors, and it could be former minors as well.

00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:26,974
SPEAKER_0:  for their education.

00:14:27,522 --> 00:14:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  And I should go along to the miners' hall, a place called Red Hills, where the miners of County Durham are actually.

00:14:35,202 --> 00:14:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  pooled all of their resources and built up their own parliament.

00:14:38,018 --> 00:14:39,934
SPEAKER_0:  and their own kind of place that they could.

00:14:40,322 --> 00:14:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  talk among themselves to figure out how to

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,950
SPEAKER_0:  enhance the welfare and wellbeing of their communities.

00:14:46,242 --> 00:14:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  and they'd put money aside for education for minors. There was all kinds of lecture series from the minors and all kinds of other activities supporting soccer teams and...

00:14:54,466 --> 00:15:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  artistic circles and writing circles, for example. People like George Orwell, you know, were involved in some of these writer's circles and other parts of.

00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,606
SPEAKER_0:  Bretton and Minnan communities for example.

00:15:05,122 --> 00:15:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  And so the.

00:15:06,562 --> 00:15:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  tell me I could go along.

00:15:08,418 --> 00:15:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  and basically.

00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:10,558
SPEAKER_0:  Apply for a grant?

00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:12,478
SPEAKER_0:  to go to study Russian, so I show up.

00:15:12,866 --> 00:15:18,398
SPEAKER_0:  And it was the easiest application I've ever come across. So just ask me to, my dad came along with me.

00:15:18,754 --> 00:15:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  They asked me to verify that my dad had been a miner, and they looked up his employment record on little cards.

00:15:25,122 --> 00:15:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  kind of a little a little trace somewhere.

00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  and then they asked me how much I needed.

00:15:29,858 --> 00:15:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  you know, to basically pay for the...

00:15:32,354 --> 00:15:32,798
SPEAKER_0:  travel.

00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,478
SPEAKER_0:  and some of the basic expenses for the...

00:15:37,314 --> 00:15:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  the study and they wrote me a check.

00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:41,406
SPEAKER_0:  And so thanks to the miners of Donbass.

00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  and this money that was deposited with the miners of County Durham with the Durham Miners Association.

00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  I got the money to study Russian for the first time.

00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:53,598
SPEAKER_0:  before I embarked on my studies at university.

00:15:53,762 --> 00:15:55,070
SPEAKER_1:  as you're speaking now.

00:15:55,394 --> 00:15:59,166
SPEAKER_1:  It's reminding me that there's a different way to look both at history.

00:15:59,778 --> 00:16:02,238
SPEAKER_1:  and a geography in a different places.

00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,582
SPEAKER_1:  is um

00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,302
SPEAKER_1:  you know, this is an industrial region.

00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:10,878
SPEAKER_1:  That's right. And it echoes in the experience of living there.

00:16:11,586 --> 00:16:13,054
SPEAKER_1:  is more captured.

00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:15,870
SPEAKER_1:  not by Moscow or Kiev.

00:16:16,418 --> 00:16:18,718
SPEAKER_1:  by at least historically.

00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,446
SPEAKER_1:  or by just being...

00:16:20,674 --> 00:16:21,799
SPEAKER_1:  mining town and

00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  That's right, in the place itself. Yeah, I mean, there are places in the United States, in Appalachia, in West Virginia and in Pennsylvania, like the Lehigh Valley.

00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  that have the same sense of place.

00:16:31,906 --> 00:16:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  And the northeast of England was the...

00:16:34,306 --> 00:16:35,966
SPEAKER_0:  cradle of the Industrial Revolution.

00:16:36,418 --> 00:16:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  It was the industrial version of Silicon Valley, which has its own.

00:16:41,538 --> 00:16:43,390
SPEAKER_0:  I would say contours and frames.

00:16:43,874 --> 00:16:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  And when you come to those industrial areas, your previous identities get submerged in that larger.

00:16:50,178 --> 00:16:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  framework. I've always looked at the world through that lens.

00:16:53,442 --> 00:16:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  of being.

00:16:54,466 --> 00:17:00,030
SPEAKER_0:  you know, someone from the working class, the blue collar communities from a very specific place with lots of historical.

00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  and economic connotations.

00:17:02,914 --> 00:17:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  And it's also a melting pot, which is the problems that the Donbass has experienced.

00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  over the last 30 years, that people came from all over the place to work there. Of course, there was a population that one might say is indigenous, might have gone back centuries there.

00:17:17,282 --> 00:17:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  but they would have been in the smaller rural farming communities just like it was the same in the northeast of England.

00:17:23,138 --> 00:17:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  People in the case of the northeast of England came from Wales, they came from further in the south of England, the Midlands, they came from Scotland, they came from Ireland.

00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  I have all of that heritage in my own personal background.

00:17:35,938 --> 00:17:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  and you've got a different identity.

00:17:38,562 --> 00:17:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  And it's when somebody else tries to impose an identity on you from the outside that things go awry. And I think that that's kind of what we've really seen.

00:17:46,434 --> 00:17:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  In the case of Donbass, it's a place that's a part in many respects historically and in terms of its evolution and development over time.

00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  and particularly in the case of Russia.

00:17:57,922 --> 00:18:02,334
SPEAKER_0:  The Russians have tried to say, well look, you know, because most people speak Russian, there is the lingua franca.

00:18:02,626 --> 00:18:09,598
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, in the North East Ring, of course, everyone spoke English, but lots of people were Irish speakers, you know, Gaelic Irish speakers or, you know, some of them might have.

00:18:09,858 --> 00:18:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  certainly been Welsh speakers. There was lots of Welsh miners who spoke Welsh as their first language who came there.

00:18:14,978 --> 00:18:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  But they created an identity. It's the same in Belfast and Ulster.

00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  the northern province of...

00:18:21,986 --> 00:18:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  of the whole of the Irish island.

00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,286
SPEAKER_0:  and are the part of Ireland that is still part of the United Kingdom.

00:18:28,514 --> 00:18:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  That was also a heavily industrialized area.

00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  high manufacturing, mass manufacturing.

00:18:35,522 --> 00:18:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  shipbuilding for example, people came from all over there too.

00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  which is why I went Ireland.

00:18:40,674 --> 00:18:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  got its independence from the United Kingdom.

00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  Ulster.

00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,430
SPEAKER_0:  Belfast and that whole region.

00:18:46,818 --> 00:18:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  and I kind of clung on because it was again that melting pot.

00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:52,350
SPEAKER_0:  It was kind of intertwined with the larger.

00:18:52,642 --> 00:18:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  industrial economy.

00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  and had a very different identity.

00:18:56,386 --> 00:19:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  And so that, for me, growing up in such a specific place with such a...

00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:03,902
SPEAKER_0:  special in many respects.

00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  Heritage.

00:19:05,314 --> 00:19:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  gave me a different perspective on things when I first went to the Soviet Union in 1987.

00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  to study there. I actually went to a translators institute, what was then called the Maurice Therese, which is now the Institute of Foreign Languages.

00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  I was immediately struck by how similar.

00:19:20,962 --> 00:19:22,590
SPEAKER_0:  Everything was to the north of England.

00:19:23,234 --> 00:19:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  because it was just like one big working class culture that sort of broken out onto the national stage. Everything in Northern England was nationalized.

00:19:30,914 --> 00:19:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  We had British steel, British coal, British rail, British shipbuilding.

00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,662
SPEAKER_0:  because after World War II, the private sector had been devastated.

00:19:37,922 --> 00:19:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  and the state had to step in.

00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  And of course, the Soviet Union is one big giant.

00:19:42,594 --> 00:19:44,254
SPEAKER_0:  nationalised economy when I get there.

00:19:44,738 --> 00:19:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  and it's just.

00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  The people's attitudes and outlooks are the same. People didn't work for themselves, they always worked for somebody else.

00:19:50,882 --> 00:19:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  and it had a quite a...

00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  a distortion on the way that people looked at the world.

00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:55,998
SPEAKER_0:  Do you still speak Russian?

00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  I do.

00:19:56,898 --> 00:20:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  Do you speak Russian? Yes, of course, if you want.

00:20:00,162 --> 00:20:05,086
SPEAKER_1:  Well, then I need to say something and everyone will think about what we are talking about now.

00:20:05,314 --> 00:20:09,374
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it would be a big mystery for everybody. You have an advantage on me because it's your native language as well.

00:20:09,506 --> 00:20:15,646
SPEAKER_1:  For people wondering, the English speakers in the audience, you're really missing a lot from the few sentences we said there.

00:20:16,002 --> 00:20:16,478
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:20:16,962 --> 00:20:22,878
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's a fascinating language that stretches actually geographically across a very large part of this world.

00:20:23,394 --> 00:20:23,934
SPEAKER_1:  So...

00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,678
SPEAKER_1:  There you are in 1987, exchange student in the Soviet Union.

00:20:28,162 --> 00:20:29,790
SPEAKER_1:  What was that world like?

00:20:30,274 --> 00:20:31,870
SPEAKER_0:  Well that was absolutely...

00:20:32,226 --> 00:20:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  fascinating in that period because it's the period.

00:20:35,202 --> 00:20:40,030
SPEAKER_0:  that's just around the time of the peak of perestroika Mikhail Gorbachev's

00:20:40,578 --> 00:20:41,054
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  role as president, well he wasn't quite president at that point, he was Secretary General of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union trying to transform the whole place.

00:20:50,242 --> 00:20:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  That's why I arrived there.

00:20:51,938 --> 00:20:54,366
SPEAKER_0:  in September of 1987.

00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:55,454
SPEAKER_0:  Justice.

00:20:55,842 --> 00:20:57,758
SPEAKER_0:  Gorbachev and Reagan's sign.

00:20:58,242 --> 00:20:59,326
SPEAKER_0:  the INF Treaty.

00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:04,734
SPEAKER_0:  was just within weeks of them about to sign that, which really ends that whole period that it

00:21:05,058 --> 00:21:06,270
SPEAKER_0:  shit my entire

00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:09,694
SPEAKER_0:  teenage years of the end of the Euro Missile Crisis by...

00:21:10,178 --> 00:21:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  finally having agreement on basically the rejection and constraints on intermediate nuclear forces.

00:21:16,002 --> 00:21:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  And also, at this point, Gorbachev

00:21:18,594 --> 00:21:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  opening the Soviet Union up.

00:21:21,026 --> 00:21:24,702
SPEAKER_0:  So we got all kinds of opportunities to travel in ways that we wouldn't have done before.

00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  not just in Moscow, which is where I was studying its translates into the Caucasus, to Central Asia.

00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  went all the way to Khabarovsk in the Russian Far East.

00:21:34,914 --> 00:21:37,470
SPEAKER_0:  all the way around, you know, kind of Moscow and.

00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  There was, at this point, it was also the Krescheni Rus, which has become very important now. This is the anniversary, the thousandth anniversary of the Christianization.

00:21:47,746 --> 00:21:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  of...

00:21:49,282 --> 00:21:49,758
SPEAKER_0:  Russia.

00:21:50,402 --> 00:21:55,294
SPEAKER_0:  which of course has become a massive obsession of Vladimir Putin's, but you know, 988.

00:21:55,778 --> 00:22:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  because I was there in 1987 to 1988. At this point, the Russian Orthodox Church is undergoing a revival from being repressed during the Soviet period.

00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,598
SPEAKER_0:  you suddenly have the church stepping out.

00:22:06,146 --> 00:22:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  as a non-governmental organization and engaging in discussions with people.

00:22:10,402 --> 00:22:11,646
SPEAKER_0:  about the future of religion.

00:22:12,482 --> 00:22:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  So that was...

00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  something that I wasn't expecting to witness.

00:22:18,146 --> 00:22:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  Also, I mean, being in Moscow, this is the cultural capital of a vast empire at this point. I'd never lived in a major city before. It's the first big city I lived in. It's the first big city I lived in.

00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  I'd never been to the opera.

00:22:28,546 --> 00:22:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the first time I got an opera, it's at the Bolshoi.

00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  I'd never seen a ballet. I mean, I was not exactly steeped in...

00:22:35,778 --> 00:22:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  high classical culture, growing up in a mining region.

00:22:39,714 --> 00:22:51,134
SPEAKER_0:  There's very limited opportunities for this kind of thing. I'd been in a youth orchestra and a youth choir. My parents signed me up for obviously everything they possibly could education wise, but it wasn't exactly any exposure to this.

00:22:51,362 --> 00:22:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  I was kind of astounded by the sort of wealth of the cultural experience that one could have in Moscow. That was amazing.

00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  was I was really struck by.

00:22:59,426 --> 00:23:01,886
SPEAKER_0:  how the Soviet Union was on its last legs.

00:23:02,658 --> 00:23:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  because this was Moscow, you know, I got this image about what it would look like. I was quite, to be honest.

00:23:08,226 --> 00:23:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  terrified at first about what I would see there, even at the big nuclear superpower. But as soon as I got there...

00:23:13,282 --> 00:23:20,190
SPEAKER_0:  It was just this like, as if a huge wedge that I'd been carrying around for years and my teenage years just disappeared because it's just ordinary people in k셔서dさん

00:23:20,514 --> 00:23:21,406
SPEAKER_0:  not doing great.

00:23:21,762 --> 00:23:22,654
SPEAKER_0:  This is the period.

00:23:23,522 --> 00:23:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  of what they call deficitne vremya, the period of deficits, but there's no food in the shops.

00:23:29,154 --> 00:23:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  There was very little in terms of commodities because...

00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:39,646
SPEAKER_0:  the supply and demand parts of the economic equation were out of luck because this was total central planning. You know, you could go into… you know, use it to

00:23:39,906 --> 00:23:43,390
SPEAKER_0:  a shop that was supposed to sell boots and there'd be just one.

00:23:43,874 --> 00:23:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  pyre of boots all in the same size and the same color.

00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  I actually looked out because once I was in this...

00:23:50,242 --> 00:23:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  Hungarian boot shop that was right next to where my Hall of Residence was and I was looking for a new pair of boots and every single pair of boots in the shop were my size.

00:23:58,498 --> 00:24:00,670
SPEAKER_0:  and they're all women's boots, they're not men's boots at all.

00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  because there has been an oversupply of boots and that size protection.

00:24:04,546 --> 00:24:13,790
SPEAKER_0:  But you could really kind of see here that there was something wrong. And, you know, in the north of England, everything was closed down. The shops were shuttered because there was no demand because everybody lost their jobs. It was just mustered employment.

00:24:14,114 --> 00:24:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  When I went off to university in 1984, 90% youth unemployment.

00:24:18,594 --> 00:24:20,414
SPEAKER_0:  in the UK, meaning that when kids...

00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  left school, they didn't have something else to go on to unless they got to university or vocational training or an apprenticeship and most people were still looking, you know, kind of months out.

00:24:29,154 --> 00:24:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  of leaving school.

00:24:30,786 --> 00:24:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  And so shops were closing because people didn't have any money.

00:24:33,378 --> 00:24:36,958
SPEAKER_0:  I had 50% male unemployment in some of the towns.

00:24:37,282 --> 00:24:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  the steelworks closed down and the wagon works for the railways, for example, in my area.

00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:46,910
SPEAKER_0:  But in Moscow, people in theory did have money, but there was just, there was nothing to buy.

00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  Also, the place was falling apart, literally. I saw massive sinkholes open up in the street.

00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  balconies fall off buildings, you know, one accident after another.

00:24:55,810 --> 00:25:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  And then there was this real sense, even though the vibrancy and excitement and hope of the Gorbachev period...

00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,606
SPEAKER_0:  a real sense that the Soviet Union has lost its way.

00:25:05,026 --> 00:25:07,678
SPEAKER_0:  And of course it was only a year or so after.

00:25:08,194 --> 00:25:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  I left from that exchange program and I'd already started with my degree program.

00:25:13,186 --> 00:25:15,134
SPEAKER_0:  and Soviet studies at Talbot.

00:25:15,618 --> 00:25:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  that the Soviet Union basically unraveled.

00:25:18,338 --> 00:25:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  And it really did unravel. It wasn't like it collapsed.

00:25:21,122 --> 00:25:28,030
SPEAKER_0:  It was basically that there were so many debates that Gorbachev had sparked off about how to reform the country, how to put it on a different path.

00:25:28,898 --> 00:25:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  you know, no one was in agreement, especially all these fights and-

00:25:32,674 --> 00:25:33,182
SPEAKER_0:  uh

00:25:33,506 --> 00:25:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  debates and disputes among the elites at the centre.

00:25:36,706 --> 00:25:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  as well as.

00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:40,222
SPEAKER_0:  You know, basically a loss of faith in the system.

00:25:40,546 --> 00:25:43,134
SPEAKER_0:  in the periphery and among the general population.

00:25:43,394 --> 00:25:45,726
SPEAKER_0:  then in fact pulled it apart and of course.

00:25:46,402 --> 00:25:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  1991.

00:25:48,482 --> 00:25:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  you get...

00:25:50,626 --> 00:25:55,582
SPEAKER_0:  Boris Yeltsin as the head of the Russian Federation, then a constituent part of the Soviet Union.

00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:59,006
SPEAKER_0:  together with the presidents of Ukraine and Belarus.

00:25:59,298 --> 00:26:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  all of these being individual.

00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  parts of the Soviet Union getting together and agreeing and essentially ending it.

00:26:06,018 --> 00:26:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  And Gorbachev, you know, so basically I'm there at the peak of this whole kind of period of experimentation and thinking about the future.

00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  And within a couple of years, it's all kind of gone and it's on a different track entirely.

00:26:16,066 --> 00:26:19,390
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I wonder if we reran the 20th century.

00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,798
SPEAKER_1:  a thousand times.

00:26:21,442 --> 00:26:24,094
SPEAKER_1:  if how many times the Soviet Union will collapse.

00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I wonder about that too. And I also wonder about what would have happened if it didn't collapse and Gorbachev had found a different direction.

00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,654
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, we see a very divisive time now in.

00:26:34,914 --> 00:26:35,870
SPEAKER_1:  American history.

00:26:36,258 --> 00:26:38,302
SPEAKER_1:  the United States of America.

00:26:38,754 --> 00:26:40,798
SPEAKER_1:  It's very different cultures, very different.

00:26:41,346 --> 00:26:44,414
SPEAKER_1:  beliefs, ideologies within those states. but those are

00:26:44,994 --> 00:26:48,670
SPEAKER_1:  That's kind of the strength of America, there's these little laboratories.

00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:49,982
SPEAKER_1:  of ideas.

00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:56,350
SPEAKER_0:  until though that they don't keep together. I mean, I've had colleagues who have described what's happening in the West right now as a kind of soft secession.

00:26:56,738 --> 00:27:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  with states going off in their own direction. The center of

00:27:01,666 --> 00:27:09,118
SPEAKER_0:  Well, these kinds of conceptions that we have now are divisions between red and blue states because of the fracturing of our politics.

00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:16,446
SPEAKER_0:  And I'd always thought that that wouldn't be possible in somewhere like the United States or, you know, many other countries as well, because there wasn't that ethnic

00:27:17,122 --> 00:27:18,462
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think we will get the

00:27:18,914 --> 00:27:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  But in fact, many of the way that people talk about politics has given it.

00:27:23,618 --> 00:27:26,814
SPEAKER_0:  that kind of appearance in many respects. This is what a company we know from

00:27:27,106 --> 00:27:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  the Soviet Union and the Soviet period.

00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  and from where you're from, you know, originally in Ukraine, that language.

00:27:33,186 --> 00:27:35,262
SPEAKER_0:  is not the man to signify of identity.

00:27:35,874 --> 00:27:39,166
SPEAKER_0:  and that identity can take all kinds of other forms.

00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,310
SPEAKER_1:  That's really interesting, I mean, but.

00:27:42,338 --> 00:27:44,734
SPEAKER_1:  There has to be a deep grievance of some kind.

00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,174
SPEAKER_1:  If you took a poll.

00:27:46,594 --> 00:27:49,054
SPEAKER_1:  in any other states in the United States, I think.

00:27:49,474 --> 00:27:52,414
SPEAKER_1:  a very small minority of people would want to actually succeed.

00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,806
SPEAKER_1:  even in Texas where I spend a lot of my time.

00:27:56,482 --> 00:27:58,878
SPEAKER_1:  I just think that there is a...

00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:02,014
SPEAKER_1:  common kind of pride of nation.

00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:05,470
SPEAKER_1:  You know, there's a lot of people complain.

00:28:05,762 --> 00:28:07,486
SPEAKER_1:  about government and about...

00:28:07,874 --> 00:28:09,374
SPEAKER_1:  how the country's going.

00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:16,894
SPEAKER_1:  the way people complain about the weather when it's raining. They say, oh, this stupid weather is raining again. But really what they mean is...

00:28:17,666 --> 00:28:19,454
SPEAKER_1:  We're in the smock together.

00:28:19,682 --> 00:28:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  There's a together there.

00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  I also feel that when I go around, because I mean, I've spent a lot of time since I wrote my book in last October, and this last year going around, I find the same feeling.

00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  But you know, when I traveled around the Soviet Union...

00:28:34,594 --> 00:28:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  in the late 1980s. I didn't get any kind of sense that people wanted to see the end of the Soviet Union either.

00:28:40,322 --> 00:28:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  It was an elite project.

00:28:42,274 --> 00:28:47,966
SPEAKER_0:  There's a really great book called Collapse by Vladislav Zubok, who is a professor.

00:28:48,514 --> 00:28:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  at

00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  London School of Economics at LSE.

00:28:53,986 --> 00:28:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  And Zubok is pretty much my age and he's from the former Soviet Union, he's Russian.

00:28:58,626 --> 00:29:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  And I mean, he describes it very quite aptly about how it was kind of the elites.

00:29:03,106 --> 00:29:09,406
SPEAKER_0:  that basically decided to pull the Soviet Union apart. And there is a risk of that here as well when you get partisan politics.

00:29:09,634 --> 00:29:10,558
SPEAKER_0:  and people forgetting.

00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  they're Americans and they are all in this together like a lot of the population thing.

00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  but they think that they're own, you know, narrow, partisan or ideological.

00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:19,262
SPEAKER_0:  precepts.

00:29:19,618 --> 00:29:20,638
SPEAKER_0:  You know, camp for more.

00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  And in the Soviet case, of course, it was also a power play.

00:29:24,194 --> 00:29:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  in a way that's...

00:29:25,954 --> 00:29:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  actually can't quite play out in the United States because it was the equivalent of governance.

00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  in many respects.

00:29:31,906 --> 00:29:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  who got together three of them, you know, in the case of.

00:29:34,978 --> 00:29:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  the heads of Russia.

00:29:37,058 --> 00:29:39,902
SPEAKER_0:  Ukraine and Belarus who then got rid of.

00:29:40,194 --> 00:29:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  you know, basically the central.

00:29:42,306 --> 00:29:45,726
SPEAKER_0:  the central figure of Mikhail Gorbachev. It would be a little...

00:29:46,114 --> 00:29:51,838
SPEAKER_0:  difficult to do that, the dynamic is not the same, but it does worry me of having seen all of that close up.

00:29:52,546 --> 00:29:54,270
SPEAKER_0:  in the late 1980s.

00:29:54,914 --> 00:29:59,870
SPEAKER_0:  and the early 90s, I spent a lot of time in Russia.

00:30:00,194 --> 00:30:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  as well as in Ukraine and the Caucasus, Central Asia and other places after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

00:30:05,954 --> 00:30:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  but that you kind of see the same.

00:30:08,066 --> 00:30:09,374
SPEAKER_0:  elite divisions here.

00:30:09,858 --> 00:30:11,326
SPEAKER_0:  in the United States pulling.

00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  in different directions and straining the overall body politic.

00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,582
SPEAKER_0:  national politics gets.

00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:21,854
SPEAKER_0:  imposed on local politics.

00:30:22,434 --> 00:30:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  whereas it certainly wasn't when I first came to the US in 1989. I didn't honestly in 1989 when I first came here. I didn't know anybody's political affiliation.

00:30:30,178 --> 00:30:32,062
SPEAKER_0:  I rarely knew that religious affiliation.

00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  And obviously race was a major phenomenon here that was a shock to me when I first came.

00:30:38,882 --> 00:30:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  but many of the kind of the class.

00:30:40,994 --> 00:30:41,726
SPEAKER_0:  regional.

00:30:42,018 --> 00:30:48,030
SPEAKER_0:  geographic, you know, kind of political dimensions that I've seen in other places. I didn't see them at play in the same way.

00:30:48,578 --> 00:30:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  then as I do now.

00:30:50,594 --> 00:30:52,222
SPEAKER_1:  and you take a lot of pride.

00:30:52,578 --> 00:30:54,398
SPEAKER_1:  to this day of being not partisan.

00:30:56,194 --> 00:30:57,150
SPEAKER_1:  That said...

00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:58,974
SPEAKER_1:  So you served.

00:30:59,266 --> 00:30:59,934
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:31:00,738 --> 00:31:04,382
SPEAKER_1:  for the George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump administrations.

00:31:05,122 --> 00:31:06,718
SPEAKER_1:  always specializing.

00:31:07,522 --> 00:31:08,382
SPEAKER_1:  And uh...

00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:10,206
SPEAKER_1:  Eurasia and Russia.

00:31:11,618 --> 00:31:14,014
SPEAKER_1:  You were the top presidential advisor to president.

00:31:14,754 --> 00:31:19,006
SPEAKER_1:  former president Donald Trump on Russia and Europe, and famously,

00:31:19,298 --> 00:31:21,758
SPEAKER_1:  testified in his first impeachment trial.

00:31:22,274 --> 00:31:24,382
SPEAKER_1:  in 2019.

00:31:24,834 --> 00:31:25,374
SPEAKER_1:  saying

00:31:26,274 --> 00:31:30,750
SPEAKER_1:  I take great pride in the fact that I'm nonpartisan foreign policy expert.

00:31:31,426 --> 00:31:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  So.

00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,438
SPEAKER_1:  given that context.

00:31:33,762 --> 00:31:35,358
SPEAKER_1:  What does nonpartisan mean to you?

00:31:36,514 --> 00:31:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I mean, being very careful about not putting any kind of ideological lens on anything that I'm analyzing or looking at or saying about foreign policy, for one thing.

00:31:45,314 --> 00:31:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  but also not taking, you know, kind of one stance of one party over another either.

00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,454
SPEAKER_0:  To be honest, I've always found.

00:31:52,034 --> 00:31:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  American politics somewhat confounding.

00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:59,070
SPEAKER_0:  Because both the Democratic and the Republican Party are pretty big-tent, some of their coalitions.

00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  In Europe, it's actually kind of, in some respects, easier to navigate the parameters of political parties because you have quite clear platforms.

00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  There's also a longer history in many respects, obviously. There's a long history here in the United States of the development of the parties going back to the late 18th century.

00:32:16,546 --> 00:32:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  But in the United Kingdom, for example, in the 20th century, the development of the mass parties, it was quite easy to get a handle on.

00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:24,446
SPEAKER_0:  you know, at one point.

00:32:24,738 --> 00:32:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  in the UK, for example. The parties were real genuine mass parties with people who were properly members and took part in regular meetings and paid dues and...

00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it was easy to just kind of see what this stood for.

00:32:35,298 --> 00:32:40,318
SPEAKER_0:  And the same in Europe, you know, when you look at France and in Germany and Western Germany, of course.

00:32:40,642 --> 00:32:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  Italy and elsewhere.

00:32:42,306 --> 00:32:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  Here in the United States, it's kind of pretty amorphous.

00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  the fact that you could kind of register.

00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:55,294
SPEAKER_0:  randomly it seems to be a Democrat or Republican, like Trump did. At one point he's Democrat, next thing he's Republican, and then you kind of usurp a party apparatus.

00:32:55,522 --> 00:32:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  but you don't have to be, you're not vetted in any way. You're not kind of.

00:32:58,786 --> 00:33:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  They don't check you out to see if you have ideological coherence.

00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  You could have someone like Bernie Sanders on the other side, on the left.

00:33:06,434 --> 00:33:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  basically calling himself a socialist and running for the Democratic.

00:33:11,298 --> 00:33:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  presidential nomination.

00:33:13,442 --> 00:33:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  So, you know, kind of in many respects, parties.

00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  in the United States are much more loose movements.

00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:23,102
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's almost like an ala carte menu of different things.

00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:25,982
SPEAKER_0:  and that people can pick out.

00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  And it's more over time, as I've noticed.

00:33:29,442 --> 00:33:30,462
SPEAKER_0:  become.

00:33:30,818 --> 00:33:33,470
SPEAKER_0:  more like a kind of an affiliation even with a sporting team.

00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I get very shocked by the way that people say, I couldn't do this because that's my side.

00:33:38,754 --> 00:33:42,078
SPEAKER_0:  I couldn't do anything and I couldn't support someone for the other side. I mean, I have a

00:33:42,434 --> 00:33:45,438
SPEAKER_0:  a relative in my extended family here.

00:33:45,826 --> 00:33:50,014
SPEAKER_0:  who died in the war Republican.

00:33:50,466 --> 00:33:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  on a family holiday.

00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  was a book on their table.

00:33:54,274 --> 00:34:00,766
SPEAKER_0:  said a hundred reasons for voting for a Democrat. And I said, hey, are you thinking of shifting party affiliation? And I opened the book and it's blank.

00:34:01,186 --> 00:34:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  It was pretty funny. I had to laugh.

00:34:03,138 --> 00:34:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  I thought, well, there you go then.

00:34:04,898 --> 00:34:11,774
SPEAKER_0:  There's no way that people can pull themselves out of these frames. So for me, it's very important to have that independence of thought.

00:34:12,034 --> 00:34:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  I think you can be politically engaged on the issues.

00:34:15,842 --> 00:34:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  But, you know, basically without.

00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  taking a stance that's defined by some ideology or some sense of parties on affiliation.

00:34:25,986 --> 00:34:28,830
SPEAKER_1:  I think I tweeted about this, maybe not eloquently.

00:34:29,314 --> 00:34:32,478
SPEAKER_1:  in the statement, if I remember correctly, was something like monumental grandpa watching records. But, I guess, I mean, I guess house studied books,

00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:34,974
SPEAKER_1:  if you honestly can't.

00:34:35,266 --> 00:34:35,934
SPEAKER_1:  Find.

00:34:36,642 --> 00:34:40,574
SPEAKER_1:  a good thing that Donald Trump did or a good thing that Joe Biden did.

00:34:41,442 --> 00:34:42,270
SPEAKER_1:  You're not.

00:34:43,234 --> 00:34:43,806
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:34:44,034 --> 00:34:46,078
SPEAKER_1:  You're not thinking about ideas.

00:34:46,946 --> 00:34:51,102
SPEAKER_1:  you just picked the tribe. I mean it was more eloquent than that but it was um.

00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:56,126
SPEAKER_1:  is basically, this is a really good test to see are you actually thinking.

00:34:56,898 --> 00:35:01,150
SPEAKER_1:  about like how to solve problems versus like your red team or blue team.

00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,622
SPEAKER_1:  like a sporting team.

00:35:02,914 --> 00:35:03,486
SPEAKER_1:  Can you?

00:35:03,938 --> 00:35:04,734
SPEAKER_1:  find it.

00:35:05,282 --> 00:35:07,358
SPEAKER_1:  Good idea of Donald Trump's that you like.

00:35:08,098 --> 00:35:09,918
SPEAKER_1:  if you're somebody who is against Donald Trump.

00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:10,654
SPEAKER_1:  And like...

00:35:11,138 --> 00:35:14,238
SPEAKER_1:  Acknowledge it to yourself privately. Oh, that's a good idea.

00:35:14,594 --> 00:35:15,614
SPEAKER_1:  I'm glad he said that.

00:35:15,874 --> 00:35:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  Or he's even asking the right kinds of questions, which he often did actually. I mean, obviously put them in a way that most of us wouldn't have done.

00:35:22,626 --> 00:35:27,806
SPEAKER_0:  But there was often kind of questions about why is this happening? Why are we doing this? And we have to challenge ourselves all the time.

00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, actually, why are we doing that?

00:35:30,498 --> 00:35:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  And then you have to really inspect it and say whether it's actually worth continuing that way, or they should be doing something differently.

00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  Now here's a more kind of destructive quality to those kinds of questions.

00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  know, maybe it's the real estate developer in him that's taking a big wrecking ball to all of these kinds of

00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:48,126
SPEAKER_0:  you know, sacred edifices and things like that, but often.

00:35:48,418 --> 00:35:51,902
SPEAKER_0:  If you really pay attention, he was asking a valid set of questions.

00:35:52,194 --> 00:35:57,022
SPEAKER_0:  about why do we continue to do things like this. Now, we didn't often have answers about what he was gonna do in response.

00:35:57,346 --> 00:35:59,230
SPEAKER_0:  but those questions still had to be asked.

00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  and we shouldn't be just rejecting them.

00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  you know, out of turn.

00:36:03,138 --> 00:36:05,662
SPEAKER_1:  And you know, the, the, another strength.

00:36:06,242 --> 00:36:10,366
SPEAKER_1:  The thing that people often, that criticize Donald Trump, will say is a weakness.

00:36:10,722 --> 00:36:12,574
SPEAKER_1:  is this lack of...

00:36:12,866 --> 00:36:13,726
SPEAKER_1:  civility.

00:36:14,818 --> 00:36:15,774
SPEAKER_1:  can be a strength.

00:36:16,066 --> 00:36:19,198
SPEAKER_1:  because I feel like sometimes bureaucracy functions on.

00:36:19,618 --> 00:36:20,958
SPEAKER_1:  excessive civility.

00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:26,046
SPEAKER_1:  Like, actually I've seen this, it's not just, it's bureaucracy in all forms, like, um,

00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:29,150
SPEAKER_1:  in tech companies as they grow.

00:36:29,986 --> 00:36:33,566
SPEAKER_1:  everybody kind of, you know, you're getting pretty good salary. Everyone's.

00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,486
SPEAKER_1:  Everyone's comfortable.

00:36:35,746 --> 00:36:37,694
SPEAKER_1:  and there's a meeting and you discuss.

00:36:38,306 --> 00:36:40,158
SPEAKER_1:  how to move stuff forward.

00:36:40,578 --> 00:36:41,118
SPEAKER_1:  And like...

00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:43,934
SPEAKER_1:  You don't want to be the asshole in the room.

00:36:44,226 --> 00:36:45,246
SPEAKER_1:  that says what?

00:36:45,506 --> 00:36:48,318
SPEAKER_1:  This is why are we doing this this way? This is

00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:49,214
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:36:49,538 --> 00:36:52,670
SPEAKER_1:  This could be unethical. This is hurting the world.

00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,654
SPEAKER_1:  This is totally a dumb idea.

00:36:54,978 --> 00:37:03,678
SPEAKER_1:  Like, I mean, I could give specific examples that I have on my mind currently that are technical, but the point is oftentimes the person that's needed in that room is an asshole.

00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:05,726
SPEAKER_1:  That's why Steve Jobs worked.

00:37:05,986 --> 00:37:09,361
SPEAKER_1:  So you know a mosque works, you have to roll in. That's what first principles thinking looks like.

00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  The one bit when it doesn't work is when they start name calling.

00:37:12,738 --> 00:37:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of inciting violence against, you know, the people that they disagree with. So that was kind of your problem because I mean, often one, you know,

00:37:18,946 --> 00:37:20,670
SPEAKER_0:  when I was in the administration.

00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  I had all of Europe in my portfolio as well as Russia.

00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:28,414
SPEAKER_0:  And there were many times when we were dealing with our European colleagues where...

00:37:28,802 --> 00:37:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  He was asking some pretty valid questions about, well, why should we do this if you're doing that?

00:37:34,082 --> 00:37:38,814
SPEAKER_0:  For example, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, the United States has been opposed to...

00:37:39,106 --> 00:37:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  Europe's reliance on gas and oil exports from...

00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:45,054
SPEAKER_0:  Russia, you know, the Soviet Union since the 70s and 80s.

00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:53,790
SPEAKER_0:  And Trump kept pushing this idea about, so why are we spending so much money on NATO and NATO defense and we're all talking about this?

00:37:54,018 --> 00:37:55,102
SPEAKER_0:  If y'all then, you know.

00:37:55,522 --> 00:37:58,046
SPEAKER_0:  basically paying billions to Russia for gas.

00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:00,638
SPEAKER_0:  isn't this, you know, contradictory? Of course it was!

00:38:01,282 --> 00:38:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  But it was the way that he did it. And I actually, you know, one instance had a discussion with a European defense minister, who basically said to me, look, he's saying exactly the same things as people said before him, including, you know, former defense secretary Gates. It's just the way he says it.

00:38:17,506 --> 00:38:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  Mm-hmm.

00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  So they took offense and then as a result of that they wouldn't take action because they took offense at what he said.

00:38:22,978 --> 00:38:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  So it was a kind of then a way of.

00:38:24,834 --> 00:38:25,726
SPEAKER_0:  Could you find?

00:38:26,242 --> 00:38:27,454
SPEAKER_0:  some other means of.

00:38:29,026 --> 00:38:30,910
SPEAKER_0:  massaging this communication.

00:38:31,138 --> 00:38:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  to go and make it effective, which we would always try to focus on.

00:38:34,658 --> 00:38:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  because it's kind of the delivery.

00:38:37,698 --> 00:38:40,798
SPEAKER_0:  But the actual message was often spot on.

00:38:41,314 --> 00:38:44,062
SPEAKER_0:  in those kinds of issues. I mean, he was actually highlighting.

00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  these ridiculous discrepancies between what people said and what they actually did.

00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:53,662
SPEAKER_1:  And it's the delivery, the charisma in the room too.

00:38:54,178 --> 00:38:54,718
SPEAKER_1:  I'm also

00:38:55,138 --> 00:38:59,422
SPEAKER_1:  understanding the power of that of a leader. It's not just about what you do at a podium.

00:39:01,026 --> 00:39:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  in a room with advisors.

00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:05,749
SPEAKER_1:  how you talk about stuff, how you convince others.

00:39:05,749 --> 00:39:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  leaders. Yeah, you don't do it through gratuitous insults and incitement to violence. That's one of the things you just you don't get anywhere on that front. Well, it is possible.

00:39:14,562 --> 00:39:20,062
SPEAKER_0:  Tough measures and maximum pressure often though does work because there were, you know, often times where...

00:39:20,578 --> 00:39:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  You know that.

00:39:21,506 --> 00:39:22,558
SPEAKER_0:  kind of relentless.

00:39:22,978 --> 00:39:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  you know, nagging about something.

00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:27,230
SPEAKER_0:  constantly raising it. actually did have results but it hadn't.

00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:30,334
SPEAKER_0:  previously. Right. So there's, you know, the maximum pressure.

00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  if it kind of kept on it in the right way. And often when we were.

00:39:34,882 --> 00:39:37,054
SPEAKER_0:  coming in behind on pushing on issues.

00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  you know, related to NATO or, you know.

00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  other.

00:39:40,866 --> 00:39:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  things in this same sphere.

00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:43,614
SPEAKER_0:  It would actually...

00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  have an effect.

00:39:45,314 --> 00:39:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  It just doesn't get talked about because.

00:39:47,234 --> 00:39:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  it gets overshadowed by.

00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:54,302
SPEAKER_0:  all of the other stuff around this and the way that he interacted with people.

00:39:55,138 --> 00:39:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  cheated people.

00:39:57,186 --> 00:40:01,310
SPEAKER_1:  What was the heart, the key insights your testimony in that impeachment?

00:40:02,946 --> 00:40:04,830
SPEAKER_0:  Look, I think there is a straight line.

00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  between.

00:40:06,562 --> 00:40:08,222
SPEAKER_0:  that whole series of episodes.

00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,046
SPEAKER_0:  and the current warranty code.

00:40:10,882 --> 00:40:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  because Vladimir Putin and the people around him in the Kremlin.

00:40:14,722 --> 00:40:18,462
SPEAKER_0:  concluded that the US did not care one little bit about Ukraine and it was just a game.

00:40:19,362 --> 00:40:20,670
SPEAKER_0:  the trumpet was personal game.

00:40:21,058 --> 00:40:22,398
SPEAKER_0:  It was best to be trying to get.

00:40:22,818 --> 00:40:23,262
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

00:40:24,194 --> 00:40:26,526
SPEAKER_0:  Volodymyr Zelensky, did you have a personal favour?

00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:29,406
SPEAKER_0:  related to his desire to stay on and.

00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  and power.

00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  in the 2020 election.

00:40:33,602 --> 00:40:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  And generally they just thought that we were using Ukraine as some kind of proxy or some kind of

00:40:38,882 --> 00:40:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  instrument within our own domestic politics as that's what it looked like.

00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,222
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that he knows the result of that.

00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:45,950
SPEAKER_0:  Putin, you know.

00:40:48,034 --> 00:40:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  the idea aware that he could.

00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:53,790
SPEAKER_0:  you know, do whatever he wanted. We were constantly being asked, even prior to this, by-

00:40:54,242 --> 00:40:55,198
SPEAKER_0:  people around.

00:40:56,418 --> 00:40:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  uh

00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  Putin like.

00:40:58,626 --> 00:41:00,414
SPEAKER_0:  Nikolai Patrushev, the head of the national.

00:41:00,642 --> 00:41:05,918
SPEAKER_0:  you know, security council equivalent in Russia who we met with frequently. What's Ukraine to you? We don't get it.

00:41:06,146 --> 00:41:07,262
SPEAKER_0:  you know, why do you even care?

00:41:07,938 --> 00:41:10,558
SPEAKER_0:  So they thought that we weren't serious, that we weren't serious about.

00:41:10,786 --> 00:41:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  Ukraine's territorial integrity and its independence.

00:41:13,922 --> 00:41:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  or it is a national security player.

00:41:17,218 --> 00:41:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  Putin also thought that he could just manipulate.

00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:22,270
SPEAKER_0:  the political space in the United States actually could.

00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  because what he was doing was seeding.

00:41:25,218 --> 00:41:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  all this dissent.

00:41:27,266 --> 00:41:28,798
SPEAKER_0:  and fueling.

00:41:29,026 --> 00:41:36,254
SPEAKER_0:  you know, already in a debate inside of US politics, the kinds of things that we see just coming out now.

00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:39,774
SPEAKER_0:  this kind of idea that Ukraine was a burden, that Ukraine was...

00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  basically just trying to extract things.

00:41:42,658 --> 00:41:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  from the United States. The Ukraine had somehow played.

00:41:45,762 --> 00:41:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  inside of US politics.

00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  Trump was convinced that the Ukrainians had done something against him, that they had intervened in the elections.

00:41:52,898 --> 00:41:57,694
SPEAKER_0:  And that was kind of a combination of people around him trying to find an excuse to

00:41:57,986 --> 00:41:58,718
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of.

00:41:59,042 --> 00:42:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  what had happened in the election to kind of divert attention away from Russia's interference in 2016 and the Russians themselves.

00:42:05,826 --> 00:42:08,254
SPEAKER_0:  poisoning the world against Ukraine.

00:42:08,482 --> 00:42:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  So you had a kind of a confluence of circumstances there.

00:42:11,618 --> 00:42:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  and what I was trying to get across.

00:42:14,434 --> 00:42:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  in that testimony was the national security imperative of.

00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:23,806
SPEAKER_0:  basically getting our act together here and separating out what was going on in our domestic politics from

00:42:24,066 --> 00:42:26,942
SPEAKER_0:  what was happening in our national security and foreign policy.

00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I think we contributed.

00:42:29,698 --> 00:42:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  end up.

00:42:30,754 --> 00:42:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  whole mess around the impeachment, but this is the whole...

00:42:34,178 --> 00:42:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  parallel policies around Ukraine.

00:42:36,994 --> 00:42:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  to the war that we now have.

00:42:39,522 --> 00:42:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  them confronting.

00:42:40,514 --> 00:42:41,598
SPEAKER_1:  signaling.

00:42:41,858 --> 00:42:47,483
SPEAKER_1:  the value we place in peace and stability in that part of the world or the reverse by saying we don't care.

00:42:47,483 --> 00:42:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, we seemed to not care. It was just a game.

00:42:49,698 --> 00:42:52,446
SPEAKER_1:  But, I mean, the US role.

00:42:52,898 --> 00:42:58,078
SPEAKER_1:  in that war is very complicated one. That's one of the variables.

00:42:58,434 --> 00:42:59,294
SPEAKER_1:  Just...

00:42:59,714 --> 00:43:00,158
SPEAKER_1:  on that.

00:43:00,706 --> 00:43:01,534
SPEAKER_1:  testimony.

00:43:02,434 --> 00:43:03,166
SPEAKER_1:  Did it.

00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:07,518
SPEAKER_1:  in part break your heart that you had to testify.

00:43:08,258 --> 00:43:10,622
SPEAKER_1:  essentially against the president of the United States.

00:43:11,842 --> 00:43:13,086
SPEAKER_1:  Or is that not how you saw it?

00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think...

00:43:16,514 --> 00:43:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  I would describe it in that way.

00:43:18,626 --> 00:43:19,038
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

00:43:19,522 --> 00:43:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  what I was was deeply disappointed by what I saw.

00:43:23,554 --> 00:43:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  happening.

00:43:25,058 --> 00:43:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  the American...

00:43:27,298 --> 00:43:28,958
SPEAKER_0:  Political spurs? I didn't expect it.

00:43:29,634 --> 00:43:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  Look, I was a starry-eyed immigrant.

00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:39,518
SPEAKER_0:  I came to the United States with all of these expectations of what the place would be. I'd already been disabused of some of the...

00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  Let's just say Rosie.

00:43:42,146 --> 00:43:45,950
SPEAKER_0:  perspectives I held in the United States. I'd been shocked by...

00:43:46,274 --> 00:43:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  the depths.

00:43:47,394 --> 00:43:47,774
SPEAKER_0:  of.

00:43:49,538 --> 00:43:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  Racial.

00:43:51,138 --> 00:43:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, problems doesn't even sum up the problems we have in the United States. I mean, I couldn't get my head around it when I first came.

00:43:57,602 --> 00:43:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I'd read about.

00:43:58,882 --> 00:44:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  slavery in American history but I hadn't fully fathomed.

00:44:02,178 --> 00:44:04,574
SPEAKER_0:  and really the kind of the way that it was ripping apart.

00:44:04,802 --> 00:44:12,382
SPEAKER_0:  United States. I mean, I'd read Alex's talk full and he'd commented on this and it obviously hadn't kind of changed the way that one would have expected.

00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  all this time from the 18th century onwards.

00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  So that was kind of one thing that I realized, civil rights.

00:44:18,978 --> 00:44:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  movement and all of these acts of expansion of suffrage and everything else were imperfect at best.

00:44:25,154 --> 00:44:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  I was born in 1965, the same time as the Civil Rights Act. It was a heck of a long way still to go, so I wasn't...

00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  Let's just say.

00:44:31,618 --> 00:44:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  You know, as.

00:44:33,186 --> 00:44:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  starry-eyed about everything as I'd been before, but I really saw an incredible competence and professionalism in the US government, in the election system and the integrity of it

00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  And I mean, I really saw that. So the nicest was the gold standard for.

00:44:47,202 --> 00:44:52,510
SPEAKER_0:  you know, come to some of its institutions. I worked in the National Intelligence Council and I'd seen the way that the United States had...

00:44:52,962 --> 00:44:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  tried to address the problems that it did.

00:44:55,714 --> 00:44:58,334
SPEAKER_0:  it faced and it was just whole botched.

00:44:58,914 --> 00:45:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  analysis of Iraq and...

00:45:01,314 --> 00:45:02,878
SPEAKER_0:  a terrible strategic blunder of...

00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:04,734
SPEAKER_0:  Um, I'll just see.

00:45:05,058 --> 00:45:08,894
SPEAKER_0:  crime in my view of invading Iraq, but the way that people were trying to.

00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  to deal with that in the aftermath. I mean, I went into the National Intelligence Council and the DNI, the office of the Director of National Intelligence when they were coming to terms with what had gone wrong.

00:45:19,362 --> 00:45:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  in the whole analysis about Iraq in 2003.

00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  in the whole work of people trying to pull together after 9-11 to learn all of the lessons from all of this.

00:45:28,194 --> 00:45:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  And I saw, you know, just really genuine striving and deliberation about what had gone wrong, what lessons could we learn from this?

00:45:34,722 --> 00:45:35,742
SPEAKER_0:  And then suddenly...

00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  I found myself.

00:45:37,762 --> 00:45:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  in this.

00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  I couldn't really describe it in any words. It's totally crazy looking glass, thinking of Alice in Wonderland, as through the looking glass version.

00:45:45,346 --> 00:45:46,526
SPEAKER_0:  of American politics.

00:45:47,874 --> 00:45:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I'd seen everything starting to unravel over a kind of a period of time before I'd been asked to be in the administration, but I did not expect it to be that bad. I honestly didn't.

00:45:56,226 --> 00:45:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I'd been warned by people that...

00:45:58,434 --> 00:45:59,038
SPEAKER_0:  This was.

00:45:59,618 --> 00:46:01,534
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of really a very...

00:46:01,954 --> 00:46:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  serious turn that the United States had taken, but I really thought that national security...

00:46:06,594 --> 00:46:10,686
SPEAKER_0:  would still be uppermost in people's minds. And it was, I mean a lot of the people that I work with.

00:46:11,042 --> 00:46:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  But what I've found...

00:46:12,642 --> 00:46:13,982
SPEAKER_0:  if you want to use that.

00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:15,678
SPEAKER_0:  in a term of heart-breaking.

00:46:16,066 --> 00:46:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  was the way in which...

00:46:17,698 --> 00:46:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  all of these principles.

00:46:19,714 --> 00:46:20,862
SPEAKER_0:  that I'd...

00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  Really?

00:46:21,954 --> 00:46:30,366
SPEAKER_0:  bought into and tried to uphold in the United States government and then the things that we were trying to do with me and my colleagues was just being thrown out the window.

00:46:31,202 --> 00:46:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  and that I would have to step up.

00:46:33,762 --> 00:46:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  in defense of them and in defense of my colleagues who are being lambasted and criticized.

00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:41,598
SPEAKER_0:  given death threats for actually standing up and doing their own jobs.

00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:43,573
SPEAKER_1:  in particular on the topic of Ukraine.

00:46:43,573 --> 00:46:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  Not just on Ukraine, but on national security overall. So I mean, I'd gone through this whole period even before we got to that point.

00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  I'm seeing non-partisan.

00:46:52,418 --> 00:46:55,358
SPEAKER_0:  government officials being attacked from all sides.

00:46:55,586 --> 00:46:57,982
SPEAKER_0:  left and right, but especially the right.

00:46:58,466 --> 00:47:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  and being basically accused of being.

00:47:00,578 --> 00:47:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  Partisan hacks in a deep state.

00:47:03,106 --> 00:47:06,270
SPEAKER_0:  Coup plotters, you know, you name it.

00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  PEPCHISISM BING

00:47:08,578 --> 00:47:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  questions as well.

00:47:09,794 --> 00:47:14,814
SPEAKER_0:  And a lot of people I work with in government, like myself, naturalized Americans, a lot of them are immigrants, many were refugees.

00:47:15,266 --> 00:47:21,438
SPEAKER_0:  and many people had fought in wars on behalf of the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan being blown up and...

00:47:21,858 --> 00:47:24,478
SPEAKER_0:  you know, they put their lives on the line.

00:47:24,898 --> 00:47:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  They'd put their family lives on the line.

00:47:26,818 --> 00:47:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  because they believed in America.

00:47:28,642 --> 00:47:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  And they were just, they were reflections of.

00:47:30,754 --> 00:47:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  Americans from all kinds of walks of life. Here's what Breedy made.

00:47:34,658 --> 00:47:36,766
SPEAKER_0:  you know, that cliche of America great. It wasn't.

00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  whatever it was that was being bandied around in these crude, crass political terms.

00:47:41,794 --> 00:47:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  It was just the strength of an incredible set of people who've come together from all kinds of places and decided.

00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:48,638
SPEAKER_0:  but they're gonna make a go of it.

00:47:48,898 --> 00:47:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  and that they're going to.

00:47:50,114 --> 00:47:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  you know, try to work towards the whole.

00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  idea of the parable of the Constitution.

00:47:54,786 --> 00:48:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  towards a more perfect union. And I saw people doing that every single day, despite all of the things that they could criticize about the United States, still believing in what they were doing and believing in the promise of the country, which is what I felt like.

00:48:05,378 --> 00:48:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  And then here we were.

00:48:06,658 --> 00:48:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  People were just treating it like a game.

00:48:09,026 --> 00:48:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  and they were treating people like dirt.

00:48:11,394 --> 00:48:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  and they were just playing games with people's lives. We all had death threats.

00:48:14,946 --> 00:48:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  and people's, you know, whole careers.

00:48:17,346 --> 00:48:20,286
SPEAKER_0:  which were not just careers for their own self-aggrandizement, but for...

00:48:20,642 --> 00:48:22,846
SPEAKER_0:  Korea's a public service trying to give us something back.

00:48:23,362 --> 00:48:24,254
SPEAKER_0:  were being shattered.

00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  And I just thought to myself, I'm not gonna let that happen.

00:48:29,026 --> 00:48:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  Because, you know, I've come from a, well, are they going to send me back to Bishop Auckland in County Durham? Fine. I'm totally fine to go back, you know, because I could do something back there. But I'm not going to let this happen.

00:48:38,434 --> 00:48:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  I've made this choice to come to America. I'm all in.

00:48:41,346 --> 00:48:44,574
SPEAKER_0:  And these guys are just behaving like a bunch of idiots.

00:48:44,802 --> 00:48:47,427
SPEAKER_0:  and the ruining it, you know, the ruining it for everybody.

00:48:47,427 --> 00:48:48,382
SPEAKER_1:  no attacks on him.

00:48:48,706 --> 00:48:52,158
SPEAKER_1:  un-competent, hard-working, passionate people who have...

00:48:52,706 --> 00:48:54,302
SPEAKER_1:  love for what they do in their heart.

00:48:54,658 --> 00:48:56,126
SPEAKER_1:  Some more stuff I've seen.

00:48:56,802 --> 00:49:03,870
SPEAKER_1:  for virologists and biologists, colleagues, basically scientists in the time of COVID when there's a bunch of cynicism.

00:49:04,418 --> 00:49:04,990
SPEAKER_1:  And there was...

00:49:05,218 --> 00:49:11,427
SPEAKER_1:  just personal attacks, including death threats on people that work on viruses.

00:49:11,427 --> 00:49:18,750
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, and they're going around basically with protective gear on in case somebody shoots them in the street. That's just absurd.

00:49:19,362 --> 00:49:19,902
SPEAKER_1:  But...

00:49:21,026 --> 00:49:23,262
SPEAKER_1:  Let me zoom out from the individual people.

00:49:24,802 --> 00:49:29,246
SPEAKER_1:  and actually look at the situations that we saw in the.

00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:31,454
SPEAKER_1:  in the

00:49:32,674 --> 00:49:35,518
SPEAKER_1:  to George W. Bush, Obama and Donald Trump.

00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:36,862
SPEAKER_1:  presidencies.

00:49:37,666 --> 00:49:38,622
SPEAKER_1:  and I'd like to sort of.

00:49:38,882 --> 00:49:39,870
SPEAKER_1:  criticize

00:49:40,482 --> 00:49:41,022
SPEAKER_1:  each.

00:49:42,018 --> 00:49:42,654
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:49:43,202 --> 00:49:50,942
SPEAKER_1:  by not the treatment of individual people, but by the results. Right, yeah, I think that's fair. So if we look at George W. Bush...

00:49:51,202 --> 00:49:52,766
SPEAKER_1:  and maybe you can give me insights.

00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:56,510
SPEAKER_1:  This is what's fascinating to me, when you have extremely competent

00:49:57,666 --> 00:49:58,974
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, smart.

00:49:59,234 --> 00:50:00,190
SPEAKER_1:  hardworking.

00:50:00,738 --> 00:50:02,238
SPEAKER_1:  well-intentioned people.

00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:03,262
SPEAKER_1:  How do we?

00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:04,670
SPEAKER_1:  as a system.

00:50:05,346 --> 00:50:08,574
SPEAKER_1:  make mistakes in foreign policy.

00:50:08,834 --> 00:50:10,142
SPEAKER_1:  The big mistake.

00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:11,198
SPEAKER_1:  uh

00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,718
SPEAKER_1:  You can characterize in different ways, but in George W. Bush is.

00:50:15,106 --> 00:50:16,158
SPEAKER_1:  invading Iraq.

00:50:16,482 --> 00:50:17,918
SPEAKER_1:  Or maybe how.

00:50:18,146 --> 00:50:19,902
SPEAKER_1:  it was invaded or maybe how the

00:50:20,258 --> 00:50:22,654
SPEAKER_1:  decision process was made to invade it.

00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:24,734
SPEAKER_1:  Again, Afghanistan with the

00:50:25,986 --> 00:50:27,518
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe not the invasion, but...

00:50:27,874 --> 00:50:29,470
SPEAKER_1:  details around.

00:50:29,794 --> 00:50:31,230
SPEAKER_1:  like having a plan.

00:50:31,842 --> 00:50:34,334
SPEAKER_1:  about how to withdraw all that kind of stuff.

00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:36,062
SPEAKER_1:  Barack Obama

00:50:37,154 --> 00:50:38,878
SPEAKER_1:  to me similarly.

00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:40,926
SPEAKER_1:  is the man who...

00:50:41,154 --> 00:50:41,758
SPEAKER_1:  came.

00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:43,902
SPEAKER_1:  fame early on.

00:50:44,354 --> 00:50:45,822
SPEAKER_1:  for being somebody who's against.

00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:48,798
SPEAKER_1:  a rare voice against the invasion.

00:50:49,058 --> 00:50:50,334
SPEAKER_1:  of Iraq, which was actually a

00:50:50,786 --> 00:50:52,222
SPEAKER_1:  a brave thing to do.

00:50:52,514 --> 00:50:53,310
SPEAKER_1:  at that time.

00:50:54,562 --> 00:50:55,006
SPEAKER_1:  end.

00:50:55,522 --> 00:50:56,382
SPEAKER_1:  Nevertheless...

00:50:56,642 --> 00:50:59,166
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I don't know the numbers, but...

00:50:59,394 --> 00:51:00,574
SPEAKER_1:  I think he...

00:51:00,898 --> 00:51:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  I was the president for years over.

00:51:03,842 --> 00:51:11,070
SPEAKER_1:  increased drone attacks, everything from a foreign policy perspective.

00:51:11,554 --> 00:51:14,430
SPEAKER_1:  the military industrial complex.

00:51:14,786 --> 00:51:17,598
SPEAKER_1:  That machine grew in power under him.

00:51:17,922 --> 00:51:18,814
SPEAKER_1:  not shrunk.

00:51:19,522 --> 00:51:21,310
SPEAKER_1:  and did not withdraw.

00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:22,590
SPEAKER_1:  from.

00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:23,454
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, let's go.

00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:24,670
SPEAKER_1:  And then.

00:51:24,962 --> 00:51:25,438
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:26,462
SPEAKER_1:  with Donald Trump.

00:51:26,914 --> 00:51:29,310
SPEAKER_1:  the criticisms that you're presenting sort of.

00:51:29,762 --> 00:51:31,966
SPEAKER_1:  the personal attacks.

00:51:32,418 --> 00:51:34,494
SPEAKER_1:  the chaos, the partisanship.

00:51:35,106 --> 00:51:37,822
SPEAKER_1:  of people that are supposed to be nonpartisan.

00:51:38,146 --> 00:51:41,918
SPEAKER_1:  So if you took sort of the steel man, the chaos.

00:51:42,178 --> 00:51:46,750
SPEAKER_1:  to make the case for chaos, maybe we need to shake up the machine.

00:51:47,458 --> 00:51:51,006
SPEAKER_1:  throw a wrench into the engine, into the gears.

00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  and then every individual gear is going to be very upset with that.

00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:59,230
SPEAKER_1:  because it's the wrench, it's an inefficient process, but maybe leads.

00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:01,086
SPEAKER_1:  for government.

00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:06,014
SPEAKER_1:  it forces the system as a whole, not the individuals, but the system to reconsider.

00:52:06,402 --> 00:52:07,198
SPEAKER_1:  how things are done.

00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,758
SPEAKER_1:  So obviously all of those things.

00:52:10,658 --> 00:52:13,342
SPEAKER_1:  the actual results are not that impressive.

00:52:14,082 --> 00:52:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  You could have done that on the latter, you know, shaking things up because I'm all one for questioning and trying to shake things up as well and do things differently.

00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

00:52:21,698 --> 00:52:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  The question is if you bring the whole system down with nothing.

00:52:24,706 --> 00:52:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  ideas of putting it in a place like home.

00:52:26,882 --> 00:52:30,910
SPEAKER_0:  Like many people, I've studied the Bolshevik Revolution and many others as well and kind of.

00:52:31,426 --> 00:52:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  What's the pattern here that actually fits into what you're talking about here is a kind of rigidity of thought on the part of revolutionaries in many cases as well.

00:52:39,746 --> 00:52:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  and also narcissism.

00:52:41,762 --> 00:52:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  In fact, I think the text is pretty...

00:52:43,746 --> 00:52:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  strong sense of yourself, you know, kind of an only yourself to want to be president of the United States, for example, and we see that in

00:52:49,922 --> 00:52:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  Many of our presidents have been narcissists to different kind of degrees.

00:52:53,698 --> 00:52:58,014
SPEAKER_0:  You think about Lenin, for example, and people can go back and read about Lenin.

00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  He formed his views when he was about 18 and he never shook them off.

00:53:01,826 --> 00:53:02,878
SPEAKER_0:  He never evolved.

00:53:03,266 --> 00:53:05,694
SPEAKER_0:  He didn't have any kind of diversity of thought.

00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  and when systems go awry.

00:53:08,898 --> 00:53:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  It's when they don't bring in.

00:53:10,338 --> 00:53:11,422
SPEAKER_0:  different perspectives.

00:53:12,066 --> 00:53:12,606
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

00:53:12,962 --> 00:53:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  Trump, if you brought in different perspectives and actually listened to them and not just believed that he himself knew better than anyone else and then tried to divide everybody against each other, would have been a different matter.

00:53:21,762 --> 00:53:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  It's a tragedy of a completely and utterly lost set of opportunities because of the flaws.

00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:27,390
SPEAKER_0:  and his own nature.

00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  Because I mean, again, there was all kinds of things that he could have done to shake things up and so many people around him.

00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:36,990
SPEAKER_0:  remained completely disappointed. And of course he divided and pitted people against each other.

00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  in creating so much factualism.

00:53:39,298 --> 00:53:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  in American politics that people have forgotten they're Americans. They think that they're red or blue, you know, parts of teams.

00:53:45,666 --> 00:53:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  If you go back over history, that's a kind of a recipe for war and internal conflict.

00:53:50,754 --> 00:53:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  You go back to the Byzantine Empire, for example, there's the famous episode of the Nike riots.

00:53:56,674 --> 00:54:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  in Constantinople where the whole city gets trashed because the greens, the reds, the blues and these various sporting teams in the hippodrome.

00:54:06,498 --> 00:54:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  get whipped up by political forces and they pull the place apart. And that's, you know, kind of where we've been heading on some of these trajectories.

00:54:13,442 --> 00:54:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  But the other point is when you look back.

00:54:15,618 --> 00:54:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  Bush and Obama as well, there's a very narrow circle of decision making.

00:54:20,034 --> 00:54:22,974
SPEAKER_0:  you know, in Bush period, it's the focus on the executive branch.

00:54:23,266 --> 00:54:26,878
SPEAKER_0:  with Dick Cheney as the Vice President being very fixated on it.

00:54:27,362 --> 00:54:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  In Obama, it's he and the bright young things around him.

00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  you know, from he himself is, you know, kind of intellectually.

00:54:36,162 --> 00:54:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  You know, one might say arrogant in many respects, you know, he was a very smart guy.

00:54:41,026 --> 00:54:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  And, you know, he's...

00:54:42,082 --> 00:54:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  convinced that he has and he ruminates over a lot of things, but he's the person who makes a lot of decisions.

00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:48,350
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:54:48,706 --> 00:54:49,214
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:54:49,762 --> 00:54:56,286
SPEAKER_0:  Basically, George W. Bush used to call himself the decider as well, right? I mean, they're all the people who make the decisions. It's not always as consultative.

00:54:56,546 --> 00:54:59,710
SPEAKER_0:  as you might think it is. And for Trump, it's like, I'm not listening to anybody at all.

00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:03,742
SPEAKER_0:  It's just me and whatever it is that I'm walking up to today and I've decided to do.

00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  So I think the problem with all of our systems is why we don't get results because we don't draw.

00:55:08,546 --> 00:55:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  upon

00:55:09,378 --> 00:55:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  the diversity of opinion and all the ideas of people out there. You do that in science.

00:55:14,594 --> 00:55:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, all my friends and relatives are in science. They've got these incredible collaborations with people across the world. I mean, how did we get to these vaccines?

00:55:23,714 --> 00:55:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  for the COVID virus because of this incredible years of collaboration and of sharing results and sharing ideas and our whole system.

00:55:32,418 --> 00:55:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  has become ossified.

00:55:34,082 --> 00:55:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  We think about the congressional system, for example, as well, and there's this kind of rapid...

00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  you know, turnover that you have in Congress every two years, you know, there's no incentive for people, you know, basically to work with others that constantly campaigning.

00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  They're constantly trying to appeal to whatever their base is and they don't really care about.

00:55:50,402 --> 00:55:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  You know, some do, you know, of their constituents, but a lot of people don't.

00:55:54,242 --> 00:55:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  And the Senate, it's all kind of focused on the game of legislation.

00:55:59,042 --> 00:56:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  for so many people as well.

00:56:01,378 --> 00:56:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  focusing again on that kind of sense about what are we doing like scientists to kind of work together, you know, for the good of the country to push things along.

00:56:08,386 --> 00:56:11,102
SPEAKER_0:  and also our government also is siloed.

00:56:11,714 --> 00:56:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  there's not a lot of mechanisms for bringing people together. There ought to be, and things like the National Security Council, the National Intelligence Council actually did that quite successfully at times for analysis that I saw.

00:56:22,626 --> 00:56:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  But we don't have, we have it within the National Institutes of Health, but we saw the CDC break down on this, you know, kind of front.

00:56:29,634 --> 00:56:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  We don't have...

00:56:30,786 --> 00:56:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  sufficient to those institutions that bring people together from all kinds of different backgrounds

00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  and one of the other problems that we have with government.

00:56:38,114 --> 00:56:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  with the federal government.

00:56:39,842 --> 00:56:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  Over.

00:56:40,738 --> 00:56:45,534
SPEAKER_0:  state and local government, it's actually quite small. People think that the federal government's huge.

00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  because we've got postal service and the military that are part of it. But your actual...

00:56:50,082 --> 00:56:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  federal government employees is a very small number.

00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:57,694
SPEAKER_0:  And the senior executive service part of that is the older white guys, you know.

00:56:57,954 --> 00:57:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  kind of come up all the way over the last several decades.

00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:03,550
SPEAKER_0:  We have a really hard time bringing in younger people.

00:57:03,778 --> 00:57:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  into that kind of government service, unless they're political hacks, you know, and want to, you know, kind of.

00:57:08,546 --> 00:57:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  or they're kind of looking for power and sort of influence.

00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  We have a hard time getting people like yourself and other younger people kind of coming in.

00:57:16,674 --> 00:57:20,062
SPEAKER_0:  to make a career out of public service and also retaining them.

00:57:20,514 --> 00:57:21,022
SPEAKER_0:  because.

00:57:21,282 --> 00:57:22,238
SPEAKER_0:  you know, people.

00:57:22,754 --> 00:57:24,254
SPEAKER_0:  with incredible skills.

00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:30,942
SPEAKER_0:  often get poached away into the private sector. And, you know, one of the people that I work with on the national security side are now at...

00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:32,350
SPEAKER_0:  all kinds of.

00:57:32,642 --> 00:57:33,982
SPEAKER_0:  you know, high end.

00:57:34,402 --> 00:57:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  political consultancies or they've gone to Silicon Valley and they've gone to this place and that place.

00:57:40,386 --> 00:57:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  Because after a time as a younger person, they're not rising up particularly quickly because there's a pretty rigid way of looking at the...

00:57:47,106 --> 00:57:55,582
SPEAKER_0:  the hierarchies and the promotion schemes. And they're also getting lambasted by everybody. People like, ah, you know, public servants. They're not really public servants. There's this whole sentence that mesmo

00:57:55,842 --> 00:57:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  Luck

00:57:56,898 --> 00:57:57,598
SPEAKER_0:  and loss.

00:57:57,826 --> 00:58:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  of a kind of a faith in public service.

00:58:01,282 --> 00:58:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  And in the last few years, I've really done a lot of damage.

00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:05,982
SPEAKER_0:  We need to revitalize.

00:58:06,594 --> 00:58:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  our government system to get better results. We need to bring more people in, even if it's for a period of time, not just...

00:58:12,418 --> 00:58:12,862
SPEAKER_0:  through.

00:58:13,282 --> 00:58:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  expensive contracts for.

00:58:15,586 --> 00:58:18,974
SPEAKER_0:  the big consulting companies and other...

00:58:19,298 --> 00:58:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  entities that do government work out there, but getting people in for a period of time, responding to some of these.

00:58:25,282 --> 00:58:26,974
SPEAKER_0:  management fellowships and

00:58:27,362 --> 00:58:36,030
SPEAKER_0:  the White House fellows and bringing in scientists from the outside, giving that kind of opportunity police to help us solve the problem.

00:58:36,322 --> 00:58:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  that we see in other spheres.

00:58:37,826 --> 00:58:39,870
SPEAKER_1:  I think that's actually one of the biggest roles.

00:58:40,546 --> 00:58:41,790
SPEAKER_1:  for president that.

00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:44,446
SPEAKER_1:  for some reason during the election.

00:58:44,802 --> 00:58:45,982
SPEAKER_1:  That's never talked about.

00:58:46,434 --> 00:58:48,158
SPEAKER_1:  is how good are you at hiring?

00:58:48,514 --> 00:58:51,102
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. And in creating a culture of.

00:58:51,714 --> 00:58:52,222
SPEAKER_1:  bike.

00:58:52,706 --> 00:58:55,326
SPEAKER_1:  attracting the right, I mean basically chief hire.

00:58:55,586 --> 00:58:57,310
SPEAKER_1:  When you think of a CEO.

00:58:58,178 --> 00:59:00,126
SPEAKER_1:  like the great CEOs.

00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:01,054
SPEAKER_1:  are.

00:59:01,954 --> 00:59:05,086
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe people don't talk about it that often, but they do more.

00:59:05,474 --> 00:59:06,078
SPEAKER_1:  often.

00:59:06,498 --> 00:59:09,873
SPEAKER_1:  for CEOs and they do for presidents is like, how good are your building?

00:59:09,873 --> 00:59:15,806
SPEAKER_0:  Well, we make it really difficult because of the political process. I mean, and also because we have so many political appointments.

00:59:16,066 --> 00:59:19,998
SPEAKER_0:  We ought to have less, to be honest. I mean, if you look at other governments around the world...

00:59:20,226 --> 00:59:21,182
SPEAKER_0:  You know, they're just smaller.

00:59:21,634 --> 00:59:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  it's much easier for them to hire people in.

00:59:24,002 --> 00:59:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  You know, some of the most successful governments are much smaller.

00:59:26,722 --> 00:59:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  And it's not that I say that the government is necessarily too big, but it's just thinking about each unit in a different way. We shouldn't be having so many political appointments.

00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  We should kind of find more professional appointments, small lawn parties and appointments.

00:59:39,202 --> 00:59:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  because...

00:59:39,906 --> 00:59:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  every single administration that we've had over the last...

00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  let's say span of presidencies, they have jobs that are unfulfilled.

00:59:48,002 --> 00:59:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  because they can't get their candidates.

00:59:50,114 --> 00:59:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  through Congress.

00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  and the Senate.

00:59:52,578 --> 01:00:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  because of all the kind of political games that are being played. I know loads of people have just been held up because it's just on the whim of some member of Congress.

01:00:00,386 --> 01:00:03,070
SPEAKER_0:  even though that the actual position that they want is really technical.

01:00:04,034 --> 01:00:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  doesn't really care about what you know what

01:00:06,434 --> 01:00:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  political preference they particularly have. So I think we have to try to.

01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  Look!

01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  at the whole system of governments in the way that we would over, you know, other professional

01:00:16,834 --> 01:00:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  sectors.

01:00:17,794 --> 01:00:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  and to try to think about this as, just as you said there, that this is a government that's actually running our country.

01:00:23,522 --> 01:00:29,502
SPEAKER_0:  This is an operating system and you wouldn't operate it like that if you were looking at anything else.

01:00:29,858 --> 01:00:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  rational way. It shouldn't be so ideologically.

01:00:32,802 --> 01:00:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  or partisan-tented.

01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:38,718
SPEAKER_0:  So you're- At every level anyway. I'd actually just say make a bit for-

01:00:38,978 --> 01:00:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  a more non-partisan approach to a lot of the parts of government. You can still kind of bring in the political and premature.

01:00:44,994 --> 01:00:49,022
SPEAKER_0:  But also you have to explain to people writ large in America as well that this is your government.

01:00:49,506 --> 01:00:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  And that actually you could also be part of this, things like the Small Business Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, you know, all these kind of things that actually people...

01:00:57,954 --> 01:01:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  interact with but they don't even know it, the postal service, you know, all of these things.

01:01:01,538 --> 01:01:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, people actually, when you ask them.

01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:13,022
SPEAKER_0:  about different functions of government. They have a lot of support for it, the National Park Service, for example. It's just when you talk about government in an abstract way, like, oh, yeah, too much.

01:01:13,538 --> 01:01:19,454
SPEAKER_0:  bloated, not efficient and effective, but if you kind of bring it down more to the kind of local and federal levels.

01:01:19,906 --> 01:01:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  That's kind of, you know, when people really see it.

01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  if people could see kind of themselves reflected.

01:01:24,738 --> 01:01:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  and many of the people have gone into public service, I think that they would.

01:01:27,586 --> 01:01:29,461
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, there needs to be. Support for it.

01:01:29,461 --> 01:01:31,902
SPEAKER_1:  more like superstars like uh

01:01:32,994 --> 01:01:34,686
SPEAKER_1:  individuals that are like...

01:01:35,426 --> 01:01:37,886
SPEAKER_1:  Big on social media, big in the public eye.

01:01:38,402 --> 01:01:41,342
SPEAKER_1:  and having fun with it and showing cool stuff that it's not.

01:01:41,762 --> 01:01:43,582
SPEAKER_1:  Right now a lot of people see.

01:01:43,938 --> 01:01:44,702
SPEAKER_1:  government as

01:01:45,186 --> 01:01:46,590
SPEAKER_1:  basically partisan.

01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:48,158
SPEAKER_1:  warfare and then

01:01:49,762 --> 01:02:00,606
SPEAKER_1:  It just, it makes it unpleasant to do the job. It makes it uninspiring for people looking in from outside about what's going on, state government, all of it, the whole thing. But you are, you know.

01:02:01,922 --> 01:02:03,358
SPEAKER_1:  With all due respect, you're pretty-

01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:11,486
SPEAKER_1:  rare individual in terms of nonpartisanship. I did just actually your whole life story the the humbling aspect of.

01:02:12,066 --> 01:02:14,366
SPEAKER_1:  of your upbringing and everything like that.

01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:18,430
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think it's possible to have a lot of nonpartisan?

01:02:19,266 --> 01:02:20,126
SPEAKER_1:  experts.

01:02:20,482 --> 01:02:22,334
SPEAKER_1:  government. Like, can you be

01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:25,630
SPEAKER_1:  a top presidential advisor on Russia.

01:02:26,466 --> 01:02:27,582
SPEAKER_1:  for 10 years.

01:02:28,002 --> 01:02:29,246
SPEAKER_1:  for 15 years.

01:02:29,634 --> 01:02:31,230
SPEAKER_1:  and remain nonpartisan.

01:02:31,522 --> 01:02:36,743
SPEAKER_0:  I think you can. I don't think that's advisable, by the way, because I mean, I don't think anybody should be there. So you're forced to That's the right thing to do. Thank you.

01:02:36,743 --> 01:02:38,243
SPEAKER_1:  Advice is to fire yourself after.

01:02:38,243 --> 01:02:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  Well, you should definitely have term limits, just like you should in everything, right? I mean, it's just like tenure in university. Well, we all have term limits. Yeah, you kind of, you know, we do, we have natural term limits, but you know, you're kind of, you know, basically bottling it up for other people.

01:02:52,706 --> 01:02:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  I'm in out.

01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:54,846
SPEAKER_0:  You know, what I'm trying to do now, I'm not.

01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  57 now.

01:02:56,290 --> 01:02:58,334
SPEAKER_0:  And I always try to work with, you know.

01:02:58,626 --> 01:03:00,958
SPEAKER_0:  people from different generations to me, just like...

01:03:02,018 --> 01:03:04,638
SPEAKER_0:  I've really benefited from these kind of...

01:03:05,154 --> 01:03:09,246
SPEAKER_0:  mentorship of people older, you can mentor up and well and mentor down. I mean, I would.

01:03:09,506 --> 01:03:15,230
SPEAKER_0:  you know, try to get people from different backgrounds and different generations to work together in teams. Honestly, I'd like to more.

01:03:15,554 --> 01:03:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  team networked kind of approach to things. The kind of things that you get again in science, right?

01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:23,422
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, all these ideas are going to come from all kinds of different perspectives.

01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:25,982
SPEAKER_0:  Age and experience does count for something.

01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:29,918
SPEAKER_0:  but fresh ideas and coming in and looking at a problem from a different perspective.

01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  and seeing something that somebody else hasn't seen before.

01:03:33,122 --> 01:03:35,550
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I just kind of love working in a.

01:03:35,906 --> 01:03:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  an environment with.

01:03:37,282 --> 01:03:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  all kinds of different people and people who don't agree with you. You need people.

01:03:41,538 --> 01:03:46,878
SPEAKER_0:  take you on and say, absolute, that's crap. You know, kind of, where did you come up with that from? And they go, hang on.

01:03:47,426 --> 01:03:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  Well, explain to me why you think so. And then, you know, you have this kind of iterative process back and forth. I mean, I would always encourage my colleagues to tell me when they thought it was wrong.

01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:57,598
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, sometimes I didn't agree because I didn't see the...

01:03:57,826 --> 01:04:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  the reasoning, but other times they're right.

01:04:01,794 --> 01:04:11,454
SPEAKER_0:  You know, that was a complete mistake. I need to admit that and, you know, kind of, we need to figure out a different way of doing things. But the one point I do want to get across is there were a lot of people.

01:04:11,746 --> 01:04:19,006
SPEAKER_0:  who were non-partisan that I worked with. I mean, honestly, in most of the jobs that I had, up until more recently, I had no idea about people's political affiliation.

01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:22,590
SPEAKER_0:  It's just when you get into this kind of highly charged partisan environment...

01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  They kind of force people to make decisions.

01:04:26,242 --> 01:04:27,486
SPEAKER_0:  And when you have, you know, one...

01:04:27,938 --> 01:04:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  political party or political faction that's trying to usurp power, it does make it quite difficult.

01:04:32,354 --> 01:04:36,926
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, that's the situation that we're in right now. And we're seeing some of the things happen in the United States. We're seeing some of the things that we're seeing in the United States.

01:04:37,154 --> 01:04:39,774
SPEAKER_0:  and studied in other settings or seen for myself happening.

01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  You know, when you have...

01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  a president who wants to cling onto power.

01:04:45,506 --> 01:04:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  You know, you've gotta, you've gotta...

01:04:46,914 --> 01:04:47,646
SPEAKER_0:  Call it out.

01:04:48,194 --> 01:04:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  Is that a partisan act or is that a kind of defense of that larger?

01:04:52,738 --> 01:04:53,182
SPEAKER_0:  uh

01:04:53,442 --> 01:04:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  political system.

01:04:54,466 --> 01:04:55,998
SPEAKER_0:  that you're part of.

01:04:56,514 --> 01:04:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  So I think we've got to...

01:04:58,722 --> 01:04:59,742
SPEAKER_0:  recognize that

01:05:00,866 --> 01:05:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  Even if you're not partisan, you can be politically engaged.

01:05:04,002 --> 01:05:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  Sometimes you just have to stand up there and speak out, which is...

01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:17,694
SPEAKER_0:  what I did and what others did as well. None of those people who spoke out can initially saw that as a partisan act, even if some of them since then have decided to make political choices they hadn't made before.

01:05:17,986 --> 01:05:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  because the situation actually forced people into.

01:05:21,346 --> 01:05:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  taking sides, very hard to still stay above the fray when you've got, you know, someone who's trying to perpetrate a coup.

01:05:26,882 --> 01:05:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, just a link on that.

01:05:28,994 --> 01:05:30,366
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's hard.

01:05:30,722 --> 01:05:32,798
SPEAKER_1:  and it's the courageous thing to do.

01:05:33,282 --> 01:05:34,750
SPEAKER_1:  to criticize the president.

01:05:35,234 --> 01:05:35,998
SPEAKER_1:  and not

01:05:36,258 --> 01:05:38,270
SPEAKER_1:  fall into partisanship after.

01:05:38,658 --> 01:05:40,574
SPEAKER_1:  Because the whole world will assume.

01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:42,846
SPEAKER_1:  If you criticize Donald Trump.

01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:44,926
SPEAKER_1:  that you're clearly...

01:05:45,314 --> 01:05:46,078
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhh...

01:05:46,338 --> 01:05:47,198
SPEAKER_1:  a Democrat.

01:05:47,586 --> 01:05:48,574
SPEAKER_1:  And so they will.

01:05:49,794 --> 01:05:52,254
SPEAKER_1:  everybody will criticize you for being a Democrat.

01:05:52,642 --> 01:05:56,286
SPEAKER_1:  And then so you're now stuck in that. So you're going to just embrace that role.

01:05:56,610 --> 01:06:00,734
SPEAKER_1:  but to still walk the nonpartisan route after the criticism, that's the hard road.

01:06:01,218 --> 01:06:03,646
SPEAKER_1:  So not let the criticisms...

01:06:03,906 --> 01:06:05,566
SPEAKER_1:  break you into a.

01:06:07,074 --> 01:06:07,966
SPEAKER_1:  you know, in.

01:06:08,354 --> 01:06:10,979
SPEAKER_1:  into a certain kind of ideological set of...

01:06:10,979 --> 01:06:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, our political system needs revitalization. We need to be taking a long, hard look at ourselves here. And I think what people are calling out for, look, there's a vast swath of the population like me who are unaffiliated.

01:06:22,786 --> 01:06:25,310
SPEAKER_0:  you know, maybe some lean in one direction over another and...

01:06:25,666 --> 01:06:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  Unaffiliated doesn't mean you don't have views about things and political opinions and you know you

01:06:30,818 --> 01:06:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  I'm quite extreme on some of those.

01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:35,710
SPEAKER_0:  you know, by the, from a left or right perspective.

01:06:36,194 --> 01:06:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  What people are looking for is kind of an articulation.

01:06:39,202 --> 01:06:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  things in a clear way that they can get a handle on.

01:06:42,114 --> 01:06:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  and they're also looking for representation. Somebody's gonna be there for you.

01:06:46,818 --> 01:06:50,494
SPEAKER_0:  You're not part of a kind of a rigid team that you're excluded from, you're the ins and the outs.

01:06:50,818 --> 01:06:55,230
SPEAKER_0:  What people are looking at now, they're looking at that in the workplace because they're not finding that.

01:06:56,098 --> 01:06:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  in politics.

01:06:57,730 --> 01:07:04,606
SPEAKER_0:  you're actually getting workers pushing the people talk about the rise of the workers people just saying hang on a sec you know the most important

01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  space than I'm in right now.

01:07:06,914 --> 01:07:16,798
SPEAKER_0:  is my workplace because that's where my benefits are from. They're not coming from the state. I mean, that's a peculiarity of the United States system. You know, in Britain, you've got the National Health Service and you've got all the kind of national wide benefits.

01:07:17,154 --> 01:07:17,598
SPEAKER_0:  You know, you don't.

01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:22,334
SPEAKER_0:  tethered to your employer like you are in the United States. But here now we're asking people.

01:07:22,594 --> 01:07:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  You know, people are pushing.

01:07:24,418 --> 01:07:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  for more representation, they're asking to be represented within their workplace.

01:07:28,706 --> 01:07:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  be it Starbucks where various other Starbucks employees are trying to unionize.

01:07:34,306 --> 01:07:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  We have unions among our research assistants, the Brookings Institution where I am, you know, kind of teaching assistants and big universities doing the same kind of thing as well.

01:07:42,274 --> 01:07:43,838
SPEAKER_0:  because they won't have their voice heard.

01:07:44,066 --> 01:07:52,382
SPEAKER_0:  They want to kind of play a larger role and they want to have change. And they're often pushing their companies or the institutions they work for to make that change because they don't see it happening.

01:07:52,994 --> 01:07:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  in the political sphere.

01:07:55,298 --> 01:07:59,326
SPEAKER_0:  So it's not just enough to go out there and protest in the street, but if you want something to happen...

01:07:59,746 --> 01:08:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  That's why you're seeing big corporations playing a bigger role as well.

01:08:04,034 --> 01:08:05,246
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, and of course there's...

01:08:05,506 --> 01:08:11,358
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, this is a longer discussion is also criticisms of that mechanisms of unions to achieve.

01:08:11,938 --> 01:08:13,063
SPEAKER_1:  the giving of a voice.

01:08:13,063 --> 01:08:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  This goes back to my own experience.

01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  growing up in Northern England.

01:08:18,274 --> 01:08:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  The Durham Miners.

01:08:20,066 --> 01:08:22,302
SPEAKER_0:  that I was part of for generations.

01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:25,598
SPEAKER_0:  Posting my family not in the mines on my dad's side.

01:08:26,338 --> 01:08:26,814
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:08:27,426 --> 01:08:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  They created their own association. It wasn't a union per se at the very beginning. Later they became part of the National Miners Union. They lost their autonomy and independence as a result of that.

01:08:35,714 --> 01:08:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  But what they did was they pulled their resources.

01:08:38,146 --> 01:08:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  They set up their own parliament so they could all get together. Literally, they built a parliament.

01:08:41,858 --> 01:08:46,814
SPEAKER_0:  and it opened in the same time as World War I and where they all got together because they didn't have the vote, they didn't have

01:08:47,106 --> 01:08:48,766
SPEAKER_0:  suffrage at the time because they didn't have any money.

01:08:49,154 --> 01:08:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  so they couldn't pay the tax and they couldn't run for Parliament.

01:08:52,706 --> 01:08:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  And this is the kind of the origins of the organized labor parties later.

01:08:57,122 --> 01:09:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  but they create this association so they could talk about how they could deal with things of their own communities.

01:09:01,666 --> 01:09:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  and have a voice.

01:09:02,946 --> 01:09:04,254
SPEAKER_0:  in the things that mattered.

01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:08,254
SPEAKER_0:  you know, education, you know, improving their work conditions.

01:09:08,482 --> 01:09:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  It wasn't like what you think about some kind of like big political trade union with, you know, left-wing, you know, kind of ideas. In fact, they actually tried to root out later after the Bolshevik Revolution.

01:09:18,434 --> 01:09:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  in the Soviet Union, even when they were still having ties with players like the miners of Don Bass in the 1920s, Trotskyites and Leninists and communists.

01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:29,054
SPEAKER_0:  they were more focused on how to improve.

01:09:29,538 --> 01:09:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  their own.

01:09:30,562 --> 01:09:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  well-being.

01:09:31,874 --> 01:09:36,670
SPEAKER_0:  what they called the welfare, they had some welfare societies where they were kind of trying to think. linen cloth, everything that you make appears to be so fulfilled, but they didn't have

01:09:37,378 --> 01:09:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  boosters in Starbucks mods.

01:09:39,202 --> 01:09:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  or workers in Amazon.

01:09:40,578 --> 01:09:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  They're looking about their own wellbeing. It's not just about pay and work conditions, it's about...

01:09:44,546 --> 01:09:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  what it means to be part of this larger entity, because you're not feeling that same kind of connection.

01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:51,454
SPEAKER_0:  to politics.

01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  at the moment because you're being told by a representative, sorry I don't represent you because you didn't vote for me.

01:09:57,762 --> 01:10:00,926
SPEAKER_0:  If you're not a Democrat, you're not Republican, you're not red, you're not blue.

01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  You're not mine.

01:10:02,754 --> 01:10:05,694
SPEAKER_0:  And so people say, well, I'm in this work class. This is kind of my collective.

01:10:06,274 --> 01:10:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  This is therefore, this is what I'm going to have to try to push to make change.

01:10:10,658 --> 01:10:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  So this is kind of happening here and we have to.

01:10:13,282 --> 01:10:18,462
SPEAKER_0:  you know, realize that, you know, we've kind of gone and we're full circle back to that, you know, kind of period of the early...

01:10:18,818 --> 01:10:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  emergence of sort of mass labor and you know the way that

01:10:21,346 --> 01:10:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  That's where the political parties that we know today.

01:10:24,034 --> 01:10:27,550
SPEAKER_0:  and the kind of early unions came out of as well, this sort of feeling of.

01:10:27,842 --> 01:10:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  a mass society but where people weren't really.

01:10:30,754 --> 01:10:31,358
SPEAKER_0:  able to.

01:10:32,674 --> 01:10:35,614
SPEAKER_0:  get together and implement or push for change.

01:10:36,002 --> 01:10:36,382
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

01:10:36,674 --> 01:10:39,614
SPEAKER_1:  with unions at a small scale and a local scale.

01:10:40,034 --> 01:10:41,918
SPEAKER_1:  It's like every good idea.

01:10:42,562 --> 01:10:44,702
SPEAKER_1:  on a small scale can.

01:10:45,154 --> 01:10:50,942
SPEAKER_1:  become a bad idea on a large scale. Like, uh, marriage is a beautiful thing.

01:10:51,394 --> 01:11:00,030
SPEAKER_1:  but at a large scale, it becomes the marriage industrial complex that tries to make money off of it, combined with the lawyers that try to make money off the divorce.

01:11:00,578 --> 01:11:04,062
SPEAKER_1:  It just becomes this caricature of a thing.

01:11:04,418 --> 01:11:07,793
SPEAKER_1:  or like Christmas and the holidays. It's like.

01:11:07,793 --> 01:11:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  I don't disagree, but what I'm saying is people are basically looking for something here. This is why I myself start to think about much more local.

01:11:17,474 --> 01:11:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  kind of solutions to a lot of these kind of problems. So again, the team network approach.

01:11:23,266 --> 01:11:24,286
SPEAKER_1:  and the impeachment.

01:11:25,154 --> 01:11:25,886
SPEAKER_1:  Looking back.

01:11:26,114 --> 01:11:26,558
SPEAKER_1:  Excuse you.

01:11:27,138 --> 01:11:29,406
SPEAKER_1:  part of it, you get to experience it.

01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:31,774
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think they strengthen or weaken?

01:11:32,706 --> 01:11:33,342
SPEAKER_1:  this nation.

01:11:34,754 --> 01:11:35,710
SPEAKER_0:  I think it weakened.

01:11:36,066 --> 01:11:40,670
SPEAKER_0:  in many respects, just the way that it was conducted. I mean, there's a new book coming out by...

01:11:40,962 --> 01:11:43,614
SPEAKER_0:  Couple of journalists in the Washington Post haven't actually seen it yet, but...

01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  I really did kind of worry that.

01:11:46,786 --> 01:11:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  myself that.

01:11:48,290 --> 01:11:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  it became a spectacle.

01:11:51,650 --> 01:12:01,278
SPEAKER_0:  And although it actually, I think, in many respects was important in terms of an exercise of civic responsibility and, you know, give people a big massive lesson in civics.

01:12:01,506 --> 01:12:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  Everyone's kind of running out and looking up the whole process of impeachment and what that meant.

01:12:05,794 --> 01:12:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  congressional prerogatives I was as well. I was running off myself and trying to learn an enormous amount about it because I was in the middle of all of this.

01:12:14,306 --> 01:12:18,142
SPEAKER_0:  that it didn't ultimately show responsibility and accountability.

01:12:19,906 --> 01:12:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  and that in itself was kind of was weakened because

01:12:23,106 --> 01:12:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  on both sides there was a lot of parties on politics.

01:12:27,394 --> 01:12:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:31,422
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I think that there was a dereliction of duty.

01:12:31,778 --> 01:12:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  in many respects.

01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, especially I have to say on the part of Republican members of Congress, who were, you know, kind of, they should have been embracing.

01:12:40,546 --> 01:12:44,254
SPEAKER_0:  Congress's prerogatives. You could have kind of basically done this in a...

01:12:44,546 --> 01:12:47,038
SPEAKER_0:  in something of a different way. But the whole thing-

01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:49,214
SPEAKER_0:  is because it was this larger.

01:12:49,666 --> 01:12:50,526
SPEAKER_0:  atmosphere.

01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  of polarized.

01:12:52,738 --> 01:12:55,550
SPEAKER_0:  not even polarised but fractured politics.

01:12:55,874 --> 01:12:59,326
SPEAKER_0:  And I was deeply disappointed, I have to say, in many of the members.

01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  of Congress on the Republican side. I mean, there's a lot of grandstanding that I really didn't like a bit on the Democratic side either.

01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  and not admitting to mistakes and not addressing.

01:13:10,690 --> 01:13:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  head on, you know, the fact that they'd.

01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:19,326
SPEAKER_0:  kind of been pushing for Trump to be impeached and talking about being an illegitimate president kind of right from the very beginning.

01:13:19,586 --> 01:13:25,150
SPEAKER_0:  And as a result of that, a lot of people just saw this as kind of a continuation of political games.

01:13:25,538 --> 01:13:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  coming out of the...

01:13:27,362 --> 01:13:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  2016 election.

01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  But on the Republican side, it was just a game.

01:13:31,106 --> 01:13:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  There was people I knew who were...

01:13:33,218 --> 01:13:33,534
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

01:13:33,794 --> 01:13:35,966
SPEAKER_0:  Basically, at one point, one of them winked at me.

01:13:36,322 --> 01:13:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  Mm-hmm.

01:13:36,994 --> 01:13:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  you know, in the middle of this, you know, kind of impeachment, it's just like, don't take this personally. You know, this is, this is a game. And I just thought this isn't a game. And that's why I think that it, you know, kind of weakened because I mean, again, on the outside, it weakened us.

01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:56,030
SPEAKER_0:  The whole process we can do is in the eyes of the world, because again, the United States was the gold standard.

01:13:56,386 --> 01:14:00,510
SPEAKER_0:  And I do think, again, in terms of the larger population, although a lot of people...

01:14:00,866 --> 01:14:05,822
SPEAKER_0:  We did actually see the system standing up, trying to do something to help people at camp, but there still was that.

01:14:06,146 --> 01:14:07,358
SPEAKER_0:  element of circus.

01:14:07,618 --> 01:14:08,926
SPEAKER_0:  and a big political game.

01:14:09,186 --> 01:14:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  and people have been careless with the country.

01:14:11,458 --> 01:14:13,662
SPEAKER_1:  I do think that the Democrats...

01:14:14,498 --> 01:14:17,278
SPEAKER_1:  were the instigators of the circus.

01:14:17,826 --> 01:14:18,878
SPEAKER_1:  as a

01:14:19,842 --> 01:14:21,246
SPEAKER_1:  It's perhaps subtle.

01:14:21,794 --> 01:14:24,638
SPEAKER_1:  but there's a different way you talk about.

01:14:25,858 --> 01:14:28,478
SPEAKER_1:  issues or concerns about accountability.

01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:30,334
SPEAKER_1:  when you care about.

01:14:30,914 --> 01:14:34,846
SPEAKER_1:  your country when you love your country when you love the ideals and when you

01:14:35,362 --> 01:14:37,237
SPEAKER_1:  versus when you just want to

01:14:37,237 --> 01:14:43,582
SPEAKER_0:  win. And stick it to the other side. I agree. I mean, there were people who I actually thought

01:14:43,874 --> 01:14:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  Manage that?

01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  that made it about the country rather than about themselves. And there were others who did. I took to do that.

01:14:49,826 --> 01:14:51,646
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, there were a lot of others who did a lot of grandstanding.

01:14:52,802 --> 01:14:59,166
SPEAKER_0:  And that's another problem of our political incentive structures, that the kind of sense of accountability and responsibility tends to be.

01:14:59,394 --> 01:15:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  personal, you know, whether people decide to do it or not. It's not institutional.

01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:08,798
SPEAKER_0:  if that makes sense. We've had a kind of a breakdown of that kind of, that sense. Until then, thank you for watching and we'll see you next time.

01:15:09,282 --> 01:15:11,070
SPEAKER_0:  and I'm assuming that most of them did too.

01:15:11,490 --> 01:15:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I had to be sworn in.

01:15:13,122 --> 01:15:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  when I took those positions, I took that seriously, but I already took an oath of citizenship.

01:15:17,922 --> 01:15:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  There's, you know, presumably you did too, you know, you kind of.

01:15:21,538 --> 01:15:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  started to become an American citizen. It's not something you take unlikely.

01:15:25,218 --> 01:15:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  And, you know, that's why I felt this deep sense of responsibility all the time.

01:15:28,642 --> 01:15:32,286
SPEAKER_0:  which is why I went into the administration in the first place. I got a lot of flack for it.

01:15:32,866 --> 01:15:35,294
SPEAKER_0:  because I thought, well, look, I've been asked.

01:15:36,194 --> 01:15:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  and there's a real issue here after the Russian

01:15:39,298 --> 01:15:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  interference and the influence operation in the 2016 elections and I knew what was going on.

01:15:45,602 --> 01:15:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  and I should do something.

01:15:48,066 --> 01:15:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  If not me, then okay, someone else will go and do it, but can I live with myself just sitting on the sidelines and criticizing what people are doing?

01:15:55,906 --> 01:16:02,526
SPEAKER_0:  you know, and kind of, you know, worrying about this, or am I actually gonna muck in there and, you know, just go and do something? It's like seeing your house on fire.

01:16:02,786 --> 01:16:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  and you say that, you know, okay, this is pretty awful and dangerous, but I could go in there and do something.

01:16:07,906 --> 01:16:09,118
SPEAKER_1:  To clarify the...

01:16:09,346 --> 01:16:10,846
SPEAKER_1:  house on fire meaning.

01:16:11,362 --> 01:16:15,317
SPEAKER_1:  uh... the cyber war going on a cyber attacks

01:16:15,317 --> 01:16:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  Well in 2016, you know, when the Russians had interfered in the election.

01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:23,966
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, basically, this was a huge national security.

01:16:24,226 --> 01:16:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  prices.

01:16:25,154 --> 01:16:27,550
SPEAKER_0:  and our politics we'd gone mad as a result of it.

01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  and in fact we were making the situation worse.

01:16:30,850 --> 01:16:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  And I felt that I could, you know, kind of.

01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  at the time, maybe I could do something here. I could try to clarify, I could...

01:16:36,834 --> 01:16:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  you know, work with others who I knew in the government from previous stints in the government.

01:16:41,218 --> 01:16:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  to push back against this and try to make sure it didn't happen again. Look, and I also didn't have this.

01:16:46,082 --> 01:16:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  mad, crazy ideological view of Russia either. I mean, I knew the place, I knew the people had been studying it a long time and quite calm about it. I don't take it personally.

01:16:55,074 --> 01:16:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  It's not kind of an extension of self.

01:16:57,698 --> 01:17:03,262
SPEAKER_0:  It's something I've spent a long time trying to understand for myself, going back to that very beginning of why were the Russians trying to blow us up?

01:17:03,522 --> 01:17:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  There must be an explanation. There was, it was a very complicated and complex explanation. It wasn't as simple as-

01:17:08,738 --> 01:17:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  how it sounded.

01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:11,838
SPEAKER_0:  And also there's a long tail.

01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  to 2016.

01:17:14,050 --> 01:17:17,182
SPEAKER_0:  in a Putin's perceptions, the kind of things that he thought were going on.

01:17:17,698 --> 01:17:19,326
SPEAKER_0:  the whole way that...

01:17:20,354 --> 01:17:21,630
SPEAKER_0:  What they did was actually...

01:17:21,922 --> 01:17:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  fairly straightforward. They'd done this before in the Soviet period during the Cold War, classic influence operation. It just did.

01:17:28,834 --> 01:17:33,182
SPEAKER_0:  gone beyond the bounds of anything they could have anticipated because of social media and just

01:17:33,602 --> 01:17:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  a confluence of circumstances in the United States as well.

01:17:36,482 --> 01:17:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  We were very fragile and vulnerable.

01:17:38,594 --> 01:17:42,302
SPEAKER_0:  And I remember at one point having a discussion with the Russian ambassador.

01:17:43,106 --> 01:17:44,286
SPEAKER_0:  where, you know, we were.

01:17:44,674 --> 01:17:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  complaining about the Russian intervention, he said.

01:17:47,362 --> 01:17:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  Are you telling me that the United States is a banana republic, that it's so vulnerable to these kinds of efforts and you're actually like genuinely mystified?

01:17:54,818 --> 01:17:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  Although obviously it was probably part of a...

01:17:57,922 --> 01:17:59,134
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of political.

01:17:59,394 --> 01:18:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  schtick there, but he had a point.

01:18:01,858 --> 01:18:06,270
SPEAKER_0:  The United States had never been that vulnerable as it suddenly was in 2016.

01:18:06,754 --> 01:18:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  and in the time that I was in government.

01:18:09,474 --> 01:18:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  going back to what you asked about the whole impeachment and the...

01:18:12,578 --> 01:18:15,006
SPEAKER_0:  whole exercise in Congress.

01:18:16,098 --> 01:18:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  That vulnerability was as stark as it, you know.

01:18:19,458 --> 01:18:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  ever could be. Our domestic politics were...

01:18:22,434 --> 01:18:27,710
SPEAKER_0:  as much a part of the problem as anything else. They were the kindling to all of the fires. Putin didn't.

01:18:28,002 --> 01:18:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  start any of this.

01:18:29,506 --> 01:18:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  other kind of problems domestically just took advantage of them.

01:18:32,610 --> 01:18:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  And, you know, basically...

01:18:34,082 --> 01:18:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  added a bit of an accelerant here and there.

01:18:37,346 --> 01:18:40,894
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, the interference, I mean, that's a much longer discussion.

01:18:42,146 --> 01:18:45,758
SPEAKER_1:  because it's also for me, technically fascinating.

01:18:46,434 --> 01:18:53,694
SPEAKER_1:  I've been playing with the idea of just launching like a million bots, but they're doing just positive stuff and just being kind.

01:18:54,274 --> 01:19:05,149
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I was kind of wondering if it is possible to do something on this skill that's positive because you know a lot of people seem to be able to use all of this for pretty negative effect. I hope that you could do this use the same networks for positive.

01:19:05,149 --> 01:19:07,486
SPEAKER_1:  I think that's actually where a lot of the war

01:19:07,842 --> 01:19:09,854
SPEAKER_1:  I think from the original...

01:19:10,274 --> 01:19:11,582
SPEAKER_1:  hackers to today.

01:19:12,482 --> 01:19:15,934
SPEAKER_1:  what gives people like me and I think a lot of people that.

01:19:16,514 --> 01:19:19,646
SPEAKER_1:  in the hacking community pleasure is to do something difficult.

01:19:20,098 --> 01:19:21,502
SPEAKER_1:  Break through the systems.

01:19:22,210 --> 01:19:24,734
SPEAKER_1:  and do the ethical thing.

01:19:25,602 --> 01:19:26,814
SPEAKER_1:  So do the...

01:19:27,362 --> 01:19:27,870
SPEAKER_1:  Because...

01:19:28,194 --> 01:19:30,238
SPEAKER_1:  if there's something broken about the system.

01:19:30,498 --> 01:19:31,326
SPEAKER_1:  You want to...

01:19:31,554 --> 01:19:32,894
SPEAKER_1:  break through all the rules.

01:19:33,410 --> 01:19:36,318
SPEAKER_1:  and do something that you know in your heart is the right thing to do.

01:19:36,642 --> 01:19:40,542
SPEAKER_1:  And that's what Karen Schwartz did with releasing.

01:19:40,962 --> 01:19:42,686
SPEAKER_1:  journals and publications.

01:19:43,074 --> 01:19:49,470
SPEAKER_1:  that were behind paywalls to the public and got arrested for it and they committed. But to me it's fascinating because I.

01:19:49,730 --> 01:19:52,542
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe you can actually educate me, but...

01:19:53,570 --> 01:19:55,902
SPEAKER_1:  I felt that the Russian interference...

01:19:57,250 --> 01:20:01,534
SPEAKER_1:  in terms of social engineering, in terms of bots, all that kind of stuff.

01:20:02,178 --> 01:20:05,566
SPEAKER_1:  I feel like that was more used for political bickering.

01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:08,254
SPEAKER_1:  and to actually understand the national security problem.

01:20:08,674 --> 01:20:09,726
SPEAKER_1:  because...

01:20:10,466 --> 01:20:17,918
SPEAKER_1:  I would like to know the actual numbers involved in the influence. I would like to, I mean, obviously, hopefully people now understand that better.

01:20:18,338 --> 01:20:20,510
SPEAKER_1:  that are trying to defend the national security.

01:20:20,930 --> 01:20:23,390
SPEAKER_1:  of this country, but it just, it felt like.

01:20:24,130 --> 01:20:26,686
SPEAKER_1:  Like for example, if I launch one bot.

01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:28,446
SPEAKER_1:  And then.

01:20:28,930 --> 01:20:33,502
SPEAKER_1:  and then just contact somebody at the New York Times saying I launched this one bot they'll just say

01:20:33,858 --> 01:20:34,622
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhhh...

01:20:35,362 --> 01:20:37,470
SPEAKER_1:  MIT scientists.

01:20:37,762 --> 01:20:40,158
SPEAKER_1:  packs, you know, and then that

01:20:40,834 --> 01:20:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  And they'll spread. But that's exactly what happened.

01:20:43,554 --> 01:20:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  It was, you know, kind of, I think that...

01:20:45,346 --> 01:20:46,206
SPEAKER_0:  We're a Putin and-

01:20:46,434 --> 01:20:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  some of the people around him.

01:20:48,418 --> 01:20:49,342
SPEAKER_0:  Understood because

01:20:49,794 --> 01:20:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  again, propaganda state.

01:20:51,682 --> 01:20:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  They spend an awful lot of time thinking about how you, you know, basically put out your own content.

01:20:56,482 --> 01:20:58,078
SPEAKER_0:  and how you get maximum effect.

01:20:58,370 --> 01:21:02,878
SPEAKER_0:  through performance. Putin himself is a political pop performance artist.

01:21:03,298 --> 01:21:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, Trump understood exactly the same thing. So actually,

01:21:06,562 --> 01:21:15,582
SPEAKER_0:  operating in parallel, not in collusion, but in parallel. You know, basically Trump understood how to get lots of free air time, how to get himself at the center of attention.

01:21:16,066 --> 01:21:26,174
SPEAKER_0:  Putin did that through a less organic way. He had a lot of people working around him. I mean, that's the old Bolshevik agitprop and kind of then the whole Soviet propaganda machine.

01:21:26,786 --> 01:21:28,670
SPEAKER_0:  Putin kind of growing up in that kind of.

01:21:28,994 --> 01:21:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  environment and having the Kremlin press office and all the people around him, got kind of a massive machine.

01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  how did that work? I mean, they haven't done what the Chinese did in Russia of like blocking everything and having a big firewall. So it's kind of putting out lots of content, getting into the sort of center of attention.

01:21:45,058 --> 01:21:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  Trump's doing the same kind of thing.

01:21:47,106 --> 01:21:49,086
SPEAKER_0:  And the Russians understood that, you know, if you...

01:21:49,314 --> 01:21:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  a bit of things out there and then you call up New York Times and people are going to run with it.

01:21:53,890 --> 01:21:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  and what they wanted was the perception.

01:21:56,386 --> 01:22:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  that they had actually sweared the election. They loved it. This was the huge mistake of the Democrats and everything. I kept trying to push against this.

01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  No, they did not elect Donald Trump.

01:22:06,178 --> 01:22:07,134
SPEAKER_0:  Americans elected.

01:22:07,586 --> 01:22:10,238
SPEAKER_0:  Donald Trump and the electoral college.

01:22:10,562 --> 01:22:11,262
SPEAKER_0:  was a key part.

01:22:11,586 --> 01:22:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  Vladimir Putin didn't make that up.

01:22:13,666 --> 01:22:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  And basically I also remember at one point the...

01:22:18,594 --> 01:22:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  Russian ambassador.

01:22:20,066 --> 01:22:27,454
SPEAKER_0:  talking to me about when we were doing this standard, you know, here we are, we're lodging our complaints about the interference, you know, he basically said...

01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:30,046
SPEAKER_0:  or we didn't kind of invent.

01:22:30,402 --> 01:22:30,910
SPEAKER_0:  Call me.

01:22:31,202 --> 01:22:34,558
SPEAKER_0:  and basically the decision to reopen.

01:22:34,946 --> 01:22:36,446
SPEAKER_0:  you know, Hillary Clinton's emails.

01:22:36,802 --> 01:22:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  or Anthony Weiner and his...

01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:44,798
SPEAKER_0:  emails on his computer.

01:22:45,186 --> 01:22:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  Yep.

01:22:46,370 --> 01:22:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  He's right. I mean, you know, there were plenty of things in our own system.

01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:51,230
SPEAKER_0:  that created chaos.

01:22:51,650 --> 01:22:52,798
SPEAKER_0:  and tip the election.

01:22:53,282 --> 01:22:58,334
SPEAKER_0:  not kind of what the Russians did, but it's obviously easier to blame the Russians than blame yourself when

01:22:58,626 --> 01:23:02,718
SPEAKER_0:  you know, things are kind of all those random forces and those random factors.

01:23:03,010 --> 01:23:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  because people couldn't understand what had happened.

01:23:05,954 --> 01:23:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  in.

01:23:06,722 --> 01:23:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  2016, there was no hanging chats like 2000 where there was a technical...

01:23:12,386 --> 01:23:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  problem that actually ended up with the intervention of the Supreme Court.

01:23:16,610 --> 01:23:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  There was, you know, pure and simple, the electoral college at work.

01:23:20,034 --> 01:23:20,510
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:23:20,738 --> 01:23:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  a candidate that nobody expected, including the Republicans in the primaries.

01:23:25,346 --> 01:23:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  to end up getting elected or put forward in a different 2016, suddenly becoming the president.

01:23:31,714 --> 01:23:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  and they needed a meta explanation.

01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:39,902
SPEAKER_0:  It was much better to say Vladimir Putin had done it and Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin guys were like, oh my god, yeah, fantastic.

01:23:40,354 --> 01:23:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  Champagne cup.

01:23:41,378 --> 01:23:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  Pop-Corks popping, this is great, our Chaos Agent. They knew they hadn't done it, but they'd love to take credit for it.

01:23:47,010 --> 01:23:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  And so, you know, the very fact that other people couldn't explain these...

01:23:50,498 --> 01:23:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  complex dynamics themselves.

01:23:53,506 --> 01:23:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  especially dovetails beautifully.

01:23:55,298 --> 01:23:56,478
SPEAKER_0:  with Vladimir Putin's.

01:23:57,378 --> 01:23:57,758
SPEAKER_0:  uh

01:23:58,050 --> 01:24:00,542
SPEAKER_0:  attempts to be the kind of the crumbling, grumbling in the system.

01:24:01,186 --> 01:24:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  And he basically was taking advantage of that forevermore. And I wanted to basically try to...

01:24:06,786 --> 01:24:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  work with us to cut through that. And the thing is then, you know, people lost faith in the integrity of the election system because people were out there, you know, suggesting that the Russians had actually to start the elections, people written books about that. who said.

01:24:17,186 --> 01:24:20,606
SPEAKER_0:  you know, that they hacked the system when, you know, they were trying to hack our minds.

01:24:20,962 --> 01:24:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  But again...

01:24:21,858 --> 01:24:27,678
SPEAKER_0:  we were the fertile soul for this. I mean, we know this from Russian history, the Bolsheviks, you know, the whole.

01:24:28,354 --> 01:24:33,342
SPEAKER_0:  1920s and 1930s with Stalin, the fellow travelers and the socialist.

01:24:33,698 --> 01:24:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  you know, international. I mean, the Russians and the Soviets have been at this for years about kind of pulling, you know, kind of people along and into kind of a broader frame, but it didn't mean...

01:24:44,194 --> 01:24:45,918
SPEAKER_0:  that they were influencing.

01:24:46,274 --> 01:24:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  you know, directly the politics of...

01:24:49,154 --> 01:24:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  of countries writ large, there's plenty of interventions. It's just that we were somehow.

01:24:54,690 --> 01:24:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  It was a confluence of events, a perfect storm. We were somehow.

01:24:58,562 --> 01:25:01,086
SPEAKER_0:  exquisitely vulnerable because of things.

01:25:01,410 --> 01:25:02,334
SPEAKER_0:  that we had.

01:25:02,626 --> 01:25:07,102
SPEAKER_0:  done to ourselves. It was what Americans were doing to themselves that was the issue.

01:25:07,426 --> 01:25:08,990
SPEAKER_1:  That's the bigger threat.

01:25:09,506 --> 01:25:12,094
SPEAKER_1:  than large-scale bot armies.

01:25:13,282 --> 01:25:24,926
SPEAKER_0:  Those can be, obviously they do have an impact, but it's how people process information. It's kind of like the lack of critical thinking. I'm just not on the internet to that extent. I'd go looking for information. I'm not on social media.

01:25:25,474 --> 01:25:31,099
SPEAKER_0:  I'm into social media, but not by myself. I don't put myself out there. I haven't got a Twitter feed. I don't have a Twitter feed.

01:25:31,099 --> 01:25:33,863
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, but there is a.

01:25:33,863 --> 01:25:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  I have all kinds of strange things. It's Fiona Hill's cat, which I kind of like, you know, occasionally have people send things to me. You have so many fans, it's hilarious. But what I try to do is just be really critical. I mean, my mom sends me stuff and I'm like, what is this?

01:25:47,682 --> 01:25:49,214
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:25:49,474 --> 01:25:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  It's just, you know, your own mother can be as much of an agent of misinformation as, you know, kind of Vladimir Putin. Oh, yeah. We all, you know, kind of, we all have to really think.

01:25:59,138 --> 01:26:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  about what it is we're reading. There's one thing from my childhood that was...

01:26:02,306 --> 01:26:04,126
SPEAKER_0:  really important, I mean I always think every...

01:26:04,546 --> 01:26:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  KJN schools should have this.

01:26:06,178 --> 01:26:07,422
SPEAKER_0:  my next door neighbour.

01:26:07,778 --> 01:26:08,286
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:26:08,994 --> 01:26:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  who were was.

01:26:11,298 --> 01:26:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  He was actually very active in the Labour Party.

01:26:13,986 --> 01:26:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  And he was kind of really interested in the way that opinion.

01:26:17,826 --> 01:26:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  you know, shape people's political views. He was Welsh, he was a native Welsh speaker. So, you know, he was always trying to explore English and how, you know, there was kind of the reach of.

01:26:26,210 --> 01:26:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  You know what I think?

01:26:26,850 --> 01:26:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  English culture and how it was shaping the way that people thought. And he used to read every single newspaper.

01:26:32,514 --> 01:26:38,718
SPEAKER_0:  from all the different spectrums, which was quite easy to do back in the 70s and 80s because there weren't that many in the UK context.

01:26:39,042 --> 01:26:43,966
SPEAKER_0:  And every Sunday, he would get all the different Sunday papers from all the different kind of ideological vantage points.

01:26:44,322 --> 01:26:47,678
SPEAKER_0:  And then when I got to be a teenager, he'd invite me to look at them with him.

01:26:48,546 --> 01:26:51,070
SPEAKER_0:  Because he was my godfather and he was just an incredible guy.

01:26:51,426 --> 01:26:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  And he was just super interesting and culturally an outsider, always kind of looking in.

01:26:57,410 --> 01:27:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  And he basically ran through what the guardian looked at, the observer, the Daily Mail, the sun.

01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of all of these, you know, the telegraph.

01:27:05,346 --> 01:27:06,814
SPEAKER_0:  all of these newspapers and...

01:27:07,074 --> 01:27:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  how you could tell.

01:27:08,258 --> 01:27:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  you know, they're different vantage points.

01:27:10,594 --> 01:27:13,982
SPEAKER_0:  And of course, it's complicated to do that now. I mean, in this, you know.

01:27:14,242 --> 01:27:14,846
SPEAKER_0:  Fredably.

01:27:15,234 --> 01:27:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  extensive media space.

01:27:17,410 --> 01:27:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  I look at what it is that they're saying.

01:27:19,362 --> 01:27:20,254
SPEAKER_0:  And then I tried to.

01:27:20,546 --> 01:27:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  read around it and then look at what other people are saying and why they're saying it and who are they, what's their context.

01:27:26,882 --> 01:27:28,670
SPEAKER_0:  And that was kind of basically what I was taught to look at.

01:27:29,026 --> 01:27:30,622
SPEAKER_0:  And I think everybody should have that.

01:27:31,266 --> 01:27:36,030
SPEAKER_1:  And certainly that's something that people in politics that are in charge of.

01:27:36,290 --> 01:27:41,118
SPEAKER_1:  directing policy should be doing. They should be. They're not getting lost.

01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:44,286
SPEAKER_1:  in the sort of the hysteria.

01:27:44,610 --> 01:27:45,758
SPEAKER_1:  that can be created.

01:27:46,274 --> 01:27:50,942
SPEAKER_1:  It does seem that the American system somehow, not the political system, just humans.

01:27:51,362 --> 01:27:52,222
SPEAKER_1:  Love drama.

01:27:53,186 --> 01:27:54,270
SPEAKER_1:  Very good.

01:27:54,818 --> 01:27:58,462
SPEAKER_1:  like the Hunter Biden laptop story. There's always like.

01:27:59,010 --> 01:28:01,374
SPEAKER_1:  One, two, three stories, somehow.

01:28:01,762 --> 01:28:05,086
SPEAKER_1:  that we just pick that we're just gonna, this is the stuff we're gonna.

01:28:05,762 --> 01:28:06,494
SPEAKER_1:  fight about.

01:28:07,330 --> 01:28:08,455
SPEAKER_1:  for this election.

01:28:08,455 --> 01:28:11,455
SPEAKER_0:  And everyone's got an opinion on it. Everybody.

01:28:11,455 --> 01:28:14,494
SPEAKER_1:  and it's the most important like Hillary Clinton's emails.

01:28:14,786 --> 01:28:15,911
SPEAKER_1:  Russians hacked the election.

01:28:15,911 --> 01:28:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, we had John Podesta's pasta recipes for a while.

01:28:19,234 --> 01:28:23,359
SPEAKER_0:  that we were kind of all obsessing over. I don't know, people running out and trying them out, you know, something like that.

01:28:23,359 --> 01:28:26,974
SPEAKER_1:  And there's fun, I mean, there's all the best.

01:28:27,490 --> 01:28:33,201
SPEAKER_1:  conspiracy theories about Giuliani. There's I just love it. We just pick a random story. Sometimes it's ridiculous.

01:28:33,201 --> 01:28:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  And it detracts from what the larger question should be, which is about the family members of senior officials and whether they should be anywhere near any of the issues that they're

01:28:42,658 --> 01:28:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  You know, there's ethics, there's government ethics and things there.

01:28:45,506 --> 01:28:50,526
SPEAKER_0:  kind of across the board. But there's a bigger story in there, but that becomes a distraction. It's a luck over there.

01:28:51,074 --> 01:28:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the oldest trick in the book, you know, kind of idea.

01:28:54,850 --> 01:29:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, and politicians are really good at that because it detracts from the larger question because every single member of Congress and...

01:29:01,666 --> 01:29:04,958
SPEAKER_0:  you know, government officials, their family should be nowhere near anything they're doing.

01:29:06,018 --> 01:29:07,262
SPEAKER_1:  With that, I could-

01:29:07,650 --> 01:29:09,525
SPEAKER_1:  push back and disagree on. i-i mean

01:29:09,525 --> 01:29:17,854
SPEAKER_0:  Well, it depends on what they do, if they're making money out of it. You know, and kind of basically being in business is what I mean. You know, kind of this is an issue. So it's not, you know...

01:29:18,274 --> 01:29:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  Hunter Biden.

01:29:19,330 --> 01:29:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  on his own, it's kind of basically the kids of the Trump family, you name it.

01:29:25,154 --> 01:29:27,710
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, in general like that, I just think.

01:29:28,738 --> 01:29:31,742
SPEAKER_1:  It's funny, like, there's a lot of families that...

01:29:32,802 --> 01:29:36,350
SPEAKER_1:  You know, they work very closely together, do business together and it's very successful.

01:29:36,738 --> 01:29:38,590
SPEAKER_1:  I get very weird about that.

01:29:40,162 --> 01:29:41,598
SPEAKER_1:  It just feels like you're not.

01:29:41,826 --> 01:29:43,390
SPEAKER_1:  In fact, I don't even like hiring.

01:29:43,746 --> 01:29:45,214
SPEAKER_1:  or working with friends.

01:29:46,210 --> 01:29:48,835
SPEAKER_1:  Initially you make friends with the people you work

01:29:48,835 --> 01:29:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  That's right. No, I have the same worries as well because in the kind of clouds, you know, I would encourage, you know, my daughter to do something completely different.

01:29:57,154 --> 01:30:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  Right. Not going to the same field. It's different if you're-

01:30:00,386 --> 01:30:01,822
SPEAKER_0:  you know, in science or...

01:30:02,082 --> 01:30:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  mathematics or something like this and maybe you've got a family member, you're kind of building on some of their theories and ideas. If Albert Einstein had a...

01:30:10,338 --> 01:30:16,030
SPEAKER_0:  kind of an offspring who was in mathematics and took as far as thinking further. That would be very different.

01:30:16,482 --> 01:30:21,438
SPEAKER_0:  But if it's kind of you're in business and other things, then it's just, you know, it's the nepotism problem.

01:30:21,762 --> 01:30:22,887
SPEAKER_0:  that no one has there.

01:30:22,887 --> 01:30:23,637
SPEAKER_1:  That says that too.

01:30:23,637 --> 01:30:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  in a space of ideas. Yeah, that's what they do if they're not people aren't coming in and building on the ideas in a constructive way.

01:30:28,386 --> 01:30:29,374
SPEAKER_1:  Right, but even for...

01:30:29,794 --> 01:30:31,166
SPEAKER_1:  SON DAUGHTER WEINSTEIN

01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:31,838
SPEAKER_1:  You wanna.

01:30:32,066 --> 01:30:34,691
SPEAKER_1:  think outside the box of the previous.

01:30:34,691 --> 01:30:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  That's what I'm meaning, but they shouldn't be sort of told, no, sorry, you can't go and study math or whatever, physics, because of...

01:30:42,178 --> 01:30:47,198
SPEAKER_1:  But a lot of that you can't actually make it into law. Well, you could, I suppose, but honestly...

01:30:47,554 --> 01:30:51,299
SPEAKER_1:  If you do that kind of thing, you should be transparent. There should be just an honesty.

01:30:51,299 --> 01:30:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  It gets back to what I was talking about before, we need diversity of views and diversity of thinking and you can't have other things. It's just like being partisan or, you know, blah, blah, blah.

01:30:59,490 --> 01:31:00,670
SPEAKER_0:  rooting just for a team.

01:31:01,218 --> 01:31:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  if something is going to cloud your judgment.

01:31:03,810 --> 01:31:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  or constrain the way you think about things and become.

01:31:06,978 --> 01:31:08,222
SPEAKER_0:  kind of a barrier to...

01:31:08,546 --> 01:31:11,710
SPEAKER_0:  moving on out. Look, that's what we see in the system around Putin.

01:31:12,066 --> 01:31:14,206
SPEAKER_0:  It's kind of kleptocratic and it's...

01:31:14,434 --> 01:31:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it's filled with nepotism.

01:31:16,514 --> 01:31:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  all of the kind of like the people who you kind of see out there and prominent positions that the sons or daughters of.

01:31:22,018 --> 01:31:23,166
SPEAKER_0:  including Putin himself.

01:31:23,618 --> 01:31:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, that's when a system has degenerated.

01:31:26,146 --> 01:31:35,998
SPEAKER_0:  And that's kind of, and I suppose in a way, this is a symbol of the degeneration of the system, but again, it's just a diversion from, kind of the bigger issues and bigger implications of.

01:31:36,290 --> 01:31:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  things that we're discussing.

01:31:38,882 --> 01:31:40,126
SPEAKER_1:  So critics on the left.

01:31:40,482 --> 01:31:44,094
SPEAKER_1:  often use the straw man of TDS, charmathovenger syndrome major encephal arabic

01:31:46,370 --> 01:31:46,718
SPEAKER_1:  uh

01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:51,134
SPEAKER_1:  Why does Donald Trump arouse so much emotion in people?

01:31:52,546 --> 01:31:56,126
SPEAKER_0:  It's just the nature of the person. I mean, I don't feel particularly emotional about him.

01:31:56,610 --> 01:31:58,078
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, he's kind of a...

01:31:59,426 --> 01:32:01,630
SPEAKER_0:  He's a very flawed guy, to be honest.

01:32:02,082 --> 01:32:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  and this made me seem bizarre, I felt sorry for him.

01:32:04,578 --> 01:32:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  Because this guy is so vulnerable.

01:32:06,882 --> 01:32:07,550
SPEAKER_0:  So...

01:32:07,874 --> 01:32:09,054
SPEAKER_0:  wrapped up in himself?

01:32:11,074 --> 01:32:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, he's just exquisitely.

01:32:13,890 --> 01:32:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  open to manipulation. And I saw people taking advantage of him all the time. He has zero self-awareness.

01:32:20,258 --> 01:32:23,550
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I kept thinking to myself, my God, if this guy didn't have this entourage around him.

01:32:23,842 --> 01:32:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  How would he function?

01:32:25,858 --> 01:32:31,006
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I felt sorry for us as well. I mean, that he ended up being our president because that should not have happened. I mean, in terms of character.

01:32:31,490 --> 01:32:38,718
SPEAKER_0:  and in terms of fit for the job. Although I saw this kind of over a period of time, but I didn't feel kind of.

01:32:40,674 --> 01:32:41,182
SPEAKER_0:  any.

01:32:41,666 --> 01:32:41,982
SPEAKER_0:  bit of.

01:32:44,482 --> 01:32:50,590
SPEAKER_0:  sense of derangement, you know, kind of around him. He didn't drive me nuts in that way. I just became, I was just very worried about.

01:32:50,914 --> 01:32:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  the kind of the impact that he was having.

01:32:53,314 --> 01:32:55,189
SPEAKER_0:  on many particular issues.

01:32:55,189 --> 01:32:56,062
SPEAKER_1:  Here's the important

01:32:56,450 --> 01:32:59,390
SPEAKER_1:  So what I notice is people that criticize Donald Trump

01:33:01,026 --> 01:33:01,694
SPEAKER_1:  is.

01:33:02,242 --> 01:33:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  they get caught up.

01:33:03,810 --> 01:33:04,894
SPEAKER_1:  in the momentum of it.

01:33:05,314 --> 01:33:06,686
SPEAKER_1:  and they're unable to see.

01:33:07,426 --> 01:33:07,934
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

01:33:09,282 --> 01:33:12,286
SPEAKER_1:  First of all, let's start with some ground truth, which is.

01:33:13,506 --> 01:33:14,334
SPEAKER_1:  approximately.

01:33:15,106 --> 01:33:16,158
SPEAKER_1:  half the country.

01:33:16,770 --> 01:33:17,662
SPEAKER_1:  voted for the guy.

01:33:19,554 --> 01:33:20,510
SPEAKER_0:  and more voted.

01:33:20,802 --> 01:33:23,262
SPEAKER_0:  in 2020, then voted in 2016 for it.

01:33:24,386 --> 01:33:24,766
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:33:25,154 --> 01:33:28,529
SPEAKER_1:  I just feel like people don't load that in when they're.

01:33:28,529 --> 01:33:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  mère

01:33:30,818 --> 01:33:31,646
SPEAKER_0:  Didn't vote for it.

01:33:32,130 --> 01:33:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  him and his personality and often could because I know a lot of people who voted for him.

01:33:36,994 --> 01:33:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  first time and second time.

01:33:39,234 --> 01:33:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  and they could disassociate.

01:33:42,626 --> 01:33:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of the...

01:33:43,906 --> 01:33:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  all of the kind of features of Donald Trump that drives other people nuts from, you know, what they thought that an actual fact he could achieve in terms of, and it wasn't just this kind of sense about, well, I couldn't possibly vote for Democrats.

01:33:55,298 --> 01:33:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  Sometimes it's just like.

01:33:56,578 --> 01:33:57,694
SPEAKER_0:  Well, lucky sheik sings up.

01:33:58,082 --> 01:34:00,707
SPEAKER_0:  and we need things to be shaken up.

01:34:00,707 --> 01:34:03,707
SPEAKER_1:  Some people might have voted for a person out. See this one's friends

01:34:03,707 --> 01:34:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  Some of them did as well, but I'm just saying that not all of them did either. Well, we don't know their data. That's the thing. But yeah, I can't say how much it is. I'm just saying anecdotally, I know people have voted for him because he's him, from the charisma and others who voted.

01:34:16,226 --> 01:34:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  because he's shaking things up and he's keeping people.

01:34:19,938 --> 01:34:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  on their toes and...

01:34:21,890 --> 01:34:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of we need that idea.

01:34:24,546 --> 01:34:25,726
SPEAKER_1:  but the way to avoid...

01:34:26,082 --> 01:34:27,262
SPEAKER_1:  Trump DeRangement Syndrome.

01:34:28,034 --> 01:34:28,446
SPEAKER_1:  to me.

01:34:28,738 --> 01:34:31,710
SPEAKER_1:  Me as a doctor, I'm sort of prescribing to the patients.

01:34:32,258 --> 01:34:33,566
SPEAKER_1:  on this syndrome.

01:34:34,434 --> 01:34:35,710
SPEAKER_1:  this issue.

01:34:36,066 --> 01:34:38,270
SPEAKER_1:  is I feel like you have to empathize.

01:34:38,978 --> 01:34:42,014
SPEAKER_1:  with the people. You have to imagine your mind all the difference.

01:34:42,658 --> 01:34:43,454
SPEAKER_1:  like.

01:34:44,066 --> 01:34:44,958
SPEAKER_1:  Strengths.

01:34:45,666 --> 01:34:48,574
SPEAKER_1:  that the people who have voted for Donald Trump see.

01:34:49,474 --> 01:34:51,262
SPEAKER_1:  and really understand it.

01:34:51,650 --> 01:34:53,918
SPEAKER_1:  really feel it, like walk around with it.

01:34:54,498 --> 01:34:55,742
SPEAKER_1:  and then criticize.

01:34:57,186 --> 01:35:05,182
SPEAKER_1:  I just feel like people get lost in this bubble of criticism in their own head. I forget like the tribe you're in or whatever in their own head. They're not able to see.

01:35:05,506 --> 01:35:07,998
SPEAKER_1:  like half this country that we're a part of.

01:35:08,418 --> 01:35:09,534
SPEAKER_1:  Voters for the person.

01:35:09,762 --> 01:35:10,942
SPEAKER_1:  Same with Biden.

01:35:11,682 --> 01:35:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  Half the country voted for the guy.

01:35:13,890 --> 01:35:16,542
SPEAKER_1:  The people that are criticizing Biden and they're doing this.

01:35:17,090 --> 01:35:17,502
SPEAKER_1:  The way-

01:35:17,986 --> 01:35:19,518
SPEAKER_1:  Biden is currently criticized.

01:35:20,514 --> 01:35:22,750
SPEAKER_1:  is not based on policy.

01:35:24,002 --> 01:35:27,678
SPEAKER_1:  uh, is based on personal stuff, similar like the Trump.

01:35:27,874 --> 01:35:31,006
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I know it is. I mean, that's what people don't look. I think part of that is...

01:35:32,130 --> 01:35:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, first of all, I want to say I completely agree with you about understanding where people are coming from. I think it's very important for people to listen.

01:35:38,754 --> 01:35:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  to other people and their views. I try to do that all the time, try to learn from that.

01:35:42,626 --> 01:35:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, everybody's got a perspective and a context. We all live in a certain context. We're all living in history, our own personal histories.

01:35:49,794 --> 01:35:53,246
SPEAKER_0:  matter a lot and also the larger context and environment in which we're living in.

01:35:53,794 --> 01:35:54,718
SPEAKER_0:  and where we live.

01:35:55,266 --> 01:35:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  and who we live with.

01:35:56,514 --> 01:36:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  and the kinds of lives that we lead as well. Those are all extraordinarily important. I mean, I know that from myself. Everything that I've done in my life has been shaped by where I came from.

01:36:05,570 --> 01:36:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  who I was, my family, and the way that we looked at things. You can't take yourself out of that.

01:36:09,890 --> 01:36:21,022
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, you can do it in some, you know, like a science or something else, but you know, it's still your own views and maybe some of the ideas that you have in pursuing an experiment might have been shaped by your larger context, you know, depending on what it is that you work on.

01:36:21,378 --> 01:36:23,422
SPEAKER_0:  But the other thing is the nature of the political system.

01:36:24,738 --> 01:36:25,182
SPEAKER_0:  The.

01:36:25,570 --> 01:36:26,974
SPEAKER_0:  Presidential election is like...

01:36:28,098 --> 01:36:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  a personality contest, a beauty contest.

01:36:30,402 --> 01:36:33,598
SPEAKER_0:  It's like a kind of a referendum on one person or another.

01:36:34,370 --> 01:36:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  It's kind of like what we see in Russia on the sea with, you know, pooping on a pooping up.

01:36:37,730 --> 01:36:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  Putin and

01:36:38,530 --> 01:36:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  before.

01:36:39,586 --> 01:36:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  It's all about Putin and what do you think about Putin? It's all about—

01:36:43,202 --> 01:36:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  what the president should be doing.

01:36:44,994 --> 01:36:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  and you know kind of what their policies are.

01:36:47,106 --> 01:36:48,574
SPEAKER_0:  That's kind of the bizzare-ness.

01:36:49,026 --> 01:36:50,238
SPEAKER_0:  of the US.

01:36:50,690 --> 01:36:53,278
SPEAKER_0:  Look, we've just seen this happening in the United Kingdom.

01:36:53,698 --> 01:36:59,614
SPEAKER_0:  You've got this core of a couple of thousand, a couple of hundred thousand, rather, people in the Conservative Party have just voted for...

01:37:00,258 --> 01:37:00,638
SPEAKER_0:  free.

01:37:00,898 --> 01:37:01,246
SPEAKER_0:

01:37:01,666 --> 01:37:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  The lead is in a row.

01:37:03,042 --> 01:37:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  the rest of the country isn't and they're just looking at whether they like that personality and you know what they say to them rather than what they're necessarily going to do for the country.

01:37:11,170 --> 01:37:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, which is kind of pretty absurd. And again, the presidency is a weird...

01:37:15,970 --> 01:37:24,478
SPEAKER_0:  hybrid in the United States. You know, we were talking before about, it's the person who should be running the country, it's the chief executive or the prime minister in another setting, but we don't think of it like that.

01:37:25,154 --> 01:37:29,118
SPEAKER_0:  We often think about whether we like the guy or not, or we'd like to hang out with him or that.

01:37:29,410 --> 01:37:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  One of my younger relatives and I said, so why did you vote for Trump? He said, well, he was great. He was funny. I went to his rallies. I got, you know, all kind of charged up.

01:37:37,026 --> 01:37:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  And I said, could you see yourself voting for Biden? No, he's too old. Let somebody know he's only just a little bit.

01:37:41,698 --> 01:37:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of.

01:37:43,010 --> 01:37:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  older than Trump.

01:37:44,290 --> 01:37:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  always.

01:37:45,026 --> 01:37:49,822
SPEAKER_0:  the same age as your grandma. Do you think your grandma's old? Oh no, not at all. But it's just this kind of perception is boring.

01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  You know, so there's people are actually sometimes, you know, basically being.

01:37:54,114 --> 01:37:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of.

01:37:55,330 --> 01:38:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  motivated by just a feeling, you know, kind of that kind of sense, because that's the sort of nature of the

01:38:00,386 --> 01:38:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  the presidency. It's this kind of

01:38:02,498 --> 01:38:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  how you feel about yourself as an American, or how you feel about the country writ large, kind of the symbol of the state.

01:38:07,842 --> 01:38:11,326
SPEAKER_0:  Look, you know, in Britain you had Queen Elizabeth II and everybody.

01:38:11,714 --> 01:38:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  you know, seem to, for the most part.

01:38:13,858 --> 01:38:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  I guess, but most people respected her.

01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  as a person, as a personality, as a symbol of the state, even if they actually didn't really like it.

01:38:20,514 --> 01:38:21,790
SPEAKER_0:  the institution of the monarchy.

01:38:22,082 --> 01:38:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  There was something kind of about that.

01:38:24,002 --> 01:38:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  particular personality.

01:38:25,826 --> 01:38:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  that you were able to.

01:38:27,426 --> 01:38:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  you don't kind of relate to in that context. But I mean, the United States, we've got all of that rolled into one, the head of state, the symbol of the state, the kind of queen, the king, the kind of idea.

01:38:35,554 --> 01:38:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  the chief executive, the kind of prime ministerial role, and then the commander in chief of the military. It's all things kind of at once.

01:38:42,594 --> 01:38:48,958
SPEAKER_0:  But ultimately for a lot of people it's just how you feel about that person. Oh I couldn't cover up for them because of this or I couldn't cover up for them because of that.

01:38:49,442 --> 01:38:50,846
SPEAKER_0:  And in 2016...

01:38:51,650 --> 01:38:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  I know Hillary Clinton actually did win the election in terms of the popular vote.

01:38:55,298 --> 01:38:59,966
SPEAKER_0:  So it wasn't that people wouldn't vote for a woman. More people voted for her.

01:39:00,738 --> 01:39:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  on the popular level, not obviously through the electoral college and the electoral college vote so

01:39:05,794 --> 01:39:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  It wasn't just gender or something like that, but it was an awful lot of things for people.

01:39:10,306 --> 01:39:11,454
SPEAKER_0:  Trump attractive.

01:39:11,874 --> 01:39:12,318
SPEAKER_0:  Because he was-

01:39:12,578 --> 01:39:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  sticking up the big middle finger to the establishment.

01:39:15,202 --> 01:39:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  He's an anti-establishment change character. There was a lot of people voted for Barack Obama for the same reason and voted for Trump. We know that phenomenon. What was the 11, 12% of people?

01:39:24,866 --> 01:39:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  so they could vote for some completely, totally different, radically different people because that's that sense of change and charisma.

01:39:32,258 --> 01:39:36,030
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I had people who I knew voted for Trump, but would have voted for Obama again if he'd run again.

01:39:36,866 --> 01:39:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  because they've just...

01:39:38,466 --> 01:39:41,982
SPEAKER_0:  the way that he spoke, the way that, you know, because they said...

01:39:42,594 --> 01:39:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, this is all my own anecdotal things, doing about one of my relatives said, I could listen to Obama all day, every day. I just love the way he sounded. I love the way he looked. You know, I just like the whole thing about him. And then say about Trump, well, he was exciting. He was interesting. You know, he was kind of like, you know, whipping it up there.

01:39:57,410 --> 01:39:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  You know, so there's this, just this kind of feeling.

01:39:59,906 --> 01:40:02,718
SPEAKER_0:  We always say about, could you have a beer with this person?

01:40:03,170 --> 01:40:05,982
SPEAKER_0:  and people decide they couldn't have one with Hillary Clinton.

01:40:06,562 --> 01:40:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  and you know.

01:40:07,522 --> 01:40:08,862
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe they could go off and have one with-

01:40:09,378 --> 01:40:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  Barack Obama.

01:40:10,658 --> 01:40:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:40:11,618 --> 01:40:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  with Donald Trump.

01:40:13,698 --> 01:40:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  She's gonna have moment.

01:40:14,914 --> 01:40:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  Joe Biden, you know, for example.

01:40:16,674 --> 01:40:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  remember George W Bush didn't drink so he wouldn't have had a beer with him. He'd have gone out and got a soda or something with him.

01:40:22,050 --> 01:40:22,974
SPEAKER_0:  But you know, there's this...

01:40:23,522 --> 01:40:29,854
SPEAKER_0:  There's that kind of element of just that sort of personal connection in the way that the whole presidential...

01:40:30,114 --> 01:40:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  election is set up. It's less about the parties.

01:40:33,570 --> 01:40:36,094
SPEAKER_0:  It's less about the platform, it's more about the person.

01:40:37,634 --> 01:40:44,062
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, and picking one side and like sticking with your person. I really like a sport team. Yeah, it is.

01:40:44,866 --> 01:40:47,198
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think about Vladimir Putin?

01:40:47,618 --> 01:40:48,862
SPEAKER_1:  The man and the leader.

01:40:50,626 --> 01:40:52,350
SPEAKER_1:  Let's actually look at the full.

01:40:52,610 --> 01:40:58,206
SPEAKER_1:  You've written a lot about him, the recent Vladimir Putin and the full context of his life.

01:40:59,522 --> 01:41:00,094
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:41:00,610 --> 01:41:05,278
SPEAKER_1:  Let's zoom out and look at the last 20 plus years of his rule.

01:41:06,402 --> 01:41:08,830
SPEAKER_1:  In what ways has he been good for Russia?

01:41:09,314 --> 01:41:10,398
SPEAKER_1:  in what ways bad.

01:41:11,842 --> 01:41:13,758
SPEAKER_0:  Well, if you look to the first...

01:41:14,114 --> 01:41:15,038
SPEAKER_0:  couple of terms.

01:41:16,194 --> 01:41:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  of his presidency. I think, you know, on the...

01:41:18,562 --> 01:41:19,070
SPEAKER_0:  of.

01:41:19,778 --> 01:41:21,854
SPEAKER_0:  overall ledger, you would have actually said that he'd

01:41:22,786 --> 01:41:26,174
SPEAKER_0:  made a lot of achievements from Russia. Now there was of course the pretty

01:41:26,914 --> 01:41:31,806
SPEAKER_0:  black period of the war in Chechnya, but he didn't start that. That was Boris Yeltsin.

01:41:32,322 --> 01:41:34,110
SPEAKER_0:  That was obviously a pretty...

01:41:34,690 --> 01:41:35,390
SPEAKER_0:  catastrophic.

01:41:35,938 --> 01:41:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  event, but if you look at then other parts of the ledge of what Putin was doing.

01:41:40,866 --> 01:41:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  from the 2000s onwards.

01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  he stabilized the Russian economy.

01:41:46,466 --> 01:41:46,814
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

01:41:47,106 --> 01:41:48,958
SPEAKER_0:  brought back confidence.

01:41:49,506 --> 01:41:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  and the Russian economy and financial system.

01:41:52,834 --> 01:41:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  He built up a pretty impressive.

01:41:55,266 --> 01:41:56,382
SPEAKER_0:  team of technocrats.

01:41:56,770 --> 01:42:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  for everything from the central bank and the economics and finance ministries.

01:42:00,738 --> 01:42:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  who really got the country back into shape again and solvent.

01:42:05,570 --> 01:42:06,814
SPEAKER_0:  paid off all of the debts?

01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  and really started to...

01:42:09,826 --> 01:42:11,742
SPEAKER_0:  build the country back up again domestically.

01:42:12,578 --> 01:42:19,070
SPEAKER_0:  And the first couple of terms, again, putting Chechnya to one side, which was a little hard because I mean there was...

01:42:19,650 --> 01:42:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  a lot of atrocities and...

01:42:21,602 --> 01:42:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  I have to say that he was pretty involved in all of that because...

01:42:24,482 --> 01:42:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  the FSB which you'd had previously.

01:42:26,754 --> 01:42:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  it was in charge of wrapping up Chechnya and it created a very strange sort of system of fealty almost a feudal system.

01:42:34,498 --> 01:42:36,094
SPEAKER_0:  and the kind of relationship between.

01:42:36,482 --> 01:42:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  Putin at the top and Kadirov in Chechnya and there was quite a lot of distortions, you know, kind of as a result of that in the way that the Russian Federation was run.

01:42:43,650 --> 01:42:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  a lot more of an emphasis on the

01:42:45,730 --> 01:42:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  security services, for example, but there was a lot of pragmatism in opening up the country for business.

01:42:51,586 --> 01:42:54,494
SPEAKER_0:  you know, basically extending relationships.

01:42:55,074 --> 01:42:56,382
SPEAKER_0:  I would say that, you know.

01:42:56,898 --> 01:42:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  by the end of those.

01:42:58,530 --> 01:43:02,366
SPEAKER_0:  first couple of terms of Putin, Russians were living their best lives.

01:43:03,202 --> 01:43:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  But there was a lot of opportunity for people.

01:43:05,890 --> 01:43:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  uh... people's labor that was being

01:43:08,674 --> 01:43:13,022
SPEAKER_0:  paid for, they weren't being taxed, the taxes were coming out of the extractive industries.

01:43:13,826 --> 01:43:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  there was a sense of much more political pluralism.

01:43:18,146 --> 01:43:20,414
SPEAKER_0:  It wasn't the chaos of the Eltsin period.

01:43:21,218 --> 01:43:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  and then you see a shift.

01:43:23,106 --> 01:43:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  And it's pretty much when he comes back into power again.

01:43:26,530 --> 01:43:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  in 2011, 2012.

01:43:29,282 --> 01:43:31,902
SPEAKER_0:  And that's when we see a kind of a different phase emerging.

01:43:33,314 --> 01:43:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  And part of it is the larger international environment where Putin himself has become kind of convinced that the United States is out to get him.

01:43:42,018 --> 01:43:43,390
SPEAKER_0:  A part of it goes back to...

01:43:43,714 --> 01:43:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  the decision.

01:43:44,962 --> 01:43:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  on the part of the United States who invaded Iraq in 2003.

01:43:48,514 --> 01:43:53,278
SPEAKER_0:  There's also the recognition of Kosovo in 2008 and the whole kind of...

01:43:53,730 --> 01:43:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  machinations around all kinds of other issues of native expansion and elsewhere.

01:43:58,594 --> 01:44:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  Iraq in 2003 and this kind of whole idea after that that the United States is in the business of regime change.

01:44:04,674 --> 01:44:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  and perhaps has him in his crosshairs as well.

01:44:07,938 --> 01:44:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  But there's also then kind of, I think, a sense of building crisis.

01:44:11,906 --> 01:44:14,078
SPEAKER_0:  after the financial crisis.

01:44:14,530 --> 01:44:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  and the Great Recession.

01:44:16,226 --> 01:44:18,174
SPEAKER_0:  2008-2009 because

01:44:18,498 --> 01:44:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  I think Putin up until then believed in.

01:44:21,506 --> 01:44:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  the whole idea is a global financial system and that Russia was...

01:44:25,186 --> 01:44:25,726
SPEAKER_0:  Prospering.

01:44:26,178 --> 01:44:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  and that Russia, part of the G8, actually could be genuinely one of the major...

01:44:30,978 --> 01:44:32,510
SPEAKER_0:  economic and financial powers.

01:44:33,538 --> 01:44:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  And then suddenly he realizes that...

01:44:36,034 --> 01:44:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  in the West is incompetent.

01:44:38,050 --> 01:44:44,190
SPEAKER_0:  that we totally mismanaged the economy of our own, the financial crash in the United States. They're kind of blowing up of the...

01:44:44,514 --> 01:44:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  of the housing bubble.

01:44:46,978 --> 01:44:48,158
SPEAKER_0:  and that we were feckless.

01:44:48,898 --> 01:44:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  and that had global reverberations.

01:44:52,066 --> 01:44:54,846
SPEAKER_0:  And he's prime minister, of course, in this kind of period.

01:44:55,362 --> 01:44:59,870
SPEAKER_0:  But then, you know, I think that that kind of compels him to kind of come back into the presidency and try to kind of

01:45:00,226 --> 01:45:03,934
SPEAKER_0:  take things under control again in 2007, 2012 and after that...

01:45:04,322 --> 01:45:09,598
SPEAKER_0:  he goes into kind of a much more sort of focused role where he sees the United States as a bigger problem.

01:45:10,594 --> 01:45:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  And he also...

01:45:12,866 --> 01:45:14,110
SPEAKER_0:  and it starts to...

01:45:14,338 --> 01:45:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of focus on also the domestic environment because his return to the presidency is met by protests and he genuinely seems to believe, because again, this is very similar to...

01:45:25,090 --> 01:45:29,438
SPEAKER_0:  belief here in the United States that Donald Trump couldn't possibly be elected by Americans. So somehow it was some kind of.

01:45:29,698 --> 01:45:33,182
SPEAKER_0:  external interference because the Russians interfered and had an impact.

01:45:33,730 --> 01:45:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  Putin himself thinks at that time.

01:45:35,842 --> 01:45:43,166
SPEAKER_0:  one of the reasons why he interferes in our elections later, that the United States or another said interfere, because he knew that people weren't that thrilled about him coming back

01:45:43,458 --> 01:45:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  that kind of like the Medvedev period.

01:45:46,050 --> 01:45:50,078
SPEAKER_0:  and the protests in Moscow and St. Petersburg and other major cities.

01:45:50,530 --> 01:45:53,278
SPEAKER_0:  he starts to believe we're instigated by the West, by the outside.

01:45:54,050 --> 01:45:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  because of funding for...

01:45:56,034 --> 01:45:58,014
SPEAKER_0:  transparency in elections and

01:45:58,402 --> 01:45:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  in all of the...

01:45:59,586 --> 01:46:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  NGOs and others, you know, they're operating, State Department, Embassy funding.

01:46:04,162 --> 01:46:08,286
SPEAKER_0:  and the whole attitude of, God is back, kind of thing.

01:46:09,058 --> 01:46:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  And so after that, we see Putin going on.

01:46:11,298 --> 01:46:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  a very different footing.

01:46:12,706 --> 01:46:14,334
SPEAKER_0:  It's also somewhere in that period.

01:46:15,330 --> 01:46:18,654
SPEAKER_0:  2011-2012, we start to kind of obsess about Ukraine.

01:46:19,682 --> 01:46:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  And he's always, I think, been kind of steeped in that whole view of Russian history. I mean, I heard at that time I was in...

01:46:25,122 --> 01:46:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  I've written about this and many of the things that, you know, I've written about Putin.

01:46:28,642 --> 01:46:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  that in that same timeframe, I'm going to all these conferences in Russia where Putin is and

01:46:33,122 --> 01:46:37,150
SPEAKER_0:  Peskov, his press secretary, and they talk about him reading Russian history.

01:46:37,762 --> 01:46:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's this and this kind of period that he formulates this idea.

01:46:41,730 --> 01:46:42,174
SPEAKER_0:  off.

01:46:43,458 --> 01:46:44,318
SPEAKER_0:  the necessity.

01:46:44,994 --> 01:46:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  of reconstituting.

01:46:46,626 --> 01:46:48,190
SPEAKER_0:  the Russian world, the Russian Empire.

01:46:48,610 --> 01:46:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  He's obviously been very interested in this. He's always said, of course, that the collapse of the Soviet Union was the great catastrophe of the 20th century, but also the collapse of the Russian Empire before it.

01:46:56,962 --> 01:47:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  and he starts to be critical about Lenin and the Bolsheviks, and he starts to do all this talking about.

01:47:01,570 --> 01:47:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  Ukraine.

01:47:03,202 --> 01:47:03,678
SPEAKER_0:  us.

01:47:04,962 --> 01:47:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  same country.

01:47:05,922 --> 01:47:07,678
SPEAKER_0:  Ukrainians and Russians being one and the same.

01:47:08,066 --> 01:47:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  This is where the ledger flips, because the initial question you asked me is about has Putin been good for...

01:47:13,442 --> 01:47:14,206
SPEAKER_0:  Russia or not.

01:47:14,498 --> 01:47:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  This is where we get into the.

01:47:16,066 --> 01:47:17,438
SPEAKER_0:  focal point of.

01:47:18,082 --> 01:47:22,014
SPEAKER_0:  or the point where he's not focusing on the prosperity and stability.

01:47:22,338 --> 01:47:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  and future of Russia.

01:47:23,906 --> 01:47:25,726
SPEAKER_0:  but he starts to obsess about the past.

01:47:26,914 --> 01:47:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  and you can start to take things in a very different direction.

01:47:30,434 --> 01:47:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  he starts to clamp it down at home because of...

01:47:33,026 --> 01:47:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  the rise of opposition.

01:47:35,106 --> 01:47:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  and the fact that he knows that his.

01:47:38,242 --> 01:47:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  Brand is not the same as it was before and his popularity is not the same as it was before because he's already gone over that.

01:47:44,802 --> 01:47:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  You know, that period in...

01:47:46,818 --> 01:47:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  anybody's professional and political life that if you stay around long enough, people get a bit sick of you.

01:47:52,226 --> 01:47:57,406
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we've talked about that before, should you stay in any job for a long period of time you need refreshing.

01:47:57,826 --> 01:48:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  And you know, kind of Putin is starting to look like he's gonna be there forever and people are not happy about that.

01:48:03,490 --> 01:48:09,246
SPEAKER_0:  and would like another chance as well to kind of move on and move up and, you know, with him in southern place that's not going to be.

01:48:09,474 --> 01:48:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  particularly possible.

01:48:11,106 --> 01:48:15,390
SPEAKER_0:  And that, you know, it's around the time when he starts to make the decision of annexing Crimea. And that's when...

01:48:15,842 --> 01:48:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  the whole thing flips in my view.

01:48:18,114 --> 01:48:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  The annexation of Crimea in 2014.

01:48:20,898 --> 01:48:22,078
SPEAKER_0:  is the beginning of the end.

01:48:22,786 --> 01:48:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  of Vladimir Putin.

01:48:24,738 --> 01:48:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  Bing.

01:48:25,474 --> 01:48:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  positive.

01:48:26,530 --> 01:48:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  within Russia.

01:48:28,002 --> 01:48:28,702
SPEAKER_0:  because if you...

01:48:29,442 --> 01:48:31,006
SPEAKER_0:  pay very close attention.

01:48:31,746 --> 01:48:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  too.

01:48:32,866 --> 01:48:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  his speech on the annexation.

01:48:35,458 --> 01:48:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  of Crimea.

01:48:37,474 --> 01:48:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  In March of 2014, you see all of the foreshadowing of where we are now.

01:48:41,698 --> 01:48:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  It's already of kind of his view of kind of his obsessions, his historical obsessions, his view of himself has been kind of fused with the state, to kind of a modern za.

01:48:49,858 --> 01:48:52,798
SPEAKER_0:  and his idea that the West is up to get him it becomes after that.

01:48:53,090 --> 01:48:55,198
SPEAKER_0:  almost a kind of like a messianic mission.

01:48:55,682 --> 01:48:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  you know, to turn things in a different direction.

01:48:58,338 --> 01:48:59,582
SPEAKER_1:  and who are.

01:49:00,418 --> 01:49:01,438
SPEAKER_1:  to keep people.

01:49:02,306 --> 01:49:03,838
SPEAKER_1:  to you in this.

01:49:04,866 --> 01:49:05,694
SPEAKER_1:  Evolution

01:49:06,210 --> 01:49:09,822
SPEAKER_1:  of the human being of the leader is a Petrushchev.

01:49:10,210 --> 01:49:14,942
SPEAKER_1:  Is it Shoygu, the Minister of Defense? Is it, like you mentioned, Pascal, the press secretary?

01:49:15,330 --> 01:49:18,494
SPEAKER_1:  What role does some of the others like Lavrov play?

01:49:19,266 --> 01:49:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's more rooted in the larger context. I mean, individuals matter in that context, so it's just kind of like this shared worldview.

01:49:25,474 --> 01:49:30,654
SPEAKER_0:  And if you go back to the early 1990s, immediately after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and Yeltsin, you know, and-

01:49:31,554 --> 01:49:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  the ice...

01:49:33,282 --> 01:49:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  come to parts of Ukraine, Belarus, pull it apart, there was an awful lot of people who...

01:49:37,346 --> 01:49:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  wanted to maintain the Soviet Union, not just Putin.

01:49:40,578 --> 01:49:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  I mean you remember after Gorbachev tried to have the new union treaty.

01:49:45,026 --> 01:49:46,334
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:49:46,562 --> 01:49:55,070
SPEAKER_0:  1991 and there was the emergency committee set up the coup against Gorbachev. It was because they were worried he was going too far and unraveling the union then.

01:49:55,330 --> 01:49:57,790
SPEAKER_0:  as well. They were opposed to his reforms.

01:49:58,210 --> 01:50:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  There's always been a kind of a very strong.

01:50:00,610 --> 01:50:03,934
SPEAKER_0:  nationalist contingent that become Russian nationalists over time rather than...

01:50:04,290 --> 01:50:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  Soviet.

01:50:05,346 --> 01:50:06,398
SPEAKER_0:  you know, hardliners.

01:50:06,946 --> 01:50:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  who basically want to maintain the empire, the union in some form.

01:50:11,650 --> 01:50:19,326
SPEAKER_0:  And in the very early part of the 1990s, there was a lot of pressure put on Ukraine and all the other former Soviet republics, now independent states.

01:50:19,714 --> 01:50:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  by people around, you know, Mayor Lushkov, for example, in Moscow.

01:50:23,938 --> 01:50:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  by other forces in the Russian Duma, not just Vladimir Zhirinovsky and others, but really serious.

01:50:30,530 --> 01:50:35,550
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of what we would call him, like right-wing, you know, nationalist forces.

01:50:35,906 --> 01:50:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  You know, pervasive.

01:50:37,154 --> 01:50:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  in the system.

01:50:38,402 --> 01:50:42,654
SPEAKER_0:  And it's especially pervasive in the KGB and in the security sector.

01:50:42,946 --> 01:50:44,862
SPEAKER_0:  And that's where Putin comes out of.

01:50:45,346 --> 01:50:46,494
SPEAKER_0:  Remember Putin also.

01:50:46,786 --> 01:50:50,046
SPEAKER_0:  was of the opinion that one of the biggest mistakes the Bolsheviks made was...

01:50:50,658 --> 01:50:52,766
SPEAKER_0:  getting rid of the Orthodox Church.

01:50:53,282 --> 01:50:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  as an instrument of the state.

01:50:55,458 --> 01:51:02,526
SPEAKER_0:  And so there's this kind of restorationist wing within the security services and the state apparatus that want to kind of bring back.

01:51:03,010 --> 01:51:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  Russian orthodoxy is a state instrument, an instrument of state power.

01:51:07,074 --> 01:51:11,262
SPEAKER_0:  and who were kind of looking all the time about strengthening the state.

01:51:11,650 --> 01:51:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  the executive, the presidency.

01:51:14,754 --> 01:51:17,246
SPEAKER_0:  And so it's everybody who takes part in that.

01:51:17,826 --> 01:51:19,646
SPEAKER_0:  And it's also where there's more power, honestly.

01:51:19,874 --> 01:51:25,822
SPEAKER_0:  and they see Putin as their vehicle for power. I think for people like Sergey Karyanko, a new Karyanko back in the 90s.

01:51:26,466 --> 01:51:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, my god, that guy's all it.

01:51:28,130 --> 01:51:29,438
SPEAKER_0:  or like Dmitri Medvedev.

01:51:30,178 --> 01:51:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  who was a warmer, fuzzier version.

01:51:32,994 --> 01:51:41,438
SPEAKER_0:  of Putin certainly had a totally different perspective, wasn't it, in the KGB? Did you say warmer, fuzzier version? A warmer, fuzzier version, yeah. I mean, he's kind of like, he was literally a warm personality.

01:51:41,666 --> 01:51:46,014
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know if you watched him during the September 30th annexation, the guy had all kinds of facial twitches.

01:51:46,402 --> 01:51:48,926
SPEAKER_0:  and looks so rigid and stiff that he looks like he might.

01:51:49,218 --> 01:51:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  implode.

01:51:50,594 --> 01:51:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, that wasn't how he was earlier in his career. I mean, you know.

01:51:54,786 --> 01:51:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  had a different view of Paris striker. We always have to remember that Putin was not in Russia.

01:51:58,690 --> 01:52:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  during power strike he was in Dresden.

01:52:00,482 --> 01:52:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  watching.

01:52:01,730 --> 01:52:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  East German state fall apart.

01:52:04,354 --> 01:52:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  and dealing with the Dastazian in a kind of place where you weren't getting a lot of information about what was happening in West Germany or even what was happening back home in Perestroika.

01:52:13,154 --> 01:52:16,670
SPEAKER_0:  And he has that kind of group of people around him, the pat ôfsheves.

01:52:17,026 --> 01:52:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  botany cuffs and others.

01:52:19,234 --> 01:52:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  So he gave on off another, you know, from, you know, the different configurations of his administration.

01:52:25,442 --> 01:52:27,550
SPEAKER_0:  who have come out of that same kind of mindset.

01:52:27,938 --> 01:52:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  and are kind of wanting to put everything back together again. There's a lot of enablers, there's a lot of, you know,

01:52:33,442 --> 01:52:33,918
SPEAKER_0:  power.

01:52:34,274 --> 01:52:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  seekers.

01:52:35,234 --> 01:52:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  And there are a lot of people who think the same as him as well. He is a man of his time, a man of his context.

01:52:43,266 --> 01:52:45,246
SPEAKER_1:  you as a top advisor yourself.

01:52:45,570 --> 01:52:47,838
SPEAKER_1:  and a scholar of Putin. Do you think-

01:52:48,418 --> 01:52:49,150
SPEAKER_1:  Actually.

01:52:49,474 --> 01:52:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  now.

01:52:50,530 --> 01:52:52,830
SPEAKER_1:  in his inner circle, are there people he trusts?

01:52:52,994 --> 01:52:54,622
SPEAKER_0:  But are people who trust for some things?

01:52:55,362 --> 01:52:59,710
SPEAKER_0:  But I don't think there's people who trust for everything. I don't think he's the kind of person who tells anyone everything at all.

01:53:00,290 --> 01:53:05,886
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think he's got something deeply confined to. I think he compartmentalizes things.

01:53:06,242 --> 01:53:08,222
SPEAKER_0:  He's often said that the only person he trusts is himself.

01:53:08,898 --> 01:53:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  I think that's probably true. He's the kind of person who keeps his own counsel.

01:53:12,130 --> 01:53:14,846
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, people talk about Kovalchuk, for example.

01:53:15,106 --> 01:53:16,830
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of some of the other people who are.

01:53:17,090 --> 01:53:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  friends with him that got to go back to his time in St. Petersburg.

01:53:21,634 --> 01:53:24,926
SPEAKER_0:  At various points, he seemed to spend a lot of time.

01:53:25,154 --> 01:53:27,262
SPEAKER_0:  you know, way back when talking to people who were...

01:53:28,130 --> 01:53:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  people think of kind of more moderating forces like Alexei Kudrin, but you know, it doesn't seem to be interacting.

01:53:33,666 --> 01:53:34,398
SPEAKER_0:  you know, with them.

01:53:34,882 --> 01:53:37,566
SPEAKER_0:  You know, there are obviously aspects of his personal life, you know, does he...

01:53:38,338 --> 01:53:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  speak to.

01:53:39,362 --> 01:53:41,886
SPEAKER_0:  his daughters? Does he speak to you?

01:53:42,402 --> 01:53:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of.

01:53:44,194 --> 01:53:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  lovers, you know, kind of in a way people speculate about, you know, kind of who might he confide in, but I would greatly doubt that he would have.

01:53:51,298 --> 01:53:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  deep political.

01:53:52,418 --> 01:53:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  discussions with them. He's a very guarded.

01:53:55,138 --> 01:53:56,286
SPEAKER_0:  very careful.

01:53:56,834 --> 01:53:57,278
SPEAKER_0:  person.

01:53:57,442 --> 01:53:59,390
SPEAKER_1:  What about sources of information then?

01:53:59,682 --> 01:54:00,254
SPEAKER_1:  to trust.

01:54:00,482 --> 01:54:02,142
SPEAKER_1:  a deep understanding about.

01:54:02,370 --> 01:54:03,806
SPEAKER_1:  military strategies.

01:54:04,034 --> 01:54:04,510
SPEAKER_1:  with

01:54:05,474 --> 01:54:05,886
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:54:06,274 --> 01:54:07,326
SPEAKER_1:  for certain conflicts.

01:54:07,618 --> 01:54:09,502
SPEAKER_1:  like the war in Ukraine or even special.

01:54:10,242 --> 01:54:12,990
SPEAKER_1:  subsets of the war in Ukraine.

01:54:13,474 --> 01:54:17,310
SPEAKER_1:  or any kind of military operations, getting clear information.

01:54:17,442 --> 01:54:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  deeply suspicious.

01:54:18,914 --> 01:54:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  you know, of people and of information.

01:54:22,690 --> 01:54:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  And I think part of the.

01:54:25,218 --> 01:54:25,982
SPEAKER_0:  problems.

01:54:26,594 --> 01:54:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  that we see with Putin now.

01:54:29,858 --> 01:54:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I've come from isolation during COVID. I'm really convinced that, you know, like many of us.

01:54:36,226 --> 01:54:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  Yep.

01:54:36,770 --> 01:54:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  a lot of Putin's views have hardened.

01:54:39,746 --> 01:54:40,222
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:54:40,674 --> 01:54:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  the way that he looks at the world have been.

01:54:43,490 --> 01:54:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  shadowed in very dark ways by

01:54:46,338 --> 01:54:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  the experience of this pandemic.

01:54:48,994 --> 01:54:54,046
SPEAKER_0:  obviously he was in a bubble, different kind of bubble than most of us. I mean, most of us are not in bubbles with multiple.

01:54:54,338 --> 01:54:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of policies and you know, kind of the Kremlin.

01:54:57,602 --> 01:55:09,022
SPEAKER_0:  But we've seen so much, obviously a lot of this is stage, that isolation, they're kind of making it very clear that he's the czar, the guy who is in charge making all the decisions, one end of the table and everybody else is at the other end.

01:55:09,506 --> 01:55:11,422
SPEAKER_0:  But you know, it's very difficult then to bring.

01:55:11,746 --> 01:55:12,990
SPEAKER_0:  information to him.

01:55:13,346 --> 01:55:21,950
SPEAKER_0:  in that way. He used to have a lot of information bundled for him in the old days by the presidential administration. I don't know that because it was a lot more open in the past.

01:55:22,178 --> 01:55:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  I have a lot of meetings with people in the presidential administration who brought outside, you know, it's all source information.

01:55:28,322 --> 01:55:29,886
SPEAKER_0:  you know, for him and, you know, kind of.

01:55:30,626 --> 01:55:33,182
SPEAKER_0:  funneled in information from different think tanks and...

01:55:34,114 --> 01:55:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  you know, different viewpoints and...

01:55:36,770 --> 01:55:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  maybe a kind of more eclectic, diversified set of information. He would meet with people. You know, you've heard all the stories about where he had once called up Masha Gessen, you know, and had to come in, you know, obviously, a very different character as a journalist and a critic.

01:55:52,674 --> 01:55:58,334
SPEAKER_0:  We've heard about Benedicta from Echo Moscovy, the radio program, the editor.

01:55:58,626 --> 01:56:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  who Putin would talk to and consult with, he'd reach out.

01:56:03,650 --> 01:56:04,734
SPEAKER_0:  people.

01:56:04,994 --> 01:56:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  like Ludmila Alexeva, for example, the head of Memorial, he had some respect for her and would, you know, sometimes just...

01:56:10,946 --> 01:56:11,486
SPEAKER_0:  Talk to her.

01:56:11,778 --> 01:56:13,566
SPEAKER_0:  You know, for example, all of that seems to have.

01:56:14,306 --> 01:56:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  come to a halt.

01:56:16,066 --> 01:56:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  I think a lot of us worry.

01:56:18,242 --> 01:56:21,950
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, as to, you know, watch Putin about what kind of information is he getting?

01:56:22,434 --> 01:56:28,798
SPEAKER_0:  You know, is it just information he's seeking and gathering himself that fits into his worldview and his framework? You're guilty of that.

01:56:29,122 --> 01:56:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  of looking for things, gets to our social media preferences.

01:56:32,578 --> 01:56:39,774
SPEAKER_0:  people just bring into him things that they think he wants to hear, like the algorithm, you know, kind of like the Kremlin working in that regard, or is he himself?

01:56:40,002 --> 01:56:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  in a tapping into source of information that he absolutely wants.

01:56:43,810 --> 01:56:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  And remember...

01:56:44,642 --> 01:56:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  He is not a Melody Guy.

01:56:47,042 --> 01:56:51,166
SPEAKER_0:  He's an operative and he was sort of trained in operations and contingency planning.

01:56:52,354 --> 01:56:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  Sergei Shoigu, the defence minister, as a civil engineer, was the former minister of emergencies. It wasn't a military planet.

01:56:58,530 --> 01:57:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  You know, somebody like Gerasimov, the head of the...

01:57:03,234 --> 01:57:04,126
SPEAKER_0:  Sheeps of stuff.

01:57:04,706 --> 01:57:14,718
SPEAKER_0:  maybe a military guy in this case from the army, but he's also somebody who's in a different part, the chain of command. He's not somebody who would spontaneously start in a telling.

01:57:15,106 --> 01:57:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  Putin things.

01:57:16,482 --> 01:57:19,870
SPEAKER_0:  and Putin comes out of the FSB, out of the KGB.

01:57:20,098 --> 01:57:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  of the Soviet era and he knows the way that intelligence gets filtered and works. He's probably somebody who wants to consume raw intelligence. He doesn't probably want to.

01:57:27,810 --> 01:57:29,470
SPEAKER_0:  hear anybody else's analysis.

01:57:30,050 --> 01:57:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  and he thrived in the past.

01:57:31,874 --> 01:57:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  of picking things up from people.

01:57:34,018 --> 01:57:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I've taken part in all of these meetings with him, gone far less, because he's just collecting.

01:57:38,018 --> 01:57:41,982
SPEAKER_0:  He's collecting information, he's sussing people out. He wants to know the questions they ask.

01:57:42,306 --> 01:57:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  He learned something about the questions that people ask, the way that they ask them.

01:57:46,178 --> 01:57:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  So he's soliciting information himself. And if he's cut off from that information...

01:57:51,426 --> 01:57:52,926
SPEAKER_0:  because of circumstances.

01:57:53,666 --> 01:57:57,214
SPEAKER_0:  then how is he formulating things in his head? And again—

01:57:57,538 --> 01:57:59,902
SPEAKER_0:  getting into, you can't get into his head, but you can.

01:58:00,226 --> 01:58:06,558
SPEAKER_0:  understand the context in which he's operating. And that's where you worry, because he clearly made this decision to invade Ukraine.

01:58:06,818 --> 01:58:08,958
SPEAKER_0:  behind the back of most of the security establishment.

01:58:11,362 --> 01:58:13,918
SPEAKER_0:  You think so? No, I think it's pretty apparent.

01:58:14,274 --> 01:58:14,782
SPEAKER_1:  What?

01:58:15,170 --> 01:58:15,710
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhh

01:58:16,610 --> 01:58:18,485
SPEAKER_1:  What would the security establishment?

01:58:18,485 --> 01:58:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  Well, that would be the larger, you know, thinking the funneling in information from the presidential administration, from the National Security Council.

01:58:25,698 --> 01:58:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  It looks like he made that decision with a handful of people.

01:58:28,418 --> 01:58:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  And then, you know, having worked in these kinds of environments and it's not that dissimilar, you filter information up.

01:58:34,658 --> 01:58:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  So think about, you and I are talking for hours here.

01:58:38,082 --> 01:58:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  Um, if you were my...

01:58:40,162 --> 01:58:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  You know, but basically...

01:58:42,466 --> 01:58:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  you know, senior official and I'm your briefer, I might only get 20 minutes with you.

01:58:47,938 --> 01:59:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  And you might be just like, you know, looking at your watch the whole time and thinking, hang on a second, I've got to go and I've got this meeting and I've got that meeting and yeah, your point, you're not going to wait there. So I give this long explanation. I've got to get to the point and then I've got to then choose for myself, what's the information I'm going to impart to you?

01:59:04,418 --> 01:59:06,494
SPEAKER_0:  out of the 20 things that I think are important.

01:59:07,298 --> 01:59:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  You know, okay, I've got...

01:59:08,482 --> 01:59:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  minutes, maybe I only suddenly get two minutes, maybe you get called out.

01:59:12,706 --> 01:59:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  And somebody, you know, kind of interrupts.

01:59:15,330 --> 01:59:17,694
SPEAKER_0:  something happens, I'm gonna get one minute, two minutes.

01:59:17,986 --> 01:59:25,982
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. I mean, I want to remember, I had to give a presentation when I was in government, to Henry Kissinger, you know, for that defense policy board.

01:59:26,210 --> 01:59:26,942
SPEAKER_0:  and we plump.

01:59:27,170 --> 01:59:28,798
SPEAKER_0:  Bloody weeks on this thing.

01:59:29,090 --> 01:59:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  PowerPoints were created, teams of people were brought together.

01:59:32,802 --> 01:59:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  And people were practicing this, we had all these different people there. And I said, look.

01:59:37,826 --> 01:59:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  Henry Kissinger is an academic and a former professor and, you know, I haven't, you know, I've got to watch him in action. He's gonna like.

01:59:45,666 --> 01:59:51,518
SPEAKER_0:  you know, five seconds in if we're lucky, we get that far, ask us a question and just throw off our entire presentation.

01:59:51,746 --> 01:59:59,038
SPEAKER_0:  What is it that we want to convey? And that's exactly what happened. And then people aren't really prepared or they wanted to convey and they're prepared.

01:59:59,426 --> 02:00:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  you know, a nice sort of fulsome.

02:00:01,506 --> 02:00:03,966
SPEAKER_0:  in a PowerPoint-like approach. We never even got there.

02:00:04,578 --> 02:00:09,022
SPEAKER_0:  And so God knows what he took away from it at the end of it. And that's, you know, think about Putin.

02:00:09,346 --> 02:00:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  He's gonna be kind of impatient.

02:00:11,394 --> 02:00:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  He's in, we see the televised things where he, you know, kind of sits at a table a bit like.

02:00:16,002 --> 02:00:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  people won't necessarily see us here.

02:00:17,890 --> 02:00:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  and he puts his hands on the table and he looks across at the person and he says so.

02:00:21,666 --> 02:00:22,078
SPEAKER_0:  Tell me.

02:00:22,818 --> 02:00:23,166
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

02:00:23,746 --> 02:00:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  What's the main things I need to know? And of course the person's mind probably goes blank.

02:00:27,362 --> 02:00:35,998
SPEAKER_0:  You know, with the kind of the thought of like, oh god, what's the main thing? Yeah. They go, well, Vladimir Vladimirovich, they start the kind of.

02:00:36,226 --> 02:00:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  They're revving up to get to the point and then he cuts them off.

02:00:39,778 --> 02:00:43,134
SPEAKER_0:  So you think about that and then you think about, well what information has he got?

02:00:43,746 --> 02:00:45,054
SPEAKER_0:  And then how does he process it?

02:00:45,538 --> 02:00:48,062
SPEAKER_0:  And is he suspicious of it? Does he not believe it?

02:00:49,090 --> 02:00:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  And what on what inside of his own history then, you know, leads him to make one judgment over another? He clearly thought...

02:00:55,298 --> 02:00:57,246
SPEAKER_0:  the Ukrainians would fall apart in five seconds.

02:00:58,498 --> 02:01:02,014
SPEAKER_1:  We don't know if he clearly thought that, but that there was a.

02:01:03,202 --> 02:01:04,702
SPEAKER_1:  High probability maybe?

02:01:04,930 --> 02:01:10,430
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, you can guess. I think he pretty much thought it, because I think he thought that, you know, kind of his answer wasn't very popular.

02:01:11,042 --> 02:01:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  There was an awful lot of pro-Russian sentiment in whatever way he thinks that is because people are Russian speakers.

02:01:17,602 --> 02:01:18,878
SPEAKER_0:  and that, you know, they're kind of...

02:01:19,298 --> 02:01:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  you know, in polling that, you know, they're

02:01:21,538 --> 02:01:32,030
SPEAKER_0:  expressed affinity with Russia. I mean, certainly in Crimea, that worked out because a majority of the population had higher sentiments or feelings of affinity with Russia.

02:01:32,450 --> 02:01:33,470
SPEAKER_0:  And you know, obviously.

02:01:33,826 --> 02:01:35,966
SPEAKER_0:  You know, that kind of, they got traction there.

02:01:36,354 --> 02:01:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  But it's more complicated. We talked about Dunbass before about being a kind of melting pot when

02:01:40,930 --> 02:01:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  they tried the same thing in Donbus.

02:01:43,170 --> 02:01:49,022
SPEAKER_0:  Donetsk and Luhansk as it tried in Crimea in 2014 didn't kind of pan out. In fact, you know, a whole wall broke out.

02:01:49,474 --> 02:01:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  They tried, you know, to kind of in...

02:01:51,426 --> 02:01:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:01:52,290 --> 02:01:55,998
SPEAKER_0:  many of the major cities that are now under attack, including Odessa.

02:01:56,290 --> 02:01:59,166
SPEAKER_0:  to kind of ferment pro-Russian movements.

02:01:59,586 --> 02:02:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  they completely and utterly fell apart. So Putin was thinking...

02:02:03,362 --> 02:02:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  I'm pretty sure based on polling and the FSB having infiltrated.

02:02:07,618 --> 02:02:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  an awful lot of the Ukrainian hierarchies we're now seeing as quite apparent with some of the dismissals in Ukraine.

02:02:14,146 --> 02:02:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  It was pretty sure.

02:02:15,522 --> 02:02:15,838
SPEAKER_0:  That's it.

02:02:16,066 --> 02:02:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of he would get traction.

02:02:19,138 --> 02:02:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  and that it would be like 1956 in Hungary or 1968 in Czechoslovakia. Remember he comes out of the Andropov.

02:02:25,922 --> 02:02:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  levy as it's called, a kind of cohort of people who come into the KGB under Yuri Andropov.

02:02:32,258 --> 02:02:34,526
SPEAKER_0:  And Euron Dropov has presided over a lot of these.

02:02:34,754 --> 02:02:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  anti-dissident.

02:02:36,130 --> 02:02:39,102
SPEAKER_0:  movements inside of Russia itself and how you suppress.

02:02:39,362 --> 02:02:42,302
SPEAKER_0:  opposition, but also over how you deal with.

02:02:42,690 --> 02:02:45,246
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of the uprisings and...

02:02:45,730 --> 02:02:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  in the Czechoslovakia and Hungary.

02:02:47,746 --> 02:02:51,294
SPEAKER_0:  there's all these lessons from this that you can put everything back in the box.

02:02:51,842 --> 02:02:58,622
SPEAKER_0:  And yeah, there might be a bit of violence and a bit of fighting, but ultimately, you think you've got the political figures and you decapitate the opposition.

02:02:58,850 --> 02:03:01,630
SPEAKER_0:  so they thought you'd let, Zylinski would run away.

02:03:02,018 --> 02:03:03,454
SPEAKER_0:  Yadokovitch, run away, but...

02:03:04,034 --> 02:03:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  That was kind of a bit, sort of a different set of circumstances.

02:03:08,610 --> 02:03:12,606
SPEAKER_0:  And they thought that all of the local governments would kind of capitulate because they had been through broke or didn't do so much which is not enough.

02:03:12,962 --> 02:03:14,942
SPEAKER_0:  Russians in inverted commas in there.

02:03:15,266 --> 02:03:17,342
SPEAKER_0:  Again, mistaking language.

02:03:18,594 --> 02:03:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  and kind of positive affinity towards Russia for identity or how people would react in the time and not understanding peoples.

02:03:25,698 --> 02:03:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  you know, linkages and, you know, kind of importance of place, the way that people feel about who they are in a certain set of circumstances and place.

02:03:34,786 --> 02:03:37,054
SPEAKER_1:  the invasion of Ukraine.

02:03:37,794 --> 02:03:39,902
SPEAKER_1:  2022 is unlike anything.

02:03:41,026 --> 02:03:41,470
SPEAKER_1:  that.

02:03:41,858 --> 02:03:43,733
SPEAKER_1:  he was ever involved with.

02:03:43,733 --> 02:03:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  But I don't think he thought it would be, you know, because it's kind of if he looks back into the past. You're right though, he wasn't involved in 68 or...

02:03:51,650 --> 02:03:54,275
SPEAKER_0:  56 or what happened in the 1980s in Poland.

02:03:54,275 --> 02:03:58,494
SPEAKER_1:  But there's a very wide front and it's the capital and I mean.

02:03:58,978 --> 02:04:00,103
SPEAKER_1:  This isn't going.

02:04:00,103 --> 02:04:05,353
SPEAKER_0:  This isn't Chichniel, this isn't you know kind of Syriac for example. This is a major nation.

02:04:05,353 --> 02:04:07,603
SPEAKER_1:  It's large.

02:04:07,603 --> 02:04:13,662
SPEAKER_0:  It was more like Afghanistan, but they didn't realize that because again, Ukrainians are us.

02:04:14,562 --> 02:04:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  inability to think that people might think differently and might want something different.

02:04:19,810 --> 02:04:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  and that 30 years of independence actually has an impact on people and there's like geese and...

02:04:25,442 --> 02:04:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  If I look back to the 1990s, I mean, I remember being in seminars and...

02:04:29,538 --> 02:04:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  at Harvard at the time and we were doing a lot of research on...

02:04:33,570 --> 02:04:34,654
SPEAKER_0:  what was happening.

02:04:35,074 --> 02:04:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  and the former Soviet Union at the time, because of the early 1990s, just after the bin of the hole.

02:04:40,322 --> 02:04:41,246
SPEAKER_0:  place fall apart.

02:04:42,338 --> 02:04:44,798
SPEAKER_0:  And there was already underyelps in this kind of idea of...

02:04:45,442 --> 02:04:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  Russians abroad, Russians in the near abroad, Russian speakers and the need to bring them back in.

02:04:50,850 --> 02:04:54,622
SPEAKER_0:  And I remember we had seminars at the time where we talked about at some point.

02:04:54,914 --> 02:04:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  There'd be some people in Russia.

02:04:56,450 --> 02:04:57,790
SPEAKER_0:  that would actually believe that...

02:04:59,362 --> 02:05:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  those Russian speakers needed to be brought back into Russia, but that the...

02:05:02,530 --> 02:05:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  people who spoke Russian might have moved on.

02:05:04,578 --> 02:05:07,902
SPEAKER_0:  because they certainly had other opportunities and other windows in the world.

02:05:08,162 --> 02:05:10,750
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, look what's happened in Scotland. You know, for example, most.

02:05:11,138 --> 02:05:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  people in Scotland speak English.

02:05:13,602 --> 02:05:15,038
SPEAKER_0:  The Scottish language is not.

02:05:15,714 --> 02:05:16,126
SPEAKER_0:  The.

02:05:16,386 --> 02:05:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  standard bearer of Scottish identity. It's almost a civic identity, a different identity than not just national identity, just like you see in Ukraine.

02:05:24,770 --> 02:05:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  and there's lots of English people.

02:05:26,210 --> 02:05:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  have moved to Scotland and now think of themselves as Scottish or Brazilians or Italians and you know all kinds of people who've moved in there. It's a smaller population obviously and it's not the scale of...

02:05:35,426 --> 02:05:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  Are you crying, but...

02:05:37,314 --> 02:05:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  You know, people deal differently.

02:05:39,618 --> 02:05:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  and there's been a devolution of power.

02:05:41,666 --> 02:05:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  And when Brexit happened...

02:05:43,330 --> 02:05:47,358
SPEAKER_0:  you know, Scotland didn't want to go along with that at all. They wanted to kind of still be, you know, a-

02:05:47,682 --> 02:05:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  having a window on Europe.

02:05:49,730 --> 02:05:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  That's kind of historic.

02:05:51,298 --> 02:05:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  and lots of people in Ukraine have looked west, not east.

02:05:54,882 --> 02:05:57,182
SPEAKER_0:  It depends on where you are, not just in...

02:05:57,858 --> 02:06:06,494
SPEAKER_0:  Lviv, you know, or somewhere like that, but also in Kiev. And Kharkiv, you know, was kind of predominantly a Russian-speaking city. But Kharkiv was also the centre.

02:06:06,946 --> 02:06:08,062
SPEAKER_0:  of Ukrainian culture.

02:06:08,546 --> 02:06:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  and you're creating literature at different points.

02:06:11,106 --> 02:06:17,982
SPEAKER_0:  People have different views. I grew up in the north of England. We don't feel like the south of England. There's been a massive divide between north and south of England.

02:06:18,498 --> 02:06:20,254
SPEAKER_0:  For millennia, not just centuries.

02:06:20,802 --> 02:06:22,526
SPEAKER_0:  So, you know, people feel differently.

02:06:22,978 --> 02:06:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  depending on where they live and kind of where they grew up. And Putin just-

02:06:27,330 --> 02:06:29,205
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't see that. I didn't see that.

02:06:29,205 --> 02:06:30,686
SPEAKER_1:  Hold on a second, let me sort of.

02:06:31,234 --> 02:06:31,582
SPEAKER_1:  Hush.

02:06:31,970 --> 02:06:32,574
SPEAKER_1:  back.

02:06:33,090 --> 02:06:35,710
SPEAKER_1:  at the fact that I don't think any of this is obvious.

02:06:36,130 --> 02:06:40,255
SPEAKER_1:  So first of all, Zelensky before the war was unpopular. I want.

02:06:40,255 --> 02:06:44,286
SPEAKER_0:  38%, something like that, but best in the popularity.

02:06:44,610 --> 02:06:48,286
SPEAKER_1:  Let me sort of make the case that the calculation here.

02:06:49,090 --> 02:06:52,318
SPEAKER_1:  is very difficult. If you were to poll...

02:06:53,346 --> 02:06:58,110
SPEAKER_1:  every citizen of Ukraine and ask them, what do you think happens if Russia invades?

02:06:59,234 --> 02:06:59,550
SPEAKER_1:  Just.

02:06:59,874 --> 02:07:01,310
SPEAKER_1:  Like actually, each.

02:07:01,538 --> 02:07:03,166
SPEAKER_1:  put each individual Ukrainian

02:07:03,394 --> 02:07:06,558
SPEAKER_1:  in a one-on-one meeting with Putin and say, what do you think happens?

02:07:07,362 --> 02:07:11,102
SPEAKER_1:  I honestly think most of them will say they will agree.

02:07:11,906 --> 02:07:14,942
SPEAKER_1:  with a prediction that the government would flee, it would collapse.

02:07:15,170 --> 02:07:17,438
SPEAKER_1:  and the country won't unite.

02:07:18,402 --> 02:07:19,838
SPEAKER_1:  around cause.

02:07:20,162 --> 02:07:21,598
SPEAKER_1:  because of the factions.

02:07:21,858 --> 02:07:24,483
SPEAKER_1:  because of all the different parties involved because of that popular

02:07:24,483 --> 02:07:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  You might have said the same thing about...

02:07:26,434 --> 02:07:27,358
SPEAKER_0:  the Soviet Union.

02:07:27,810 --> 02:07:29,502
SPEAKER_0:  when Hitler invaded.

02:07:30,018 --> 02:07:30,942
SPEAKER_0:  in 1941.

02:07:32,130 --> 02:07:35,902
SPEAKER_0:  You see, the problem is Putin always reads history from one perspective over another.

02:07:36,386 --> 02:07:37,662
SPEAKER_0:  I think most countries.

02:07:39,298 --> 02:07:41,086
SPEAKER_0:  basically rise to their own defense.

02:07:41,890 --> 02:07:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  So this is actually one of the first times that Russia has been on the offensive.

02:07:46,722 --> 02:07:48,062
SPEAKER_0:  rather than on the defensive.

02:07:50,210 --> 02:07:52,446
SPEAKER_0:  you know, so there's kind of a bit of a flip there.

02:07:53,698 --> 02:08:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, obviously Afghanistan, but that was more complicated because it was also supposed to be an intervention right. I mean, it wasn't supposed to be to annex Afghanistan. It was to try to.

02:08:02,338 --> 02:08:03,038
SPEAKER_0:  I'm gonna pop up.

02:08:03,490 --> 02:08:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  kind of a reinstall of a leader there.

02:08:07,170 --> 02:08:09,342
SPEAKER_0:  You were in there to, you know, help.

02:08:09,762 --> 02:08:11,454
SPEAKER_0:  Your guy, Bashar al-Assad.

02:08:11,938 --> 02:08:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  turn away the opposition.

02:08:13,506 --> 02:08:14,590
SPEAKER_0:  Chetch now was a debacle.

02:08:15,266 --> 02:08:16,030
SPEAKER_0:  The Chaptains.

02:08:16,610 --> 02:08:17,310
SPEAKER_0:  Thought back.

02:08:17,826 --> 02:08:18,398
SPEAKER_0:  Big time.

02:08:18,818 --> 02:08:20,414
SPEAKER_0:  and it was only by dint of.

02:08:21,666 --> 02:08:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  horrible.

02:08:22,658 --> 02:08:24,030
SPEAKER_0:  violent persistence.

02:08:24,770 --> 02:08:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  and ruthlessness.

02:08:26,370 --> 02:08:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  nasty dirty tricks.

02:08:28,642 --> 02:08:29,630
SPEAKER_0:  that動画 relieved from needs of time.

02:08:30,082 --> 02:08:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  know, kind of Putin prevailed there, but then, you know, you wonder, did he prevail? Because what happened?

02:08:35,138 --> 02:08:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  You know, Chechnya sometimes describes the most independent part of the Russian Federation, Ramzan Kadyrov.

02:08:40,194 --> 02:08:41,822
SPEAKER_0:  and it plays power games in Moscow.

02:08:42,626 --> 02:08:43,966
SPEAKER_0:  His predecessors.

02:08:44,418 --> 02:08:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  Even his father and others wouldn't have done that.

02:08:47,426 --> 02:08:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  and before that, Dadaev and Maskhadaev, they were willing to make a compromise, but they wouldn't have had.

02:08:54,914 --> 02:08:55,710
SPEAKER_0:  end of the same.

02:08:56,354 --> 02:08:58,238
SPEAKER_0:  position that Kadira facade.

02:08:58,914 --> 02:08:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:08:59,554 --> 02:09:07,262
SPEAKER_0:  I think that again, it's your perspective and where you stand and which bit of history you start to read. That's why I say that, you know, I kind of think Putin...

02:09:07,906 --> 02:09:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  It's again, it's the information, the way that he processes it.

02:09:10,722 --> 02:09:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  I think most Russians also can't believe that they've done something wrong in Ukraine.

02:09:14,786 --> 02:09:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, maybe at this point things are...

02:09:16,386 --> 02:09:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  changing a bit.

02:09:17,698 --> 02:09:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  But that's why there was so much support for this.

02:09:21,186 --> 02:09:24,702
SPEAKER_0:  I have Russian friends again and I said, but look what was happening in Dunyets.

02:09:25,026 --> 02:09:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  look what the Ukrainians were doing to our guys.

02:09:29,538 --> 02:09:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  You know, look what was happening to Russian speakers.

02:09:32,610 --> 02:09:33,950
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we were defenders.

02:09:35,042 --> 02:09:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  We were not, we're not invaders. I think, again, the special military operation idea, now I think it's flipping, obviously, in the way that with the wall going on there.

02:09:44,418 --> 02:09:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  But Putin wasn't, you know, kind of looking at what would happen.

02:09:48,802 --> 02:09:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, most of the kind of glory parts of Russian history when you kind of go in.

02:09:52,898 --> 02:09:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  you know, you chase Napoleon back to Paris.

02:09:55,394 --> 02:09:59,326
SPEAKER_0:  or you taste the Germans back to Berlin, you put the flag above the Reichstag.

02:09:59,778 --> 02:10:00,990
SPEAKER_0:  That's very different.

02:10:01,346 --> 02:10:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  set of affairs.

02:10:02,530 --> 02:10:04,958
SPEAKER_0:  when you've been fighting a defensive one, you've been invaded.

02:10:05,410 --> 02:10:07,646
SPEAKER_0:  from a world where you invade someone else.

02:10:10,562 --> 02:10:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  And even the most fractured populations like you had in the Soviet Union at the point, can run around.

02:10:15,522 --> 02:10:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  World War I, the...

02:10:17,314 --> 02:10:20,414
SPEAKER_0:  fell apart. I mean, the czar didn't manage to rally everybody around.

02:10:21,826 --> 02:10:22,814
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, the whole thing fell apart.

02:10:24,098 --> 02:10:24,478
SPEAKER_0:  and.

02:10:24,770 --> 02:10:25,694
SPEAKER_0:  World War II?

02:10:26,018 --> 02:10:26,942
SPEAKER_0:  Stalin had to...

02:10:27,266 --> 02:10:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  you know, revive nationalism.

02:10:29,986 --> 02:10:33,662
SPEAKER_0:  including in the republics in Central Asia and Elsevier to revive nationalism.

02:10:35,522 --> 02:10:38,631
SPEAKER_0:  and you can see from nationalism you know the kind of sense

02:10:38,631 --> 02:10:45,534
SPEAKER_1:  That's really interesting because it's not obvious, especially what Ukrainians went through in the 1930s.

02:10:46,178 --> 02:10:47,678
SPEAKER_1:  It's not obvious that that...

02:10:48,162 --> 02:10:51,774
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, my grandfather was Ukrainian and he was proud to...

02:10:52,290 --> 02:10:52,830
SPEAKER_1:  Fight.

02:10:53,698 --> 02:10:55,166
SPEAKER_1:  a Ukrainian Jew.

02:10:55,746 --> 02:10:58,622
SPEAKER_1:  He was proud to fight and willing to die for.

02:10:59,202 --> 02:10:59,902
SPEAKER_1:  his country.

02:11:00,258 --> 02:11:01,086
SPEAKER_1:  It wasn't like...

02:11:01,698 --> 02:11:03,573
SPEAKER_0:  His country then was the Soviet Union.

02:11:03,573 --> 02:11:05,073
SPEAKER_1:  of the union, right, sorry.

02:11:05,073 --> 02:11:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  But he might fight now for his country, Ukraine.

02:11:08,034 --> 02:11:08,414
SPEAKER_1:  Yes.

02:11:08,802 --> 02:11:09,214
SPEAKER_1:  But it's.

02:11:09,634 --> 02:11:10,590
SPEAKER_1:  I'm just like...

02:11:10,946 --> 02:11:13,982
SPEAKER_1:  um... lingering in the point you made it was not obvious

02:11:15,106 --> 02:11:16,382
SPEAKER_1:  that that united.

02:11:16,610 --> 02:11:17,598
SPEAKER_1:  feeling would be there.

02:11:18,786 --> 02:11:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  No, and again, it wouldn't have been obvious for the Soviet Union.

02:11:21,314 --> 02:11:22,439
SPEAKER_0:  That's what, sorry. Huh.

02:11:22,439 --> 02:11:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  That's what I'm saying. Sorry, I was referring to my grandfather, the Soviet Union. We're both saying the exact same thing. We know. Yeah, we are. You're saying it's a really powerful thing because I take it because you take history as it happened.

02:11:33,346 --> 02:11:35,966
SPEAKER_1:  you don't realize it could have happened differently. It's kind of.

02:11:36,546 --> 02:11:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  It's fascinating. It's that whole counterfactual, right? Yeah.

02:11:39,586 --> 02:11:44,542
SPEAKER_0:  Because if you've kind of, that's why we all need in the United States to really examine our own history.

02:11:45,794 --> 02:11:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  because.

02:11:46,530 --> 02:11:48,062
SPEAKER_0:  You know, there's a lot of lessons from that.

02:11:48,834 --> 02:11:49,918
SPEAKER_0:  that we should.

02:11:50,370 --> 02:11:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  treat very cautiously. It doesn't mean that, you know, history repeats or even rhymes, you know.

02:11:55,106 --> 02:11:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  the old Axiom all the time.

02:11:57,058 --> 02:11:58,814
SPEAKER_0:  There are a lot of things that you can.

02:11:59,106 --> 02:12:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  take away differently from.

02:12:01,986 --> 02:12:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  putting a different perspective and a different slant on the same set of events. I mean, I always used to wonder, like, how many books can be written on the French Revolution?

02:12:08,610 --> 02:12:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  or even on the Russian Revolution. You know, I studied with Richard Pipes, and I remember he was really offended after he'd written his great micro-surplus on the Russian Revolution, two volumes, that other people would...

02:12:17,186 --> 02:12:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  kind of write about the Russian revolution. He said, I've written it all. And I thought, well, actually, maybe you haven't. It's like there might be some completely different angle there that you haven't really thought of. And that's Putin. I remember Peskov saying.

02:12:28,418 --> 02:12:32,094
SPEAKER_0:  Putin reads history all the time, Russian history, and I thought, well, maybe she should read some world history.

02:12:32,770 --> 02:12:33,950
SPEAKER_0:  You know, maybe he should.

02:12:34,242 --> 02:12:40,894
SPEAKER_0:  kind of read some European authors on Russian history, not just reading Lamanosa for, you know.

02:12:41,506 --> 02:12:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  Russian historians on Russian history, because you might see something from a very different perspective. Look, the United States made a massive mistake in Vietnam.

02:12:50,946 --> 02:12:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, they saw Vietnam as kind of weak, manipulated by, you know, kind of external forces, China, Soviet Union.

02:12:58,658 --> 02:13:00,606
SPEAKER_0:  the Vietnamese fought for their own country.

02:13:01,442 --> 02:13:05,022
SPEAKER_0:  they suddenly became Vietnamese and Ho Chi Minh became.

02:13:05,346 --> 02:13:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  you know, going to basically a kind of a war time.

02:13:08,098 --> 02:13:08,958
SPEAKER_0:  fighter and leader.

02:13:09,282 --> 02:13:12,798
SPEAKER_0:  in a way that perhaps people wouldn't have understood either.

02:13:13,186 --> 02:13:15,870
SPEAKER_1:  You said the United States made a massive mistake.

02:13:16,386 --> 02:13:17,438
SPEAKER_1:  in Vietnam.

02:13:17,858 --> 02:13:20,830
SPEAKER_1:  and that for some reason sprung a thought in my head.

02:13:21,698 --> 02:13:22,942
SPEAKER_1:  as United States.

02:13:23,490 --> 02:13:24,702
SPEAKER_1:  since World War II.

02:13:25,666 --> 02:13:30,206
SPEAKER_1:  uh, had anything that's not a mistake in terms of military operations.

02:13:30,850 --> 02:13:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  abroad.

02:13:33,698 --> 02:13:36,350
SPEAKER_1:  I suppose all the ones that are successes.

02:13:37,186 --> 02:13:41,854
SPEAKER_1:  we don't even know about probably. So it's like very fast military operations.

02:13:42,114 --> 02:13:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, Korea is divided. I mean, I don't know what's successful, but kind of, I mean, there was a solution found that some people are promoting, in this case as well, of a sort of division in a.

02:13:52,034 --> 02:13:53,502
SPEAKER_0:  you know, the DMZ and...

02:13:53,954 --> 02:13:57,246
SPEAKER_0:  one side over the other and kind of perpetuating a division.

02:13:57,954 --> 02:14:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  particularly successful but if you think about World War One and World War Two

02:14:01,570 --> 02:14:03,070
SPEAKER_0:  The United States came in.

02:14:03,746 --> 02:14:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  you know, under some very specific sets of circumstances. In World War I, they did kind of come in to help.

02:14:08,674 --> 02:14:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of liberate.

02:14:10,466 --> 02:14:14,302
SPEAKER_0:  parts of Europe, France and the UK.

02:14:14,594 --> 02:14:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  everything else, Great Britain and the war towards the end of it.

02:14:17,794 --> 02:14:18,814
SPEAKER_0:  World War II?

02:14:19,202 --> 02:14:22,718
SPEAKER_0:  there was that whole debate about whether the United States should even be part of the war.

02:14:23,394 --> 02:14:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, we know it wasn't thought to...

02:14:25,410 --> 02:14:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  overturn the Holocaust and all of the kind of things you kind of wish it would have been fought for. It was because of Pearl Harbor and the Japanese pulling in.

02:14:32,930 --> 02:14:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  But ultimately...

02:14:34,786 --> 02:14:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  It was easy to explain.

02:14:37,282 --> 02:14:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  while you were there, you know, particularly after Pearl Harbor and what had happened.

02:14:40,546 --> 02:14:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  It was hard to explain Vietnam and Korea and...

02:14:42,978 --> 02:14:48,702
SPEAKER_0:  many of them wasn't. Look, that's kind of going to be a problem for Putin. That's why there is a problem for Putin. All of his explanations of—

02:14:50,274 --> 02:14:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  being questioned.

02:14:51,906 --> 02:14:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  you know, Sarsavol for NATO or this or that or the other.

02:14:55,554 --> 02:14:59,742
SPEAKER_0:  and kind of all liberating Ukraine from Nazis or...

02:15:00,098 --> 02:15:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of basically stopping the persecution of Russian speakers and.

02:15:04,322 --> 02:15:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  All of this has now got lost in just this.

02:15:07,106 --> 02:15:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  horrific destruction.

02:15:08,898 --> 02:15:10,686
SPEAKER_0:  And that's what happened in Vietnam as well.

02:15:11,522 --> 02:15:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  I became.

02:15:12,706 --> 02:15:15,006
SPEAKER_0:  you know, a great degradation.

02:15:15,554 --> 02:15:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  of the Russian military with atrocities and people wondering why on earth the United States was in Vietnam.

02:15:22,178 --> 02:15:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, even that kind of happened in Britain in the colonial.

02:15:25,058 --> 02:15:28,030
SPEAKER_0:  kind of pivot as well. Why was the United Kingdom?

02:15:28,482 --> 02:15:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  committing atrocities and basically fighting these colonial wars.

02:15:33,186 --> 02:15:33,982
SPEAKER_0:  Northern Ireland.

02:15:34,338 --> 02:15:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  Why was the United Kingdom still...

02:15:37,314 --> 02:15:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of militarily occupying.

02:15:40,258 --> 02:15:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  Island.

02:15:41,186 --> 02:15:46,014
SPEAKER_0:  There's all kinds of instances where we look at this thing. What Russia was doing now, Putin is-

02:15:46,242 --> 02:15:47,358
SPEAKER_0:  trying to occupy.

02:15:48,002 --> 02:15:48,702
SPEAKER_0:  another country.

02:15:49,346 --> 02:15:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  irrespective of the historical linkages.

02:15:52,354 --> 02:15:55,966
SPEAKER_0:  and the larger metanarratives that he's trying to put forward there.

02:15:58,242 --> 02:15:59,230
SPEAKER_1:  What brawl?

02:15:59,522 --> 02:16:01,790
SPEAKER_1:  Did the United States play?

02:16:02,178 --> 02:16:04,990
SPEAKER_1:  in the lead up and the actual invasion.

02:16:05,282 --> 02:16:06,302
SPEAKER_1:  of um...

02:16:07,234 --> 02:16:07,806
SPEAKER_1:  of Ukraine.

02:16:08,034 --> 02:16:08,638
SPEAKER_1:  by Russia.

02:16:09,282 --> 02:16:12,286
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of people say that, I mean, obviously.

02:16:12,802 --> 02:16:14,654
SPEAKER_1:  Vladimir Putin says that

02:16:15,074 --> 02:16:16,158
SPEAKER_1:  part of the reason.

02:16:16,450 --> 02:16:18,718
SPEAKER_1:  The invasion had to happen because of

02:16:18,978 --> 02:16:21,278
SPEAKER_1:  security concerns over the expansion of NATO.

02:16:22,178 --> 02:16:22,718
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:16:23,970 --> 02:16:24,606
SPEAKER_1:  There is.

02:16:25,250 --> 02:16:27,582
SPEAKER_1:  a lot of people that say that this was provoked.

02:16:27,810 --> 02:16:28,382
SPEAKER_1:  by NATO.

02:16:29,410 --> 02:16:31,646
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think there's some legitimacy to that case?

02:16:32,386 --> 02:16:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  Look, I think the whole situation here is very complicated and you have to take a much longer view than what happened in 2008 with the open door for Ukraine and Georgia, which actually by the way I thought was a strategic blunder.

02:16:44,002 --> 02:16:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  just to be very clear.

02:16:45,122 --> 02:16:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  because I wasn't any kind of thinking through about what the implications of that would be and what it actually would mean for Ukraine's security and also bearing in mind what Putin had already said about NATO expansion.

02:16:55,906 --> 02:17:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  They came on the wake of the recognition by the United States pretty unilaterally of Kosovo.

02:17:01,186 --> 02:17:05,214
SPEAKER_0:  And it also comes in the wake of, as I mentioned before, the invasion of Iraq, which...

02:17:05,602 --> 02:17:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  Really because very

02:17:08,130 --> 02:17:10,718
SPEAKER_0:  important for understanding Putin's psyche.

02:17:11,554 --> 02:17:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  So I think we have to go back much further and it's not just talking about NATO and what that means.

02:17:18,210 --> 02:17:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  NATO is part of the whole.

02:17:20,578 --> 02:17:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  of Ukraine going in a different direction from Russia.

02:17:23,842 --> 02:17:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  just as so as the European Union. Remember the annexation.

02:17:27,074 --> 02:17:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  of Crimea comes after.

02:17:29,570 --> 02:17:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  Ukraine has sought an association agreement with the European Union.

02:17:33,890 --> 02:17:39,230
SPEAKER_0:  Not with NATO at that particular point, even though the EU on the common security defense policy...

02:17:39,714 --> 02:17:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:17:40,738 --> 02:17:41,470
SPEAKER_0:

02:17:42,082 --> 02:17:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  all kinds of connections.

02:17:43,682 --> 02:17:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  with NATO at various different levels in the European Security Front. It was all about Europe.

02:17:48,930 --> 02:17:51,166
SPEAKER_0:  going on a different economic and political.

02:17:51,650 --> 02:17:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  and ultimately legal path because if you have.

02:17:55,106 --> 02:18:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  an association agreement eventually you get into the Aki Communitern and it just transforms the country completely and Ukraine is no longer.

02:18:01,954 --> 02:18:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  the Ukraine of the Soviet period or the Russian Empire period, it becomes...

02:18:05,762 --> 02:18:07,358
SPEAKER_0:  you know, on a different trajectory like...

02:18:08,066 --> 02:18:09,694
SPEAKER_0:  Czech Republic, Slovakia.

02:18:10,242 --> 02:18:11,006
SPEAKER_0:  Poland.

02:18:11,554 --> 02:18:11,902
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

02:18:12,354 --> 02:18:17,022
SPEAKER_0:  another country becomes a different place. It moves into a different space and that's part of it.

02:18:17,474 --> 02:18:19,006
SPEAKER_0:  But if you go back again...

02:18:19,618 --> 02:18:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  to the period at the very beginning of the 1990s, after the...

02:18:23,618 --> 02:18:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  dissolution.

02:18:24,994 --> 02:18:28,926
SPEAKER_0:  of the Soviet Union. Well, there's no discussion about NATO at that point in NATO enlargement.

02:18:29,666 --> 02:18:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  There is a lot of pressure, again, as I've said before, by nationalist elements on Ukraine and trying to bring it back in the fold.

02:18:35,586 --> 02:18:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  and wanting to make what was then.

02:18:37,794 --> 02:18:38,302
SPEAKER_0:  in this.

02:18:38,530 --> 02:18:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  mechanism for divorce.

02:18:40,322 --> 02:18:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  more of a mechanism for re-management of Commonwealth of Independent States.

02:18:45,122 --> 02:18:46,654
SPEAKER_0:  And in the early 1990s...

02:18:47,042 --> 02:18:47,582
SPEAKER_0:  when

02:18:48,290 --> 02:18:49,150
SPEAKER_0:  Ukraine

02:18:49,858 --> 02:18:52,510
SPEAKER_0:  became an independent state, it inherited that nuclear arsenal.

02:18:52,834 --> 02:18:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  from

02:18:53,762 --> 02:18:56,190
SPEAKER_0:  the Soviet Union, basically whatever was stationed.

02:18:56,418 --> 02:18:59,870
SPEAKER_0:  opposition in Ukrainian territory at the time became Ukraine.

02:19:00,386 --> 02:19:04,190
SPEAKER_0:  strategic and you know kind of basically intermediate and tactical nuclear weapons.

02:19:05,186 --> 02:19:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  in the United States at the time, we had all this panic about.

02:19:08,930 --> 02:19:12,382
SPEAKER_0:  what was going to happen with all of that. I mean, I think, you know, I was a scientist and, you know, kind of.

02:19:12,802 --> 02:19:18,174
SPEAKER_0:  Technically, it would have been difficult for Ukraine to actually use this. I mean, the targeting was done centrally.

02:19:18,658 --> 02:19:20,606
SPEAKER_0:  They were actually stationed there, but nonetheless.

02:19:20,866 --> 02:19:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  Ukraine, like Belarus and Kazakhstan, suddenly become nuclear powers.

02:19:24,514 --> 02:19:32,894
SPEAKER_0:  And Ash Carter, the former US Defense Secretary, just died tragically and Dave was talking about...

02:19:33,218 --> 02:19:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  you know, talking together today was part of a whole team of Americans and others who

02:19:39,586 --> 02:19:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  you know, try to work with Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan.

02:19:42,370 --> 02:19:44,318
SPEAKER_0:  got them to give up the nuclear weapons.

02:19:45,506 --> 02:19:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  and back in the early.

02:19:47,490 --> 02:19:48,574
SPEAKER_0:  period of that, 1980.

02:19:48,802 --> 02:19:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  394.

02:19:50,498 --> 02:19:58,206
SPEAKER_0:  go back and I mean I was writing about this at the time I wrote a report called Back in the USSR which is you know kind of on the website of the Kennedy School with some other colleagues.

02:19:59,266 --> 02:20:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  And we were monitoring how there was all these accusations coming out of Moscow, the defence ministry and the Duma, the parliament and others, that Ukraine was trying to find a way of making a dirty bomb.

02:20:10,018 --> 02:20:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  using its nuclear weapons.

02:20:11,586 --> 02:20:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  becoming a menace and Ukraine might have to be brought to order.

02:20:16,834 --> 02:20:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  So a lot of the dynamics we're seeing now were happening then.

02:20:19,458 --> 02:20:20,638
SPEAKER_0:  irrespective of NATO.

02:20:21,410 --> 02:20:22,078
SPEAKER_0:  Basically.

02:20:22,434 --> 02:20:25,182
SPEAKER_0:  The problem was always Ukraine getting away.

02:20:25,698 --> 02:20:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  Yeltsin himself, when he unraveled the Soviet Union, didn't really want it to unravel.

02:20:29,954 --> 02:20:33,534
SPEAKER_0:  But he didn't have the wherewithal to bring the countries back again. Russia was weak.

02:20:33,986 --> 02:20:36,734
SPEAKER_0:  after the collapse of the Soviet Union, its economy imploded.

02:20:37,314 --> 02:20:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  It had to give sovereignty to all of these constituent parts of

02:20:40,866 --> 02:20:44,798
SPEAKER_0:  the Russian Federation in terms of a sort of devolution of authority at the war in Chechnya.

02:20:45,026 --> 02:20:49,086
SPEAKER_0:  which Yeltsin stupidly sparked off in 1994.

02:20:49,506 --> 02:20:52,734
SPEAKER_0:  You had Tatarstan, one of the regions, the old rich regions.

02:20:53,154 --> 02:20:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  You know basically

02:20:54,946 --> 02:20:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  resting out a kind of a.

02:20:56,898 --> 02:21:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  a bilateral treaty with Moscow. The whole place seemed like it was falling apart, so that you couldn't do anything on Ukraine.

02:21:03,938 --> 02:21:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  because you didn't have the wherewithal to do it. And then when, you know, kind of basically Russia starts to get its act back together again.

02:21:10,338 --> 02:21:11,262
SPEAKER_0:  all of these.

02:21:11,490 --> 02:21:12,254
SPEAKER_0:  Security.

02:21:12,738 --> 02:21:21,630
SPEAKER_0:  nationalists types who had never wanted Ukraine or Belarus or Moldova or anywhere else to kind of move away. They didn't worry that much about central Asia to be frank, but they know they did want.

02:21:21,986 --> 02:21:24,990
SPEAKER_0:  you know, the core states in their view to come back.

02:21:25,218 --> 02:21:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  And Moldova was part of that, even if it's not Slavic, but they wanted.

02:21:28,770 --> 02:21:29,630
SPEAKER_0:  Belarus and

02:21:29,858 --> 02:21:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  Northern Kazakhstan and probably Kazakhstan as well, which wasn't really thought about being part of Central Asia, back in the fold as close as possible.

02:21:36,930 --> 02:21:38,014
SPEAKER_0:  So anything.

02:21:38,242 --> 02:21:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  Look, Gabe.

02:21:39,138 --> 02:21:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  those countries an alternative.

02:21:41,634 --> 02:21:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  was seen as negative.

02:21:43,458 --> 02:21:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  It could have been an association.

02:21:45,954 --> 02:21:46,750
SPEAKER_0:  with China.

02:21:46,978 --> 02:21:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  of them joining an association with Latin America or Africa or something else like that. But of course, NATO has all of those larger connotations of it being into the Cold War.

02:21:57,122 --> 02:22:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  opposing entity and Putin has always seen NATO.

02:22:01,378 --> 02:22:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  as being the direct correlation of the Warsaw Pact.

02:22:04,098 --> 02:22:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  which is, in other words, just something dominated completely by the United States.

02:22:08,930 --> 02:22:11,742
SPEAKER_0:  Now that of course is why getting back to Trump again, Trump was always going

02:22:12,002 --> 02:22:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  to the Europeans, if this is really supposed to be collective security in a mutual defence pact, why are you guys not paying?

02:22:17,538 --> 02:22:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  You know, why does the US and the States pay for everything?

02:22:19,970 --> 02:22:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  But you know, NATO was actually conceived as collective defense.

02:22:23,490 --> 02:22:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  in a mutual.

02:22:24,610 --> 02:22:25,278
SPEAKER_0:  security.

02:22:25,794 --> 02:22:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  And it was set up by the United States along with the UK and France and...

02:22:30,690 --> 02:22:33,470
SPEAKER_0:  you know, Germany and Turkey and, you know, other countries.

02:22:33,730 --> 02:22:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  And we see that now with the entry of Finland and Sweden. They didn't have to join NATO. They didn't want to join NATO for a long time. They wanted to partner with it, just like Israel and other countries partner with NATO.

02:22:44,898 --> 02:22:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  But once they thought that their security was really at risk, they wanted to be part of it.

02:22:48,930 --> 02:22:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  And so, you know, kind of, you're now really seeing, you know, that Nate was something other than just being.

02:22:54,146 --> 02:22:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  you know, a creature.

02:22:56,354 --> 02:23:01,022
SPEAKER_0:  or an instrument of the United States. But that's how Putin always saw it. So, you know, what-

02:23:01,794 --> 02:23:04,158
SPEAKER_0:  This debate about murder is all about.

02:23:04,514 --> 02:23:05,694
SPEAKER_0:  Russia being provoked.

02:23:06,498 --> 02:23:09,278
SPEAKER_0:  is wanting to kind of return to an old superpower.

02:23:10,018 --> 02:23:11,582
SPEAKER_0:  bipolar relationship.

02:23:11,938 --> 02:23:14,302
SPEAKER_0:  where everything is negotiated with the United States.

02:23:14,946 --> 02:23:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  It's to try to deny that Ukraine or Belarus, well Belarus has been absorbed by this point, by Russia or Moldova or Kazakhstan or...

02:23:23,010 --> 02:23:24,990
SPEAKER_0:  any of the other countries have any kind of urgency.

02:23:25,410 --> 02:23:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  not even Poland or Hungary or, you know, kind of.

02:23:29,090 --> 02:23:29,886
SPEAKER_0:  France and Britain.

02:23:31,234 --> 02:23:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  For years and years and years.

02:23:33,698 --> 02:23:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  senior people like Putin and

02:23:35,554 --> 02:23:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  people around the Kremlin have demanded a return to the kind of what they call the old concert of Europe.

02:23:40,578 --> 02:23:41,918
SPEAKER_0:  or the concert of Vienna where.

02:23:42,402 --> 02:23:43,134
SPEAKER_0:  big guys.

02:23:44,258 --> 02:23:48,062
SPEAKER_0:  which now means the United States and Russia just sit down and thrash everything out.

02:23:48,962 --> 02:23:50,558
SPEAKER_0:  And so, I mean, Putin vibe.

02:23:50,850 --> 02:23:53,822
SPEAKER_0:  saying, look, it was provoked. It's the United States. It's NATO.

02:23:54,338 --> 02:23:57,246
SPEAKER_0:  it's a proxy war or it's this or it's that or...

02:23:57,570 --> 02:24:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  This is going to be a nuclear confrontation. It's like the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Euro Missile Crisis. It's basically just saying...

02:24:03,362 --> 02:24:04,958
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I want to go back to when...

02:24:05,378 --> 02:24:09,150
SPEAKER_0:  The Soviet Union and the United States work things out. I want to go back to the whole.

02:24:09,410 --> 02:24:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  in a period of the 1980s when Gorbachev and Reagan just kind of got together and figured things out.

02:24:13,890 --> 02:24:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  or even better...

02:24:15,650 --> 02:24:16,350
SPEAKER_0:  Back to...

02:24:16,834 --> 02:24:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  Yelta Potsdam and Tehran.

02:24:18,914 --> 02:24:20,670
SPEAKER_0:  on the big, you know, meetings.

02:24:21,442 --> 02:24:29,918
SPEAKER_0:  at the end of World War II, where we resolved the whole future security. We've had a war, we've had the Cold War, now we've got another war, we've got a real war, a hot war, we've got a war in Ukraine.

02:24:30,306 --> 02:24:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  It should be the United States.

02:24:32,002 --> 02:24:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  and Russia that sought this out.

02:24:33,954 --> 02:24:39,230
SPEAKER_0:  So this is where we see the United States waffling about as well, trying to kind of like figure out how to handle this because...

02:24:40,578 --> 02:24:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  It has to be handled in a way that Ukraine has agency. Because if Ukraine doesn't have agency, nobody else has agency either. Nobody else has any kind of decision making power.

02:24:48,674 --> 02:24:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  And we have an environment in which Putin thinks that there's only really three players.

02:24:53,442 --> 02:24:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  as the United States.

02:24:54,850 --> 02:24:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  and Russia and China.

02:24:56,482 --> 02:24:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  And maybe occasionally it might be India and perhaps Brazil or some other.

02:25:00,066 --> 02:25:03,038
SPEAKER_0:  South Africa or some other country like maybe the Bricks at some point.

02:25:04,258 --> 02:25:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  you know, ultimately, it's like the old days, big powers resolve everything. And so this war is also about.

02:25:10,818 --> 02:25:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  Russia's right, Putin's right.

02:25:12,898 --> 02:25:14,270
SPEAKER_0:  in order to determine things.

02:25:14,850 --> 02:25:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  You know, strong man to strong man, big country to big country.

02:25:18,562 --> 02:25:19,678
SPEAKER_0:  and determine.

02:25:19,906 --> 02:25:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  you know, where things happen next. That's why he's talking about things being provoked since being the United States' fault.

02:25:25,218 --> 02:25:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  but aren't they parts of the United States?

02:25:28,290 --> 02:25:29,118
SPEAKER_1:  establishment.

02:25:29,346 --> 02:25:31,454
SPEAKER_1:  that likes that kind of.

02:25:32,258 --> 02:25:33,918
SPEAKER_1:  three-party view of the world.

02:25:34,050 --> 02:25:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, there's always going to be people who like that.

02:25:36,674 --> 02:25:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  pasta.

02:25:37,794 --> 02:25:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  approach of course there is.

02:25:39,362 --> 02:25:44,926
SPEAKER_0:  But then they don't necessarily dominate. That's the kind of thing that people kind of think about. I mean, Putin can...

02:25:45,186 --> 02:25:46,110
SPEAKER_0:  you know, read.

02:25:46,466 --> 02:25:51,358
SPEAKER_0:  all the various articles and he the kind of pronouncements of people. But you know, this gets back to.

02:25:51,746 --> 02:25:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  in other words, the United States operates.

02:25:54,498 --> 02:25:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  You're gonna poop.

02:25:55,426 --> 02:25:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  Putin saw that Trump wanted to have a top down.

02:25:58,722 --> 02:25:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  you know, vertical of power.

02:26:00,738 --> 02:26:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  and other presidents have wanted to have that, but they notice that this is a pretty messy place.

02:26:04,738 --> 02:26:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  and we have all kinds of different viewpoints.

02:26:06,690 --> 02:26:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  Now of course we know that in Russia...

02:26:08,770 --> 02:26:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  Everything, even criticism of the Kremlin is usually

02:26:11,362 --> 02:26:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  fairly orchestrated, usually to kind of.

02:26:13,378 --> 02:26:13,982
SPEAKER_0:  Flash out.

02:26:14,242 --> 02:26:18,526
SPEAKER_0:  what people think about things. When we had these hardliners saying we needed more.

02:26:18,786 --> 02:26:22,014
SPEAKER_0:  destruction of Ukraine not less and that the army wasn't doing enough.

02:26:22,370 --> 02:26:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  It was in many respects kind of encouraged by the Kremlin to see how people would react to that.

02:26:27,138 --> 02:26:31,166
SPEAKER_0:  to kind of actually create a constituency for being more ruthless.

02:26:31,490 --> 02:26:35,582
SPEAKER_0:  than you had before because they wanted to clamp down. In the United States...

02:26:36,098 --> 02:26:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I can say whatever I want. It doesn't mean that I'm speaking on behalf of the White House.

02:26:40,738 --> 02:26:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  And even if I have been an advisor to this president, that president, and the other, it doesn't mean I'm basically speaking on behalf.

02:26:48,002 --> 02:26:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  of the US government. But there's kind of always an assumption from the Russians that you know, when people

02:26:53,378 --> 02:27:00,414
SPEAKER_0:  you know, say this and people do advocate one thing over another, that they're, you know, it's operating, there's a lot of mirror imaging.

02:27:00,674 --> 02:27:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  think that we're operating.

02:27:02,370 --> 02:27:04,158
SPEAKER_0:  in the same kind of way. So yes.

02:27:04,450 --> 02:27:10,750
SPEAKER_0:  There are of course constituencies who think like that and would love it. It has to be back to that and there are many people out there with their own peace plans.

02:27:11,490 --> 02:27:14,375
SPEAKER_0:  all kinds of people, you know, have to push this.

02:27:14,375 --> 02:27:20,862
SPEAKER_1:  There does seem to be the engine of the military industrial complex seems to give some fuel to the hawks.

02:27:21,314 --> 02:27:22,238
SPEAKER_1:  And they...

02:27:23,650 --> 02:27:26,366
SPEAKER_1:  seem to create momentum in government.

02:27:26,498 --> 02:27:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, but other people do too. I mean, there's always, you know, kind of checks. I mean, again.

02:27:31,042 --> 02:27:41,182
SPEAKER_0:  You believe in the tension of ideas. I think there was a lot of tension. I mean, I've seen it. I've seen it inside of the government now, you know, and people can push back. And that's why I speak out and I try to lay it out so that everybody can.

02:27:41,410 --> 02:27:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of figure it out for themselves. I said the same to you as I say to everybody.

02:27:45,474 --> 02:27:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  This is how I see the situation.

02:27:47,778 --> 02:27:50,526
SPEAKER_0:  and this is how we can analyze it here.

02:27:50,914 --> 02:27:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  Now look.

02:27:51,650 --> 02:27:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  Do I think that we've?

02:27:52,994 --> 02:27:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  handled the whole Russia account for years.

02:27:56,770 --> 02:27:58,014
SPEAKER_0:  Well, no, we haven't.

02:27:58,658 --> 02:27:59,710
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, we've...

02:27:59,970 --> 02:28:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  taken our eyes off the ball many times.

02:28:02,146 --> 02:28:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  We fail to understand the way that people like Putin think.

02:28:05,282 --> 02:28:09,310
SPEAKER_0:  You talked earlier about we need to have empathy for all the people who...

02:28:09,538 --> 02:28:17,982
SPEAKER_0:  like Trump or like Biden and understand how they think. We've got to have strategic empathy about Putin as well. We've got to understand how the guy thinks and why he thinks like he does.

02:28:18,914 --> 02:28:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  You know, he has got his own context and his own frame.

02:28:22,242 --> 02:28:23,422
SPEAKER_0:  and his own rationale.

02:28:24,130 --> 02:28:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  And he is rational, he is a rational actor.

02:28:26,690 --> 02:28:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  in his own context, we've got to understand that. We've got to understand that he would take offense as something and he would take action over something.

02:28:33,122 --> 02:28:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  It doesn't mean to say that.

02:28:34,530 --> 02:28:35,262
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we are.

02:28:35,906 --> 02:28:41,598
SPEAKER_0:  necessary to blame by taking actions, but we are to blame when we don't understand the consequences of things that we do.

02:28:42,050 --> 02:28:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  and act accordingly.

02:28:43,746 --> 02:28:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  or take preventative action or...

02:28:46,050 --> 02:28:48,766
SPEAKER_0:  recognize that something might happen as a result of something.

02:28:49,346 --> 02:28:51,262
SPEAKER_1:  So you've been in the room with Putin.

02:28:52,130 --> 02:28:54,110
SPEAKER_1:  Let me ask you for some advice.

02:28:55,266 --> 02:28:57,502
SPEAKER_1:  And it's also just a good philosophical question.

02:28:57,986 --> 02:28:58,878
SPEAKER_1:  for you or for me.

02:28:59,266 --> 02:29:05,982
SPEAKER_1:  If I have a conversation with Vladimir Putin right now, can you advise on what questions, topics, ideas to talk through?

02:29:06,626 --> 02:29:08,478
SPEAKER_1:  to him as a leader, to him as a human.

02:29:08,866 --> 02:29:12,030
SPEAKER_1:  What would you like to understand about his mind, about his thinking?

02:29:14,978 --> 02:29:22,654
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, remember what I said before, that Putin always tries to reverse things. He wants to hear the questions that people have.

02:29:23,938 --> 02:29:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  Because remember...

02:29:25,666 --> 02:29:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  He himself.

02:29:26,946 --> 02:29:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  different points has been a recruiter, which is, you know, the way that you're operating now as well, right? You're asking an awful lot of questions. Your questions also betray, you know, often the times where you're thinking about things.

02:29:37,474 --> 02:29:39,230
SPEAKER_0:  you know, the kind of context.

02:29:40,834 --> 02:29:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of.

02:29:41,826 --> 02:29:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  Any kind of dialogue like this reveals a lot about the other person.

02:29:46,434 --> 02:29:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  And I've actually...

02:29:47,554 --> 02:29:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  often noticed in these settings that Putin likes to have a lot of give and take.

02:29:52,194 --> 02:29:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  So I think you would actually enjoy having a conversation with you.

02:29:55,586 --> 02:29:56,286
SPEAKER_0:  But again...

02:29:56,610 --> 02:29:58,206
SPEAKER_0:  he would always be trying to.

02:30:00,034 --> 02:30:00,766
SPEAKER_0:  influence you.

02:30:01,186 --> 02:30:05,214
SPEAKER_0:  Inform and influence, that's kind of, you know, part of the way that he always operates.

02:30:05,858 --> 02:30:13,374
SPEAKER_0:  So what you would have to be trying to think about, so what is it you would want to elicit information from him? You're trying to understand the guy's worldview.

02:30:13,826 --> 02:30:17,118
SPEAKER_0:  And what we're trying to also understand is if there's any room there...

02:30:17,442 --> 02:30:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  where he might compromise on something.

02:30:20,194 --> 02:30:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  So if your goal was to go in there to talk about Ukraine at this particular moment.

02:30:26,562 --> 02:30:27,230
SPEAKER_0:  I'm in one of the...

02:30:27,554 --> 02:30:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  problems that I've often seen in the sort of the meetings we've had with Putin which just ends up in sort of mutual recriminations.

02:30:33,794 --> 02:30:34,462
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of.

02:30:34,914 --> 02:30:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  know, well, what about what you've done? Oh, no, you've done that about, you know, and there's always this what about-ism.

02:30:40,898 --> 02:30:42,654
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it often say, well.

02:30:43,138 --> 02:30:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  You're saying that I've done this, but you've done that.

02:30:45,794 --> 02:30:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  the United States invaded Iraq? What's the difference between what I'm doing and all of the things that you've been doing here?

02:30:53,026 --> 02:30:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, what you would have to try to do is kind of elicit.

02:30:56,098 --> 02:30:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  information about why.

02:30:57,826 --> 02:31:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  or what he is thinking about this particular moment in time and why he thinks it.

02:31:03,490 --> 02:31:08,286
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, the what about ism is a failure case. I think that shows

02:31:09,090 --> 02:31:15,326
SPEAKER_1:  from all the interviews I've seen with him, that just shows that he doesn't trust the person on the other side. No, he doesn't.

02:31:15,650 --> 02:31:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  Right, but I...

02:31:17,314 --> 02:31:19,070
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not cynical like people's

02:31:19,586 --> 02:31:22,398
SPEAKER_1:  They seem to think he's some kind of KGB agent.

02:31:22,882 --> 02:31:26,590
SPEAKER_1:  that doesn't trust anybody. I disagree. I think everybody's human.

02:31:27,330 --> 02:31:30,462
SPEAKER_1:  And from my perspective, I'm worried about.

02:31:32,098 --> 02:31:33,150
SPEAKER_1:  What I've seen?

02:31:33,602 --> 02:31:36,286
SPEAKER_1:  is I think whether it's COVID, whether it's...

02:31:37,186 --> 02:31:37,630
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

02:31:39,042 --> 02:31:42,526
SPEAKER_1:  other aspects that I'm not aware of leading up to the invasion.

02:31:42,818 --> 02:31:44,286
SPEAKER_1:  He seems to be less...

02:31:44,802 --> 02:31:46,174
SPEAKER_1:  willing to have a

02:31:46,850 --> 02:31:48,725
SPEAKER_1:  charismatic back and forth dialogue.

02:31:48,725 --> 02:31:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  an open discussion. You know, actually, I mean, I said, you asked me before about, you know, that issue of trust, and he often says he only trusts himself.

02:31:55,842 --> 02:31:56,542
SPEAKER_0:  And I said, you know.

02:31:57,282 --> 02:31:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  He's often distrustful of people.

02:31:59,650 --> 02:32:00,542
SPEAKER_0:  but he just trusts.

02:32:00,802 --> 02:32:04,254
SPEAKER_0:  some people for certain things where he knows it's within their competence.

02:32:05,570 --> 02:32:06,398
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. So.

02:32:07,266 --> 02:32:12,158
SPEAKER_0:  He has people he trusts to do things because he knows they'll do them and he knows that they'll do them well.

02:32:12,546 --> 02:32:14,078
SPEAKER_0:  which is why, you know, he has his.

02:32:14,338 --> 02:32:19,998
SPEAKER_0:  you know, old buddies from, you know, St. Peter's because he's known for a very long time and he knows that they want, you know, try to...

02:32:20,482 --> 02:32:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  a fast one over him, but he also knows their strengths and their weaknesses.

02:32:23,970 --> 02:32:29,310
SPEAKER_0:  and what they can be trusted to do. I mean, he's learning that, you know, some of the people in the military that he thought were competent.

02:32:29,730 --> 02:32:31,646
SPEAKER_0:  or people on other things are not, right?

02:32:32,098 --> 02:32:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  that they...

02:32:33,250 --> 02:32:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  And he intends to actually have a lot of loyalty to people as well. Or he also kind of thinks it's best to keep him inside the tent than outside.

02:32:39,938 --> 02:32:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  and he moves them around, you know, he kind of, okay, you know, he gives them multiple chances to redeem themselves if they don't. It's not like he...

02:32:47,106 --> 02:32:55,582
SPEAKER_0:  has him done in? I mean, there is a lot of that in the system. But the people that he's worked with for a long time, he moves them around to something else, perhaps where they can do less harm. Although...

02:32:56,226 --> 02:32:57,246
SPEAKER_0:  We often see that.

02:32:57,570 --> 02:33:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  He has quite a small cadre of people that he's reliant on, and they're not up to the task, which is kind of what's happening here.

02:33:04,770 --> 02:33:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  But also...

02:33:05,986 --> 02:33:07,102
SPEAKER_0:  in the past has been.

02:33:07,522 --> 02:33:10,750
SPEAKER_0:  more straightforward, just like you were saying here, more pragmatic.

02:33:11,970 --> 02:33:13,822
SPEAKER_0:  And I think, you know, if you were engaged with him...

02:33:14,146 --> 02:33:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  in Russian.

02:33:15,298 --> 02:33:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  where you're actually literally speaking the same language because there's so much lost in translation.

02:33:20,002 --> 02:33:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  I used to jump out of my skin listening to some of the phone calls.

02:33:23,874 --> 02:33:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  because you know, the way that they're kind of relayed.

02:33:26,434 --> 02:33:27,559
SPEAKER_0:  you know, with an interpreter.

02:33:27,559 --> 02:33:29,059
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, because you listen to the translation.

02:33:29,059 --> 02:33:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  I'm listening to them. No, because I know I'm listening to the Russian and the translation. And the translation. I'm listening to the Russian and the translation.

02:33:34,434 --> 02:33:40,798
SPEAKER_0:  And I haven't been at a translators institute. It's really difficult. Look, an interpreter is a trend in the moment to do something.

02:33:41,026 --> 02:33:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  you know, the synchronicity, the synchronized or the real-time translation.

02:33:48,386 --> 02:33:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  It's a translation.

02:33:49,826 --> 02:33:51,262
SPEAKER_0:  is an art as well as a skill.

02:33:52,098 --> 02:33:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  Mm-hmm.

02:33:53,378 --> 02:33:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  Simultaneous translation, that's the word in English, synchronicity in Russian.

02:33:58,210 --> 02:34:04,798
SPEAKER_0:  you're kind of focused in the moment on the fragments of the discussion, trying to render it as accurately as you possibly can.

02:34:05,634 --> 02:34:09,342
SPEAKER_0:  And when you come out of that, you can't relay the entire conversation.

02:34:10,178 --> 02:34:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  And often, you know, what translators do is they, you know, they take this little short hand note like journalists do.

02:34:14,818 --> 02:34:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  Afterwards, they've just been caught up in the moment and they haven't got the big picture.

02:34:20,354 --> 02:34:24,254
SPEAKER_0:  consecutive translation is different, you know, kind of you're trying to convey.

02:34:24,546 --> 02:34:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  the whole mood of big chunks of dialogue that have already been there. But sometimes you might not get that right either. And it breaks up the flow of the discussion.

02:34:33,474 --> 02:34:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  That's terrible.

02:34:34,626 --> 02:34:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  And often it's the kind of the person who translates it's different. You know, some of our best translators are women.

02:34:41,282 --> 02:34:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  but you know, hearing a woman's voice.

02:34:43,234 --> 02:34:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  you know, translating a guy who has a particular guys way of speaking.

02:34:47,298 --> 02:34:50,782
SPEAKER_0:  and a macho way of speaking and a crude way of speaking.

02:34:51,010 --> 02:34:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  It'll be that Putin or I've seen that happen with Erdogan, the president of Turkey.

02:34:56,066 --> 02:35:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  and it gets translated by a much more refined female speaker, you've just lost the whole thing.

02:35:02,690 --> 02:35:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  And many of the translators on the Russian side...

02:35:05,826 --> 02:35:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  and not.

02:35:06,530 --> 02:35:14,302
SPEAKER_0:  competent in English in the way that you would hope they are. It's not just that they're not native speakers. They're just not trained to the same high standards they used to be in the past.

02:35:15,138 --> 02:35:18,750
SPEAKER_0:  and you just lose the nuance, you lose the feel.

02:35:19,202 --> 02:35:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  you almost need the interpretive actor doing the kind of the...

02:35:24,834 --> 02:35:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  the interpretation for that, you need to match it as much as you can in the way that you do voiceovers in film.

02:35:31,554 --> 02:35:33,022
SPEAKER_0:  Best way to talk to Putin.

02:35:33,602 --> 02:35:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  is.

02:35:34,594 --> 02:35:35,422
SPEAKER_0:  One on one.

02:35:36,482 --> 02:35:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  in his own language. I have a really great friend here who is one of the best interpreters of Putin is often asked by the media.

02:35:44,674 --> 02:35:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  to interpret farm.

02:35:47,426 --> 02:35:51,070
SPEAKER_0:  he was at the institute that I was at, I mean I know him from that kind of period.

02:35:51,490 --> 02:35:57,182
SPEAKER_0:  And he is just excellent, just like Pavel Palashenko was absolutely phenomenal at interpreting Gorbachev. Always good.

02:35:57,442 --> 02:35:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  interpreting accurately because...

02:35:59,170 --> 02:36:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  Gorbachev made lots of grammatical gaffes and...

02:36:01,506 --> 02:36:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  sometimes was Gorbachev himself would joke that Palashenko spoke better for Gorbachev than Gorbachev could himself. But Putin is actually quite precise and careful in the way that he speaks, because there's a lot of menace sometimes to things deliberately, other times there's lots of humour.

02:36:15,426 --> 02:36:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  and he's telling a joke for a particular reason.

02:36:18,082 --> 02:36:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  And all of it is, I mean, he actually uses the richness of the Russian language and the crudity of language that can't be conveyed in English. Across the facial expressions that go along with it? Body language, the way that he sits back in the chair and slouches.

02:36:29,634 --> 02:36:33,662
SPEAKER_0:  the kind of the way that he makes fun of people and he kind of uses irony.

02:36:33,954 --> 02:36:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  Some of it is just lost and it needs to be conveyed.

02:36:36,706 --> 02:36:37,502
SPEAKER_1:  the depth.

02:36:37,794 --> 02:36:40,702
SPEAKER_1:  of humor and wit. I've met quite a few.

02:36:41,730 --> 02:36:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  political leaders like that and this week only Russian when I was traveling Ukraine.

02:36:45,922 --> 02:36:46,526
SPEAKER_1:  Um

02:36:48,578 --> 02:36:54,814
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know how you translate that. I think it's almost the other person that reminds me like that a little bit as Obama.

02:36:55,522 --> 02:36:57,566
SPEAKER_1:  There's Obama had a wit.

02:36:57,890 --> 02:36:59,710
SPEAKER_1:  and intelligence but like a

02:37:00,098 --> 02:37:02,334
SPEAKER_1:  He would smile as you said something.

02:37:03,010 --> 02:37:10,110
SPEAKER_1:  that add a lot to it, like that he's trolling you or he's being sarcastic or the gather it

02:37:10,338 --> 02:37:17,635
SPEAKER_1:  me converting into words. It's obvious that all English speakers, if they listen to Obama, but if you have to translate to a different language, I think you're going to lose a lot of time.

02:37:17,635 --> 02:37:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I mean when I watched the...

02:37:19,938 --> 02:37:32,286
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I watched many of Putin's speeches, you know, kind of just in Russian, not looking at any of the, you know, the subtitles or anything. And it's just watching the way that his body language is at the time when he's saying things, whether you smoke, you'll sneer.

02:37:32,546 --> 02:37:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  He'll laugh.

02:37:33,922 --> 02:37:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  he'll ad lib, you know, kind of from something that obviously kind of, you know, wasn't there on the prepared speech.

02:37:39,906 --> 02:37:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  and it's really critical.

02:37:41,282 --> 02:37:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  And you know, kind of a lot, some people speak, you know, like Trump, it just needs kind of...

02:37:47,330 --> 02:37:47,966
SPEAKER_0:  words.

02:37:48,994 --> 02:37:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  Puh-ah.

02:37:49,794 --> 02:37:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  putting the words are very important.

02:37:52,322 --> 02:37:57,438
SPEAKER_0:  Trumpets, the atmosphere, it's the kind of the way you feel about things, it's the buzz you get, you know, it's revving people up.

02:37:58,018 --> 02:37:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  It's the kind of slogans and.

02:37:59,938 --> 02:38:02,014
SPEAKER_0:  Putin, he's conveying a lot.

02:38:02,466 --> 02:38:03,591
SPEAKER_0:  and what he's saying.

02:38:03,591 --> 02:38:07,166
SPEAKER_1:  I think, I mean, of course I don't know much because I only speak Russian and English.

02:38:07,618 --> 02:38:11,134
SPEAKER_1:  but I have in English or Russian have not met.

02:38:12,194 --> 02:38:14,014
SPEAKER_1:  almost anyone ever.

02:38:14,786 --> 02:38:17,598
SPEAKER_1:  as interesting in conversation as Putin.

02:38:18,274 --> 02:38:18,622
SPEAKER_1:  the

02:38:19,042 --> 02:38:22,417
SPEAKER_1:  I think he shines not in speeches, but in interaction.

02:38:22,417 --> 02:38:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  with others. Yeah, when you watch those interviews and things with him, and I've been at many of these sessions, it's been hours of him.

02:38:28,290 --> 02:38:29,310
SPEAKER_0:  Hurrying questions.

02:38:29,634 --> 02:38:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  And it's like watching a boxer sparring.

02:38:33,282 --> 02:38:34,686
SPEAKER_0:  in a kind of training bout.

02:38:35,298 --> 02:38:36,446
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, come on, give me another one.

02:38:36,738 --> 02:38:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  you know, and it's kind of like he prides himself in.

02:38:39,266 --> 02:38:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:38:40,066 --> 02:38:41,246
SPEAKER_0:  He's made mistakes.

02:38:42,146 --> 02:38:42,654
SPEAKER_0:  often.

02:38:43,202 --> 02:38:47,998
SPEAKER_0:  the breadth of the issues that he's often covered has been fascinating. Nice buckle bite.

02:38:49,378 --> 02:38:52,382
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of really detailed notes about this because you learn a term.

02:38:52,994 --> 02:38:54,686
SPEAKER_0:  but it's not about his world view again.

02:38:55,874 --> 02:38:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, he does live in a certain box, like we all do.

02:38:59,650 --> 02:39:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:39:00,450 --> 02:39:05,118
SPEAKER_0:  And again, his world experience is not as extensive as you would hope it would be.

02:39:05,538 --> 02:39:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  But that's why you have to really pay attention. That's where we've messed up.

02:39:09,442 --> 02:39:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  That's where we haven't really paid a lot of attention to.

02:39:12,610 --> 02:39:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  what he's been saying, he's been telegraphing.

02:39:15,778 --> 02:39:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  this.

02:39:17,250 --> 02:39:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  grievances, dissatisfaction.

02:39:20,226 --> 02:39:22,078
SPEAKER_0:  I'm gonna do something for years.

02:39:23,554 --> 02:39:26,366
SPEAKER_1:  And the thing is during war time.

02:39:28,226 --> 02:39:28,958
SPEAKER_1:  the...

02:39:29,282 --> 02:39:30,878
SPEAKER_1:  combined with propaganda.

02:39:31,394 --> 02:39:32,286
SPEAKER_1:  and the narratives.

02:39:33,346 --> 02:39:35,966
SPEAKER_1:  of resentment and grievance that you dig in.

02:39:36,482 --> 02:39:37,118
SPEAKER_1:  on those.

02:39:38,722 --> 02:39:43,102
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe you start out not believing it, but you're sure it's all going to believe it eventually.

02:39:43,490 --> 02:39:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  Well, you convince yourself over time. Yeah. And that makes you feel calm, but sometimes when you're telling a lie, you feel kind of Whoosh, on 1970s, The Wさん K— Rule William triple Inaccuracy Of opponents

02:39:47,746 --> 02:39:51,230
SPEAKER_0:  You're in a position like Putin. 22 years now, come at one 23 years.

02:39:51,714 --> 02:39:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  could be out there for...

02:39:52,930 --> 02:39:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  36 years.

02:39:54,498 --> 02:39:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  you become more and more rigid. I mean, this is again, you know, something that you see in history.

02:39:59,458 --> 02:40:07,710
SPEAKER_0:  You look at people through history who've moved from being left-wing in their perspectives to hard right.

02:40:08,162 --> 02:40:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  they kind of have a sort of an ossification or a rigidity emerges in their views. And again,

02:40:13,442 --> 02:40:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  I used to have these arguments with Professor Pace about Lenin.

02:40:16,226 --> 02:40:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  because he would talk about it. And I said, yeah, but he didn't change his mind from being 18. Have you not thought about that? I mean, it's like, we're not formed fully formed individuals at 18.

02:40:25,218 --> 02:40:26,174
SPEAKER_0:  We don't know anything.

02:40:26,530 --> 02:40:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  you know, something, but not everything. I mean, obviously the younger context, you know, the kind of the way that you kind of grow up, the place you grow up, the things that happen to you, the traumas you have.

02:40:34,658 --> 02:40:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, all of these have an impact, but if you don't grow beyond all of that...

02:40:38,466 --> 02:40:40,734
SPEAKER_0:  and Putin's been stuck in place since 2000.

02:40:41,218 --> 02:40:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  when he became president. It's not out and about.

02:40:43,522 --> 02:40:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of being a man of the people.

02:40:46,178 --> 02:40:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  He's not doing the kind of things that he used to do. Yeah, he gets out there and he goes to Kazakhstan and, you know, got him.

02:40:52,450 --> 02:40:53,406
SPEAKER_0:  Tajikistan and...

02:40:53,794 --> 02:40:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  He goes to China and he does this and that and then under Covid he didn't go anywhere.

02:40:57,442 --> 02:40:58,686
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, very few places.

02:40:59,138 --> 02:41:00,542
SPEAKER_0:  And so he's got stuck.

02:41:01,666 --> 02:41:06,814
SPEAKER_0:  And that worries me a lot because you could see before that he had a bit more of flexibility of thought.

02:41:07,618 --> 02:41:14,302
SPEAKER_0:  And that's why nobody should be in place forever. You should always kind of like get out there and go out there and learn a new skill, you know, kind of.

02:41:14,530 --> 02:41:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  He needs to sort of, you know, he needs to get out more and do something different.

02:41:18,050 --> 02:41:20,030
SPEAKER_1:  You had an interesting point, you've made that.

02:41:20,674 --> 02:41:25,406
SPEAKER_1:  both Vladimir Zelensky and Putin are thinking about.

02:41:26,786 --> 02:41:28,126
SPEAKER_1:  They're just politicians.

02:41:28,770 --> 02:41:31,006
SPEAKER_1:  They're thinking about the 2024 election.

02:41:31,394 --> 02:41:32,519
SPEAKER_1:  which is coming up for both.

02:41:32,519 --> 02:41:35,998
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I've said that in some of the other interviews. Yeah, that's true. That's so interesting.

02:41:36,322 --> 02:41:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I... Our election's going to be pretty much at the same time.

02:41:39,618 --> 02:41:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  as the US election. Yeah, others will be before. I mean, because sometime in that, you know, early part of the year of the presidential election.

02:41:46,114 --> 02:41:50,239
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. And also, I don't know if you know about US elections, but they actually last way long.

02:41:50,239 --> 02:41:53,239
SPEAKER_0:  Well, they got grown up. We're in it now, aren't we? You know, already.

02:41:53,239 --> 02:41:56,478
SPEAKER_1:  Starting. So there's going to be a significant overlap.

02:41:56,898 --> 02:41:57,438
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:41:57,794 --> 02:42:00,158
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, you know, you're right. That actually comes into play.

02:42:00,706 --> 02:42:01,886
SPEAKER_1:  in their calculus.

02:42:02,466 --> 02:42:11,326
SPEAKER_0:  I think it was one of the reasons why Putin invaded in February 2022, because it was going to be two years, I mean, he thought it'd be over by March of 2022, and he got two years to prepare for.

02:42:11,586 --> 02:42:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  the election and you've got a big boost. You've got a boost from Crimea. I mean, I didn't mention that before. I mean, one of the reasons for inverting Crimea.

02:42:18,978 --> 02:42:23,806
SPEAKER_0:  and annexing or invading Ukraine the first time, and I asked in Crimea, was, look what happened to his ratings?

02:42:24,098 --> 02:42:33,982
SPEAKER_0:  They went from kind of declining, and they were still pretty good, you know, by anybody's standards, to just rocketing off into the stratosphere. I mean, I didn't really meet anybody in Russia who thought that Alex in Crimea was...

02:42:34,466 --> 02:42:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of a bad thing.

02:42:36,354 --> 02:42:42,526
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, even kind of people who were post-Putin on so many other things, Crimea was, you know, Krimnash, they kept saying. You know, this is kind of.

02:42:42,978 --> 02:42:43,838
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we got it back.

02:42:44,290 --> 02:42:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  It should never have gone away. It was ours. But this is more complex.

02:42:49,346 --> 02:42:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  And he wasn't, I don't think at the time, planning on annexing all of Ukraine.

02:42:53,506 --> 02:42:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  when he went into this special military operation, he was going to try to turn it into what Belarus has become. Different numbers were written.

02:42:59,490 --> 02:43:03,582
SPEAKER_0:  Bring back the Commonwealth of Independent States or the Union than a new Union with.

02:43:03,970 --> 02:43:06,814
SPEAKER_0:  Belarus and Ukraine and Russia over time. But certainly.

02:43:07,906 --> 02:43:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  Remove your cranners.

02:43:09,858 --> 02:43:12,798
SPEAKER_0:  a major independent factor on the world stage.

02:43:13,506 --> 02:43:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  Consolidate Crimea and

02:43:15,234 --> 02:43:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  maybe, you know, kind of incorporate Donetsk and Luhansk.

02:43:18,978 --> 02:43:21,246
SPEAKER_0:  that was also a possibility, but it wasn't.

02:43:21,890 --> 02:43:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  He wasn't in his intention, in any case, to have something on this kind of scale. He only wanted to get on with then preparing for what was going to be.

02:43:28,578 --> 02:43:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  He would think the cakewalk, the shoe in.

02:43:30,946 --> 02:43:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  of the next presidential election.

02:43:32,738 --> 02:43:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, last time around, he had to invite a bit of competition with his...

02:43:35,842 --> 02:43:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  person who's reputed to be his goddaughter.

02:43:38,050 --> 02:43:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  in your subject.

02:43:39,394 --> 02:43:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  you know, to put a bit of, you know, kind of entertainment for people.

02:43:43,138 --> 02:43:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  the next time around, maybe he wasn't really planning on running.

02:43:47,074 --> 02:43:48,446
SPEAKER_0:  you know, against any other.

02:43:48,674 --> 02:43:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  serious opposition. He was just going to have the acclaim of the great leader.

02:43:53,794 --> 02:43:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  present she.

02:43:54,914 --> 02:43:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  in China.

02:43:56,226 --> 02:44:03,742
SPEAKER_0:  Putin was basically, I think he also hoped that he would be able to devolve some authority away, you know, kind of so he's more like the...

02:44:04,258 --> 02:44:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  you know, the supreme leader kind of figure.

02:44:06,562 --> 02:44:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  the czar-like figure, the monarch.

02:44:08,450 --> 02:44:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  and then other people get on with the...

02:44:10,562 --> 02:44:11,582
SPEAKER_0:  Chief Executive.

02:44:11,970 --> 02:44:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  prime ministerial run in the country and he could kind of like step back and just enjoy this. Maybe there was going to be again a new union of

02:44:18,626 --> 02:44:19,870
SPEAKER_0:  Belarus, Russia and...

02:44:20,450 --> 02:44:20,926
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:44:21,698 --> 02:44:25,246
SPEAKER_0:  than Ukraine in some fashion, and he would preside over that.

02:44:25,890 --> 02:44:31,806
SPEAKER_1:  Speaking of opposition, you've criticized the famed Putin critic, Alexei Navalny.

02:44:32,578 --> 02:44:34,174
SPEAKER_1:  What's the nature of your criticism?

02:44:34,562 --> 02:44:37,150
SPEAKER_0:  Well, it hasn't really been a kind of a criticism in the way that...

02:44:37,442 --> 02:44:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  people have implied, but more just reminding people that Navalny isn't some stooge of the West as other people have, you know, kind of.

02:44:44,418 --> 02:44:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  depicted him in the Russian firm, but saying that this is kind of, he's pro-Western.

02:44:49,730 --> 02:44:51,070
SPEAKER_0:  He's a Russian nationalist.

02:44:51,682 --> 02:44:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  and a Russian patriot.

02:44:53,122 --> 02:44:54,334
SPEAKER_0:  you know, in the past.

02:44:54,786 --> 02:44:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  He's articulated.

02:44:56,834 --> 02:45:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  you know, things are not sort of dissimilar from some of the people around Putin.

02:45:00,578 --> 02:45:04,606
SPEAKER_0:  And it's more just reminding people that, you know, just because you kind of see somebody.

02:45:05,218 --> 02:45:11,198
SPEAKER_0:  as a kind of in an opposition figure or somebody who might be more palatable from your perspective looking from the West.

02:45:11,746 --> 02:45:14,046
SPEAKER_0:  they're not always going to be what you think they are.

02:45:14,370 --> 02:45:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  Now Alexei Navalny is a Russian.

02:45:16,642 --> 02:45:20,062
SPEAKER_0:  And in a particular Russian context, he's different from Putin.

02:45:20,770 --> 02:45:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  but he wouldn't necessarily.

02:45:22,722 --> 02:45:26,334
SPEAKER_0:  kind of run the Russian system in ways that we will like.

02:45:27,330 --> 02:45:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  So it's not a kind of a criticism, it's more of a critique of the way that we look at things.

02:45:32,450 --> 02:45:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's a mistake to always say, well, this is pro-Western or this is a liberal. I mean, what the heck does that mean, pro-Western?

02:45:38,818 --> 02:45:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, he's a Russian.

02:45:40,066 --> 02:45:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  is a Russian nationalist and a Russian patriot. He's often been quite critical about immigration.

02:45:46,594 --> 02:45:51,134
SPEAKER_0:  He's had some negative views about, you know, at one point, when I said, don't feed the Caucasus.

02:45:51,522 --> 02:45:53,214
SPEAKER_0:  kind of played upon some of the.

02:45:53,570 --> 02:45:55,166
SPEAKER_0:  you know, the racial and ethnic.

02:45:55,586 --> 02:45:58,206
SPEAKER_0:  tensions inside of Russia itself as well.

02:45:58,626 --> 02:46:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  Now he is a pluralist and he wants to have...

02:46:02,594 --> 02:46:03,486
SPEAKER_0:  you know, different.

02:46:03,970 --> 02:46:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:46:05,282 --> 02:46:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  set of political actors there, but he also isn't promoting revolution. He's not Lenin. He's not one to bring down the state.

02:46:12,258 --> 02:46:14,142
SPEAKER_0:  He wants to kind of, you know, change.

02:46:15,266 --> 02:46:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  the people.

02:46:16,034 --> 02:46:19,454
SPEAKER_0:  who are in charge, that's what he's been basically focused on and you know he might have.

02:46:20,386 --> 02:46:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  and have things done, do things.

02:46:22,466 --> 02:46:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  Been a wee elsewhere, might not like.

02:46:24,674 --> 02:46:26,814
SPEAKER_1:  And I guess the bigger picture there is.

02:46:28,642 --> 02:46:33,022
SPEAKER_1:  It's not trivial to know that if you place another human in power

02:46:33,762 --> 02:46:38,462
SPEAKER_1:  To replace the current human and power that things are going to be better. They could be a lot worse

02:46:38,914 --> 02:46:39,550
SPEAKER_1:  because

02:46:40,514 --> 02:46:42,430
SPEAKER_1:  there's a momentum to a system.

02:46:42,882 --> 02:46:46,110
SPEAKER_1:  A system is bigger than just its leader, even when that leader has

02:46:46,402 --> 02:46:47,518
SPEAKER_1:  huge amount of power.

02:46:47,874 --> 02:46:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  That's absolutely right. And he grew up in that same system. Now, he's younger than Putin.

02:46:53,090 --> 02:46:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  so he's got a different generational perspective.

02:46:56,034 --> 02:46:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  and he's not wedded to the Soviet Union.

02:46:59,106 --> 02:47:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  or some concept of the Russian Empire. He doesn't seem to spend a lot of time, I don't know what he's doing in jail, but he's probably not sitting around reading Lomonosov and the great kind of...

02:47:09,026 --> 02:47:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  tracks of Russian history. Could be, actually.

02:47:11,266 --> 02:47:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  But I mean, I think Navalny has a different worldview on a different perspective, just like Medvedev.

02:47:15,874 --> 02:47:16,574
SPEAKER_0:  was different.

02:47:16,898 --> 02:47:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  in his time and presidency and made some.

02:47:19,778 --> 02:47:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

02:47:20,386 --> 02:47:26,430
SPEAKER_0:  changes and some innovations there, but don't think that they're going to be radically different because look Gorbachev, I mean he was.

02:47:27,650 --> 02:47:30,750
SPEAKER_0:  So different from Andropov and Cheney and Co. Now this is the person.

02:47:31,522 --> 02:47:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  but he was also constrained by the system.

02:47:34,274 --> 02:47:39,934
SPEAKER_0:  And he wanted to have change, but he wanted evolutionary change. He didn't know how to do it, but he didn't want to bring the whole system down. He wanted to become a fan of Chekhov.

02:47:40,578 --> 02:47:43,038
SPEAKER_0:  when he came in after that whole period of...

02:47:45,826 --> 02:47:54,494
SPEAKER_0:  everybody trying to figure out what to do after Stalin had died and there was all this kind of back and forth and eventually Khrushchev emerges and you know he tries to make changes to the system but he's also a creature.

02:47:55,010 --> 02:47:59,454
SPEAKER_0:  of a very specific context. He's grown up in the same system, and it kind of brings...

02:47:59,906 --> 02:48:01,534
SPEAKER_0:  all kinds of elements of chaos there.

02:48:01,954 --> 02:48:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  and it's the whole thing.

02:48:03,458 --> 02:48:05,982
SPEAKER_0:  and gets into a standoff with the United States.

02:48:06,690 --> 02:48:08,958
SPEAKER_0:  that we know as the Cuban Missile Crisis.

02:48:09,474 --> 02:48:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  then eventually, you know, it gets removed.

02:48:11,394 --> 02:48:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  We're looking at what's happening in the United Kingdom right now.

02:48:15,298 --> 02:48:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  They've just churned through.

02:48:16,962 --> 02:48:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  Three.

02:48:18,370 --> 02:48:19,966
SPEAKER_0:  Prime Minister's and actually

02:48:20,194 --> 02:48:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  five prime ministers in, you know, kind of as many years, but all of those prime ministers have come out of the context of the Conservative Party in the role.

02:48:26,882 --> 02:48:28,286
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of just shades of.

02:48:28,578 --> 02:48:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  you know, the same thing. They've all come out of the same academic and.

02:48:32,226 --> 02:48:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of privileged backgrounds, even Rishi Sunak, the new prime minister, was number one—air

02:48:38,082 --> 02:48:48,190
SPEAKER_0:  you know, Indian or Anglo-Indian Prime Minister in British history. It was a kind of phenomenal, you know, kind of as a child of Indian immigrants, but also...

02:48:48,898 --> 02:48:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  person of great privilege from the same academic and party background as the others.

02:48:53,570 --> 02:48:58,046
SPEAKER_0:  So there are always differences with those human beings, but those contexts matter a lot.

02:48:58,498 --> 02:49:03,326
SPEAKER_1:  What is the probability that Russia attacks Ukraine with a tactical nuclear weapon?

02:49:05,922 --> 02:49:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  Well, Putin's definitely been thinking about it, right? I mean, he is the kind of person, if he's got an instrument, who wants to figure out how to use it.

02:49:11,522 --> 02:49:15,390
SPEAKER_0:  We look at polonium, we look at Novichok, we look at all kinds of things.

02:49:15,746 --> 02:49:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  that has also presided over in Syria.

02:49:19,042 --> 02:49:22,014
SPEAKER_0:  He has put in charge of the war in Ukraine now.

02:49:22,338 --> 02:49:27,838
SPEAKER_0:  General Svrkin is known as General Armageddon, the kind of person who pretty much

02:49:28,226 --> 02:49:32,094
SPEAKER_0:  facilitated the use of chemical weapons in Syria, for example.

02:49:32,642 --> 02:49:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:49:33,346 --> 02:49:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  don't think that Putin hasn't thought about how ruthless he can possibly be. The question is really the calculation. It's his.

02:49:41,154 --> 02:49:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  estimation of the probability that it will get the desired effect.

02:49:45,090 --> 02:49:52,638
SPEAKER_0:  We keep talking about this idea of escalate de-escalate. That's not what the Russians, you know, how they call it, but it's the whole idea that you do something really outrageous.

02:49:52,898 --> 02:49:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  to get everybody else to back up.

02:49:54,754 --> 02:49:56,478
SPEAKER_0:  Now when you talked about the precedent.

02:49:56,802 --> 02:49:58,206
SPEAKER_0:  that the United States set.

02:49:58,594 --> 02:49:59,902
SPEAKER_0:  of detonating.

02:50:00,130 --> 02:50:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  the nuclear weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

02:50:04,802 --> 02:50:08,350
SPEAKER_0:  He obviously meant the precedent of using nuclear weapons, of course, which of course

02:50:08,610 --> 02:50:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  we would then say, well, we showed them.

02:50:11,650 --> 02:50:12,510
SPEAKER_0:  how the imp...

02:50:12,834 --> 02:50:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  permissibility of ever doing that again. What he's talking about is the precedent of

02:50:17,314 --> 02:50:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  escalating to such an extent that you stop the war because he reads that saying, well,

02:50:21,314 --> 02:50:21,630
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

02:50:22,210 --> 02:50:26,526
SPEAKER_0:  US dropped the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the war was brought to a quick conclusion.

02:50:26,882 --> 02:50:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  Of course, there's a huge debate in America about whether it was necessary to do that, whether the war was ending anywhere. Did that really change the minds of the Japanese high command?

02:50:38,242 --> 02:50:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  and being written about that.

02:50:40,706 --> 02:50:44,606
SPEAKER_0:  And of course, the revulsion that people felt in the wake of that was just, you know.

02:50:44,962 --> 02:50:47,966
SPEAKER_0:  just the shock of what actually happened and we've spent.

02:50:48,450 --> 02:50:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  70 years, you know, basically coming to terms with the fact that we did something like that.

02:50:52,610 --> 02:50:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  the firebombing. We've also looked at all the bombing in Vietnam and everywhere.

02:50:58,178 --> 02:51:01,758
SPEAKER_0:  you know, all these massive bombing campaigns and realizing they actually often had the

02:51:02,018 --> 02:51:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  opposite effect.

02:51:04,802 --> 02:51:16,606
SPEAKER_0:  contributed and there's a lot of, you know, scholars suggesting it did to the end of the war. But all of the big bombing campaigns, the destruction actually prolonged wars because they made people fight back as we're kind of seeing in the case of Ukraine. So Putin has to calculate.

02:51:17,122 --> 02:51:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  The probability.

02:51:18,658 --> 02:51:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  that if he uses some.

02:51:20,738 --> 02:51:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  tactical nuclear weapon that it will get the desired effect which is get us to capitulate.

02:51:25,346 --> 02:51:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  and Ukraine to capitulate, us to capitulate, meaning the United States and the Europeans.

02:51:29,346 --> 02:51:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  not supporting Ukraine anymore, pushing towards the negotiating table and negotiating Ukraine away

02:51:34,274 --> 02:51:36,030
SPEAKER_0:  and Ukraine saying, okay, we give up.

02:51:36,418 --> 02:51:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  like happened in.

02:51:38,050 --> 02:51:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan.

02:51:41,986 --> 02:51:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  It's his calculation.

02:51:43,778 --> 02:51:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  as much as anything else, which is really important. He said, we have to show him that he won't get that out of it. It's kind of less our probability and kind of the odds of it. It's just how he calculates that probability.

02:51:54,178 --> 02:51:56,053
SPEAKER_0:  of getting what he wants.

02:51:56,053 --> 02:52:00,062
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I guess that's how the game of poker works. It's your probability.

02:52:00,482 --> 02:52:02,558
SPEAKER_1:  and your estimate of their probability.

02:52:02,914 --> 02:52:06,289
SPEAKER_1:  and your estimate of their estimate of your probability and. Yeah.

02:52:06,289 --> 02:52:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  So it goes on. Yeah.

02:52:08,226 --> 02:52:13,851
SPEAKER_1:  I think he has two tools, right? So one is the actual use of nuclear weapons and then the threat of

02:52:13,851 --> 02:52:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, the thrust is very effective.

02:52:15,778 --> 02:52:16,286
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:52:16,738 --> 02:52:17,502
SPEAKER_1:  the more.

02:52:17,922 --> 02:52:20,062
SPEAKER_1:  really you make the threat. That's right.

02:52:20,322 --> 02:52:21,662
SPEAKER_1:  This, like, uh...

02:52:21,954 --> 02:52:23,998
SPEAKER_1:  the more you approach the actual use.

02:52:24,322 --> 02:52:25,447
SPEAKER_1:  I get very close.

02:52:25,447 --> 02:52:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  She's already using.

02:52:27,330 --> 02:52:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  Chernobyl, Zaporizhzhya.

02:52:29,378 --> 02:52:29,918
SPEAKER_0:  And then.

02:52:30,306 --> 02:52:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  Usually, in Ukraine, they're the...

02:52:32,674 --> 02:52:37,854
SPEAKER_0:  nuclear reactor. So he's using civilian nuclear reactors as a dirty bomb. So it's ironic that

02:52:38,114 --> 02:52:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  He has Sergey Shoigu, his defense minister calling people up to the Ukraine to use a dirty bomb. Are you doing it?

02:52:44,130 --> 02:52:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, what is kind of more destructive than stirring up all the radioactive dust and Chernobos you send your troops through?

02:52:51,138 --> 02:52:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  for example, or shelling the Chernobyl plant and the sarcophagus and putting it at risk.

02:52:57,122 --> 02:52:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  and that Parisian you've got the...

02:52:58,722 --> 02:53:02,942
SPEAKER_0:  International Atomic Energy Agency running out there in utter panic and kind of.

02:53:03,202 --> 02:53:05,758
SPEAKER_0:  also trying to intervene in the conflict.

02:53:06,114 --> 02:53:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  So you're putting, you know, civilian nuclear.

02:53:08,674 --> 02:53:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  reactors at risk. I mean that also has a great added effect of cutting off.

02:53:12,546 --> 02:53:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  Ukraine's power supply because Zaporizhzhia in particular was

02:53:16,098 --> 02:53:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  What was it, a third of?

02:53:17,538 --> 02:53:18,462
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I'm Ukraine's.

02:53:18,914 --> 02:53:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  power generation or some really high percentage, I'd have to go back and take a look at that. But that's a twofer. It's kind of a double effect there.

02:53:27,618 --> 02:53:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  of

02:53:28,322 --> 02:53:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  undermining.

02:53:29,506 --> 02:53:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  power generation, also frightening Germans and others who've already been very worried about nuclear power and increasing your leverage on that energy front.

02:53:37,474 --> 02:53:39,102
SPEAKER_0:  but also scaring people.

02:53:39,394 --> 02:53:40,862
SPEAKER_0:  from the perspective.

02:53:41,186 --> 02:53:42,494
SPEAKER_0:  of the use of.

02:53:42,754 --> 02:53:43,838
SPEAKER_0:  nuclear weapon does.

02:53:44,418 --> 02:53:48,190
SPEAKER_0:  reactors also become a nuclear weapon tactically deployed. And as you said,

02:53:48,738 --> 02:53:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  the discussion of using a nuclear weapon.

02:53:51,458 --> 02:53:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  and engendering all those fears.

02:53:53,602 --> 02:53:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  And he's already got an effect.

02:53:55,618 --> 02:53:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  Everyone's running around talking about the Cooper Missile Crisis and secret diplomacy.

02:53:59,266 --> 02:54:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  and how we negotiate away Ukraine in return for Putin not blowing up a nuclear weapon.

02:54:03,874 --> 02:54:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  So he's got a lot of people obviously talking about that.

02:54:06,274 --> 02:54:12,382
SPEAKER_1:  Sorry for the difficult and dark question. It could be for you directly or more like.

02:54:13,026 --> 02:54:14,942
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think we have a plan for this?

02:54:15,234 --> 02:54:16,670
SPEAKER_1:  What happens if he does?

02:54:17,634 --> 02:54:18,686
SPEAKER_1:  Drop a nuclear.

02:54:19,842 --> 02:54:22,718
SPEAKER_1:  Do you have a sense that the United States

02:54:24,386 --> 02:54:25,246
SPEAKER_1:  has a good plan.

02:54:27,874 --> 02:54:28,990
SPEAKER_0:  I know we're talking about it.

02:54:29,378 --> 02:54:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  I think we probably have several plans because it depends on what, where.

02:54:33,122 --> 02:54:33,918
SPEAKER_0:  When? How?

02:54:35,586 --> 02:54:38,270
SPEAKER_1:  But don't, and also don't these things.

02:54:38,562 --> 02:54:39,710
SPEAKER_0:  I put it very quickly.

02:54:40,834 --> 02:54:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  Well, there's also signaling and signs of movement there. I mean, I want to be very, you know, kind of careful about this. But then the thing is, it's also very important that we do this.

02:54:50,018 --> 02:54:51,262
SPEAKER_0:  with other nuclear powers.

02:54:51,586 --> 02:54:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  So the other thing that's different.

02:54:53,698 --> 02:54:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  from how it might have been in the past, and particularly different from the Cuban missile crisis and the Euro missile crisis, they're not the only nuclear players.

02:55:00,674 --> 02:55:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  China has an emerging nuclear arsenal now.

02:55:03,426 --> 02:55:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  Less on the strategic side, but building it up.

02:55:06,274 --> 02:55:09,694
SPEAKER_0:  but very much on the intermediate range and tactical.

02:55:10,466 --> 02:55:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  Kim Jong-un is firing off weapons left, right and center at the moment in North Korea. We've got other rogue states. Putin's behaving like a rogue state, just to be very clear.

02:55:18,146 --> 02:55:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  And this is what we've got with Kim Jong-un in North Korea.

02:55:20,834 --> 02:55:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  We've also got India.

02:55:22,242 --> 02:55:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  and Pakistan.

02:55:23,746 --> 02:55:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  And we've got other states we're not supposed to talk about that we know have nuclear capacities and others that would like to have nuclear capacity.

02:55:30,658 --> 02:55:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  and the whole questioner here.

02:55:32,578 --> 02:55:34,238
SPEAKER_0:  is about also proliferation.

02:55:34,786 --> 02:55:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  getting back to that time when Ukraine had...

02:55:37,506 --> 02:55:38,846
SPEAKER_0:  Nuclear weapons, at least.

02:55:39,298 --> 02:55:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  there on its territory in southern Belarus and Kazakhstan, you've got to wonder, was it wise for them to give it up?

02:55:44,194 --> 02:55:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  We were worried about, you know, kind of loose nukes.

02:55:46,818 --> 02:55:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  nuclear weapons getting out of hand.

02:55:50,178 --> 02:55:52,990
SPEAKER_0:  proliferation at the time, we wanted fewer nuclear powers.

02:55:53,250 --> 02:55:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  Russia wanted that too.

02:55:54,818 --> 02:55:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  Now we're going to have more.

02:55:56,194 --> 02:55:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  We've got more.

02:55:57,218 --> 02:56:01,086
SPEAKER_0:  And what Putin is saying is, well, that was stupid of Ukraine to give up the nuclear weapons.

02:56:01,570 --> 02:56:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  In fact...

02:56:02,338 --> 02:56:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  my colleagues and I back in our report back in the US, saw kind of suggest they shouldn't give him up.

02:56:07,010 --> 02:56:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  And then that's why we had the Budapest Mamorandum. That's why the United States and the United Kingdom in particular.

02:56:12,738 --> 02:56:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  have basically some responsibility and obligation, going back to 1994 when they promised Ukraine that gave up the nuclear weapons, that territorial integrity and sovereignty would remain intact, some obligation to actually do something to step up.

02:56:26,050 --> 02:56:29,310
SPEAKER_0:  If we step back from that, this is the thing that people are not talking about.

02:56:30,466 --> 02:56:36,766
SPEAKER_0:  You know, what about nuclear proliferation? If you're South Korea, you're Japan, you know, you're any other country that's kind of worrying about your neighbors.

02:56:37,346 --> 02:56:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  and what might happen to you.

02:56:39,330 --> 02:56:44,606
SPEAKER_0:  Just like India and Pakistan are both like, we've got to kind of keep our strategic nuclear balance here.

02:56:44,962 --> 02:56:47,902
SPEAKER_0:  Everything is up for question. How does the wanted nuclear weapon?

02:56:48,194 --> 02:56:50,526
SPEAKER_0:  The Turks already want one, they've talked about one for years.

02:56:50,818 --> 02:56:53,278
SPEAKER_0:  know, why should the Iranians be the only one with an Islamic?

02:56:53,538 --> 02:56:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  nuclear weapon.

02:56:54,722 --> 02:56:57,886
SPEAKER_0:  And if we know that Iran has...

02:56:58,818 --> 02:57:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  Break up capacity now.

02:57:00,642 --> 02:57:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  Saudis and all the other states that are in opposition to Iran will also want to have some nuclear capacity. And the United States before wanted to maintain everything under the nuclear umbrella.

02:57:10,050 --> 02:57:14,814
SPEAKER_0:  What are the reasons why Sweden and Finland are joining there to us because of suddenly all of these nuclear threats?

02:57:15,522 --> 02:57:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  Sweden was actually the last country on the planet to want to have nuclear weapons. They were actually pushing for a ban on nuclear weapons in the United Nations. Now that Putin's doing the nuclear saber-rattling.

02:57:25,314 --> 02:57:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  You know, they're talking about joining.

02:57:27,266 --> 02:57:28,798
SPEAKER_0:  and are on the verge of joining.

02:57:29,538 --> 02:57:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  a nuclear alliance.

02:57:31,266 --> 02:57:33,470
SPEAKER_0:  You know, see what's happening here, so...

02:57:33,794 --> 02:57:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  We have to make it more and more difficult for Putin to even contemplate that. That's why people are saying this is reckless. This is irresponsible.

02:57:40,930 --> 02:57:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  Putin is actually making the world less safe for himself down the line either, but he's thinking short term here.

02:57:46,498 --> 02:57:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  He's thinking, what can I do? What do I actually have?

02:57:49,410 --> 02:57:51,710
SPEAKER_0:  You can also destroy lots of infrastructure as he's doing.

02:57:52,450 --> 02:57:59,614
SPEAKER_0:  You can use subversion, you know, we're worried about all of the undersea cables, all these weird things happening, you know, off Orkney or in the Mediterranean or...

02:58:00,034 --> 02:58:06,654
SPEAKER_0:  you know, all these other things that are happening, not stream to pipelines, other infrastructure, there's all kinds of other things that you can do as well here.

02:58:07,106 --> 02:58:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  It's not just.

02:58:08,770 --> 02:58:10,686
SPEAKER_0:  You know, again, this is civilian nuclear threat.

02:58:11,618 --> 02:58:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  of blowing up one of the reactors.

02:58:14,210 --> 02:58:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  Now it's gonna be.

02:58:15,202 --> 02:58:17,406
SPEAKER_0:  sure about where the wind turns and the wind blows.

02:58:18,274 --> 02:58:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  and there's all kinds of things to factor in here, but Putin is definitely sitting around.

02:58:23,970 --> 02:58:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  calculating with other people, what can I do?

02:58:26,754 --> 02:58:27,806
SPEAKER_0:  to turn this around.

02:58:28,162 --> 02:58:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, he still thinks that he can win this.

02:58:31,330 --> 02:58:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  or in other words, he can end it on his terms.

02:58:35,714 --> 02:58:36,286
SPEAKER_0:

02:58:36,578 --> 02:58:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  Done yet, Luhansk.

02:58:38,050 --> 02:58:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  Harrison, Zaporizhzhia.

02:58:41,090 --> 02:58:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  and capitulation.

02:58:42,978 --> 02:58:45,150
SPEAKER_0:  all recognized as being part of Russia.

02:58:47,394 --> 02:58:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  or he can freeze it and then kind of figure out where it goes from there, what other pressure he can put on. I mean I'm sure he's confident he can get rid of Zelensky.

02:58:56,034 --> 02:59:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  And it can prevail over us. I mean, the UK is going through prime ministers faster than I'm changing my socks.

02:59:02,498 --> 02:59:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  you know so it's like a

02:59:04,066 --> 02:59:08,670
SPEAKER_0:  He can prevail on the...

02:59:09,474 --> 02:59:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  he can have an impact on the political.

02:59:11,874 --> 02:59:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  seen in Europe and elsewhere.

02:59:13,666 --> 02:59:16,190
SPEAKER_0:  Again, everyone's talking about winter coming and...

02:59:16,450 --> 02:59:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  I know Putin's thinking, yeah, great, I've destroyed the infrastructure.

02:59:20,290 --> 02:59:20,638
SPEAKER_0:  of.

02:59:21,474 --> 02:59:22,814
SPEAKER_0:  Are you worried about the winter?

02:59:23,618 --> 02:59:25,950
SPEAKER_0:  Well yeah, but I mean look, the other thing is that we have to...

02:59:26,242 --> 02:59:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  start preparing.

02:59:27,842 --> 02:59:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  We have to start thinking about this. We've got a wartime economy situation.

02:59:32,098 --> 02:59:40,670
SPEAKER_0:  That's where we are. We've got the home front to think about as well. Putin has declared war on us. He did that on September 30th, and he's done it at other points as well.

02:59:40,930 --> 02:59:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  not paid attention.

02:59:42,626 --> 02:59:45,854
SPEAKER_0:  But he was pretty explicit in September 30th. Let me go back and watch.

02:59:46,082 --> 02:59:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  that speech.

02:59:47,842 --> 02:59:48,958
SPEAKER_0:  And, you know, he...

02:59:49,794 --> 02:59:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  is gambling that people will go back.

02:59:52,546 --> 02:59:53,150
SPEAKER_0:  You know, to...

02:59:53,698 --> 02:59:55,582
SPEAKER_0:  basically taking Russian gas and oil but...

02:59:56,034 --> 02:59:57,182
SPEAKER_0:  It's not going to be that simple.

02:59:57,634 --> 02:59:58,814
SPEAKER_0:  as well. you

02:59:59,234 --> 03:00:03,038
SPEAKER_0:  And then the question has to be, do we really kind of think he's going to play fair after that?

03:00:03,586 --> 03:00:04,734
SPEAKER_0:  when he's kind of also.

03:00:05,058 --> 03:00:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  shown that he can leverage that.

03:00:07,650 --> 03:00:11,025
SPEAKER_0:  It's such a complicated world. It is complicated. It's very complicated.

03:00:11,025 --> 03:00:14,302
SPEAKER_1:  It's never, I mean, it feels like things are heating up.

03:00:16,802 --> 03:00:17,758
SPEAKER_1:  and China.

03:00:18,498 --> 03:00:20,606
SPEAKER_1:  is very quiet right now.

03:00:21,250 --> 03:00:24,094
SPEAKER_0:  they're watching what happens. I mean for president Xi...

03:00:25,538 --> 03:00:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  It is trying to-

03:00:26,594 --> 03:00:27,454
SPEAKER_0:  consolidaties.

03:00:27,938 --> 03:00:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  even further after the party congress but

03:00:30,722 --> 03:00:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  He doesn't want to look like he made a mistake by backing Putin.

03:00:34,242 --> 03:00:35,838
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, he thought Putin was also going to be.

03:00:36,226 --> 03:00:37,054
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

03:00:37,730 --> 03:00:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  Ukraine would probably be open for massive Chinese investment. China was the largest investor.

03:00:43,234 --> 03:00:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  in Ukraine.

03:00:44,898 --> 03:00:45,598
SPEAKER_0:  before the war.

03:00:46,498 --> 03:00:49,086
SPEAKER_0:  Largest single investor, I mean the EU was bigger of course.

03:00:49,250 --> 03:00:50,750
SPEAKER_1:  How do you hope the war ends?

03:00:50,978 --> 03:00:51,582
SPEAKER_1:  in Ukraine.

03:00:52,898 --> 03:00:53,246
SPEAKER_0:  Well.

03:00:53,986 --> 03:00:55,230
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I do hope.

03:00:55,490 --> 03:00:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  it ends.

03:00:56,546 --> 03:01:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  you know, with a ceasefire and a negotiated solution, but it has to be with Russia compromising on something.

03:01:02,146 --> 03:01:04,021
SPEAKER_0:  and that's not where we are right now. Do you think?

03:01:04,021 --> 03:01:04,990
SPEAKER_1:  both sides.

03:01:05,474 --> 03:01:05,982
SPEAKER_1:  Bye.

03:01:06,338 --> 03:01:07,774
SPEAKER_1:  be willing to compromise.

03:01:08,066 --> 03:01:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  Most wars always end in that way.

03:01:10,466 --> 03:01:11,678
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, nobody's ever happy.

03:01:11,842 --> 03:01:13,822
SPEAKER_1:  but they don't seem to either side.

03:01:14,242 --> 03:01:16,867
SPEAKER_1:  like legitimately doesn't want to compromise.

03:01:16,867 --> 03:01:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  right now.

03:01:17,858 --> 03:01:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, because the thing is that...

03:01:20,418 --> 03:01:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  for Ukraine right now.

03:01:22,530 --> 03:01:23,678
SPEAKER_0:  Anything is a compromise.

03:01:24,066 --> 03:01:25,278
SPEAKER_0:  at his expense, right?

03:01:26,050 --> 03:01:27,230
SPEAKER_0:  Fust devastation.

03:01:27,906 --> 03:01:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  unbelievable casualty rates.

03:01:30,722 --> 03:01:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  biggest refugee crisis since World War II.

03:01:33,666 --> 03:01:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  Russia's just said, sorry, this is our territory, it's not just Crimea. I think there could have been a negotiation over that.

03:01:39,426 --> 03:01:43,966
SPEAKER_0:  but you know, Donetsk and Lukács. I mean, we've got all kinds of formulas we've had all the way through history.

03:01:44,322 --> 03:01:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  of

03:01:45,314 --> 03:01:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  putting things under a kind of guardianship receivership of territory, the United Nations, all kinds of different ways of formulating that, we could have easily been creative.

03:01:53,410 --> 03:01:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  for Russia's best ex-sign up. Sorry we've taken this.

03:01:55,970 --> 03:02:00,702
SPEAKER_0:  And any other negotiations, just you recognizing this for us not doing more destruction.

03:02:01,314 --> 03:02:03,262
SPEAKER_0:  That is not the basis for negotiation.

03:02:04,546 --> 03:02:09,214
SPEAKER_0:  And having people come and just laying those terms down is not a starting position.

03:02:10,242 --> 03:02:11,070
SPEAKER_0:  I think Russia...

03:02:12,674 --> 03:02:13,374
SPEAKER_0:  is also.

03:02:13,666 --> 03:02:14,206
SPEAKER_0:  Again, I know.

03:02:15,074 --> 03:02:17,982
SPEAKER_0:  dilemma of its own making now because Putin has made it very difficult.

03:02:18,242 --> 03:02:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  to compromise just by everything that he said.

03:02:21,474 --> 03:02:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  Now for Ukraine they've already won.

03:02:24,258 --> 03:02:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  a great moral.

03:02:25,634 --> 03:02:26,782
SPEAKER_0:  political and military victory.

03:02:27,810 --> 03:02:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  It's just hard to see it, right?

03:02:29,538 --> 03:02:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  at the particular moment.

03:02:31,170 --> 03:02:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

03:02:31,906 --> 03:02:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  what the Finns did in the Winter War, which the Finns were devastated by the Winter War as well but they pushed them back.

03:02:37,762 --> 03:02:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  Now the Finns lost a lot of territory, they lost Karelia and...

03:02:40,642 --> 03:02:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  huge spares of territory.

03:02:43,330 --> 03:02:44,190
SPEAKER_0:  they've got to be Finland.

03:02:44,994 --> 03:02:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  and now they're joining NATO, but they've been part of the EU.

03:02:49,154 --> 03:02:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  The question is how to...

03:02:51,618 --> 03:02:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  you know, get Ukraine to be.

03:02:53,922 --> 03:02:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  Ukraine in a success.

03:02:55,970 --> 03:02:56,990
SPEAKER_0:  But you know, it's...

03:02:57,442 --> 03:02:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  And that's the challenge, again, they've already won.

03:03:00,514 --> 03:03:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  psychologically, politically, militarily.

03:03:02,850 --> 03:03:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  Because poop doesn't-

03:03:04,642 --> 03:03:08,958
SPEAKER_0:  succeeded in what he wanted to do, but he has succeeded in completely and utterly devastating by taking advantage of heue puthite's

03:03:09,378 --> 03:03:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  And this is the kind of the old Muscovite.

03:03:12,258 --> 03:03:16,606
SPEAKER_0:  old Russian imperial, old Soviet mentality, you know, going all the way back to when the

03:03:17,186 --> 03:03:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  Muscovites were the bagmen for the

03:03:19,554 --> 03:03:25,182
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the horde, for the Mongols, it was destruction. You know, you don't play with us, we'll destroy you.

03:03:25,890 --> 03:03:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  People talk about it as mafia, but it's old. You know, all you have to go down is go and see.

03:03:30,466 --> 03:03:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublyov.

03:03:32,578 --> 03:03:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I remember seeing that film when I was first as a student in Moscow and just being...

03:03:36,834 --> 03:03:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  Whoa, this is so brutal.

03:03:39,362 --> 03:03:40,158
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, this is...

03:03:40,386 --> 03:03:42,174
SPEAKER_0:  just unremittingly brutal.

03:03:42,562 --> 03:03:43,966
SPEAKER_0:  because the whole point is...

03:03:45,378 --> 03:03:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  you show people who's the boss.

03:03:48,162 --> 03:03:50,142
SPEAKER_0:  The destruction is the point of things as well.

03:03:50,914 --> 03:03:51,454
SPEAKER_0:  because...

03:03:52,482 --> 03:03:53,278
SPEAKER_0:  you know you are.

03:03:53,986 --> 03:03:55,230
SPEAKER_0:  emphasizing your.

03:03:55,522 --> 03:03:56,190
SPEAKER_0:  Domination.

03:03:57,282 --> 03:03:59,614
SPEAKER_0:  And that's what Putin is doing right now is saying.

03:04:00,194 --> 03:04:01,342
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, you wanna go?

03:04:01,698 --> 03:04:04,574
SPEAKER_0:  in a different direction, so be it, but I'm going to make you suffer.

03:04:05,218 --> 03:04:06,494
SPEAKER_0:  Remember when Hodocovsky?

03:04:06,978 --> 03:04:07,710
SPEAKER_0:  got out of.

03:04:08,034 --> 03:04:08,542
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:04:09,026 --> 03:04:11,166
SPEAKER_0:  penal colony when Putin let him out eventually.

03:04:11,554 --> 03:04:12,862
SPEAKER_0:  He said he's suffered enough.

03:04:14,274 --> 03:04:16,222
SPEAKER_0:  but he suffered for 10, 11 years.

03:04:17,954 --> 03:04:22,407
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think Putin feels that Ukraine has suffered enough at this point, or we have suffered enough.

03:04:22,407 --> 03:04:23,038
SPEAKER_1:  apart.

03:04:23,330 --> 03:04:26,654
SPEAKER_1:  of this invasion that's punishment for something.

03:04:27,138 --> 03:04:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it's medieval.

03:04:29,186 --> 03:04:35,966
SPEAKER_0:  I mean look, we're all capable of the same things, right? There was all that destruction in... That's what Assad was like in Syria, like his father.

03:04:36,706 --> 03:04:38,686
SPEAKER_0:  you destroy because you teach them a lesson.

03:04:39,618 --> 03:04:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  And look, Britain did that in the colonial era. All the history of British colonialism is exactly the same.

03:04:45,474 --> 03:04:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, all the Mao Mao, you know, and Kenya, you know, up until recent times, brutality.

03:04:50,818 --> 03:04:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  teaching people, you know, give to...

03:04:52,482 --> 03:04:53,214
SPEAKER_0:  teaching them a lesson.

03:04:53,474 --> 03:04:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  You have to suffer.

03:04:54,754 --> 03:04:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  The US did it. I mean, we did it with the Native Americans. We did it all over the place, you know, as well.

03:04:59,362 --> 03:05:00,574
SPEAKER_0:  This is kind of what big.

03:05:00,834 --> 03:05:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  you know, state to do.

03:05:03,234 --> 03:05:06,654
SPEAKER_0:  different points in history. Just that Russia has not moved on from that.

03:05:07,426 --> 03:05:14,014
SPEAKER_0:  And we've learned some lessons later. I hope we've fully internalized them of things that we've done, and kind of the past United States.

03:05:14,818 --> 03:05:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  Ideally, you're trying to do better, and most of Europe's trying to do better as well. Think about France and Algeria, you know, again.

03:05:20,450 --> 03:05:22,590
SPEAKER_0:  We can see this in many different settings.

03:05:23,586 --> 03:05:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  But I think enough of Putin right now.

03:05:25,634 --> 03:05:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  He hasn't taught all of us.

03:05:27,202 --> 03:05:27,998
SPEAKER_0:  sufficient to lessen.

03:05:29,698 --> 03:05:30,078
SPEAKER_1:  I just.

03:05:30,466 --> 03:05:33,022
SPEAKER_1:  I talked to hundreds of people in Ukraine and.

03:05:34,242 --> 03:05:35,422
SPEAKER_1:  The Tough Thing.

03:05:36,706 --> 03:05:39,678
SPEAKER_1:  The inspiring thing is that there's a unity, the tough thing is

03:05:40,386 --> 03:05:41,790
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of them speak.

03:05:42,114 --> 03:05:43,358
SPEAKER_1:  intensity of hate.

03:05:43,906 --> 03:05:46,494
SPEAKER_1:  towards not just Russia, but Russians.

03:05:47,010 --> 03:05:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  Russians. Europeans felt about Germany and Germans.

03:05:50,274 --> 03:05:51,294
SPEAKER_0:  at the end of World War II.

03:05:52,738 --> 03:05:53,150
SPEAKER_1:  and

03:05:53,506 --> 03:05:55,166
SPEAKER_1:  generational heat.

03:05:55,394 --> 03:05:56,958
SPEAKER_1:  Like, I don't think that hate.

03:05:57,474 --> 03:05:58,846
SPEAKER_1:  is gonna pass.

03:05:59,202 --> 03:06:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  Well, it might well take a generation. I mean, I won't.

03:06:02,498 --> 03:06:03,454
SPEAKER_0:  when I was a kid in the-

03:06:03,746 --> 03:06:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  70s I went on exchanges to Germany.

03:06:06,978 --> 03:06:08,926
SPEAKER_0:  And that was like 30 years.

03:06:09,410 --> 03:06:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  more than 30 years after the end of the war. My grandfather had fought in World War I.

03:06:14,114 --> 03:06:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  wouldn't speak to my parents when they sent me on a-

03:06:16,674 --> 03:06:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  And we haven't fought World War II, we fought World War I, and we hated the Germans.

03:06:21,602 --> 03:06:27,678
SPEAKER_0:  And he did not want me going to Germany as an exchange student. He refused to meet, you know, kind of the German kid who...

03:06:28,034 --> 03:06:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  came to stay at my house.

03:06:30,146 --> 03:06:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  You know, for example, I mean, it takes a long time to...

03:06:33,090 --> 03:06:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  and it takes a long time to get over this.

03:06:35,138 --> 03:06:36,990
SPEAKER_0:  But you do, and we have.

03:06:37,378 --> 03:06:39,550
SPEAKER_0:  We have in Europe, and that was the whole point.

03:06:40,258 --> 03:06:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  of all of that kind of exercise of European unity.

03:06:44,322 --> 03:06:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  after World War II. Now the big challenge is-

03:06:47,682 --> 03:06:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  What do we do with Russia? Because a lot of people are talking about we can't have European security without Russia. That's what people are saying.

03:06:52,194 --> 03:06:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  We can't overhear.

03:06:53,602 --> 03:06:55,166
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of with Russia.

03:06:56,034 --> 03:06:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  You know, so how do we deal with this? We've got a-

03:06:59,202 --> 03:07:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  basically it's going to be like Japan.

03:07:01,858 --> 03:07:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  and Germany after World War II, after this. Just the level.

03:07:05,346 --> 03:07:08,862
SPEAKER_0:  of the atrocities that have been carried out. As you said, the level of hatred.

03:07:10,626 --> 03:07:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  But we found a way of doing it.

03:07:13,666 --> 03:07:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  Now, a lot of it will require.

03:07:15,714 --> 03:07:17,246
SPEAKER_0:  change on the part of Russia as well.

03:07:17,538 --> 03:07:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  and Russians and really thinking about this. I mean Gorbachev before I tried to do.

03:07:21,698 --> 03:07:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  in the late 1980s with.

03:07:23,906 --> 03:07:24,926
SPEAKER_0:  the black spots in.

03:07:25,858 --> 03:07:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  with glass sauce with.

03:07:27,362 --> 03:07:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  openness and talking about Russian history just kind of never sort of withered on the vine.

03:07:32,450 --> 03:07:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  as time went on.

03:07:35,266 --> 03:07:36,190
SPEAKER_1:  What gives you hope?

03:07:36,706 --> 03:07:37,726
SPEAKER_1:  about the future.

03:07:38,434 --> 03:07:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  Well, my hope comes into the fact that we've done things before, that we've got ourselves out of tough times and we've overcome stuff, and in people, because I meet amazing people.

03:07:46,914 --> 03:07:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  You just talked about hundreds of people that you've met within Ukraine.

03:07:50,850 --> 03:07:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  and people all think differently.

03:07:53,282 --> 03:07:57,406
SPEAKER_0:  Contexts and circumstances change and people can evolve. Some people get stuck.

03:07:57,890 --> 03:07:58,686
SPEAKER_0:  Putin's got stuck.

03:07:59,010 --> 03:08:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  but people can evolve.

03:08:01,122 --> 03:08:04,350
SPEAKER_0:  And I do think that if we all pull together...

03:08:04,866 --> 03:08:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  and we've seen this in so many contexts, we can find solutions to things.

03:08:08,450 --> 03:08:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  just like we get back again to our discussion about scientists.

03:08:11,298 --> 03:08:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  and just the kind of amazing breakthroughs of.

03:08:14,370 --> 03:08:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  you know, what we did.

03:08:15,426 --> 03:08:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  on COVID or done on, you know, kind of other.

03:08:18,274 --> 03:08:19,646
SPEAKER_0:  you know, diseases and things.

03:08:20,386 --> 03:08:24,254
SPEAKER_0:  there is some similarities as a pathology around war and conflict.

03:08:25,058 --> 03:08:27,358
SPEAKER_0:  Years ago in the 1990s I worked on

03:08:27,778 --> 03:08:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  know a lot of

03:08:28,642 --> 03:08:31,646
SPEAKER_0:  for projects that were funded by the Carnegie Corporation.

03:08:31,938 --> 03:08:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  of the United States under the then presidency of David Hamburg, who was a scientist.

03:08:36,930 --> 03:08:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  and actually did see a lot of parallels between the sort of like the pathology of disease and

03:08:41,474 --> 03:08:42,206
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of the.

03:08:42,786 --> 03:08:43,166
SPEAKER_0:

03:08:43,682 --> 03:08:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  pestilence, conflict kind of idea.

03:08:46,690 --> 03:08:54,462
SPEAKER_0:  And of course, these parallels, you have to be very careful because they're not neat. But there was kind of like an idea in there and how do you sort of treat this? How do you deal with this?

03:08:55,330 --> 03:09:00,254
SPEAKER_0:  And we did come up with all kinds of ideas and things that are still out there.

03:09:00,546 --> 03:09:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  We've created institutions that have helped to keep the peace. We just-

03:09:04,450 --> 03:09:05,118
SPEAKER_0:  they got to them.

03:09:05,442 --> 03:09:06,270
SPEAKER_0:  allowed them to.

03:09:06,594 --> 03:09:10,206
SPEAKER_0:  degrade just like the United Nations and we've created.

03:09:10,754 --> 03:09:11,902
SPEAKER_0:  problems inside them.

03:09:12,386 --> 03:09:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  like the veto power of the permanent powers on the

03:09:16,578 --> 03:09:19,038
SPEAKER_0:  UN Security Council, but we can change that.

03:09:19,586 --> 03:09:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  You've just got to have a will. And I do think out there, there are sufficient people with a will.

03:09:23,874 --> 03:09:28,414
SPEAKER_0:  and we've just got to get people mobilized. I mean, I'm always amazed by how people can mobilize themselves.

03:09:28,738 --> 03:09:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  around a crisis. Remember Winston Churchill, I don't quote all the time because I can never remember all his quotes.

03:09:33,634 --> 03:09:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  But I do remember the one about never let a good crisis go to waste.

03:09:37,378 --> 03:09:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  And I always think that that, you know, yeah.

03:09:39,586 --> 03:09:39,902
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

03:09:40,386 --> 03:09:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  We shouldn't let this crisis go to waste.

03:09:43,682 --> 03:09:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  and something else can come out of this. Just like in Ukraine, we've worried before about...

03:09:47,650 --> 03:09:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  corruption in Ukraine.

03:09:49,538 --> 03:09:53,790
SPEAKER_0:  Influence the oligarchs, we've got our own oligarchs here in the US we need to deal with as well.

03:09:54,146 --> 03:09:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  but this is a chance to do it differently.

03:09:56,962 --> 03:09:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it really is a chance to do things differently.

03:09:58,978 --> 03:10:01,603
SPEAKER_1:  And a part of that is young people. I have to ask.

03:10:01,603 --> 03:10:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  And as young people, I mean, I'm feeling a bit on the older side now, but I still feel I've got a bit of youth within me yet. I'm 57, I'm not that old, but I'm not that young. But we have to work together with younger and older people. We've got to work together in coalitions of, you know, across generations.

03:10:16,258 --> 03:10:22,814
SPEAKER_1:  You remind me of kids who just graduated college and say, I feel old.

03:10:23,778 --> 03:10:24,318
SPEAKER_1:  So yeah.

03:10:24,450 --> 03:10:33,950
SPEAKER_0:  No. I don't actually feel old, but it is a number, age, and you know, when you kind of think about when I was. I thought you don't like math. Yeah, yeah. I know what it's like and things like that. Yeah, but I think it's kind of interesting.

03:10:34,274 --> 03:10:39,710
SPEAKER_0:  But you know, when I was a little kid, I kept thinking about the year 2000 and I thought, oh my God, I'll be dead, I'll be 35.

03:10:39,938 --> 03:10:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

03:10:40,546 --> 03:10:41,534
SPEAKER_0:

03:10:41,826 --> 03:10:43,070
SPEAKER_0:  22 years ago.

03:10:43,714 --> 03:10:44,670
SPEAKER_1:  You've overcome.

03:10:45,218 --> 03:10:46,654
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of struggle in your life.

03:10:47,554 --> 03:10:49,918
SPEAKER_1:  based on different reasons as you write about.

03:10:50,338 --> 03:10:50,782
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

03:10:52,130 --> 03:10:53,662
SPEAKER_1:  class being one of them.

03:10:54,562 --> 03:10:55,006
SPEAKER_1:  You're f-

03:10:55,330 --> 03:10:59,198
SPEAKER_1:  funny sounding accent being another or just representation of class.

03:10:59,746 --> 03:11:01,054
SPEAKER_1:  But in general...

03:11:01,890 --> 03:11:02,750
SPEAKER_1:  through all of that.

03:11:03,554 --> 03:11:04,190
SPEAKER_1:  to be.

03:11:04,418 --> 03:11:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  at the White House.

03:11:06,338 --> 03:11:08,862
SPEAKER_1:  to be one of the most powerful voices.

03:11:09,570 --> 03:11:10,526
SPEAKER_1:  in the world.

03:11:11,202 --> 03:11:12,830
SPEAKER_1:  What advice would you give from?

03:11:13,346 --> 03:11:17,886
SPEAKER_1:  grounded in your life story to somebody who's young, somebody who's in high school and college.

03:11:18,370 --> 03:11:20,062
SPEAKER_1:  thinking of how they can have a big.

03:11:20,514 --> 03:11:22,014
SPEAKER_1:  positive impact on the world.

03:11:22,178 --> 03:11:23,262
SPEAKER_0:  Look, we all have a voice.

03:11:24,034 --> 03:11:27,646
SPEAKER_0:  We all have agency. We all actually have the ability to do something.

03:11:28,290 --> 03:11:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  And you can start small in your local community or even in your own classroom, just helping somebody else out or speaking up and advocating on behalf of things.

03:11:37,602 --> 03:11:44,190
SPEAKER_0:  When I was about 11 years old, I got involved with other kids on Save the Whales.

03:11:44,674 --> 03:11:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  We were hardly Greta Thunberg, but we kind of got together in a kind of network writing to people and trying to raise money to...

03:11:51,266 --> 03:11:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  you know, helped save the whales. www.Illuminati

03:11:53,698 --> 03:11:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  of the world out.

03:11:54,626 --> 03:11:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  doing somewhat better. I can't say that that was because of me and my network, but...

03:11:59,010 --> 03:12:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  It was kind of a way of organizing.

03:12:01,538 --> 03:12:06,270
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of joining in at a larger movement. Everybody can be part of something bigger.

03:12:06,658 --> 03:12:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  The thing is, it's all about working together with others and giving other people a chance as well.

03:12:11,426 --> 03:12:12,158
SPEAKER_0:  I think in a one.

03:12:12,738 --> 03:12:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  is that our voices...

03:12:15,298 --> 03:12:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  have more impact when they're amplified. They don't have to be the voices of discord or the voices of hate.

03:12:21,410 --> 03:12:27,454
SPEAKER_0:  You've been trying to do this with your podcast, kind of give people a voice, give them a kind of platform.

03:12:28,034 --> 03:12:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  and get them to join in with other people.

03:12:30,978 --> 03:12:38,750
SPEAKER_0:  And one of the things that I've been trying to do is kind of go and talk to just as many people as I possibly can and say, look, you know, we can all do something here.

03:12:39,490 --> 03:12:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  We can all, you know, lend our voices to a cause that we care deeply about. We can be kind to each other.

03:12:44,802 --> 03:12:49,918
SPEAKER_0:  We can give other people a chance. We can kind of speak out while we see that, you know, something is wrong and we can try to...

03:12:50,146 --> 03:12:51,518
SPEAKER_0:  You know, explain things to people.

03:12:52,002 --> 03:12:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  And what I'm trying to do at the moment is just sort of explain, you know, what I've learned about things and

03:12:57,186 --> 03:12:58,814
SPEAKER_0:  I hope that that helps people.

03:12:59,042 --> 03:13:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  make informed judgments of their own and that, you know, kind of maybe take things further and learn something more. That's like kind of building upon.

03:13:05,890 --> 03:13:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  you know, the knowledge.

03:13:07,458 --> 03:13:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  you know, that I have, you know, to try to impart, but everybody can do that different ways. You can kind of reach back.

03:13:13,474 --> 03:13:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, if you're 14, help somebody who's 7.

03:13:15,458 --> 03:13:17,310
SPEAKER_0:  The 21 helps someone use 14.

03:13:17,634 --> 03:13:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  You know, kind of in the kind of my age now I'm always trying to.

03:13:21,890 --> 03:13:23,006
SPEAKER_0:  you know, reach back and...

03:13:23,682 --> 03:13:28,958
SPEAKER_0:  work with younger people, listen to younger people, help them out, make connections for them.

03:13:29,506 --> 03:13:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  listen to what they have to say about something, try to incorporate that in the things that I'm saying as well. The main point is that we've all got a voice, we've all got agency.

03:13:37,538 --> 03:13:40,318
SPEAKER_0:  and it always works better when we work together with other people.

03:13:40,546 --> 03:13:43,838
SPEAKER_1:  but sometimes it can feel pretty hopeless. It can feel...

03:13:44,610 --> 03:13:48,670
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, there's low points. You seem to have a kind of a-

03:13:49,154 --> 03:13:52,126
SPEAKER_1:  Restless energy, a drive to you.

03:13:52,578 --> 03:13:55,198
SPEAKER_1:  where there are low points in the beginning when...

03:13:56,162 --> 03:13:56,766
SPEAKER_1:  um

03:13:58,402 --> 03:14:01,726
SPEAKER_1:  in your early days when you're trying to get the education where...

03:14:02,018 --> 03:14:05,822
SPEAKER_1:  it may have not been clear to you that you could be at all successful.

03:14:06,306 --> 03:14:10,558
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, there were always, there were lots of points where I was just despondent.

03:14:10,882 --> 03:14:13,022
SPEAKER_0:  But then, you know, I'd meet somebody.

03:14:13,730 --> 03:14:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  who would just suddenly turn things around. I was this look or was I out there looking for it? You know, sometimes.

03:14:19,394 --> 03:14:27,198
SPEAKER_0:  you know, you just, if you're open and receptive to, you know, kind of, uh, hearing something from someone else, I mean, I, you know, the oftentimes I felt so despondent.

03:14:27,554 --> 03:14:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  in such a black mood I didn't think I'd be able to go on and then I'd have a chance conversation with somebody.

03:14:32,866 --> 03:14:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I once remember, you know, I was sitting on the bench, I was probably 11 or 12, just crying my eyes out, just really upset, and an old lady just came and sat next to me.

03:14:39,778 --> 03:14:42,846
SPEAKER_0:  put her arm around me and said, oh, it's all right pet, what's the matter?

03:14:43,234 --> 03:14:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  know, it can't be that bad, can it? And it was just this...

03:14:45,666 --> 03:14:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  Human.

03:14:46,562 --> 03:14:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  embrace. It's like somebody...

03:14:48,962 --> 03:14:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  you know, just basically reaching out to me that snapped me out of it.

03:14:52,930 --> 03:14:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  And I thought, you know, here's somebody just, you know, she didn't know who I was. She just felt really bad that I was.

03:14:57,026 --> 03:14:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  you know, sitting.

03:14:58,178 --> 03:14:59,134
SPEAKER_0:  you know, crying and...

03:14:59,458 --> 03:15:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  I mean I can't even remember what it was about anymore.

03:15:01,474 --> 03:15:05,406
SPEAKER_0:  Now it just seems inconsequential at the time. I probably thought my life was at an end.

03:15:06,082 --> 03:15:08,670
SPEAKER_0:  you know, sometimes people making out contact with him in the street.

03:15:09,122 --> 03:15:11,710
SPEAKER_0:  and saying something to you can kind of pull you out of something.

03:15:12,674 --> 03:15:14,366
SPEAKER_0:  And, you know, it's kind of a...

03:15:14,946 --> 03:15:20,094
SPEAKER_0:  I think you would just have to open yourself up to the prospect that not everyone's bad, just like you were saying before, that there's...

03:15:20,322 --> 03:15:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  you know, goes in everybody.

03:15:21,954 --> 03:15:25,598
SPEAKER_0:  even during that really difficult period of impeachment.

03:15:25,826 --> 03:15:27,742
SPEAKER_0:  I was trying to listen very carefully to people.

03:15:28,354 --> 03:15:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  And I thought, we always, we still have something in common here.

03:15:32,098 --> 03:15:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  We need to remember that.

03:15:34,082 --> 03:15:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of when people are kind of forgetting who they are or, you know, the context in their operating.

03:15:39,586 --> 03:15:41,086
SPEAKER_0:  There's always something that can.

03:15:41,474 --> 03:15:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  can pull you back again, there's always that kind of thread.

03:15:44,386 --> 03:15:46,878
SPEAKER_1:  So I'm sure you were probably attacked.

03:15:47,906 --> 03:15:48,638
SPEAKER_1:  By Allah.

03:15:49,026 --> 03:15:49,598
SPEAKER_1:  people.

03:15:50,498 --> 03:15:53,342
SPEAKER_1:  and you're still able to keep that optimism that.

03:15:53,858 --> 03:16:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I kept it into kind of perspective. Like when I was a kid, I mean, things were going to mention before I got bullied, you know, kind of again, and I tried to win some, why they're doing this.

03:16:02,626 --> 03:16:03,102
SPEAKER_0:  One of the-

03:16:03,362 --> 03:16:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  Most amazing things.

03:16:05,346 --> 03:16:08,702
SPEAKER_0:  that happened, you know, really almost my dad was a pretty incredible person.

03:16:08,962 --> 03:16:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  He would always open my eyes to something. I was getting bullied really nasty by a girl at school.

03:16:13,826 --> 03:16:15,582
SPEAKER_0:  and my dad started asking me questions about her.

03:16:16,610 --> 03:16:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:16:17,666 --> 03:16:19,838
SPEAKER_0:  one day my dad's going to go for a walk.

03:16:20,866 --> 03:16:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  and my town is very small. Remember it's very depressed, really you know, a deprived area.

03:16:24,898 --> 03:16:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  and we go to this.

03:16:26,562 --> 03:16:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  housing estate, public housing place that's not too far away from where I live. And it's really, you know, kind of one of the most rundown places and already rundown place.

03:16:34,402 --> 03:16:36,766
SPEAKER_0:  My dad knocks on the door and I said, what are we doing dad?

03:16:36,994 --> 03:16:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  He says, we're going to visit somebody, an old family friend.

03:16:42,050 --> 03:16:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  I think they were even a distant relative. We're knocking the door and this old man answers the door and he's, oh Alfie. I don't know, his name is Alf Alfie.

03:16:48,834 --> 03:16:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  You know, kind of, ah, fancy seeing you here, haven't seen you, come on in, have a cup of tea, what you doing? Said, oh, I'm just walking past my daughter, we're going for a trip.

03:16:55,842 --> 03:16:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  There we're going for a walk and then suddenly I see that girl.

03:16:59,394 --> 03:17:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  and she's in the kitchen.

03:17:00,930 --> 03:17:01,502
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm thinking.

03:17:02,050 --> 03:17:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  Oh my.

03:17:03,106 --> 03:17:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  Bloody hell, you know, British expression, what's this?

03:17:05,922 --> 03:17:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  And it turns out that Dad had figured out who she was.

03:17:09,346 --> 03:17:19,678
SPEAKER_0:  And he knew her grandfather and she was living with her grandfather and she'd been abandoned by her parents and she was living in pretty dire circumstances and she'd been getting raised by her grandfather and she was just miserable.

03:17:20,578 --> 03:17:23,102
SPEAKER_0:  And the reason she was bullying me was to make herself feel better.

03:17:23,554 --> 03:17:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

03:17:24,130 --> 03:17:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  And after that, she never bullied me again. She told me we didn't even talk.

03:17:28,002 --> 03:17:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  because there was a connection mode.

03:17:29,474 --> 03:17:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  and suddenly she realized that her grandfather was the only person she had.

03:17:33,666 --> 03:17:34,974
SPEAKER_0:  knew my dad and there was some...

03:17:35,394 --> 03:17:47,358
SPEAKER_0:  they were friends or they were even family, some kind of relationship there. I mean, I was raised half of North of England, I had no idea how we were related. Everybody was some relative because people have lived there for generations to get in this very small area.

03:17:47,746 --> 03:17:50,526
SPEAKER_0:  And that turned things around. Just remember you might have.

03:17:51,010 --> 03:17:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  And that's kind of suddenly taught to me this.

03:17:52,834 --> 03:17:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  always a reason why somebody's doing something. A lot of the times they're really unhappy with themselves. So there's something else going on in their lives.

03:17:58,850 --> 03:18:00,414
SPEAKER_0:  Sometimes they just don't know any better.

03:18:00,962 --> 03:18:02,590
SPEAKER_0:  and I shouldn't take it personally.

03:18:03,138 --> 03:18:07,614
SPEAKER_0:  Because I don't have a personal connection with half these people who are out there saying that they want this and that to happen to me.

03:18:08,610 --> 03:18:16,158
SPEAKER_1:  Well, thank you for the kindness and empathy you still carry in your heart. I can see it through all that you must have gone through in the recent couple of years.

03:18:16,610 --> 03:18:18,462
SPEAKER_1:  It's really inspiring to see that and.

03:18:19,010 --> 03:18:24,062
SPEAKER_1:  Thank you for everything you've done, for the work you've written, for the work you continue to write and to do.

03:18:25,314 --> 03:18:31,422
SPEAKER_1:  This seems like a really, really difficult time for human civilization on a topic that you're a world expert in.

03:18:31,970 --> 03:18:32,766
SPEAKER_1:  So, um.

03:18:33,058 --> 03:18:33,822
SPEAKER_1:  don't mess it up.

03:18:34,018 --> 03:18:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  No, I know. Let's just keep it together, right?

03:18:38,882 --> 03:18:40,007
SPEAKER_0:  Exactly. Keep it together.

03:18:40,007 --> 03:18:44,894
SPEAKER_1:  Your words have a lot of power right now, so it's a really, really tricky time.

03:18:45,282 --> 03:18:46,430
SPEAKER_1:  So thank you so much.

03:18:46,978 --> 03:18:49,603
SPEAKER_1:  given how valuable your time is to sit down with me today.

03:18:49,603 --> 03:18:53,822
SPEAKER_0:  It was an honor. It was amazing. It's a privilege and a pleasure to talk to you as well. Thank you.

03:18:54,818 --> 03:18:56,958
