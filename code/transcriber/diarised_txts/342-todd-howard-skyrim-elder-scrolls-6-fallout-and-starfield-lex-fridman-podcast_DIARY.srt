00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:03,230
SPEAKER_1:  Blink once if you know when Elder Scrolls 6 is coming out.

00:00:04,162 --> 00:00:05,598
SPEAKER_1:  but are not going to tell me.

00:00:08,514 --> 00:00:10,622
SPEAKER_1:  The following is a conversation with Todd Howard.

00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:13,502
SPEAKER_1:  One of the greatest video game designers of all time.

00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:14,846
SPEAKER_1:  He has lead.

00:00:15,106 --> 00:00:16,926
SPEAKER_1:  the development of the Fallout series.

00:00:17,154 --> 00:00:19,102
SPEAKER_1:  and the Elder Scrolls series.

00:00:19,362 --> 00:00:19,902
SPEAKER_1:  including

00:00:20,162 --> 00:00:21,502
SPEAKER_1:  Arena, Daggerfall.

00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,870
SPEAKER_1:  Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, and

00:00:24,162 --> 00:00:26,046
SPEAKER_1:  The Future Elder Scrolls 6.

00:00:26,434 --> 00:00:26,974
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:28,382
SPEAKER_1:  A totally new world.

00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,750
SPEAKER_1:  in an upcoming game called Starfield.

00:00:31,522 --> 00:00:33,790
SPEAKER_1:  Many of these have won Game of the Year awards.

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:34,686
SPEAKER_1:  and have been.

00:00:35,042 --> 00:00:38,110
SPEAKER_1:  some of the most celebrated and impactful games ever made.

00:00:38,754 --> 00:00:39,230
SPEAKER_1:  to me.

00:00:39,842 --> 00:00:40,446
SPEAKER_1:  Skyrim

00:00:41,122 --> 00:00:43,486
SPEAKER_1:  is quite possibly the greatest game.

00:00:44,162 --> 00:00:44,606
SPEAKER_1:  ever.

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,430
SPEAKER_1:  This is the Lex Friedman podcast to support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:00:50,786 --> 00:00:52,094
SPEAKER_1:  And now, to your friends.

00:00:52,418 --> 00:00:53,118
SPEAKER_1:  Here's Todd.

00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:54,046
SPEAKER_1:  Howard.

00:00:55,234 --> 00:00:56,318
SPEAKER_1:  Is it possible?

00:00:56,834 --> 00:01:00,894
SPEAKER_1:  that we are currently living inside a video game that the future you designed.

00:01:01,634 --> 00:01:04,350
SPEAKER_1:  Can you give hints as to how one would escape?

00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,270
SPEAKER_1:  if this was a video game.

00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,534
SPEAKER_1:  How can a video game character escape?

00:01:10,274 --> 00:01:11,582
SPEAKER_1:  outside the video game.

00:01:12,418 --> 00:01:14,366
SPEAKER_1:  Are these things you don't consider when you design the game?

00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  Actually, we do.

00:01:16,482 --> 00:01:18,110
SPEAKER_0:  because in the kind of games that we make...

00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:20,446
SPEAKER_0:  We want it to be as open as possible.

00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:21,950
SPEAKER_0:  So...

00:01:22,562 --> 00:01:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  You know, when you start a game...

00:01:24,098 --> 00:01:24,702
SPEAKER_0:  You're always.

00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:25,598
SPEAKER_0:  testing it.

00:01:26,242 --> 00:01:30,334
SPEAKER_0:  What can I do? What would the game allow me to do? When you check everything you try to pick up the-

00:01:30,786 --> 00:01:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the mugs, you try every door, you collide with everything like, hey, what are the rules?

00:01:35,842 --> 00:01:36,734
SPEAKER_0:  of this world?

00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:38,846
SPEAKER_0:  We try to do games where...

00:01:39,522 --> 00:01:42,526
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we say yes as much as possible that leads to.

00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,318
SPEAKER_0:  some level of chaos.

00:01:45,634 --> 00:01:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  If you were stuck in a video game, you would try everything and usually...

00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  You're gonna find a door or a space where the designers didn't anticipate you piling all those crates up and getting over a wall.

00:01:57,858 --> 00:01:58,878
SPEAKER_0:  that they didn't expect.

00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:00,126
SPEAKER_1:  Right, so it's not.

00:02:00,482 --> 00:02:01,630
SPEAKER_1:  a designed.

00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:03,966
SPEAKER_1:  doorway out. It's a

00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:07,294
SPEAKER_1:  accidental unintended doorway out. And it's a

00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:08,807
SPEAKER_1:  It's a happy bug.

00:02:08,807 --> 00:02:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  You could like Truman Show.

00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,245
SPEAKER_0:  Just get in the ocean and go till it's...

00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:14,046
SPEAKER_1:  keep going, keep going.

00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,078
SPEAKER_1:  But the more realistic the game becomes, the harder it is to find that door.

00:02:18,754 --> 00:02:20,958
SPEAKER_1:  the bigger the world, the bigger the open world.

00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  And then as we do it, we learn.

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,782
SPEAKER_0:  are going to find a way. when mostly anymore inverter

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  Don't try to pen them in.

00:02:29,762 --> 00:02:32,542
SPEAKER_0:  Usually we leave like this developer.

00:02:33,026 --> 00:02:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  test cell.

00:02:34,594 --> 00:02:37,854
SPEAKER_0:  area in the game that we don't anticipate anyone will find.

00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:39,422
SPEAKER_0:  and they.

00:02:39,682 --> 00:02:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  ultimately find it usually has.

00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  crates of all the weapons in the game and things like that.

00:02:46,018 --> 00:02:51,070
SPEAKER_1:  The little hints you drop now will just drive people mad, which is something I enjoy deeply.

00:02:51,586 --> 00:02:56,958
SPEAKER_1:  So Skyrim NPCs have at times hilarious dialogue. What does it take to build?

00:02:57,346 --> 00:02:57,950
SPEAKER_1:  A good.

00:02:58,434 --> 00:02:59,742
SPEAKER_1:  NPC dialogue.

00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:03,390
SPEAKER_0:  The main thing is to make them...

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  reactive.

00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of times when you write characters for movies or things like that, you want to make that character.

00:03:10,498 --> 00:03:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  interesting for themselves, right? what's their story?

00:03:14,914 --> 00:03:19,006
SPEAKER_0:  And there's some characters like that that the player definitely cares about.

00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:21,790
SPEAKER_0:  but the best characters.

00:03:22,082 --> 00:03:23,550
SPEAKER_0:  are the ones that react.

00:03:23,874 --> 00:03:24,286
SPEAKER_0:  to you.

00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  So you'll find a lot of people love our guards.

00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  and the guards are written almost.

00:03:30,722 --> 00:03:32,286
SPEAKER_0:  purely to be reactive.

00:03:32,994 --> 00:03:36,830
SPEAKER_0:  Hey, nice tie, I like your jacket. Do this cool watch. Hey, what'd you do?

00:03:37,282 --> 00:03:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  and so that, hey, you're the man.

00:03:40,002 --> 00:03:41,086
SPEAKER_0:  as you walk by.

00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:45,598
SPEAKER_0:  that makes them interesting or the way they react to something that you do.

00:03:46,178 --> 00:03:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  Lydia in Skyrim.

00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  who everybody loves. I'm sworn to carry your burdens.

00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  That's a generic line.

00:03:53,282 --> 00:03:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  that all of the House Carls have.

00:03:56,418 --> 00:03:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  And it just kind of lands when she says it.

00:03:59,362 --> 00:04:01,118
SPEAKER_1:  Why does it land? What are you- what are you-

00:04:01,506 --> 00:04:03,381
SPEAKER_1:  And did you anticipate it would like?

00:04:03,381 --> 00:04:07,742
SPEAKER_0:  There's a slight snarkiness in that particular read of it.

00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:10,526
SPEAKER_0:  and you're asking her to do something and...

00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  Sheez.

00:04:12,258 --> 00:04:13,150
SPEAKER_0:  reacting to you.

00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,166
SPEAKER_1:  What about...

00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,254
SPEAKER_1:  Duh.

00:04:18,178 --> 00:04:19,582
SPEAKER_1:  the trade-off between.

00:04:20,514 --> 00:04:24,510
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe the randomness and the scripted nature of the dialogue.

00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:28,350
SPEAKER_1:  Like is there any room for randomness of the dialogue tree?

00:04:28,994 --> 00:04:33,982
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, absolutely. We tend to write them in stacks with, you know, it's a very small...

00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  Think of it as a small state machine that just says, OK.

00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  This is what's happening.

00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:43,838
SPEAKER_0:  Here's a random list of things I could say to that.

00:04:44,578 --> 00:04:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  and then some of that.

00:04:46,114 --> 00:04:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:04:47,362 --> 00:04:49,022
SPEAKER_0:  plays out in ways you don't anticipate.

00:04:49,314 --> 00:04:52,254
SPEAKER_0:  But we look at the things, what are the players doing that we could have?

00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:58,014
SPEAKER_0:  the characters respond to that they don't expect you know jumping on tables are stealing stuff or.

00:04:58,722 --> 00:04:59,070
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:05:00,162 --> 00:05:04,254
SPEAKER_0:  you know, sneaking in in the middle of the night or those kind of things. The more that we can do.

00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  the more reactive and interesting the characters.

00:05:09,506 --> 00:05:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  appear.

00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,126
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,654
SPEAKER_1:  these state machines.

00:05:15,138 --> 00:05:18,494
SPEAKER_1:  How big are these things? Are these individual to the individual characters?

00:05:18,946 --> 00:05:20,574
SPEAKER_1:  It's just fascinating how you design.

00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,006
SPEAKER_1:  state machines. Is it just a just a

00:05:23,266 --> 00:05:25,726
SPEAKER_0:  I would think of the AI as one big one.

00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, for sort of everybody.

00:05:31,106 --> 00:05:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  So there's an AI.

00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  There's a manager for all the people. And one of the things that- A manager.

00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,686
SPEAKER_0:  Right, right.

00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,526
SPEAKER_0:  One of the things that makes what we do particularly unique...

00:05:43,682 --> 00:05:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  is

00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  And this is a trade-off for what people are seeing, because a lot of it's not on the screen, but we're using cycles to run this, which is.

00:05:52,546 --> 00:05:54,334
SPEAKER_0:  We're thinking about everybody in the whole world.

00:05:55,554 --> 00:05:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  all the time.

00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:58,046
SPEAKER_0:  The ones that are further away.

00:05:58,338 --> 00:06:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  at a much less tick rate, they go into low, but we know if they want to walk across the world.

00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  and we're running every quest.

00:06:06,338 --> 00:06:07,326
SPEAKER_0:  at the same time.

00:06:07,906 --> 00:06:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  Whereas in other open world games, you start an activity, the rest of the world is going to shut down.

00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:15,838
SPEAKER_0:  so that they can really make that as impactful.

00:06:17,442 --> 00:06:17,886
SPEAKER_0:  We're-

00:06:18,914 --> 00:06:22,974
SPEAKER_0:  I really prefer that the rest of it's going on. It's more of a simulation.

00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,222
SPEAKER_0:  that we're building.

00:06:24,962 --> 00:06:27,230
SPEAKER_0:  So when those things collide...

00:06:27,842 --> 00:06:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  that's where.

00:06:29,186 --> 00:06:30,878
SPEAKER_0:  it gets the most interesting.

00:06:31,714 --> 00:06:34,110
SPEAKER_0:  And so we're running all of those people.

00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  and understanding where they want to go in their cycles and what they want to do. And the ones that are closer to you, we just...

00:06:39,234 --> 00:06:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  update a lot more.

00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,246
SPEAKER_0:  One way to think about it.

00:06:42,242 --> 00:06:45,342
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, that's really fascinating. That's something that people had.

00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:50,142
SPEAKER_1:  They were wondering about to what degree it's possible.

00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:51,998
SPEAKER_1:  to run the world without you.

00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:59,582
SPEAKER_1:  So there is a feeling to role playing games that you're the central, you're the center of the world and the whole world rotates around you.

00:07:00,098 --> 00:07:03,550
SPEAKER_1:  as it does in normal life. Like when we walk around, there's a-

00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:05,694
SPEAKER_1:  when you forget yourself.

00:07:06,274 --> 00:07:09,374
SPEAKER_1:  you start to take yourself very seriously, like you are the center of the world.

00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:13,662
SPEAKER_1:  You forget that there's 8 billion people on earth and you forget that they have lives.

00:07:13,922 --> 00:07:20,926
SPEAKER_1:  That's actually a sobering realization that they all have really interesting life stories and they have their worries, they suffer and-

00:07:21,282 --> 00:07:21,918
SPEAKER_1:  different.

00:07:22,786 --> 00:07:24,030
SPEAKER_1:  complicated ways.

00:07:25,282 --> 00:07:25,854
SPEAKER_1:  And yet...

00:07:27,202 --> 00:07:29,086
SPEAKER_1:  when you play a role-playing game there's a

00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:33,054
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, both computationally and from a storytelling perspective.

00:07:33,442 --> 00:07:34,142
SPEAKER_1:  You wonder...

00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:38,654
SPEAKER_1:  if the world goes on without you. Like if you come back, if you take a break and you come back.

00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,270
SPEAKER_1:  Is there still a bustling town that now has a history?

00:07:42,786 --> 00:07:44,446
SPEAKER_1:  since you have last visited.

00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,206
SPEAKER_1:  So to what degree can you?

00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,086
SPEAKER_1:  Create a world that goes on without you.

00:07:49,346 --> 00:07:53,150
SPEAKER_1:  or goes on at the same time as you do your thing, whatever the heck you're doing.

00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  We don't prioritize the stuff you can't see, so it's more like an amusement park.

00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:04,030
SPEAKER_0:  If you study like the designer level designers did this, how do they build Disney world in these places? So it still exists.

00:08:04,994 --> 00:08:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  for you the player.

00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  So it is fairly, you know, when you're going to come in, this is what you're going to see. The shops are in the front. You're going to do this.

00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  It's just for us.

00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:16,606
SPEAKER_0:  to make it far more.

00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,094
SPEAKER_0:  believable and get some more emergent behavior.

00:08:20,994 --> 00:08:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  That.

00:08:22,146 --> 00:08:23,550
SPEAKER_0:  not just make it sort of.

00:08:24,258 --> 00:08:27,038
SPEAKER_0:  the verisimilitude of what you're in for that moment.

00:08:28,002 --> 00:08:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  but you buy it all.

00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,702
SPEAKER_0:  I always say like, you know, we got to do the little things.

00:08:33,282 --> 00:08:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  so that you buy the reality.

00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,494
SPEAKER_0:  of the virtual world you're in, so we want to do something crazy.

00:08:38,946 --> 00:08:43,646
SPEAKER_0:  you know, when a dragon lands or a death law comes out of the wasteland or those kind of things that you

00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  It has the impact.

00:08:45,538 --> 00:08:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  to you as the viewer.

00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  that it would to the people in the world.

00:08:51,106 --> 00:08:51,486
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,846
SPEAKER_1:  but still you are simulating stuff that's close to you.

00:08:55,298 --> 00:08:58,174
SPEAKER_1:  It is a bit of a simulation going on. Oh, absolutely. Yes.

00:08:59,202 --> 00:09:01,630
SPEAKER_1:  And so that creates some interesting dynamics then.

00:09:02,178 --> 00:09:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  and the stuff that we're looking at in the future.

00:09:05,026 --> 00:09:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  Our plan is to push that even more.

00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,958
SPEAKER_0:  to think about.

00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,270
SPEAKER_0:  how these things exist in the world first.

00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  And we do some of this, but even more so in the future, to say how do these things exist?

00:09:19,938 --> 00:09:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  Take like a faction in the world.

00:09:21,922 --> 00:09:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  What is their role in the world?

00:09:24,226 --> 00:09:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  as opposed to just, their role is for the player to join it.

00:09:27,746 --> 00:09:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  go through a bunch of quests and become the head of the faction.

00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  you know, think a little bit deeper about the simulation and...

00:09:34,178 --> 00:09:37,054
SPEAKER_0:  What would the Mages Guild be doing in a fantasy world?

00:09:37,858 --> 00:09:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  or the Fighters Guild be doing in a fantasy world.

00:09:41,026 --> 00:09:42,078
SPEAKER_0:  versus just.

00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:44,798
SPEAKER_0:  Sign up, do quests, get gold.

00:09:46,658 --> 00:09:49,374
SPEAKER_1:  And so that when you show up to that mages guild...

00:09:50,146 --> 00:09:51,582
SPEAKER_1:  It's a bustling guild.

00:09:52,194 --> 00:09:53,182
SPEAKER_1:  full of stuff going on.

00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,718
SPEAKER_0:  It's not just that it's bustling, it's that they feel rooted in it. They don't feel like a storefront for.

00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,086
SPEAKER_0:  Come here, do quests, get experience.

00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,886
SPEAKER_1:  Is that one of the essential components of randomly generated worlds?

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,478
SPEAKER_1:  So when I think back to Daggerfall.

00:10:09,506 --> 00:10:10,974
SPEAKER_1:  gigantic world.

00:10:11,394 --> 00:10:13,086
SPEAKER_1:  When I first played it, I thought like...

00:10:14,306 --> 00:10:14,782
SPEAKER_1:  I mean...

00:10:15,234 --> 00:10:16,766
SPEAKER_1:  You're just struck by the-

00:10:17,186 --> 00:10:22,174
SPEAKER_1:  the immensity of it. The immensity of the possibility. When you're young and you look-

00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,606
SPEAKER_1:  into your future, it's.

00:10:24,866 --> 00:10:26,686
SPEAKER_1:  It's wide open, you can do anything.

00:10:27,138 --> 00:10:30,462
SPEAKER_1:  And that's what Daggerfall felt like. The openness was gigantic.

00:10:31,234 --> 00:10:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:10:32,418 --> 00:10:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  Daggerfall is interesting coming off Arena.

00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  where arena does the same thing.

00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:40,478
SPEAKER_0:  But Daggerfall in many ways is bigger.

00:10:41,026 --> 00:10:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  despite focusing.

00:10:42,978 --> 00:10:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  on an area.

00:10:44,514 --> 00:10:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  because of how.

00:10:46,018 --> 00:10:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  the density of.

00:10:47,586 --> 00:10:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, this is how much physical game space...

00:10:50,946 --> 00:10:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  will do for these villages and towns and it does feel.

00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  Endless.

00:10:54,978 --> 00:10:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  even though you're looking at a map that has.

00:10:57,442 --> 00:10:58,206
SPEAKER_0:  constraints.

00:10:58,818 --> 00:11:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  And Daggerfall actually was a touchstone for us going into Starfield.

00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  for how we do the planets.

00:11:07,682 --> 00:11:08,574
SPEAKER_0:  Because...

00:11:08,962 --> 00:11:10,046
SPEAKER_0:  There is.

00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  there's a different kind of gameplay experience when you just wander outside a city in Daggerfall.

00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:17,854
SPEAKER_0:  then.

00:11:18,306 --> 00:11:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  you know, follow a quest line and go through, go to this place and it's completely handcrafted.

00:11:23,074 --> 00:11:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  and everything around every corner we've kind of placed like Skyrim.

00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  You know, starfields a bit more like Daggerfall and if you want are outside the city.

00:11:32,418 --> 00:11:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  we're going to be generating things, and you kind of get used to that game flow, which is different than we've done before.

00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  fun in a different kind of way.

00:11:42,274 --> 00:11:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  We'll talk about starfields, so just for people who don't know.

00:11:45,282 --> 00:11:47,422
SPEAKER_1:  And how dare you for not knowing.

00:11:47,746 --> 00:11:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  But we're with Daggerfall. We're talking about the Elder Scrolls series that started.

00:11:52,610 --> 00:12:02,846
SPEAKER_1:  So they're talking about the big titles within the series started with arena in 94, dagger fall in 96 i didn't look up the years before this is depressing or or awesome.

00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:03,806
SPEAKER_1:  Um

00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,758
SPEAKER_1:  So all of these games.

00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:07,102
SPEAKER_1:  bruh

00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,126
SPEAKER_1:  hundreds.

00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:14,398
SPEAKER_1:  Probably for some of them thousands of hours of joy for me. So arena dagger fall Morrowind oblivion

00:12:14,978 --> 00:12:16,606
SPEAKER_1:  and Skyrim.

00:12:18,178 --> 00:12:21,566
SPEAKER_1:  So I don't remember Arena being that open world.

00:12:21,858 --> 00:12:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  Well, it's all the provinces.

00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  It follows kind of the same pattern. It just doesn't have all the...

00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  number of villages and places that Daggerfall has while Daggerfall focuses on the Iliac Bay.

00:12:33,314 --> 00:12:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  area.

00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  arena does it all just changes the scale in terms of.

00:12:38,178 --> 00:12:40,469
SPEAKER_0:  You know, one block on the map equals this much space.

00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:43,838
SPEAKER_1:  There is something that I mean, I'm speaking to anecdotal experience.

00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:45,886
SPEAKER_1:  but I just remembered feeling.

00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:48,030
SPEAKER_1:  Wide open, Daggerfall.

00:12:48,354 --> 00:12:50,014
SPEAKER_1:  It definitely was, yes. The way Arena didn't.

00:12:51,106 --> 00:12:52,254
SPEAKER_1:  I don't remember.

00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:54,942
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe, maybe because arena.

00:12:56,386 --> 00:13:00,382
SPEAKER_1:  It was so cool to have the just the role playing game aspect.

00:13:00,706 --> 00:13:03,742
SPEAKER_1:  You're focused on the items and the character development. You're focused on the character development.

00:13:04,226 --> 00:13:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  Daggerfall has a lot more depth, particularly in the character system.

00:13:08,386 --> 00:13:12,446
SPEAKER_0:  That's what introduces all of the skills and those kind of things. ARENA!

00:13:13,218 --> 00:13:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  It's actually, it's a game I love.

00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:13:16,354 --> 00:13:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  It's very, very elegant.

00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  If you look at the first one where it's just an XP-based system.

00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,278
SPEAKER_0:  Do this, get XP, level up. It's a very classic role-playing game.

00:13:25,954 --> 00:13:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  Daggerfall digs deep into who's your character, how you're going to develop it, what are your skills, there's advantages, there's disadvantages.

00:13:33,762 --> 00:13:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  and the environment going full 3D.

00:13:37,218 --> 00:13:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  from Arena, which is actually like a 2.5D Doom style.

00:13:40,738 --> 00:13:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  engine.

00:13:42,082 --> 00:13:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:13:42,818 --> 00:13:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  I agree with you that Daggerfall feels like there's more possibilities.

00:13:47,746 --> 00:13:48,062
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

00:13:48,354 --> 00:13:48,958
SPEAKER_0:  when you're playing it.

00:13:49,186 --> 00:13:55,902
SPEAKER_1:  Were you able to like look up to the sky in Daggerfall? Yep. My memory is- It's full 3D, yeah. That's what full 3D means.

00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,822
SPEAKER_1:  and then you can go outside the city.

00:13:58,146 --> 00:14:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  You walk outside the city you can do that in arena too but it looks more fakey right so i'm gonna be a flat plane here comes things and then a dungeon entrance is a.

00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  you know, 8-bit, here comes a little flat coming at the camera.

00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:10,238
SPEAKER_1:  So before we go...

00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,486
SPEAKER_1:  to the end.

00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:13,054
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:14:13,506 --> 00:14:14,270
SPEAKER_1:  in the middle.

00:14:14,658 --> 00:14:15,070
SPEAKER_1:  So...

00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,638
SPEAKER_1:  from starfield to

00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,766
SPEAKER_1:  fallout and the Elder Scrolls series. Let's go to the very beginning. What's the origin story?

00:14:21,218 --> 00:14:24,318
SPEAKER_1:  You know what, let's even go before then. What's the first time you-

00:14:25,506 --> 00:14:26,334
SPEAKER_1:  You remember?

00:14:26,818 --> 00:14:29,886
SPEAKER_1:  The thing that made you fall in love with video games.

00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,422
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I think it's partly, you know, my age coming up with the arcades.

00:14:35,938 --> 00:14:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  and playing.

00:14:37,218 --> 00:14:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  you know, Space Invaders at the pizza place and then Pac-Man.

00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  Really?

00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,798
SPEAKER_0:  It's interesting about video games and what Pac-Man...

00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  did for video games where it popularized them in a way that was

00:14:49,282 --> 00:14:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  just insane at the time, had a song, had a cartoon, had all of the things.

00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:56,990
SPEAKER_0:  Nintendo comes along. So it was always part of.

00:14:57,346 --> 00:15:00,766
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I think if you were a kid growing up then, it was such a newness.

00:15:01,474 --> 00:15:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  to playing things like that.

00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:09,598
SPEAKER_0:  I remember being in fifth grade when the TRS-80 was brought into the classroom and there was a Star Trek game.

00:15:10,466 --> 00:15:11,198
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:15:11,554 --> 00:15:12,990
SPEAKER_0:  I was enamored with it.

00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  and they were gonna start teaching some.

00:15:16,418 --> 00:15:17,886
SPEAKER_0:  rudimentary programming.

00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,998
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, would you like to know how this is made?

00:15:20,802 --> 00:15:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  and I was hooked.

00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  Like I need to figure out how to make this stuff.

00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:30,366
SPEAKER_0:  And so I was a self-taught programmer and my whole goal.

00:15:31,202 --> 00:15:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  was to write my own video games.

00:15:34,498 --> 00:15:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

00:15:36,258 --> 00:15:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  You know, by sixth, seventh grade, I had written my own.

00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:42,910
SPEAKER_0:  much better Star Trek clone for the Apple II.

00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:15:44,674 --> 00:15:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

00:15:45,762 --> 00:15:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  I really...

00:15:46,882 --> 00:15:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  enjoyed programming on the Apple II then.

00:15:49,922 --> 00:15:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  and that I think was the right level of like complexity.

00:15:53,474 --> 00:16:01,822
SPEAKER_0:  you know, at that age where you could kind of, you were always learning, but you could still understand a lot of the problem set for like, this is when I get on the screen.

00:16:02,722 --> 00:16:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  And I was also into art.

00:16:04,066 --> 00:16:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:16:04,994 --> 00:16:05,822
SPEAKER_0:  I did a lot of art.

00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  and I did a lot of programming and I was always making games. That was my hobby.

00:16:10,914 --> 00:16:13,539
SPEAKER_0:  from the time I was 10 or 12.

00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:14,334
SPEAKER_1:  to you.

00:16:14,562 --> 00:16:20,734
SPEAKER_1:  involved in making games? Like how did you think of it? Was it from a graphics perspective, like what shows up on screen?

00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  Was it how it makes you feel? Was it about the story? Was it the text-based stuff and the dialogue and the prompting? Like, what—

00:16:28,418 --> 00:16:29,470
SPEAKER_1:  What, like, um...

00:16:30,882 --> 00:16:33,507
SPEAKER_1:  What does it mean to create a video game at that young age?

00:16:33,507 --> 00:16:34,462
SPEAKER_0:  to you.

00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  It was a way of experiencing things that I...

00:16:37,634 --> 00:16:37,982
SPEAKER_0:  couldn't.

00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  myself.

00:16:40,642 --> 00:16:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:16:41,922 --> 00:16:42,846
SPEAKER_0:  You know, if you're playing...

00:16:43,362 --> 00:16:46,430
SPEAKER_0:  Dungeons and Dragons at the time too, where you...

00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:47,390
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  you really feel, even pen and paper, these are like...

00:16:51,906 --> 00:16:57,694
SPEAKER_0:  They feel somewhat in quotes real to you as you're playing them. You're very invested in your character and what you're doing.

00:16:58,178 --> 00:16:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  and then

00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:04,094
SPEAKER_0:  I love the games, the Wizardry and Ultima, that were able to bring that to a computer so I could...

00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:06,814
SPEAKER_0:  You know, do it on my own time was very, very.

00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  real to me. I'd sit in my bedroom and then go to bed and think about it and then, oh no, I have to go to school. I want to come home and figure out how to...

00:17:13,954 --> 00:17:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  how to do this problem in the game.

00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  And so whatever I was creating was something that...

00:17:19,714 --> 00:17:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  I was excited about at the time.

00:17:22,114 --> 00:17:25,278
SPEAKER_0:  I made Raiders of the Lost Ark games.

00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,926
SPEAKER_0:  Like with graphics and everything? Yeah, so it was usually, you know...

00:17:29,474 --> 00:17:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  Made a Miami Vice game, made a Gru the Wanderer game, made a traveler game.

00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  I may, but every time I was doing it, I wanted to figure out a new method.

00:17:38,402 --> 00:17:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  on the Apple II of pulling it off graphically.

00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  whether that was editing character sets to get graphics in different formats.

00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  or

00:17:47,362 --> 00:17:49,278
SPEAKER_0:  How can I enable the secret?

00:17:49,762 --> 00:17:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  double high res mode it had or.

00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  Just things like that where it became kind of this limitless.

00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  What can I make this do?

00:17:57,858 --> 00:18:00,734
SPEAKER_0:  And I had some friends who were doing the same thing, and then you get into...

00:18:01,154 --> 00:18:02,366
SPEAKER_0:  who can impress each other.

00:18:02,786 --> 00:18:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  And I was kind of middle of the pack.

00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:05,406
SPEAKER_0:  I would say.

00:18:05,986 --> 00:18:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:18:07,682 --> 00:18:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  And that, but again, this was the time where they're bringing computers into the school and the apples come into the school and the teachers.

00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:15,582
SPEAKER_0:  are learning it.

00:18:15,938 --> 00:18:20,734
SPEAKER_0:  because they have to teach the students, but then I would say I was part of a group of students that were like way.

00:18:21,218 --> 00:18:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  past that.

00:18:22,594 --> 00:18:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:25,822
SPEAKER_0:  and it was very much of a self-taught.

00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,278
SPEAKER_0:  you know, how do you make this thing dance?

00:18:29,794 --> 00:18:31,518
SPEAKER_1:  I'd like to ask a strange question.

00:18:32,162 --> 00:18:33,246
SPEAKER_1:  So at that time...

00:18:34,402 --> 00:18:37,758
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of people consider you one of, if not the greatest.

00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,574
SPEAKER_1:  game designer creator of all time.

00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,134
SPEAKER_1:  You were middle of the pack then.

00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:50,078
SPEAKER_1:  Did you have a sense that this would be your life and you would also be creating?

00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,766
SPEAKER_1:  you know, the greatest games ever.

00:18:53,762 --> 00:18:55,294
SPEAKER_0:  Not, not in the slightest.

00:18:55,554 --> 00:18:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:18:56,354 --> 00:18:58,014
SPEAKER_0:  No, I don't think anybody...

00:18:58,274 --> 00:19:00,766
SPEAKER_0:  but I was very much like that was my...

00:19:01,186 --> 00:19:01,758
SPEAKER_0:  Dream.

00:19:02,402 --> 00:19:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  at that age.

00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  but you don't think that that's a job?

00:19:07,618 --> 00:19:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  You know, and the...

00:19:08,738 --> 00:19:09,502
SPEAKER_0:  As I got.

00:19:09,986 --> 00:19:12,894
SPEAKER_0:  I was really going through college and I...

00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  Even the computer classes then weren't.

00:19:17,154 --> 00:19:19,966
SPEAKER_0:  where I wanted them to be so I still kind of doing my own stuff.

00:19:20,386 --> 00:19:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:19:21,858 --> 00:19:26,974
SPEAKER_0:  And I ended up getting a business degree and then interviewing for some jobs, like finance jobs.

00:19:27,522 --> 00:19:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I guess I should do this to make money.

00:19:30,178 --> 00:19:31,902
SPEAKER_0:  And I can keep doing this on the side.

00:19:32,322 --> 00:19:38,302
SPEAKER_0:  And I remember I actually got to like the final level of like this corporate finance job at Circuit City.

00:19:38,914 --> 00:19:40,158
SPEAKER_0:  And they turn me down.

00:19:41,058 --> 00:19:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  And I was like, fuck them.

00:19:42,658 --> 00:19:44,158

00:19:51,303 --> 00:19:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  They were based in Richmond. I was going to school close to there.

00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,590
SPEAKER_1:  So what's the origin story of you joining?

00:19:59,362 --> 00:20:01,470

00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  Um

00:20:13,794 --> 00:20:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  I was in college.

00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  And...

00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:18,974
SPEAKER_0:  I noticed that it was...

00:20:19,874 --> 00:20:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  you know, in.

00:20:21,826 --> 00:20:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  Rockville, Maryland.

00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  and oh, that's on my way home.

00:20:25,698 --> 00:20:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  over Christmas break back to William & Mary where I went to college.

00:20:29,314 --> 00:20:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  And I was at this point committed, like this is what I want to do. So I'm just going to drive by and knock on the door.

00:20:35,554 --> 00:20:39,518
SPEAKER_0:  which is what I did. So I drove by and knocked on the doors, to bring back some of my old previous car,

00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  90.

00:20:41,314 --> 00:20:41,886
SPEAKER_0:  3

00:20:43,362 --> 00:20:44,318
SPEAKER_0:  And...

00:20:44,706 --> 00:20:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  Someone came out and met me and said...

00:20:46,882 --> 00:20:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  Well, maybe what and I swam in college. I'm talking about when I'm out of school. Okay, well contact us then.

00:20:52,258 --> 00:20:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  Aaand...

00:20:53,826 --> 00:20:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  I will say I was

00:20:55,202 --> 00:20:57,598
SPEAKER_0:  I would contact them every once in a while.

00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  I did work for a small software company right.

00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:02,814
SPEAKER_0:  out of school.

00:21:04,034 --> 00:21:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  down in that area of Williamsburg.

00:21:06,882 --> 00:21:10,206
SPEAKER_0:  and still would contact Bethesda, Arena had just come out.

00:21:10,946 --> 00:21:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  So then we're in 94. Arena had just come out and I loved it. So I was into sports games. I liked the hockey stuff.

00:21:16,546 --> 00:21:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  They were doing a basketball. They did a basketball game.

00:21:19,202 --> 00:21:22,366
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I'm just looking at they did a lot of, they did like six.

00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,518
SPEAKER_1:  Sports Game 6

00:21:24,002 --> 00:21:27,454
SPEAKER_1:  But that's the 10 games, six of them sports games.

00:21:27,938 --> 00:21:29,982
SPEAKER_1:  and NCAA basketball.

00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:32,277
SPEAKER_1:  hockey league simulator.

00:21:32,277 --> 00:21:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  the favorite way is that anyone being able to read and do a zIP code in a later yet.

00:21:33,634 --> 00:21:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  So it was really like sports.

00:21:35,522 --> 00:21:40,126
SPEAKER_0:  Gridiron, which is like the first kind of physics-based football game at the time.

00:21:40,802 --> 00:21:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  And there's a famous story with electronic arts trying to do Madden and then hiring Bethesda before my time.

00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  to make Madden because they were struggling.

00:21:49,506 --> 00:21:50,142
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:21:50,754 --> 00:21:52,990
SPEAKER_0:  When I started at Bethesda, I remember the owner had...

00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  John Madden's Oakland Raiders playbook.

00:21:56,098 --> 00:21:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  in his office like, can I see that?

00:21:58,434 --> 00:22:02,014
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and I love sports, right? So I'd still play Madden to this day. I love it.

00:22:02,306 --> 00:22:03,431
SPEAKER_0:  So there's an alternate reality.

00:22:03,431 --> 00:22:04,190
SPEAKER_1:  where

00:22:04,546 --> 00:22:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  I made sports games? Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:06,914 --> 00:22:09,886
SPEAKER_0:  I wanted to make like the ultimate.

00:22:10,178 --> 00:22:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  college football game.

00:22:11,714 --> 00:22:15,839
SPEAKER_0:  Well, it's always like, you know, it's like music. You probably listen to lots of type of music. Like you don't play every time.

00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:20,126
SPEAKER_1:  I think of open worlds as fundamentally different....

00:22:20,866 --> 00:22:23,550
SPEAKER_1:  no like source of happiness, entertainment.

00:22:24,066 --> 00:22:25,118
SPEAKER_1:  storytelling.

00:22:26,434 --> 00:22:30,846
SPEAKER_1:  world gaming than matter. I mean, it's just because I love both.

00:22:31,234 --> 00:22:32,574
SPEAKER_1:  I loved both worlds, but...

00:22:32,674 --> 00:22:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  They're two totally different experiences.

00:22:35,394 --> 00:22:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  just like when you might watch.

00:22:36,866 --> 00:22:40,670
SPEAKER_0:  movie you might be in the mood for Lord of the Rings one day and then you want some

00:22:41,154 --> 00:22:41,598
SPEAKER_0:  other.

00:22:41,922 --> 00:22:50,014
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, competitive show or game show or something like that. Or watch football on TV, right? You watch football on TV, but then I want to watch get really into Game of Thrones.

00:22:50,978 --> 00:22:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  So I think all those things have.

00:22:52,866 --> 00:22:53,502
SPEAKER_0:  validity.

00:22:53,762 --> 00:22:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  And actually one of the first things I worked on when I started at Bethesda was...

00:22:59,106 --> 00:23:01,342
SPEAKER_0:  NCAA basketball, road to the Final Four.

00:23:03,106 --> 00:23:07,262
SPEAKER_0:  So that was kind of an external project was came in like, Hey, you, you know sports.

00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:08,574
SPEAKER_0:  Get this game done.

00:23:09,314 --> 00:23:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  and then went on to, but they were doing everything I loved. It was like, this is where I have to work.

00:23:13,634 --> 00:23:20,190
SPEAKER_0:  They're doing like the Terminator science fiction stuff. I love that. They're doing these open world role playing games. Like I love that. They're doing sports like this.

00:23:20,514 --> 00:23:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  I have to work here.

00:23:22,178 --> 00:23:22,590
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:23:23,522 --> 00:23:25,246
SPEAKER_1:  and started there and you love.

00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  I loved it.

00:23:26,754 --> 00:23:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, so when I came in...

00:23:28,994 --> 00:23:33,598
SPEAKER_0:  It had just come out and they were doing the CD-ROM version. So CD-ROMs aren't even out yet.

00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:38,142
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, it used to be floppy disks. That's probably what it.

00:23:38,562 --> 00:23:39,687
SPEAKER_1:  What was the re-

00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:42,238
SPEAKER_0:  Burn them in the basement. We had the disc replicators.

00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,734
SPEAKER_1:  Right, so...

00:23:45,378 --> 00:23:48,190
SPEAKER_1:  Arena was not released on

00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  It was. Yeah, I believe it's six floppy disks.

00:23:52,258 --> 00:23:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  Six lobby discs.

00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:54,494
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe it was eight.

00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  But in those days, the number of floppy disks was very, very important to what

00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:02,974
SPEAKER_0:  the money you were making.

00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  So if you want to do a big, huge game, like, well, that's just too many disks. So the CD-ROM became this.

00:24:11,202 --> 00:24:13,918
SPEAKER_0:  this jumping off point for the whole industry where...

00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, it's unlimited data.

00:24:17,474 --> 00:24:18,078
SPEAKER_1:  by the way.

00:24:18,594 --> 00:24:19,262
SPEAKER_1:  I played

00:24:19,586 --> 00:24:20,318
SPEAKER_1:  Arena

00:24:21,442 --> 00:24:22,238
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhhhhh...

00:24:23,394 --> 00:24:25,694
SPEAKER_1:  So that was of course attained.

00:24:26,658 --> 00:24:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:24:28,578 --> 00:24:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  Legally, as one does alternate means

00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:32,926
SPEAKER_1:  by alternate means.

00:24:33,154 --> 00:24:35,454
SPEAKER_1:  on floppy disks.

00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:36,894
SPEAKER_1:  That was, uh...

00:24:37,858 --> 00:24:41,886
SPEAKER_1:  That was such an incredible, as you probably have seen interacted with.

00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:44,478
SPEAKER_1:  large number of people it's a whole world

00:24:44,802 --> 00:24:46,014
SPEAKER_1:  It's a world that you...

00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,918
SPEAKER_1:  escape to in a way like your favorite book like Lord of the Rings.

00:24:51,394 --> 00:24:53,598
SPEAKER_1:  It was just some, it was...

00:24:54,466 --> 00:24:55,806
SPEAKER_1:  It was unlike anything else.

00:24:56,098 --> 00:25:07,934
SPEAKER_1:  It was incredible. It's probably, I mean, of course, as people say, the first game you play is the most, is the one that really sentimentally means the most to you. I think the first role playing game I played.

00:25:08,226 --> 00:25:10,526
SPEAKER_1:  and it was just changed everything. was area.

00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,678
SPEAKER_1:  Puzzarina, yeah.

00:25:12,418 --> 00:25:15,102
SPEAKER_1:  I think Daggerfall is what I really kind of...

00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:16,446
SPEAKER_1:  really played?

00:25:16,994 --> 00:25:17,502
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:25:17,826 --> 00:25:22,302
SPEAKER_1:  Especially because like you said the character development was really rich, but just like

00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,094
SPEAKER_1:  that you can...

00:25:24,354 --> 00:25:27,166
SPEAKER_1:  be feel like you travel to this whole other world.

00:25:27,554 --> 00:25:30,270
SPEAKER_1:  that's less about entertainment like a shooting game.

00:25:30,786 --> 00:25:33,758
SPEAKER_1:  and more about a world. It felt like it's a world.

00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:39,998
SPEAKER_1:  Like you're literally there, you can travel there, you can live there, you actually feel like that.

00:25:40,866 --> 00:25:43,262
SPEAKER_1:  person versus like a Pac-Man like a

00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:47,966
SPEAKER_1:  like an arcade, fun, entertaining adventure game.

00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:49,758
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  So you joined.

00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,238
SPEAKER_1:  You made it.

00:25:55,426 --> 00:25:56,094
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

00:25:56,642 --> 00:25:58,014
SPEAKER_1:  What did you work on first there?

00:25:59,074 --> 00:26:05,182
SPEAKER_0:  I worked, well everyone did a bunch of stuff, so I worked on the basketball game, really just to get it out the door.

00:26:05,762 --> 00:26:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  and Terminator Future Shock. So we were doing Future Shock and Daggerfall at the same time.

00:26:13,634 --> 00:26:18,398
SPEAKER_0:  they were developing a new engine. So it was one of the first 3D engines, the X engine. They didn't feel too Auch ambush.

00:26:18,882 --> 00:26:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  There were a bunch of guys from Denmark.

00:26:20,898 --> 00:26:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  actually, there's like a big Danish demo scene in those days in the PC.

00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

00:26:27,074 --> 00:26:31,870
SPEAKER_0:  bunch of the top programmers there. And look, this is not big. This is not a big company. Maybe there's 20 people in development.

00:26:32,546 --> 00:26:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:26:34,146 --> 00:26:37,054
SPEAKER_0:  and we were doing both Daggerfall and the new Terminator.

00:26:38,082 --> 00:26:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  And so...

00:26:39,522 --> 00:26:43,422
SPEAKER_0:  Daggerfall was a bit more, again, behind the Terminator game, so...

00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,110
SPEAKER_0:  I was one of the main people on the Terminator team.

00:26:46,754 --> 00:26:47,358
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, things kind of worked out. I very quickly, I don't know why, like I quickly became the producer and I was making levels and doing all these things and it was...

00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,182
SPEAKER_0:  It was awesome.

00:26:57,986 --> 00:26:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, and I-

00:26:59,554 --> 00:27:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  Looking back now, I can understand it better.

00:27:02,018 --> 00:27:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  But at the time, I didn't appreciate it, which is no one quite owned the Terminator license. It was in like this limbo.

00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,022
SPEAKER_0:  Legally?

00:27:09,602 --> 00:27:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  So there was no one to tell us what to do. Like, no, you can't do that.

00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:19,230
SPEAKER_0:  So we would pick apart the movies and how does he mention the gunny ones and the wattage?

00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:21,406
SPEAKER_0:  of the laser and all these things and so.

00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:27,742
SPEAKER_0:  Future Shock is a game that I still love today. It does a lot of things that if you go back and look at it...

00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:30,654
SPEAKER_0:  we're frankly still doing. Like it's a.

00:27:31,202 --> 00:27:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  large open world post-apocalyptic.

00:27:34,914 --> 00:27:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  You know, landscape.

00:27:36,418 --> 00:27:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  height map with

00:27:38,242 --> 00:27:40,478
SPEAKER_0:  instanced objects all over it and

00:27:41,538 --> 00:27:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  That is still a lot of how we build our worlds.

00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  What's an instanced object?

00:27:47,138 --> 00:27:49,278
SPEAKER_0:  It's, you know, some games, every...

00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  you know, wall or building is kind of unique in its.

00:27:54,818 --> 00:27:55,294
SPEAKER_0:  Data?

00:27:55,810 --> 00:28:00,670
SPEAKER_0:  Whereas we would just build, you know, these little husks of buildings and then place them all over the place.

00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:03,902
SPEAKER_0:  the memory and the way you render it is much more optimal.

00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,805
SPEAKER_1:  that allows you to build a bigger world.

00:28:06,805 --> 00:28:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  Because you build a bigger world much faster and not.

00:28:10,626 --> 00:28:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

00:28:11,394 --> 00:28:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  You know, not every single version of that building isn't its own unique architecture.

00:28:16,162 --> 00:28:19,390
SPEAKER_0:  that is going to take up memory and processing speed, etc.

00:28:19,714 --> 00:28:23,825
SPEAKER_1:  So you're there very much feeling the computational constraints of the system when you're creating

00:28:23,825 --> 00:28:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  these Oprah Awards. And you know what, that's the thing then.

00:28:26,722 --> 00:28:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  You see some of it now?

00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  But in those times, I do feel like...

00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  every year.

00:28:32,866 --> 00:28:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  the technology moved and maybe it's because the same thing. We're like that my age at that time.

00:28:37,442 --> 00:28:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  where every year.

00:28:39,266 --> 00:28:41,726
SPEAKER_0:  Somebody was coming up with some new method.

00:28:42,402 --> 00:28:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  or some new game system.

00:28:44,866 --> 00:28:45,534
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:28:47,106 --> 00:28:50,814
SPEAKER_0:  It was every year that innovation, innovation, innovation. And thenims

00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:51,518
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

00:28:52,514 --> 00:28:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  3D acceleration comes along.

00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:59,294
SPEAKER_0:  and then these things come along and then HD comes along and it is true that as time goes on

00:28:59,682 --> 00:29:02,398
SPEAKER_0:  there is visually a diminishing return.

00:29:02,978 --> 00:29:03,934
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of...

00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:06,942
SPEAKER_0:  what you're able to do on the screen and it

00:29:07,714 --> 00:29:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  There's a ton of work that goes into it now because just rendering...

00:29:11,618 --> 00:29:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  to the perfect.

00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:18,526
SPEAKER_0:  shine and material and roughness and how does the global illumination off this wall, it's a ton of work.

00:29:18,978 --> 00:29:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:29:20,002 --> 00:29:22,110
SPEAKER_0:  but you can pretty much do what you want now.

00:29:22,338 --> 00:29:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  if you want to put the time in.

00:29:24,098 --> 00:29:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  Whereas then, okay, you can't do everything you want.

00:29:27,618 --> 00:29:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:29:28,866 --> 00:29:30,590
SPEAKER_0:  Pick your battles really carefully.

00:29:30,818 --> 00:29:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:29:32,386 --> 00:29:34,814
SPEAKER_0:  Technically, you can do what you want, if that makes sense.

00:29:35,202 --> 00:29:36,510
SPEAKER_1:  How much trade off is there?

00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:37,598
SPEAKER_1:  now.

00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:40,670
SPEAKER_1:  in how much effort you put into.

00:29:42,082 --> 00:29:42,718
SPEAKER_1:  The...

00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:46,174
SPEAKER_1:  the realism of the graphics versus the story.

00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:48,702
SPEAKER_1:  And actually not even how much effort you put in.

00:29:49,282 --> 00:29:50,302
SPEAKER_1:  But is there a...

00:29:51,106 --> 00:29:53,854
SPEAKER_1:  trade-off in the experience the feel of the game.

00:29:54,594 --> 00:29:55,966
SPEAKER_1:  in terms of realism.

00:29:56,354 --> 00:29:57,086
SPEAKER_1:  and story.

00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,934
SPEAKER_0:  Usually we will start with.

00:30:00,322 --> 00:30:04,830
SPEAKER_0:  Let the player have as much agency and do as many things as they can as possible.

00:30:05,282 --> 00:30:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  and we will sacrifice.

00:30:07,842 --> 00:30:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  some graphic fidelity for that, some speed for that.

00:30:11,074 --> 00:30:12,446
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we could make a game that...

00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:22,686
SPEAKER_0:  you know are traditionally our games are you know we okay with thirty frames a second as long as it looks really good in the simulations running and all those things so we'll sacrifice some of that

00:30:22,914 --> 00:30:23,678
SPEAKER_0:  Fidelity?

00:30:24,034 --> 00:30:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  for the player experience?

00:30:25,634 --> 00:30:27,998
SPEAKER_0:  in the kind of things that I do.

00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  Um, but from like a manpower standpoint.

00:30:32,194 --> 00:30:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  The graphics programmers work on graphics, the artists work on art, and we have an awesome team of artists and designers and writers and programmers.

00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  It's usually where we find as time goes on.

00:30:43,394 --> 00:30:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  The amount of art time.

00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  that it takes to create.

00:30:47,202 --> 00:30:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  A cup?

00:30:49,026 --> 00:30:50,526
SPEAKER_0:  compared to what it used to be that.

00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  has increased, so we do use, like most people use.

00:30:53,794 --> 00:30:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  you know, art outsourcing as well so that we're not, we still relatively

00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,702
SPEAKER_0:  compared to our industry and what we're doing.

00:31:00,962 --> 00:31:01,758
SPEAKER_0:  have smaller.

00:31:02,146 --> 00:31:02,590
SPEAKER_0:  teams.

00:31:02,978 --> 00:31:07,070
SPEAKER_1:  What about the experience of the beauty of the graphics?

00:31:07,778 --> 00:31:10,078
SPEAKER_1:  So like one of the most.

00:31:11,426 --> 00:31:13,182
SPEAKER_1:  amazing things about Skyrim.

00:31:13,826 --> 00:31:20,318
SPEAKER_1:  And maybe you could say that about some of the other games, but for me, Skyrim is the outdoor, when you step outside, it's the outdoor scenery.

00:31:21,154 --> 00:31:22,590
SPEAKER_1:  What does it take to create?

00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:23,870
SPEAKER_1:  the feeling.

00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:25,438
SPEAKER_1:  especially of that.

00:31:26,242 --> 00:31:28,094
SPEAKER_1:  being outdoors of nature.

00:31:28,706 --> 00:31:29,566
SPEAKER_1:  and just like...

00:31:30,114 --> 00:31:30,750
SPEAKER_1:

00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:35,518
SPEAKER_1:  lost in the beauty, whatever it is when you go hiking and you feel the awe of it.

00:31:36,002 --> 00:31:38,334
SPEAKER_1:  How do you create that all? Is that graphics? What is that?

00:31:38,946 --> 00:31:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  It's a lot of graphics. It's a lot of mood. We just talk about it in terms of-

00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  cone.

00:31:44,546 --> 00:31:46,014
SPEAKER_0:  And those are...

00:31:46,594 --> 00:31:48,510
SPEAKER_0:  Again, going back to my previous comment.

00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  The graphics are very, very important to us because...

00:31:53,602 --> 00:31:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  and we always push them.

00:31:55,906 --> 00:32:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  Because when you're doing the kind of things we do, where you step into a virtual world, it does have to have that moment of wow.

00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,358
SPEAKER_0:  This is, this feels real.

00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  I've never experienced this.

00:32:06,178 --> 00:32:07,006
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  It's okay.

00:32:09,858 --> 00:32:12,798
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's okay to let just like the time settle.

00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,134
SPEAKER_0:  meaning you step out.

00:32:17,218 --> 00:32:18,302
SPEAKER_0:  How does the wind sound?

00:32:19,266 --> 00:32:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  How are the trees moving?

00:32:20,866 --> 00:32:21,950
SPEAKER_0:  how the clouds moving.

00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,358
SPEAKER_0:  I enjoy strolling and watching the sunset.

00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  you know, how does it land over the water?

00:32:31,202 --> 00:32:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  Like it doesn't have to be like.

00:32:32,706 --> 00:32:37,374
SPEAKER_0:  hey, let's go, let's finish a quest, let's go kill things, let's figure out the next step, let's level up, like.

00:32:37,826 --> 00:32:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  I like the quiet moments a lot, and I think when you play our games you can tell we spend a lot of time on them.

00:32:43,362 --> 00:32:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:32:44,002 --> 00:32:46,334
SPEAKER_0:  then you watch like the weather roll in.

00:32:47,138 --> 00:32:49,470
SPEAKER_0:  I think that's just part of being.

00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:53,182
SPEAKER_0:  being that character, being that person in that space.

00:32:54,146 --> 00:32:55,230
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, the...

00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:58,398
SPEAKER_1:  I saw that there's a mod that removes all enemies.

00:32:58,786 --> 00:32:59,902
SPEAKER_1:  I've been meaning to do it.

00:33:00,226 --> 00:33:01,118
SPEAKER_1:  to do that.

00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  to just do like a livestream where for hours we walk around Skyrim.

00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:08,926
SPEAKER_1:  just and then answer questions and so on. It just feels.

00:33:09,506 --> 00:33:09,982
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:33:10,914 --> 00:33:13,054
SPEAKER_1:  That's a completely stress-free environment.

00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:16,638
SPEAKER_1:  It's just, you are, just like you said, in this moment in time.

00:33:17,186 --> 00:33:18,430
SPEAKER_1:  It's so incredible.

00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:25,214
SPEAKER_1:  It feels as incredible as going hiking or something like that, but in another totally different place.

00:33:25,506 --> 00:33:25,886
SPEAKER_1:  I can't.

00:33:26,114 --> 00:33:28,958
SPEAKER_1:  like Iceland or something like that. Yesterday, I had my little guy admit defeat at seeWell, and I understood where we were in it. He components byiverd namedElizabeth over probably, Tom��요.

00:33:29,378 --> 00:33:33,438
SPEAKER_1:  this whole other surreal ethereal place.

00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:37,886
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's incredible how you kind of create that. So graphics is a part of that, but also letting it.

00:33:39,298 --> 00:33:42,366
SPEAKER_1:  the temporal aspect of that, like the wind.

00:33:42,594 --> 00:33:46,590
SPEAKER_1:  the rustling sound and look and all of that.

00:33:46,818 --> 00:33:48,510
SPEAKER_0:  The soundscape is really...

00:33:48,962 --> 00:33:49,822
SPEAKER_0:  really important.

00:33:50,402 --> 00:33:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  in the sky, we spend a lot of time on the sky, because it's taking up much more of the screen than...

00:33:55,938 --> 00:33:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of people give credit.

00:33:58,914 --> 00:34:01,630
SPEAKER_1:  What about the rendering, the openness of it? I gotta, um, his Coke.

00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,902
SPEAKER_0:  There's a lot of level of detail.

00:34:04,162 --> 00:34:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  streaming work and you know nowadays it's getting more common like frankly the systems are built better for it.

00:34:10,978 --> 00:34:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  Hard drive speed is really prioritized. Like they're so blazing fast.

00:34:16,546 --> 00:34:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:34:17,314 --> 00:34:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  You take Skyrim and Oblivion and the fallouts of that.

00:34:20,898 --> 00:34:22,558
SPEAKER_0:  360 era.

00:34:23,042 --> 00:34:23,550
SPEAKER_0:  It's a-

00:34:24,034 --> 00:34:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  It was a lot of time spent.

00:34:25,986 --> 00:34:26,430
SPEAKER_0:  on.

00:34:26,914 --> 00:34:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  How do we get all this data streaming in?

00:34:30,274 --> 00:34:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  As you move...

00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  and then levels of detail so you can see all the way.

00:34:35,682 --> 00:34:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  but not, you know.

00:34:37,506 --> 00:34:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  Crush the processor.

00:34:38,754 --> 00:34:43,998
SPEAKER_1:  You know what, let's even step back, because you mentioned tone, you mentioned tone a lot. What do you mean by tone?

00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:45,246
SPEAKER_0:  It's all of it.

00:34:45,698 --> 00:34:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  together if you look at.

00:34:49,282 --> 00:34:51,902
SPEAKER_0:  I think you can flip through, let's just take fantasy.

00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  You can sort of look at a couple images or things and know.

00:34:56,226 --> 00:34:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  How does Lord of the Rings different?

00:34:58,242 --> 00:34:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  from...

00:34:59,586 --> 00:35:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  Game of Thrones that is different than...

00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:07,134
SPEAKER_0:  Um, you know, uh, a three and like Excalibur.

00:35:07,618 --> 00:35:09,886
SPEAKER_0:  or your, you know.

00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,158
SPEAKER_0:  Sci-fi channel.

00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:12,798
SPEAKER_0:  No

00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:13,790
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:35:14,786 --> 00:35:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  you know, series of the month kind of thing.

00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:21,630
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

00:35:22,402 --> 00:35:25,598
SPEAKER_0:  finding that what's going to make it kind of unique and usually

00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,678
SPEAKER_0:  I lean on something that

00:35:28,066 --> 00:35:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  is grounded in

00:35:31,074 --> 00:35:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  Reality?

00:35:32,162 --> 00:35:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  for what it is?

00:35:33,762 --> 00:35:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  and then have lesser kind of.

00:35:36,898 --> 00:35:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  fantastical.

00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  things at least at the start.

00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:45,246
SPEAKER_0:  and then they kind of build. So even when we do starfield.

00:35:45,858 --> 00:35:50,014
SPEAKER_0:  It's a science fiction game, there are laser guns and spaceships that fly around and shoot each other and blah blah blah blah blah!

00:35:50,402 --> 00:35:52,894
SPEAKER_0:  but it's grounded in, you can look at it and say...

00:35:53,506 --> 00:35:56,286
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, this is kind of an extension of...

00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,134
SPEAKER_0:  things as we view them today.

00:35:59,682 --> 00:36:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  in space.

00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  And we sort of take the same approach with Fallout, where admittedly things can get

00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,550
SPEAKER_0:  Admittedly, things can get even

00:36:08,162 --> 00:36:09,502
SPEAKER_0:  a little bit crazier.

00:36:10,146 --> 00:36:12,414
SPEAKER_0:  the longer you're developing fallout content.

00:36:14,274 --> 00:36:14,654
SPEAKER_1:  So.

00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,862
SPEAKER_1:  just to linger on this.

00:36:17,154 --> 00:36:21,118
SPEAKER_1:  So tone starts at, or the defining the tone starts at.

00:36:21,506 --> 00:36:24,894
SPEAKER_1:  creating a realistic experience. Make you feel like I could walk into this.

00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:26,878
SPEAKER_1:  and this feels like life.

00:36:27,266 --> 00:36:33,758
SPEAKER_0:  What's their technology level, like even for a fantasy world, like is magic, how prevalent is it? Or are they making weapons and things and armor?

00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  Is it for utility? Is it for decoration? How do they live their lives? Does this feel?

00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  like a place that you believe that has some grounding in our reality, whether that's historical.

00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  or near future or.

00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  that it's grounded in some semblance of the reality that you and I.

00:36:57,314 --> 00:36:59,102
SPEAKER_0:  understand so that it can feel.

00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  It's also making it feel a little bit welcoming.

00:37:02,146 --> 00:37:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  Like, okay, I understand this.

00:37:04,034 --> 00:37:06,878
SPEAKER_1:  Is that art or science? So like what, how do you know?

00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:11,134
SPEAKER_1:  when he feels welcoming and everything fits in his ground. now it's

00:37:11,682 --> 00:37:14,494
SPEAKER_0:  I guess it's personal taste. Some people like things that are.

00:37:15,394 --> 00:37:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  weirder.

00:37:16,322 --> 00:37:18,398
SPEAKER_0:  that have more fantastical from the get-go.

00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:22,878
SPEAKER_0:  even a game like Morrowind where we get into some more fantastical things.

00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  it intentionally starts.

00:37:25,378 --> 00:37:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  a little more grounded.

00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,030
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it was a very...

00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  classic medieval looking town that you come into.

00:37:32,194 --> 00:37:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  B looked just beyond it and her...

00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  mushroom trees and...

00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  giant insects and things like that.

00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,838
SPEAKER_1:  So it's kind of when you put a dragon in it.

00:37:40,674 --> 00:37:42,942
SPEAKER_1:  What are your thoughts about dragons and tone?

00:37:44,002 --> 00:37:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  How does that fit into a tone?

00:37:46,402 --> 00:37:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  That's a great question.

00:37:48,162 --> 00:37:48,638
SPEAKER_0:  The

00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:54,147
SPEAKER_1:  It's a ridiculous question, but yeah, I just love drag it so

00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:58,110
SPEAKER_0:  No, no, no. These are the things that we debate.

00:37:58,402 --> 00:37:59,527
SPEAKER_0:  with doing.

00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,158
SPEAKER_1:  a dragon?

00:38:01,026 --> 00:38:03,614
SPEAKER_1:  Why didn't you include a dragon and daggerfall? That's what I want to know.

00:38:03,842 --> 00:38:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  I think there's dragon, there's dragonlings. They're hard to do. Dragons are hard to do. So when you start Skyrim, say, hey, look, dragons are gonna be a theme. Let's just start visually.

00:38:12,482 --> 00:38:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  I think I, yeah, they're-

00:38:13,954 --> 00:38:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  You can make the argument that dragons existed. Okay, what would they look like? How close to dinosaurs would they be? Or what would they, and ours are less, I believe they're less fantastical looking in general.

00:38:24,418 --> 00:38:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  They look like beasts that could.

00:38:26,594 --> 00:38:27,806
SPEAKER_0:  exist in that world.

00:38:28,354 --> 00:38:30,622
SPEAKER_0:  and then how we introduce them.

00:38:31,138 --> 00:38:32,862
SPEAKER_0:  It's kind of a little bit of a slow.

00:38:33,474 --> 00:38:35,294
SPEAKER_0:  you know role in Skyrim

00:38:35,778 --> 00:38:36,254
SPEAKER_0:  and that the

00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  people in the world are reacting to the dragons appearing.

00:38:41,346 --> 00:38:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  And that somewhat mirrors, you want something that mirrors the player experience as well. It says back to you like, hey, no, these are this is have you heard this? Someone saw a dragon.

00:38:51,874 --> 00:38:55,294
SPEAKER_1:  That's what Daggerfall is there is there mentions of dragons or something?

00:38:55,746 --> 00:38:56,510
SPEAKER_1:  Cause I remember

00:38:57,474 --> 00:38:58,814
SPEAKER_1:  I remember being sure.

00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  that there's dragons in Daggerfall as I'm playing it and I'm searching. Pretty sure.

00:39:04,162 --> 00:39:06,037
SPEAKER_1:  Is there a dragon in the Dragonfall?

00:39:06,037 --> 00:39:11,614
SPEAKER_0:  There's dragon wings in Daggerfall. Look, I guess someone will probably correct me. Actually, there is a dragon here.

00:39:11,874 --> 00:39:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  but I'm pretty sure they're sort of.

00:39:13,986 --> 00:39:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  They're not. And then.

00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:18,974
SPEAKER_0:  game I did, Redguard, which...

00:39:19,266 --> 00:39:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  We bring back a dragon, it takes place beforehand, we have a dragon there.

00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  in that game and that was unique to that at the time.

00:39:26,594 --> 00:39:31,518
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, just a brief tangent on that. I thought Redgar was a really, really good game.

00:39:32,066 --> 00:39:33,374
SPEAKER_1:  I played it as a-

00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:36,382
SPEAKER_1:  Again, you don't, you know, just.

00:39:37,346 --> 00:39:40,158
SPEAKER_1:  If you forget stuff, but I remember getting.

00:39:41,218 --> 00:39:46,558
SPEAKER_1:  I guess it was the first in the Elder Scrolls series to put it into that world, but it was like an adventure game.

00:39:47,106 --> 00:39:50,302
SPEAKER_1:  It reminds me of another game I really love, like Prince of Persia.

00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  That was the end.

00:39:52,002 --> 00:39:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  one of the inspirations. This is one of my favorite games.

00:39:55,874 --> 00:40:01,726
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe, okay, I apologize if I'm forgetting, but you can like jump in buildings and stuff. There's a jump in, there's a...

00:40:01,986 --> 00:40:05,854
SPEAKER_1:  dynamic, airy nature, like it's a parkour type of situation.

00:40:06,722 --> 00:40:07,326
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:14,375
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it was an incredible game. What, why do you think, let me ask sort of a dark question. Why do you think that game was a flop? One of the, one of the future.

00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:16,190
SPEAKER_0:  Not a dark question. It was.

00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  Um, well, a lot of reasons.

00:40:19,234 --> 00:40:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  Um, game, game that I love.

00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  and really got us going on a handcrafted world. So we're coming off of Daggerfall.

00:40:27,106 --> 00:40:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  Morrowind is sort of in design.

00:40:30,018 --> 00:40:31,102
SPEAKER_0:  And then, you know.

00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  Part of our development teams broke up to do different things. The game that did Battlespire and Redguard was my game.

00:40:37,986 --> 00:40:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:40:39,714 --> 00:40:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  And I wanted to do something a little more Ultima feeling, a handcrafted world.

00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:49,022
SPEAKER_0:  I really like things that blend up genres, so I know it's in the adventure game category.

00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:57,438
SPEAKER_0:  but it really does a lot of things. It's a love letter to Prince of Persia, there's a little Raiders of the Lost Ark in it, there's a lot of Ultima in it.

00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:00,990
SPEAKER_0:  and really see what we could do with the engine.

00:41:01,794 --> 00:41:02,942
SPEAKER_0:  It is very much...

00:41:03,234 --> 00:41:08,062
SPEAKER_0:  I think it would have had a much better home on, say, PlayStation or Xbox.

00:41:08,514 --> 00:41:09,694
SPEAKER_0:  This is Predates Xbox.

00:41:10,498 --> 00:41:17,758
SPEAKER_0:  where it's much more like constantly Tomb Raider had come out. So do you see those influences of Tomb Raider on that game?

00:41:18,274 --> 00:41:19,006
SPEAKER_0:  And...

00:41:20,418 --> 00:41:23,326
SPEAKER_0:  3D effects cards had just come out, so okay, we can do...

00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  And it was the last, I think it's one of the last like.

00:41:27,298 --> 00:41:29,502
SPEAKER_0:  DOS games in a Windows world.

00:41:29,986 --> 00:41:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  I think it missed kind of a technology window.

00:41:33,186 --> 00:41:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  as well as

00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  Ultimately, not what people wanted from us.

00:41:38,658 --> 00:41:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:40,190
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:41:41,026 --> 00:41:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:41:42,882 --> 00:41:43,390
SPEAKER_0:  I thought-

00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:47,422
SPEAKER_0:  I was really kind of the company let me make that game.

00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  It was a big flop.

00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  Battlespire hadn't done well. The company was in really bad shape and I felt really like personally responsible.

00:41:57,026 --> 00:41:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  They let me do this creative thing?

00:41:59,138 --> 00:42:01,790
SPEAKER_0:  It didn't do what we needed it to do and now...

00:42:02,338 --> 00:42:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  We're in a very, very bad situation.

00:42:04,962 --> 00:42:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  a company that was put out of business.

00:42:07,618 --> 00:42:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  And...

00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  That's when it got reformed.

00:42:11,522 --> 00:42:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  with Zenimax Media and Robert Altman came in and we were starting more when we had just sort of started. And it was sort of that whole experience that made you sort of realize.

00:42:20,386 --> 00:42:22,110
SPEAKER_0:  Someone says, you okay, you're gonna get another shot.

00:42:23,682 --> 00:42:24,926
SPEAKER_0:  And that's where you're like, okay.

00:42:25,346 --> 00:42:26,782
SPEAKER_0:  We're gonna make more wind.

00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:28,030
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:42:28,674 --> 00:42:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  Make

00:42:29,538 --> 00:42:33,982
SPEAKER_0:  the biggest best RPG we can make. We know what the audience wants from us. We know what we can do.

00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:38,718
SPEAKER_0:  building a world. So there's like callbacks to how we built the world in Redguard.

00:42:39,202 --> 00:42:47,742
SPEAKER_0:  Morrowind is a large scale handcrafted, but if you were to put it, you know, pixel per pixel with Daggerfall, you wouldn't even see Morrowind, like, because Daggerfall is so big.

00:42:48,194 --> 00:42:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  but the impact of playing it, I think.

00:42:50,882 --> 00:42:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  is.

00:42:51,746 --> 00:42:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  in many ways, equal but different.

00:42:55,074 --> 00:43:01,662
SPEAKER_1:  Just you personally, psychologically, did you have doubt about yourself from the performance of Redguard?

00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:04,190
SPEAKER_1:  Do I even, do I know what it is? Of course.

00:43:04,322 --> 00:43:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  Of course.

00:43:05,538 --> 00:43:07,070
SPEAKER_1:  Where do you get the?

00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:08,414
SPEAKER_1:  How do you overcome that?

00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  I-

00:43:10,722 --> 00:43:13,566
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, I would say this honestly, I enjoy it so much.

00:43:14,274 --> 00:43:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  You know, like I'm so heads down, like that becomes...

00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  better worse like my life.

00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:43:21,762 --> 00:43:22,398
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:43:23,266 --> 00:43:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  It's just something that I want to play so much it becomes like there's a little bit you get a little obsessed with it.

00:43:28,962 --> 00:43:29,758
SPEAKER_0:  No, but I mean...

00:43:30,402 --> 00:43:31,678
SPEAKER_1:  You love Redguard, right?

00:43:32,226 --> 00:43:34,142
SPEAKER_1:  So like, doesn't that mean...

00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:38,878
SPEAKER_1:  Isn't there a kind of self doubt about, do I know what it takes to create a great game?

00:43:39,106 --> 00:43:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  Well no, I think Redguards are great, can't you?

00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:46,750
SPEAKER_0:  All right, so you were sure, even if it wasn't. Okay, so if you're gonna debate, like, do I like that game? It's about finding an, okay, so.

00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  I love Ragnar.

00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  And the people who play it, it won a bunch of awards and you know, it's

00:43:52,802 --> 00:43:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  Critically, it was a pretty good game.

00:43:54,658 --> 00:43:55,678
SPEAKER_0:  did not sell.

00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:57,886
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:43:58,306 --> 00:44:03,070
SPEAKER_0:  The reason for that again, like we probably made this the wrong type of game and we missed the technology window.

00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  We also thought it was very conservative. We're going to do this.

00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:08,766
SPEAKER_0:  So my main takeaway was...

00:44:08,994 --> 00:44:10,654
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not going to be conservative again.

00:44:11,234 --> 00:44:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  going to swing for the fences.

00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:15,454
SPEAKER_0:  And we've had, you know.

00:44:15,714 --> 00:44:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  There'll be some rough edges in swinging for the fences and shooting for the moon, but we'd rather do that in the land where we land.

00:44:21,922 --> 00:44:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  than be very, very conservative.

00:44:24,354 --> 00:44:25,982
SPEAKER_0:  and what we're putting out there.

00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  You mentioned...

00:44:28,546 --> 00:44:30,270
SPEAKER_1:  just referencing this game.

00:44:30,562 --> 00:44:31,038
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:44:31,618 --> 00:44:33,118
SPEAKER_1:  on Reddit AMA.

00:44:33,378 --> 00:44:36,894
SPEAKER_1:  That long time ago during Redguard, the lead programmer made me...

00:44:37,602 --> 00:44:48,574
SPEAKER_1:  made all the buildings up and down after you played for 10 minutes just to mess with me. Just a curious tangent, what's involved with programming in open world game?

00:44:49,026 --> 00:44:50,110
SPEAKER_1:  So what will we do?

00:44:50,338 --> 00:44:51,134
SPEAKER_1:  So we talked about.

00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:53,982
SPEAKER_1:  We will talk about design and so on.

00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:57,982
SPEAKER_1:  but specifically the programming, because I think this question came from

00:44:58,466 --> 00:45:02,590
SPEAKER_1:  What are some interesting sticky bugs that you've encountered throughout your life?

00:45:03,106 --> 00:45:05,790
SPEAKER_1:  in creating these games and this is one of them that you mentioned.

00:45:06,274 --> 00:45:08,318
SPEAKER_1:  So what are some of the challenges?

00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,446
SPEAKER_1:  programming these open world games.

00:45:13,186 --> 00:45:13,918
SPEAKER_0:  I mean...

00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  There are different flavors of them.

00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,174
SPEAKER_0:  Right? Your GTAs will have different...

00:45:18,658 --> 00:45:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  issues then...

00:45:20,866 --> 00:45:24,862
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the Ubisoft games versus our games, I can sort of speak to ours.

00:45:25,762 --> 00:45:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  which is you want to build systems.

00:45:28,514 --> 00:45:32,798
SPEAKER_0:  Right? Because they're going to play the game for a very long time as well, which we've learned.

00:45:33,474 --> 00:45:34,238
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:45:35,106 --> 00:45:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  You can't go through and touch everything by hand per se.

00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  So you have to rely on some systemic level of.

00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  creation

00:45:44,642 --> 00:45:46,014
SPEAKER_0:  and a lot of systems.

00:45:46,338 --> 00:45:47,646
SPEAKER_0:  that are robust enough.

00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  so that when they touch another one, things aren't.

00:45:51,138 --> 00:45:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  Breaking apart.

00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:53,630
SPEAKER_1:  So there's like a...

00:45:54,402 --> 00:45:59,294
SPEAKER_1:  What are the major systems? Is there like the physics of the game, the engine of how like stuff.

00:46:00,098 --> 00:46:01,246
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, like...

00:46:01,602 --> 00:46:04,977
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, the physics, the motion, and maybe how light is rendered and all that kind of stuff.

00:46:04,977 --> 00:46:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  So you have the rendering.

00:46:06,594 --> 00:46:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  right of like

00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, this is how I'm going to render.

00:46:09,922 --> 00:46:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  the data that I have.

00:46:12,418 --> 00:46:14,814
SPEAKER_0:  So a lot of people confuse engines with rendering.

00:46:15,234 --> 00:46:23,550
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, they're combined, obviously, but there's the data you're going to give to a renderer, which is the thing that draws the pixels on the screen.

00:46:24,162 --> 00:46:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  So there's a.

00:46:25,026 --> 00:46:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  Most of the engine is how are you gonna bring in that data?

00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:30,750
SPEAKER_0:  and give it to the renderer.

00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  to draw it.

00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:34,398
SPEAKER_0:  So you have that whole system of walking through the world.

00:46:34,914 --> 00:46:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  feeding in the data and drawing it.

00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  you then obviously have the physics and the interactivity.

00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  What are the things that are there just to be drawn?

00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  And what are the things there that are meant to be interacted with and touched?

00:46:48,802 --> 00:46:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  we put a big premium on the ones that can be interacted with and touched, whether it's flowers.

00:46:55,202 --> 00:47:01,278
SPEAKER_0:  whether the trees move, whether you can sleep on the sofa, sit in this chair, pick up all this stuff, bake bread, blah, blah, blah.

00:47:02,754 --> 00:47:04,574
SPEAKER_0:  you then have the AI.

00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:08,958
SPEAKER_0:  which loops in the stuff we talked about earlier in terms of processing everybody and

00:47:10,114 --> 00:47:10,686
SPEAKER_0:  combat.

00:47:10,978 --> 00:47:15,454
SPEAKER_0:  systems, which is a lot of what people end up doing, combat systems.

00:47:15,842 --> 00:47:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  on top of that AI, how do they react to those types of things?

00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:20,958
SPEAKER_0:  and then.

00:47:22,146 --> 00:47:22,590
SPEAKER_0:  how.

00:47:23,042 --> 00:47:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  how do they look at the things that can be interacted with? One of my favorite things is when NPCs will go pick up weapons in the world, which you don't see in other games. And the first time you see it in one of ours, it's like very unexpected.

00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  You can drop like a crazy weapon.

00:47:35,458 --> 00:47:39,902
SPEAKER_0:  Being a fight and an NPC runs over, picks it up, and uses it on you, it's not something you would expect.

00:47:40,354 --> 00:47:40,798
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:47:41,474 --> 00:47:42,110
SPEAKER_0:  I love that stuff.

00:47:42,466 --> 00:47:43,262
SPEAKER_1:  And that's...

00:47:44,034 --> 00:47:49,566
SPEAKER_1:  integrated into a larger system, the ability to pick up a, the NPC picking up a, so it's not like a little.

00:47:49,858 --> 00:47:51,326
SPEAKER_1:  that's hard-coded in.

00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:52,743
SPEAKER_1:  as part of a bigger...

00:47:52,743 --> 00:47:55,486
SPEAKER_0:  system. So, some people have their own AI for

00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:58,814
SPEAKER_0:  scanning the environment, and that's one of the rules. Hey, is there a weapon?

00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  that is better than the one I have.

00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:03,518
SPEAKER_0:  I'm gonna go get it.

00:48:03,778 --> 00:48:08,574
SPEAKER_0:  Now we do lock off if it's in a chest and that's treasure we left for the player, but it's in particular

00:48:09,154 --> 00:48:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  Because what you don't want, we actually had this problem started in oblivion, I believe, which is a separate level.

00:48:13,186 --> 00:48:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  Hey, let the enemies go pick up.

00:48:15,938 --> 00:48:17,118
SPEAKER_0:  You know, weapons if they're better.

00:48:17,538 --> 00:48:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  So we make a level and go in and all of the enemies are armed to the teeth and there's no treasure for the player because the enemies went and took all the good weapons and he's like, okay.

00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:29,310
SPEAKER_0:  They don't take those, they take the ones that are dropped by other.

00:48:29,762 --> 00:48:31,102
SPEAKER_0:  NPCs are the player.

00:48:31,714 --> 00:48:32,286
SPEAKER_1:  It's such...

00:48:32,546 --> 00:48:36,286
SPEAKER_1:  fascinating world of designing the experience for the NPC.

00:48:36,994 --> 00:48:37,854
SPEAKER_1:  because in part.

00:48:38,178 --> 00:48:39,326
SPEAKER_1:  that experience.

00:48:40,002 --> 00:48:42,430
SPEAKER_1:  defines the experience of the player.

00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:46,238
SPEAKER_1:  So how they interact with their environment defines.

00:48:46,722 --> 00:48:48,990
SPEAKER_1:  how the player experiences their environment.

00:48:49,282 --> 00:48:50,558
SPEAKER_1:  Is there room for...

00:48:50,786 --> 00:48:54,110
SPEAKER_1:  further and further development of the AI that controls

00:48:54,594 --> 00:48:55,326
SPEAKER_1:  The NPC.

00:48:56,034 --> 00:48:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  Sure, we're always iterating on it.

00:48:58,274 --> 00:48:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  Again, as we look...

00:49:00,514 --> 00:49:01,886
SPEAKER_0:  in the future.

00:49:03,042 --> 00:49:05,534
SPEAKER_0:  It's more about us finding those...

00:49:06,146 --> 00:49:11,262
SPEAKER_0:  more reactivity to the player and also understanding their roles in the world.

00:49:12,546 --> 00:49:14,046
SPEAKER_0:  So they're not just there.

00:49:14,722 --> 00:49:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  They're not just there for the player.

00:49:16,642 --> 00:49:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  as a signpost.

00:49:18,274 --> 00:49:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  the player.

00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,214
SPEAKER_1:  but they're reacting to the player. But what about.

00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:24,318
SPEAKER_1:  You know, some of the richest experiences we have.

00:49:24,802 --> 00:49:29,054
SPEAKER_1:  with people is like the chaos of it, the push and pull, the emperor.

00:49:29,378 --> 00:49:30,398
SPEAKER_1:  unpredictability.

00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:36,830
SPEAKER_1:  Is there something I don't know if you've been following, but the quick amazing development of language models?

00:49:37,506 --> 00:49:38,814
SPEAKER_1:  then you're on that work.

00:49:39,746 --> 00:49:42,366
SPEAKER_1:  natural language processing systems.

00:49:42,786 --> 00:49:44,574
SPEAKER_1:  dialogue systems.

00:49:45,474 --> 00:49:47,678
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think there's some possibility of using?

00:49:48,322 --> 00:49:49,470
SPEAKER_1:  So it is incredible.

00:49:50,018 --> 00:49:51,294
SPEAKER_1:  neural nets that can...

00:49:51,714 --> 00:49:53,630
SPEAKER_1:  Have open-ended dialogue.

00:49:54,306 --> 00:49:55,518
SPEAKER_1:  Basically, chatbots.

00:49:55,618 --> 00:50:01,022
SPEAKER_0:  Yep, I've seen some incredible demos. I do think it's coming. I don't know when. Yeah.

00:50:01,378 --> 00:50:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:50:02,594 --> 00:50:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  And there's a little bit of a question like what's ready for...

00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  real.

00:50:07,106 --> 00:50:08,702
SPEAKER_0:  Deployment and release.

00:50:09,378 --> 00:50:10,430
SPEAKER_0:  versus

00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  Hey, let's use that to generate.

00:50:13,922 --> 00:50:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  some things that is then static that we're giving to the players

00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:19,006
SPEAKER_0:  Um, versus.

00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  it's generated on the fly, but it's definitely coming.

00:50:23,586 --> 00:50:27,358
SPEAKER_0:  definitely coming. And I think you'll see it in the types of games that we do.

00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:28,286
SPEAKER_0:  And that's great.

00:50:28,546 --> 00:50:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  you know, application.

00:50:30,018 --> 00:50:31,230
SPEAKER_1:  I love the idea that you beat.

00:50:31,618 --> 00:50:37,182
SPEAKER_1:  using it to design different NPCs and then testing if they're good enough.

00:50:37,794 --> 00:50:41,169
SPEAKER_1:  If they're like, um, oh, too crazy. You don't want like the, the.

00:50:41,169 --> 00:50:44,798
SPEAKER_0:  Right, but if we go back to it being reactive, some of that bot stuff.

00:50:45,378 --> 00:50:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it's pretty, it's incredible. It's then translating that into.

00:50:49,602 --> 00:50:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  voice.

00:50:50,786 --> 00:50:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  And then is that being done?

00:50:53,186 --> 00:50:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  by the client, is it being done on a server, is it baked into the game? There's like different flavors of it.

00:51:00,258 --> 00:51:03,934
SPEAKER_1:  So there's still computational challenges, like how do you actually make that happen? Re-

00:51:04,706 --> 00:51:05,566
SPEAKER_1:  Well, what about...

00:51:06,274 --> 00:51:09,342
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, in terms of creating the feeling of an NBC.

00:51:10,594 --> 00:51:12,469
SPEAKER_1:  What's the role of voice actors?

00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  Awesome.

00:51:14,178 --> 00:51:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  We work with a ton of voice actors.

00:51:17,122 --> 00:51:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  and they bring so much to it and that's the thing.

00:51:20,642 --> 00:51:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:51:22,626 --> 00:51:27,742
SPEAKER_0:  They, you know, we can write some stuff and the best ones get in there and make it so much better.

00:51:28,354 --> 00:51:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  or even AdLib things.

00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  And so we do a lot of voice recording.

00:51:33,986 --> 00:51:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  And we used to do it kind of like at the end of the project.

00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  and now we do it throughout.

00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  We start really early and we just start recording. So we're recording.

00:51:44,642 --> 00:51:47,358
SPEAKER_0:  for years and years, literally, probably three years.

00:51:47,746 --> 00:51:48,871
SPEAKER_0:  four years apart.

00:51:48,871 --> 00:51:50,718
SPEAKER_1:  of the actual experience of the recording.

00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:53,374
SPEAKER_1:  will help define the characters and the tone of the game.

00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:59,614
SPEAKER_0:  And we'll go back sometimes and hey, we really like this. We want more of this. Let's write, let's do another session or.

00:52:00,802 --> 00:52:05,598
SPEAKER_0:  Hey, we don't think this character's actually working. We want you to do, you're gonna be someone else now. Sorry, that got cut.

00:52:06,722 --> 00:52:07,326
SPEAKER_1:  Did you ever?

00:52:09,186 --> 00:52:13,342
SPEAKER_1:  I try to sort of imagine that people fall in love with the characters, with the NPCs. I do.

00:52:14,754 --> 00:52:16,629
SPEAKER_1:  Like, and do they get really attached to the...

00:52:16,629 --> 00:52:18,526
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, yeah, I mean I've done it in games

00:52:18,786 --> 00:52:20,158
SPEAKER_1:  These are like close friends, right?

00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:21,438
SPEAKER_1:  You can.

00:52:21,922 --> 00:52:22,782
SPEAKER_1:  You missed them.

00:52:23,298 --> 00:52:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  A hundred percent. I actually like whenever I'm playing a game and there is, you know, if there's like a.

00:52:28,034 --> 00:52:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  friendship option or make friends or a romance thing. I find those moments really...

00:52:33,666 --> 00:52:36,830
SPEAKER_0:  I enjoy them, I find them pretty impactful emotionally.

00:52:37,058 --> 00:52:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  what we're doing and so...

00:52:38,882 --> 00:52:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  We've done a little bit of it. It's one of the things that we actually have pushed in Starfield.

00:52:44,098 --> 00:52:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  So...

00:52:45,506 --> 00:52:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  We have a number of companions, but four of them.

00:52:48,514 --> 00:52:49,246
SPEAKER_0:  We go.

00:52:49,474 --> 00:52:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I won't say super complex.

00:52:52,354 --> 00:52:55,582
SPEAKER_0:  romantic but more complex relationships than we've had.

00:52:56,482 --> 00:52:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of...

00:52:58,946 --> 00:53:05,150
SPEAKER_0:  not just some state of they like you or they don't like you, but they can be they can be in love with you.

00:53:05,858 --> 00:53:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:53:06,946 --> 00:53:11,070
SPEAKER_0:  dislike something you did and be pissed at you temporarily and then come back to loving you.

00:53:11,362 --> 00:53:14,110
SPEAKER_1:  I saw that relationship status of it's complicated.

00:53:14,946 --> 00:53:19,294
SPEAKER_1:  that they're existing in that gray area is complicated. We're not dating or just.

00:53:20,578 --> 00:53:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  Well, it's in a lot of games, you know, previous stuff, you just work your way up, they like you more and more and more and more, and now you're in a relationship. Now you're in, yeah. And when you make them upset, you drift out of, like it never happened, you know, you drift out of it, whereas.

00:53:33,314 --> 00:53:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  We wanted one where, okay, we can be in a relationship and-

00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:36,766
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:53:37,698 --> 00:53:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  We've committed to each other in some way.

00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  but I just did something that really made you angry.

00:53:42,754 --> 00:53:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  And as opposed to just drifting out of that status, you're in a temporary...

00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:47,966
SPEAKER_0:  I don't like what you did, Steve.

00:53:48,418 --> 00:53:52,670
SPEAKER_1:  Also some greater degree of complexity in the relationship with a little a little bit

00:53:52,866 --> 00:53:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  a little bit.

00:53:53,954 --> 00:53:57,726
SPEAKER_0:  I don't want to oversell that part, but sure my point is

00:53:58,018 --> 00:54:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  I think those things where you meet a character in a game...

00:54:01,218 --> 00:54:03,038
SPEAKER_0:  and you do spend time with them.

00:54:03,266 --> 00:54:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  a companion in a game and it leads to romance.

00:54:06,466 --> 00:54:08,894
SPEAKER_0:  You know, myself and others and I find a lot of players.

00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  Those moments are really, really impactful.

00:54:12,642 --> 00:54:14,558
SPEAKER_0:  and special to them because they did put in the time.

00:54:15,682 --> 00:54:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  That's another thing that I always come at it with, which is...

00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  I think people who don't play video games, they sometimes think like, oh, that's, I don't know, that's a waste of time, or that's not real. That's not like, you're not getting a lot out of that. Like.

00:54:26,402 --> 00:54:28,702
SPEAKER_0:  Well, you haven't really experienced it in the way that you can.

00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  because...

00:54:30,946 --> 00:54:33,598
SPEAKER_0:  these moments that I spent in games, not the ones I made.

00:54:33,922 --> 00:54:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  Other ones, when I was growing up or even now, those are, that is important time to me.

00:54:38,402 --> 00:54:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  Like, I love those moments.

00:54:40,258 --> 00:54:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  I felt really like.

00:54:42,082 --> 00:54:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  Proud.

00:54:42,914 --> 00:54:44,190
SPEAKER_0:  of what I accomplished.

00:54:44,962 --> 00:54:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  We want people to have that.

00:54:47,874 --> 00:54:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  in our games.

00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  And the fact that they have had those experiences and we hear from them and how important it is to them.

00:54:54,338 --> 00:54:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  It's like...

00:54:55,938 --> 00:54:58,398
SPEAKER_0:  No, this is really, really special.

00:54:59,298 --> 00:55:00,158
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's uh...

00:55:00,962 --> 00:55:03,358
SPEAKER_1:  It's funny from a game design perspective.

00:55:03,618 --> 00:55:06,622
SPEAKER_1:  I wonder if you can honor the time you spent together with the game.

00:55:07,266 --> 00:55:08,286
SPEAKER_1:  Because, um...

00:55:09,922 --> 00:55:13,758
SPEAKER_1:  You know, sometimes there's a heartbreak at the end of the game, like when you're...

00:55:15,426 --> 00:55:17,630
SPEAKER_1:  When you leave a game, there's a...

00:55:18,434 --> 00:55:20,830
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's a really complicated relationship, actually.

00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:26,078
SPEAKER_1:  Is it when you leave the game it's almost like leaving a romantic partner because.

00:55:26,818 --> 00:55:27,166
SPEAKER_1:  Heh.

00:55:27,522 --> 00:55:29,662
SPEAKER_1:  Thank you for spending so much time together.

00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:31,710
SPEAKER_1:  And...

00:55:32,674 --> 00:55:34,014
SPEAKER_1:  There's a sense in which

00:55:34,274 --> 00:55:35,326
SPEAKER_1:  It was, uh...

00:55:36,642 --> 00:55:37,534
SPEAKER_1:  It was ephemeral.

00:55:37,954 --> 00:55:38,814
SPEAKER_1:  Like you.

00:55:39,074 --> 00:55:42,238
SPEAKER_1:  This is not... It didn't happen. It didn't really happen.

00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:45,886
SPEAKER_1:  It was good. It was like you went to Vegas, you got drunk and stuff.

00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:47,966
SPEAKER_1:  for like, and now life goes on.

00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:52,030
SPEAKER_1:  I wonder if there's a way to sort of always carry that with you.

00:55:52,514 --> 00:55:54,366
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I guess with words you can kinda...

00:55:54,978 --> 00:55:56,103
SPEAKER_1:  share with others like.

00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:57,246
SPEAKER_0:  It's weird.

00:55:58,082 --> 00:56:03,582
SPEAKER_0:  Now that we're in the age where you have achievements and you can look at your library and see your hours in games.

00:56:04,898 --> 00:56:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  Like that's like, it's almost like a scrapbook now. Like I wish.

00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  One of my wishes was like, I wish I had that achievement list.

00:56:12,546 --> 00:56:13,278
SPEAKER_0:  everything.

00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  like back to the.

00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  late 70s. Like every game you played. Right.

00:56:18,882 --> 00:56:23,038
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, like you. I mean, that's one of the cool things with Xbox like.

00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:27,582
SPEAKER_1:  we're moving towards that direction, it'd be cool to be from like childhood.

00:56:27,906 --> 00:56:30,590
SPEAKER_1:  the first time you play a video game, it will actually tell you.

00:56:30,946 --> 00:56:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  What is the first game you can play? But you know what? Yeah. They will have that.

00:56:34,658 --> 00:56:35,262
SPEAKER_1:  So we'll have that.

00:56:35,714 --> 00:56:36,510
SPEAKER_1:  haha

00:56:37,122 --> 00:56:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  And see, you can look back and see, oh my God, I put a thousand hours in there. And my last save was.

00:56:45,346 --> 00:56:46,471
SPEAKER_0:  1997

00:56:46,471 --> 00:56:46,974
SPEAKER_1:  I see.

00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:48,254
SPEAKER_1:  Umm...

00:56:48,898 --> 00:56:51,230
SPEAKER_1:  Man, I don't know, Golden Axe maybe?

00:56:51,522 --> 00:56:53,118
SPEAKER_1:  I'm trying to think what was the first game I heard.

00:56:54,402 --> 00:56:57,630
SPEAKER_1:  No, it's probably Commodore 64 games, yeah.

00:56:58,146 --> 00:56:59,038
SPEAKER_1:  arcade games.

00:56:59,938 --> 00:57:00,350
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:06,398
SPEAKER_1:  You mentioned Starfield. What is Starfield? And what's the origin story of this game?

00:57:07,394 --> 00:57:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  we had always wanted to do.

00:57:10,274 --> 00:57:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  something where you explore space.

00:57:12,354 --> 00:57:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  you know, the explore space role-playing game. So take the kind of games that we make.

00:57:16,546 --> 00:57:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:57:18,082 --> 00:57:20,286
SPEAKER_0:  Give it a little bit of a different spin.

00:57:20,738 --> 00:57:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  And I-

00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the other games that I love, there was a pen and paper RPG I loved, Traveler, it was one of the-

00:57:26,882 --> 00:57:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  first games I made for the Apple II.

00:57:29,122 --> 00:57:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  uh, din-

00:57:30,242 --> 00:57:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  I never finished it, right? I'm just doing it on my own.

00:57:33,666 --> 00:57:34,558
SPEAKER_0:  and...

00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:38,590
SPEAKER_0:  Love this game. Star flight was one star control to.

00:57:39,202 --> 00:57:45,534
SPEAKER_0:  was a game that I loved. Sun Dog was a big one in the Apple II days that a lot of people don't know that I loved.

00:57:46,178 --> 00:57:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  And so...

00:57:47,618 --> 00:57:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of us in the studio felt.

00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  It was time to do something new.

00:57:52,066 --> 00:57:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we're going between Elder Scrolls and Fallout and going back and forth and...

00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, we love that.

00:57:57,282 --> 00:57:59,134
SPEAKER_0:  But hey, we've always wanted to do this.

00:57:59,362 --> 00:58:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  explore the galaxy science fiction game.

00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:03,966
SPEAKER_0:  You know, now is the time.

00:58:04,386 --> 00:58:04,702
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:58:05,026 --> 00:58:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  to do that.

00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:11,230
SPEAKER_1:  And that's a brave move. So follow us post-apocalyptic.

00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:13,118
SPEAKER_1:  on a single.

00:58:13,954 --> 00:58:14,366
SPEAKER_1:  planet.

00:58:14,818 --> 00:58:15,774
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,854
SPEAKER_1:  You know, Elder Scrolls series is...

00:58:19,106 --> 00:58:19,486
SPEAKER_1:  uh

00:58:20,034 --> 00:58:23,678
SPEAKER_1:  on a single planet. So this is going out into the open world of.

00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:27,646
SPEAKER_1:  many star systems many planets i saw that it's uh...

00:58:28,258 --> 00:58:29,022
SPEAKER_1:  thinking about.

00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:33,214
SPEAKER_1:  a hundred star systems and a thousand planets available to explore.

00:58:33,954 --> 00:58:36,542
SPEAKER_1:  What is that world of stars and planets like?

00:58:37,442 --> 00:58:41,662
SPEAKER_0:  Well, you mentioned Daggerfall. We go back to some of that. Well, the first one we did it was...

00:58:42,178 --> 00:58:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  How are we gonna?

00:58:44,098 --> 00:58:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  render a planet, like pull it off for the player, like can we?

00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  Or do we have to sort of do it where you can't land on all of them?

00:58:52,002 --> 00:58:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  where you're landing in a very controlled, small...

00:58:54,978 --> 00:58:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  world space that we.

00:58:56,770 --> 00:58:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of craft and you would have.

00:58:59,106 --> 00:59:00,958
SPEAKER_0:  a very limited set of those.

00:59:01,442 --> 00:59:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  If you go back to tone, like, well, that's.

00:59:03,234 --> 00:59:04,638
SPEAKER_0:  Probably the wrong tone.

00:59:05,826 --> 00:59:10,750
SPEAKER_0:  And how can we say yes? Like, I wanna land on that ice ball. So it started, we started the game.

00:59:11,074 --> 00:59:14,014
SPEAKER_0:  right after Fallout 4, so 2016.

00:59:14,786 --> 00:59:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  And the first thing we did...

00:59:16,482 --> 00:59:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  was can you know

00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  How can we have a system to generate these planets?

00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  and make them look.

00:59:24,034 --> 00:59:26,046
SPEAKER_0:  you know, I'll say reasonable.

00:59:26,498 --> 00:59:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  as opposed to fractally.

00:59:29,442 --> 00:59:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  Goop.

00:59:30,914 --> 00:59:31,454
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:59:31,938 --> 00:59:34,142
SPEAKER_1:  What's the technical definition of goop?

00:59:34,658 --> 00:59:35,783
SPEAKER_1:  Fractally goop.

00:59:35,783 --> 00:59:45,630
SPEAKER_0:  Fractally goopy. You've probably seen a lot of like simulations whether they're space things or landscape things where Using fractals and just the landscape does not look real. Just this is like highs and lows and

00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  It's muddy.

00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  And so we did find a way, we came up with a way, and we had prototyped of building.

00:59:52,802 --> 00:59:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  like large tiles of landscape, the way we would usually build them.

00:59:57,346 --> 01:00:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  We kind of generate them offline, hand do some things.

01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  end up with these very realistic looking tiles of landscape.

01:00:04,706 --> 01:00:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  and then built a system that...

01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:08,190
SPEAKER_0:  wraps those.

01:00:08,578 --> 01:00:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  around a planet.

01:00:10,082 --> 01:00:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  and blends them all together.

01:00:12,546 --> 01:00:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  and we had pretty successful results with that.

01:00:15,554 --> 01:00:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  So we thought, yeah, we could do this.

01:00:18,018 --> 01:00:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:00:19,138 --> 01:00:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  And so there was a big design.

01:00:22,978 --> 01:00:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  kind of problem to solve in terms of what's fun.

01:00:26,978 --> 01:00:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  about landing on a planet where there's potentially nothing.

01:00:31,714 --> 01:00:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  because there's a lot of.

01:00:33,186 --> 01:00:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  planets and moons if you kind of.

01:00:35,682 --> 01:00:37,470
SPEAKER_0:  in reality that, well, there's nothing on them.

01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:43,134
SPEAKER_0:  except resources and so we spent a lot of time figuring out okay let's just lean in on

01:00:43,458 --> 01:00:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  That can A, be a lonely experience.

01:00:45,954 --> 01:00:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  as long as we tell the player, here's what's there.

01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  Here are the resources that are there.

01:00:50,018 --> 01:00:51,006
SPEAKER_0:  Go find them.

01:00:51,938 --> 01:00:53,982
SPEAKER_0:  I equate it to that moment of we said about

01:00:54,466 --> 01:00:59,038
SPEAKER_0:  listening to the wind go and watching the sunset and i do think there's a certain beauty

01:00:59,586 --> 01:01:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  to landing on a strange planet.

01:01:01,538 --> 01:01:03,454
SPEAKER_0:  being somewhat the only person there.

01:01:03,714 --> 01:01:04,830
SPEAKER_0:  building an outpost.

01:01:05,186 --> 01:01:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  And we are modeling.

01:01:07,202 --> 01:01:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  all of the systems, because that's how we like to do things. So you can watch whatever that gas giant or moon.

01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:14,718
SPEAKER_0:  it will rotate and go and...

01:01:16,098 --> 01:01:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  sunrise, sunset, and...

01:01:18,242 --> 01:01:20,606
SPEAKER_0:  all of those things that you would expect and it's.

01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:22,526
SPEAKER_0:  It's all really happening.

01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:23,678
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:01:24,098 --> 01:01:26,974
SPEAKER_0:  Most people probably won't notice or appreciate all of that, but...

01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:01:29,666 --> 01:01:32,190
SPEAKER_0:  I think it gives them the ability to say.

01:01:33,442 --> 01:01:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  I wanna go do that and see that.

01:01:35,426 --> 01:01:37,150
SPEAKER_0:  on that place, as long as we tell them.

01:01:37,538 --> 01:01:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  Hey, the quest leads over here.

01:01:39,266 --> 01:01:42,110
SPEAKER_0:  Here's where the handcrafted content is that you would expect.

01:01:42,434 --> 01:01:45,150
SPEAKER_0:  And then here's more of the open procedural.

01:01:46,146 --> 01:01:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  planet experience.

01:01:47,714 --> 01:01:49,822
SPEAKER_0:  Long answer, I don't know if I answered your question.

01:01:50,882 --> 01:01:55,486
SPEAKER_1:  There's no questions are stupid and the answers are brilliant. That's how this works.

01:01:55,810 --> 01:02:01,118
SPEAKER_1:  So this is the world's most immense simulator of the human condition of loneliness.

01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:04,355
SPEAKER_1:  Because I can't imagine a more lonely experience.

01:02:04,355 --> 01:02:07,262
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, you put it that way. I don't know if that was the goal, but...

01:02:07,746 --> 01:02:10,526
SPEAKER_1:  just on a planet alone.

01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:12,190
SPEAKER_1:  That must be...

01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:16,446
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, a deep embodiment of what loneliness is like.

01:02:17,538 --> 01:02:20,542
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, it's both on, like when you hike alone.

01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:23,614
SPEAKER_1:  There's a deep loneliness.

01:02:23,842 --> 01:02:24,318
SPEAKER_1:  to that.

01:02:24,578 --> 01:02:25,310
SPEAKER_1:  It's like a...

01:02:25,826 --> 01:02:28,542
SPEAKER_1:  It's humbling that this thing...

01:02:29,122 --> 01:02:32,478
SPEAKER_1:  will last much longer than you. It's been here way before you.

01:02:33,698 --> 01:02:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  Is it the line from the moon landing? Beautiful desolation?

01:02:37,826 --> 01:02:38,750
SPEAKER_0:  Buzz Aldrin, is it?

01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:42,398
SPEAKER_1:  Beautiful desolation, is that what he said? I think so. Desolation.

01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:43,838
SPEAKER_1:  Wow. Something like that.

01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:48,414
SPEAKER_1:  but that's just words, there's a feeling to it, and you want that feeling to be real.

01:02:49,122 --> 01:02:51,198
SPEAKER_1:  You just hear there's some resources here.

01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:55,838
SPEAKER_1:  I just feel like it will hit people at a certain moment. Like it does for me with Skyrim, like...

01:02:56,738 --> 01:02:57,854
SPEAKER_1:  Holy shit, I'm here alone.

01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:03,870
SPEAKER_1:  Whatever cruel nature that's out there doesn't really care about me.

01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:11,966
SPEAKER_1:  Exactly. That's the experience. So you want to create the whole planet and you want to have many of them.

01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  We have.

01:03:14,658 --> 01:03:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  We do have many, but once you build that system, I think the numbers become.

01:03:19,522 --> 01:03:20,702
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, honestly, a little bit.

01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  We wrap it in so we can name them all and have a finite set, even though it's a very, very large number.

01:03:27,938 --> 01:03:29,502
SPEAKER_0:  but a set that we can.

01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  you know, validate.

01:03:32,066 --> 01:03:34,462
SPEAKER_0:  and know about even though it's a huge number.

01:03:34,946 --> 01:03:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  But once you...

01:03:36,418 --> 01:03:40,158
SPEAKER_0:  Once you're building a system that can build a planet, I mean a planet is sort of infinite space.

01:03:40,386 --> 01:03:41,822
SPEAKER_0:  We go back to the Daggerfall analogy.

01:03:42,242 --> 01:03:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

01:03:43,298 --> 01:03:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  If you have systems to build that much space doing...

01:03:46,338 --> 01:03:49,150
SPEAKER_0:  A hundred planets or a thousand or ten thousand or a million planets is not.

01:03:49,954 --> 01:03:52,766
SPEAKER_0:  You just press, you just change the number and press the button.

01:03:53,378 --> 01:03:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  But you can't name them all, you can't control, like, when you're getting in really big numbers.

01:03:59,426 --> 01:04:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  Hey, what is?

01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  What does the system way out here feel like if you take your ship and jump that far?

01:04:05,954 --> 01:04:10,494
SPEAKER_0:  We do level the systems when you go to system, you'll see this is like a level 40 system.

01:04:11,074 --> 01:04:14,014
SPEAKER_0:  and us being able to at least control that scale.

01:04:14,402 --> 01:04:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  is how we kind of ended up with the hundred-ish systems we have.

01:04:17,858 --> 01:04:21,233
SPEAKER_1:  What are the levelings? What do you mean by levelings?

01:04:21,233 --> 01:04:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  We'll be like when you look at a map in a game and says this is the area for low level players This is level one. Yeah. Yeah, so we do that on a system basis

01:04:31,138 --> 01:04:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  star system.

01:04:33,218 --> 01:04:36,062
SPEAKER_1:  I read that space travel is considered dangerous in this game.

01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:37,182
SPEAKER_1:  Can you explain?

01:04:37,858 --> 01:04:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  That's more of that goes back to a tone thing.

01:04:40,546 --> 01:04:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  right? When you actually play the game, because it's a game...

01:04:43,490 --> 01:04:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  Like, we don't really kill you when you...

01:04:46,178 --> 01:04:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  Fly out in space.

01:04:47,682 --> 01:04:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  but it has a tone of, there's some effort involved.

01:04:52,738 --> 01:04:57,214
SPEAKER_0:  And we've dialed it back as we've been making the game, whereas we used to run out of fuel.

01:04:57,634 --> 01:05:04,318
SPEAKER_0:  You jump and get stranded, which on paper was a great, like, it's a great moment when you get stranded and you have to press this beacon and you don't know who's gonna come.

01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  Um, turns out this not like.

01:05:07,202 --> 01:05:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  It just stops your game. We found you'd be playing the game and I ran out of fuel.

01:05:11,746 --> 01:05:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, I guess I'll just-

01:05:13,666 --> 01:05:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  wander these planets trying to mine for fuel so I can get back to what I was doing.

01:05:18,818 --> 01:05:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it's a fun killer.

01:05:20,482 --> 01:05:23,550
SPEAKER_1:  That's too realistic of a simulation of the human condition.

01:05:24,674 --> 01:05:28,414
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I know the idea was, well, it's for, you know, games do that. If you had like a hardcore.

01:05:28,738 --> 01:05:33,758
SPEAKER_0:  You're right. The hardcore survival mode, it's the kind of thing you would do. Maybe we'll do it in the future.

01:05:34,146 --> 01:05:38,846
SPEAKER_0:  But it's more of like a tone, how they build their ships, do they have all the right things for safety?

01:05:39,298 --> 01:05:42,078
SPEAKER_0:  We do get into environmental things.

01:05:42,594 --> 01:05:43,582
SPEAKER_0:  on the planets.

01:05:43,874 --> 01:05:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  You know, in your space suit, obviously a lot of different space suits and buffs for.

01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:52,734
SPEAKER_0:  you know the gases the toxicity or the temperature on on various planets

01:05:56,034 --> 01:05:57,022
SPEAKER_1:  Are there robots?

01:05:57,314 --> 01:05:58,750
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, those companions.

01:05:59,106 --> 01:06:00,414
SPEAKER_1:  Are they robust patients?

01:06:00,898 --> 01:06:03,262
SPEAKER_0:  One of the companions is a robot Vosko, yeah.

01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:07,345
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so they have a name and a personality and so on.

01:06:07,345 --> 01:06:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  Vosgo does and then there's a whole bunch of...

01:06:09,922 --> 01:06:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  I call them generic.

01:06:11,234 --> 01:06:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  robots.

01:06:13,122 --> 01:06:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  So are you like, we use them for utility?

01:06:15,682 --> 01:06:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  You know, okay, people...

01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:22,407
SPEAKER_0:  We actually dialed them back, because if you think about, well, you know a lot about this more than me in terms of-

01:06:22,407 --> 01:06:25,407
SPEAKER_1:  I'm offended right now you're calling robots generic and

01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  No, no, no, the ones we use, the ones we use. We made them more generic. We didn't say actually. Sorry, I'm very sensitive about this topic. I understand.

01:06:33,442 --> 01:06:38,686
SPEAKER_0:  If you were to chart the future, you would say robots would have a much bigger role in our future.

01:06:38,914 --> 01:06:40,222
SPEAKER_0:  than we are presenting.

01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  But that was the tone thing.

01:06:43,234 --> 01:06:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  We, most of our robots are there as utility robots, and there are some combat ones as well as enemies.

01:06:49,794 --> 01:06:51,454
SPEAKER_1:  So it's a deeply human world.

01:06:52,194 --> 01:06:54,110
SPEAKER_1:  very much. Yes. In terms of tone.

01:06:55,106 --> 01:06:55,742
SPEAKER_1:  uh so

01:06:57,538 --> 01:07:01,566
SPEAKER_1:  Have you talked to Elon about this, about this game? Have they're... Have you talked to Elon about this, about this game?

01:07:02,338 --> 01:07:08,126
SPEAKER_1:  How much of reality, like the work of SpaceX, is an inspiration for the decisions made in this game?

01:07:08,866 --> 01:07:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  I wouldn't say it's for the-

01:07:10,850 --> 01:07:12,350
SPEAKER_0:  decisions we made?

01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:13,566
SPEAKER_0:  But...

01:07:14,626 --> 01:07:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  you know, visiting SpaceX and walking in there, it was...

01:07:19,426 --> 01:07:21,630
SPEAKER_0:  It's like the Avengers meets NASA.

01:07:21,986 --> 01:07:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  It's like the most amazing.

01:07:24,162 --> 01:07:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  And here we're building the next gen, like see the dragon stuff before it was.

01:07:29,282 --> 01:07:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  uh, you know.

01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:31,582
SPEAKER_0:  other people saw it like just.

01:07:31,874 --> 01:07:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  I was really...

01:07:34,434 --> 01:07:35,134
SPEAKER_0:  in awe.

01:07:36,962 --> 01:07:40,190
SPEAKER_0:  you know, this giant machine that looks for.

01:07:40,578 --> 01:07:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  imperfections on the surface of these.

01:07:43,202 --> 01:07:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  GIANT!

01:07:44,834 --> 01:07:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

01:07:46,274 --> 01:07:47,230
SPEAKER_0:

01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:50,110
SPEAKER_0:  You know whenever and cuz you know we're in DC.

01:07:50,498 --> 01:07:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  go to the Air and Space Museum a lot, so whenever I look at...

01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:56,990
SPEAKER_0:  those kind of things or you'll visit the space shuttle.

01:07:57,506 --> 01:07:58,686
SPEAKER_0:  sort of overcome with.

01:07:58,914 --> 01:08:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  how big it is and I go stand back by the engines and think about that thing.

01:08:03,042 --> 01:08:04,254
SPEAKER_0:  leaving orbit.

01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  You know, and one of the things that Elon really impresses like...

01:08:07,778 --> 01:08:11,006
SPEAKER_0:  We're reaching the edge of physics on a lot of the stuff where...

01:08:11,394 --> 01:08:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  how hard it is.

01:08:13,378 --> 01:08:14,142
SPEAKER_0:  to leave.

01:08:15,074 --> 01:08:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  orbit.

01:08:16,546 --> 01:08:17,982
SPEAKER_0:  the gravitational pull.

01:08:18,626 --> 01:08:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  And so the engineering that has gone into that.

01:08:22,242 --> 01:08:24,478
SPEAKER_0:  R-Space program, what he's doing now.

01:08:25,058 --> 01:08:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  I just marvel at it. I don't understand.

01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,942
SPEAKER_0:  Right, I'm not at that level, but I marvel at the-

01:08:31,362 --> 01:08:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  kind of.

01:08:32,130 --> 01:08:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  human ingenuity and scale.

01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:36,254
SPEAKER_0:  I was.

01:08:37,218 --> 01:08:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  on the Delaware coast.

01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:40,190
SPEAKER_0:  Last month.

01:08:41,442 --> 01:08:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  And I went outside, I was outside for some reason, and it was dark.

01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:44,926
SPEAKER_0:  And I saw this.

01:08:45,154 --> 01:08:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  Crazy light.

01:08:46,306 --> 01:08:47,038
SPEAKER_0:  in the sky.

01:08:48,098 --> 01:08:49,726
SPEAKER_0:  and I thought it was like a helicopter.

01:08:50,402 --> 01:08:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  and that didn't go away.

01:08:52,386 --> 01:08:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  I'm like, someone, what is that? I call my-

01:08:56,322 --> 01:08:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  with some friends. Hey.

01:08:57,698 --> 01:09:02,366
SPEAKER_0:  Did everybody see this? What is that? And we just stood dumbfounded looking at this thing in the sky.

01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:04,350
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:08,798
SPEAKER_0:  Like that is a UFO. Nobody takes their phone out.

01:09:09,218 --> 01:09:14,494
SPEAKER_0:  Everyone, I'm with like four people. Everyone is too dumbstruck. You would think, why don't you take a picture of this thing?

01:09:15,266 --> 01:09:20,254
SPEAKER_0:  And the next day we found out it was in the news, it was the SpaceX launch in Florida.

01:09:21,954 --> 01:09:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm seeing it from.

01:09:24,514 --> 01:09:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  Delaware, Maryland area.

01:09:26,594 --> 01:09:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  It was one of the most, it was incredible.

01:09:28,866 --> 01:09:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  It's just even just that.

01:09:30,914 --> 01:09:32,382
SPEAKER_0:  I am in complete awe.

01:09:33,026 --> 01:09:39,454
SPEAKER_1:  Is there some aspect to that that you can replicate the majestic nature of that in the video game?

01:09:41,058 --> 01:09:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  I wish I had the answer to that. You know, I think some of it we-

01:09:45,506 --> 01:09:51,070
SPEAKER_0:  we're doing when you're standing on a planet and you see the other moons go by and then you realize

01:09:51,394 --> 01:09:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  I could get my ship blast off and land there.

01:09:54,082 --> 01:09:56,254
SPEAKER_0:  build myself a home. I think that's pretty cool.

01:09:57,410 --> 01:10:10,750
SPEAKER_0:  There's a minor thing we do, which is we have other ships come and go from the starports when you're there. So you'll be in a city and then you hear this, you hear the engine, you look up and a ship is taken off or coming. That's great. There's nothing for you to do, but-

01:10:12,386 --> 01:10:14,142
SPEAKER_0:  It's, I think it's awesome. Yeah.

01:10:14,306 --> 01:10:14,654
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:10:15,714 --> 01:10:16,446
SPEAKER_1:  And then that's all.

01:10:16,706 --> 01:10:19,006
SPEAKER_1:  about creating the soundscape to feel.

01:10:19,586 --> 01:10:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  seeing it and like, oh, that's real. That's a ship that...

01:10:22,402 --> 01:10:25,726
SPEAKER_0:  Or you jump into a system and you see these freighters and...

01:10:26,274 --> 01:10:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  Sometimes they contact you like.

01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:10:30,018 --> 01:10:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  It's not all just like jump in and combat.

01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:33,598
SPEAKER_1:  Do you ever think about?

01:10:33,986 --> 01:10:36,574
SPEAKER_1:  The fact that science fiction seems to make a...

01:10:38,018 --> 01:10:40,350
SPEAKER_1:  It has a way of creating reality.

01:10:41,026 --> 01:10:41,950
SPEAKER_1:  not just kind of...

01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:43,806
SPEAKER_1:  predicting it or

01:10:44,418 --> 01:10:45,758
SPEAKER_1:  imagining it.

01:10:46,274 --> 01:10:49,854
SPEAKER_1:  It's almost like the thing you put out there with a video game like this.

01:10:50,722 --> 01:10:53,630
SPEAKER_1:  like Starfield that you can anticipate.

01:10:54,594 --> 01:10:58,526
SPEAKER_1:  It kind of fuels people's imagination what is possible.

01:11:01,346 --> 01:11:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe, I don't know. I can't.

01:11:03,906 --> 01:11:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  I can't say. You're making me think now about other science fiction that-

01:11:09,314 --> 01:11:11,486
SPEAKER_0:  Movie I love, Minority Report, it's more of like a-

01:11:11,906 --> 01:11:14,718
SPEAKER_0:  not a space movie, but more like looking at the future.

01:11:15,554 --> 01:11:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  If you look at a lot of the things in that movie, it's almost like, I think those are coming true.

01:11:20,066 --> 01:11:20,510
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:22,078
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, uh...

01:11:22,306 --> 01:11:25,502
SPEAKER_1:  Is that the one that you do interface this like a.

01:11:25,826 --> 01:11:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  the interfaces and then the way he looks at his child is more like a holographic almost AR

01:11:32,066 --> 01:11:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  VR kind of thing or.

01:11:34,338 --> 01:11:35,934
SPEAKER_0:  digital billboards.

01:11:36,610 --> 01:11:39,774
SPEAKER_0:  or trying to predict human behavior.

01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  There's just a lot of future stuff in that movie. As it comes to sci-fi, to your other question, I don't know.

01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:47,646
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know.

01:11:48,738 --> 01:11:51,742
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I think it does. And it's interesting. I mean, I suppose.

01:11:52,674 --> 01:11:54,014
SPEAKER_1:  you're trying to create the most.

01:11:54,498 --> 01:11:55,198
SPEAKER_1:  realist.

01:11:55,586 --> 01:11:56,830
SPEAKER_1:  sticking to the tone.

01:11:57,314 --> 01:12:02,718
SPEAKER_1:  the most immersive, realistic world, and almost by accident, you create the thing that is possible.

01:12:03,106 --> 01:12:06,174
SPEAKER_1:  because you want it to be realistic in some deep sense. So.

01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:08,798
SPEAKER_1:  accidentally can become.

01:12:09,218 --> 01:12:11,262
SPEAKER_1:  the possible and then that places.

01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:13,022
SPEAKER_1:  that idea in people's heads.

01:12:13,538 --> 01:12:16,894
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, if humans are ever to become a multi-planetary species...

01:12:18,146 --> 01:12:18,750
SPEAKER_1:  We need.

01:12:19,778 --> 01:12:21,118
SPEAKER_1:  We need to play games.

01:12:21,826 --> 01:12:25,694
SPEAKER_1:  We need to read sci-fi to help imagine that that's possible.

01:12:26,466 --> 01:12:27,806
SPEAKER_1:  to look outside of Earth.

01:12:28,066 --> 01:12:31,678
SPEAKER_1:  to look outside, look up on the stars, and then we can actually travel out there.

01:12:32,354 --> 01:12:37,086
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know, there's power to sci-fi to do that. I guess you shouldn't feel the pressure of that.

01:12:37,442 --> 01:12:37,886
SPEAKER_1:  d

01:12:38,658 --> 01:12:40,158
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know if I'd make the leap.

01:12:41,026 --> 01:12:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  Now that's all that what we're doing might.

01:12:43,746 --> 01:12:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  No, maybe, you know.

01:12:46,914 --> 01:12:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  One of our in-

01:12:48,034 --> 01:12:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  Hopefully, it might inspire some young people who are headed.

01:12:52,066 --> 01:12:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  in that direction alike.

01:12:54,114 --> 01:12:55,230
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, I thought about-

01:12:55,554 --> 01:13:00,702
SPEAKER_0:  getting into space and space exploration and being an engineer doing these things and I played this game and

01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it really...

01:13:03,202 --> 01:13:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  sparked that interest in me. So I'm gonna go take that as a field and maybe that's the person.

01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:10,206
SPEAKER_0:  who goes and does some of these things.

01:13:10,594 --> 01:13:12,798
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, because in the next couple of decades...

01:13:13,634 --> 01:13:14,430
SPEAKER_1:  a likely.

01:13:15,042 --> 01:13:16,926
SPEAKER_1:  A human being will step foot on Mars.

01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:21,278
SPEAKER_1:  which are the first steps towards us becoming multis-planetary.

01:13:22,018 --> 01:13:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  And then if you read some of the stuff they're doing with the James Webb telescope.

01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  and then being able to look for signs of life.

01:13:30,082 --> 01:13:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  on other planets.

01:13:31,842 --> 01:13:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  is quite fascinating.

01:13:33,378 --> 01:13:36,990
SPEAKER_0:  And, you know, recent stuff I read say they think in 20 years they will.

01:13:38,434 --> 01:13:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:13:39,874 --> 01:13:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  It's actually quite encouraging to think.

01:13:42,882 --> 01:13:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  I suppose the dream of mine, like in our lifetimes, that we discover life.

01:13:47,618 --> 01:13:48,414
SPEAKER_0:  on another planet.

01:13:49,218 --> 01:13:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:13:50,466 --> 01:13:52,030
SPEAKER_1:  especially if it's intelligent life.

01:13:52,418 --> 01:13:54,270
SPEAKER_1:  I've been talking to a lot of biologists and

01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:56,894
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of folks, I imagine there's life everywhere.

01:13:57,090 --> 01:13:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  there. The numbers are

01:13:58,946 --> 01:13:59,934
SPEAKER_0:  Would say so, yes.

01:14:00,354 --> 01:14:01,566
SPEAKER_1:  The challenge of the question is...

01:14:01,826 --> 01:14:04,350
SPEAKER_1:  what it looks like and how much of it is intelligent.

01:14:04,962 --> 01:14:09,086
SPEAKER_1:  So a lot of biologists tell me the big, big difficult leap is from the...

01:14:09,442 --> 01:14:13,150
SPEAKER_1:  prokaryotes to the eukaryotes, so like the complex life.

01:14:13,538 --> 01:14:14,302
SPEAKER_1:  It could be that.

01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of our universe is just filled with bacteria.

01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:20,254
SPEAKER_0:  I believe if I'm understanding it right.

01:14:20,482 --> 01:14:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  that there's two ways they're gonna look at planets. When they can look at, you know, they can read, hey, this planet has this kind of gas.

01:14:26,818 --> 01:14:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  They can now look at the ones that are created by...

01:14:29,282 --> 01:14:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  potential life forms and then the ones that are created.

01:14:32,418 --> 01:14:34,270
SPEAKER_0:  the byproducts of industry.

01:14:34,818 --> 01:14:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  There's only certain ones that are created if you have a society there.

01:14:38,914 --> 01:14:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  and that they can start looking.

01:14:41,346 --> 01:14:45,182
SPEAKER_0:  on these types of star systems and these planets.

01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  But it takes a lot of time because you have to book time in that telescope. You have to look at that planet over a long period of time.

01:14:53,282 --> 01:14:56,990
SPEAKER_0:  in theory, given enough time, given the amount of space out there.

01:14:59,714 --> 01:15:00,318
SPEAKER_0:  We would find one.

01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:04,414
SPEAKER_1:  That would be a cool thing in this short life of ours to find out.

01:15:05,122 --> 01:15:06,750
SPEAKER_1:  definitively that there isn't.

01:15:07,202 --> 01:15:08,510
SPEAKER_1:  and in industrial.

01:15:08,802 --> 01:15:10,654
SPEAKER_1:  intelligent civilization out there.

01:15:11,554 --> 01:15:13,918
SPEAKER_1:  before you contact them, so like die.

01:15:14,370 --> 01:15:15,518
SPEAKER_1:  End your life.

01:15:16,482 --> 01:15:18,750
SPEAKER_1:  Not knowing the rest of the story.

01:15:19,010 --> 01:15:21,310
SPEAKER_1:  but just know that it's out there. That's a cool.

01:15:21,954 --> 01:15:23,870
SPEAKER_1:  And then if you have kids, be like.

01:15:24,226 --> 01:15:24,542
SPEAKER_1:  Well.

01:15:24,834 --> 01:15:25,758
SPEAKER_1:  This one's on you.

01:15:26,018 --> 01:15:26,654
SPEAKER_1:  Hehehe

01:15:27,170 --> 01:15:28,446
SPEAKER_1:  F this amount

01:15:28,674 --> 01:15:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  and I'm fascinated by what it would do.

01:15:31,682 --> 01:15:34,430
SPEAKER_0:  to the way, I think in a positive way, the way.

01:15:35,106 --> 01:15:36,670
SPEAKER_0:  humanity thinks about itself.

01:15:36,962 --> 01:15:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  here.

01:15:37,698 --> 01:15:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  Like, no, there is a-

01:15:39,458 --> 01:15:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  Defendively.

01:15:41,282 --> 01:15:42,110
SPEAKER_0:  other life out there.

01:15:42,530 --> 01:15:45,182
SPEAKER_1:  I mean both things, if there isn't life out there.

01:15:46,018 --> 01:15:48,510
SPEAKER_1:  That's also a huge responsibility.

01:15:48,962 --> 01:15:50,174
SPEAKER_1:  Both are super exciting.

01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:56,798
SPEAKER_1:  For a loan, it's super exciting because there's a responsibility to preserve whatever special thing we have going on here.

01:15:57,282 --> 01:15:58,270
SPEAKER_1:  This, uh...

01:15:59,330 --> 01:16:01,630
SPEAKER_1:  whether you call it the flame of consciousness or...

01:16:02,178 --> 01:16:04,926
SPEAKER_1:  Whether it's consciousness or intelligence, that's a special thing.

01:16:05,282 --> 01:16:06,046
SPEAKER_1:  Preserve it.

01:16:06,626 --> 01:16:07,518
SPEAKER_1:  have it expand.

01:16:08,034 --> 01:16:09,374
SPEAKER_1:  But if there's others out there...

01:16:10,114 --> 01:16:10,558
SPEAKER_1:  I mean.

01:16:10,786 --> 01:16:15,102
SPEAKER_1:  that sparks that drive for exploration.

01:16:16,226 --> 01:16:18,270
SPEAKER_1:  of reaching out to the stars and meeting them.

01:16:19,458 --> 01:16:20,926
SPEAKER_1:  Most of them probably want to kill us.

01:16:21,538 --> 01:16:21,854
SPEAKER_1:  You

01:16:22,818 --> 01:16:23,454
SPEAKER_1:  So...

01:16:23,938 --> 01:16:30,398
SPEAKER_1:  But luckily we have the military industrial complex on earth that builds bigger and better weapons all the time. improvement of the development

01:16:30,690 --> 01:16:31,582
SPEAKER_1:  Space Force.

01:16:31,810 --> 01:16:34,686
SPEAKER_1:  It will both protect us and destroy all our enemies.

01:16:36,610 --> 01:16:37,374
SPEAKER_1:  Everyone.

01:16:37,986 --> 01:16:38,718
SPEAKER_1:  UGH

01:16:38,946 --> 01:16:42,142
SPEAKER_1:  This is 100% a video game we're living in.

01:16:42,594 --> 01:16:48,798
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, back to dragons. So blink once if you know when Elder Scrolls 6 is coming out.

01:16:49,762 --> 01:16:51,166
SPEAKER_1:  but are not going to tell me.

01:16:53,506 --> 01:16:54,974
SPEAKER_1:  I have a vague idea.

01:16:55,202 --> 01:16:57,534
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, big idea.

01:16:58,274 --> 01:16:59,614
SPEAKER_1:  So like if you have the.

01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:05,726
SPEAKER_1:  quantum mechanical interpretation that allows for multiple universes in the universe where you didn't blink.

01:17:06,274 --> 01:17:06,686
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:17:07,138 --> 01:17:10,494
SPEAKER_1:  What would that Todd tell me about the year it's coming up?

01:17:10,946 --> 01:17:12,821
SPEAKER_1:  would be 2025.

01:17:12,821 --> 01:17:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  Question

01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  or 26. I've been asked that question many ways, but never like that. Yeah.

01:17:18,498 --> 01:17:24,222
SPEAKER_1:  I thought I would try to sneak it. I mean, there is, of course, no answer.

01:17:24,386 --> 01:17:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  because I wish it was soon.

01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  You know, like we don't.

01:17:28,802 --> 01:17:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  We want them out too, you know.

01:17:32,514 --> 01:17:34,526
SPEAKER_0:  and I wish they didn't take as long.

01:17:34,754 --> 01:17:35,710
SPEAKER_0:  as they did.

01:17:35,938 --> 01:17:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  But they do.

01:17:37,826 --> 01:17:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  And

01:17:39,074 --> 01:17:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  Look, I mean, if I could go back in time, would never have been my plan to wait.

01:17:42,626 --> 01:17:43,582
SPEAKER_0:  as long as it's

01:17:43,842 --> 01:17:44,574
SPEAKER_0:  It's taken.

01:17:44,866 --> 01:17:45,790
SPEAKER_0:  for it.

01:17:46,658 --> 01:17:47,774
SPEAKER_1:  So you love that world.

01:17:47,970 --> 01:17:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  The eldest girl's world. But look, it's-

01:17:49,986 --> 01:17:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  As part of why I've spent more time there than anything else in my life probably, right?

01:17:55,650 --> 01:17:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  Um

01:17:57,186 --> 01:18:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  I deeply love it. We all do. It's a part of us and

01:18:02,562 --> 01:18:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  You know, when you aren't doing it for a while, you really do miss it.

01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and when I look at what we're doing,

01:18:10,818 --> 01:18:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  have planned for that game.

01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:15,038
SPEAKER_0:  That was a meeting.

01:18:15,746 --> 01:18:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  Yesterday

01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:19,678
SPEAKER_0:  I just want to play all this right now.

01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  But it.

01:18:22,050 --> 01:18:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we're gonna make sure we do it right.

01:18:23,906 --> 01:18:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  for everybody and.

01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:27,070
SPEAKER_0:  We do have to approach it.

01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  People are playing games for a long time, you know, Skyrim's 11 years old.

01:18:33,218 --> 01:18:35,390
SPEAKER_0:  Still probably our most played game.

01:18:35,650 --> 01:18:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  and so we don't see it slowing down.

01:18:38,178 --> 01:18:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  And...

01:18:39,490 --> 01:18:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  People were probably playing it.

01:18:41,826 --> 01:18:45,214
SPEAKER_0:  10 years from now also. So you have to think about, okay.

01:18:46,466 --> 01:18:47,678
SPEAKER_0:  People are gonna play.

01:18:47,938 --> 01:18:49,470
SPEAKER_0:  the next Elder Scrolls game for...

01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  decade, two decades, and that does change the way you think about.

01:18:55,138 --> 01:18:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  how you.

01:18:56,066 --> 01:18:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  architect it.

01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  from the get-go.

01:18:58,914 --> 01:19:01,790
SPEAKER_1:  What are some elements that changed the way?

01:19:02,498 --> 01:19:05,438
SPEAKER_1:  Like, how do you make a game that's playable for 20 years?

01:19:06,402 --> 01:19:09,351
SPEAKER_0:  I know we're trying to figure that out.

01:19:09,351 --> 01:19:12,798
SPEAKER_1:  I should pause on that, you know, pardon me, I'm of course asking.

01:19:13,314 --> 01:19:15,294
SPEAKER_1:  Jokingly, I'm excited for it, but

01:19:15,874 --> 01:19:17,726
SPEAKER_1:  I think Skyrim is an amazing game still.

01:19:18,562 --> 01:19:19,687
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I really enjoy.

01:19:19,687 --> 01:19:22,526
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, and you know what? The content, the...

01:19:22,914 --> 01:19:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  Even if you think if you step away from it for a while, then play what I'll put say the vanilla version without mods if you go and haven't played in a while.

01:19:30,114 --> 01:19:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  There's always a new way to play it.

01:19:32,066 --> 01:19:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  But then if you look at the mods and what creators are doing to it.

01:19:35,714 --> 01:19:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  We think that is just awesome.

01:19:37,282 --> 01:19:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  It's something that we've always supported. We're gonna keep supporting.

01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  We've...

01:19:43,138 --> 01:19:50,462
SPEAKER_0:  hired a large number of modders that are now professionals. We want to support the people who are doing on their own so they can be.

01:19:50,754 --> 01:19:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  professionals on their own.

01:19:54,146 --> 01:19:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  And...

01:19:54,946 --> 01:19:58,462
SPEAKER_1:  how you create a world that's moddable. So you think of designing a game.

01:19:59,042 --> 01:19:59,710
SPEAKER_1:  from the start.

01:19:59,938 --> 01:20:00,510
SPEAKER_1:  as

01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:02,494
SPEAKER_1:  that enables.

01:20:02,594 --> 01:20:03,454
SPEAKER_0:  mods.

01:20:03,906 --> 01:20:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  Absolutely.

01:20:05,666 --> 01:20:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  So it starts with us, like everything we're doing. Okay, a modder, a content creator is gonna have to do it, use our tools.

01:20:12,610 --> 01:20:18,398
SPEAKER_0:  Now we do clean them up for release, because if you're like a developer in house, you can deal with some clujiness.

01:20:18,850 --> 01:20:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  when you're putting stuff together, when you put it out for people.

01:20:21,826 --> 01:20:25,982
SPEAKER_0:  We do clean a lot of it up and there's still a lot obviously a learning curve there.

01:20:26,466 --> 01:20:29,470
SPEAKER_0:  But we have look we have people been doing it for 20 years with us

01:20:29,954 --> 01:20:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:20:30,594 --> 01:20:34,046
SPEAKER_1:  What's involved with modding? I'm actually quite newbish at this.

01:20:34,306 --> 01:20:42,238
SPEAKER_1:  And I'm almost afraid to ask, because now that you explained to me, I fear I will spend a very large amount of time creating mods.

01:20:42,658 --> 01:20:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  Well, we have an editor you can download on Steam, the creation kit for our games, and then it loads up the world and you could do something really, really small, change the color of the weather.

01:20:52,802 --> 01:20:56,350
SPEAKER_0:  and it creates a little plug-in file, we call it, you know, a modification of the game.

01:20:56,738 --> 01:20:57,342
SPEAKER_0:  and then

01:20:57,634 --> 01:20:59,006
SPEAKER_0:  you can run your game with that.

01:20:59,618 --> 01:21:03,070
SPEAKER_0:  It's on console now, the mods, not the editing.

01:21:03,842 --> 01:21:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  It's just been incredible. Our community there has been...

01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  Amazing what they do with the games.

01:21:11,234 --> 01:21:13,662
SPEAKER_1:  So a lot of it is the visuals.

01:21:14,242 --> 01:21:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of people do visual things because it's the easiest thing to do first or they're building new space.

01:21:19,106 --> 01:21:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  There's some great things with like, I love the Khajiit follower mod for Skyrim.

01:21:24,994 --> 01:21:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  It's awesome.

01:21:26,274 --> 01:21:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  um...

01:21:27,330 --> 01:21:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  The...

01:21:28,322 --> 01:21:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  There have been quest lines. Those things just take a really really long time

01:21:32,866 --> 01:21:34,750
SPEAKER_0:  And so someone is going to do that.

01:21:35,522 --> 01:21:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  That's almost like it takes him a long time. It's more than a hobby.

01:21:39,586 --> 01:21:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:21:40,802 --> 01:21:45,438
SPEAKER_0:  We're always looking at ways that we can make it like, hey, they can turn a career into it.

01:21:45,858 --> 01:21:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  cuz

01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  It's just awesome.

01:21:49,090 --> 01:21:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  What about, is there any possibility in?

01:21:52,642 --> 01:21:54,110
SPEAKER_1:  doing a mod for the...

01:21:54,882 --> 01:21:56,190
SPEAKER_1:  some of the AI stuff.

01:21:57,026 --> 01:21:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  There is.

01:21:58,594 --> 01:22:07,070
SPEAKER_0:  And I've seen some, but to really move it along, if they're using the tools that we already put out there, so to really move the AI along, you'd have to get in the code.

01:22:07,554 --> 01:22:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  which...

01:22:08,418 --> 01:22:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  Some people have figured out ways to hack in and do things with script extenders.

01:22:12,930 --> 01:22:15,390
SPEAKER_0:  but for the most part, like really pushing it.

01:22:15,618 --> 01:22:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  it does take us, which is why you see.

01:22:17,890 --> 01:22:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  when we have a new game come along.

01:22:20,226 --> 01:22:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  the palette that they have is there's so many more things they can do.

01:22:24,258 --> 01:22:28,766
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I've built bots that play the driving games.

01:22:29,410 --> 01:22:33,118
SPEAKER_1:  but they do that by just taking, reading the screen.

01:22:33,474 --> 01:22:34,494
SPEAKER_1:  and doing basic.

01:22:34,754 --> 01:22:39,998
SPEAKER_1:  not basic, it's actually pretty complicated, but computer vision and doing the control, be basically assimilating the human player.

01:22:40,610 --> 01:22:44,222
SPEAKER_1:  to do that for Skyrim or for some of the open world games.

01:22:44,578 --> 01:22:47,614
SPEAKER_1:  That's literally you have to create AGI to be able to. Yep.

01:22:48,066 --> 01:22:48,702
SPEAKER_1:  to play.

01:22:49,922 --> 01:22:52,542
SPEAKER_1:  those open, well maybe not, maybe you can create a super dumb.

01:22:53,026 --> 01:22:56,401
SPEAKER_1:  like just a two handed sword and just keep swinging until

01:22:56,401 --> 01:23:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  Look, there's some bot stuff out there that does it. We have some very, very dumb bots that we use to run through the world to test it.

01:23:04,482 --> 01:23:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  that we'll deploy on a whole bunch of servers just to, you know, we do it every day. We run through every space.

01:23:09,986 --> 01:23:10,718
SPEAKER_0:  We're doing Starfield.

01:23:10,914 --> 01:23:12,574
SPEAKER_1:  And it's just running, they're all.

01:23:13,026 --> 01:23:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  Well, it does it very quickly. It loads up every place, every...

01:23:17,954 --> 01:23:21,790
SPEAKER_0:  every place in the game and runs around a little bit and then loads the next place and runs around a little bit

01:23:22,018 --> 01:23:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  We're just testing like, did it crash? What's the memory growth? What's the fr-

01:23:25,346 --> 01:23:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  Get a report, here are all the places where the frame rate wasn't up to snuff.

01:23:29,154 --> 01:23:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  And then we do have one that will play on its own. It's heavily scripted, but it lets us test.

01:23:35,298 --> 01:23:38,590
SPEAKER_0:  you know, every time we make a build, there's a bot that runs through like the first

01:23:39,522 --> 01:23:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  one or two main quests. Like it'll just play it.

01:23:42,274 --> 01:23:44,062
SPEAKER_0:  That way we know, do we break anything?

01:23:44,898 --> 01:23:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  because you don't want to waste like QA's time, like you guys broke it again within five minutes.

01:23:50,626 --> 01:23:53,182
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, that's for like a...

01:23:53,922 --> 01:23:54,526
SPEAKER_1:  Broken stuff.

01:23:54,786 --> 01:23:56,318
SPEAKER_1:  I wonder if you can build a bot.

01:23:56,930 --> 01:23:59,555
SPEAKER_1:  that estimates the quality of the experience.

01:23:59,555 --> 01:24:01,055
SPEAKER_0:  Oh my gosh. Okay, can you do that?

01:24:01,055 --> 01:24:03,614
SPEAKER_1:  But just like the number.

01:24:04,322 --> 01:24:06,718
SPEAKER_1:  Like how boring or not boring, the boring meter.

01:24:07,106 --> 01:24:07,998
SPEAKER_1:  how many times you die.

01:24:08,866 --> 01:24:12,894
SPEAKER_1:  How many times you die? Is death boring or exciting? That's the question. How many times do you die?

01:24:13,666 --> 01:24:18,014
SPEAKER_1:  I feel like there's a balance to be struck there because you always want to be in fear of death.

01:24:18,530 --> 01:24:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, we always we have this chart at work we use, which is like if you think about any game that you've played that you've put down.

01:24:24,866 --> 01:24:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  It's either about a frustration.

01:24:26,978 --> 01:24:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  slash confusion.

01:24:28,738 --> 01:24:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  Boredom.

01:24:30,146 --> 01:24:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  You gotta put the player right.

01:24:32,674 --> 01:24:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  in the middle of that.

01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:37,054
SPEAKER_1:  but I've sometimes put down games from frustration.

01:24:37,730 --> 01:24:38,846
SPEAKER_1:  only to return.

01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:40,190
SPEAKER_1:  Again.

01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:41,278
SPEAKER_1:  stronger.

01:24:41,506 --> 01:24:42,494
SPEAKER_1:  Dark Souls.

01:24:42,722 --> 01:24:43,902
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:24:44,226 --> 01:24:46,494
SPEAKER_1:  So I mean, that's, I mean, the challenge.

01:24:47,394 --> 01:24:48,638
SPEAKER_1:  That's part of it.

01:24:48,866 --> 01:24:54,590
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I don't know. Actually Skyrim, I'm one of those. I mean, I'm sure there's all kinds of humans that you've interacted with.

01:24:55,042 --> 01:24:57,534
SPEAKER_1:  about what they enjoy. which are من

01:24:58,018 --> 01:24:58,974
SPEAKER_1:  I could enjoy this.

01:24:59,202 --> 01:25:02,494
SPEAKER_1:  Skyrim on any difficulty level.

01:25:02,818 --> 01:25:03,358
SPEAKER_1:  All of it.

01:25:04,034 --> 01:25:08,638
SPEAKER_1:  So it depends. The open world nature of it is what's really compelling.

01:25:09,282 --> 01:25:12,318
SPEAKER_1:  not necessarily the challenge of the particular quest and so on.

01:25:12,898 --> 01:25:15,523
SPEAKER_1:  But I'm not sure if that's the same experience for everybody.

01:25:15,523 --> 01:25:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  play the survival mode? There's a survival mode in Skyrim. It was a creation club thing. It does like...

01:25:21,634 --> 01:25:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  some hunger, it does hot and cold.

01:25:24,258 --> 01:25:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  It does some other systems that make it.

01:25:27,842 --> 01:25:28,414
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

01:25:28,642 --> 01:25:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  in our minds more believable.

01:25:31,522 --> 01:25:37,374
SPEAKER_0:  Um, it was actually a creation club thing made by an external creator who is now full time with us.

01:25:38,754 --> 01:25:40,958
SPEAKER_1:  So can we actually thinking about...

01:25:41,474 --> 01:25:44,190
SPEAKER_1:  Starfield thinking about as a scroll six

01:25:44,802 --> 01:25:45,790
SPEAKER_1:  Go through.

01:25:46,178 --> 01:25:49,950
SPEAKER_1:  the full life of a video game you've created.

01:25:50,338 --> 01:25:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  So what's it take to take a game?

01:25:53,570 --> 01:25:55,646
SPEAKER_1:  from the idea to the final product.

01:25:56,642 --> 01:25:58,686
SPEAKER_1:  What are the different steps along the way?

01:25:59,426 --> 01:26:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  Great question.

01:26:01,122 --> 01:26:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  Um, well, usually it starts with...

01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:07,742
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, honestly, lunchtime conversations with a number of us.

01:26:08,098 --> 01:26:13,630
SPEAKER_0:  Hey, we think we want to do this. This is what it's going to be like. I mean, look, with an Elder Scrolls, you know you're going to do it.

01:26:14,722 --> 01:26:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  It's a matter of when. Okay.

01:26:16,898 --> 01:26:19,582
SPEAKER_0:  What's the tone we're going for, right? Where's it set?

01:26:20,386 --> 01:26:22,110
SPEAKER_0:  So we usually start with the world.

01:26:23,298 --> 01:26:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  And then...

01:26:24,898 --> 01:26:26,174
SPEAKER_0:  We were always overlapping.

01:26:26,850 --> 01:26:27,358
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:26:27,682 --> 01:26:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  while we're making one game.

01:26:29,634 --> 01:26:30,334
SPEAKER_0:  as we are.

01:26:30,658 --> 01:26:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  you know, getting in the throws of it or wrapping it up.

01:26:33,634 --> 01:26:36,670
SPEAKER_0:  You know, meh, probably by the midpoint of one game.

01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  We've had enough conversations.

01:26:40,258 --> 01:26:43,422
SPEAKER_0:  to understand what the next one's gonna be.

01:26:44,034 --> 01:26:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  What are the big ticket like? Where's it set? What's the tone?

01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  Is there a big ticket feature or two that make it really unique?

01:26:52,450 --> 01:26:56,702
SPEAKER_0:  And then when we're finishing one game, we start...

01:26:58,146 --> 01:26:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  prototyping.

01:26:59,138 --> 01:27:00,702
SPEAKER_0:  Sorry, before that we start concepting.

01:27:01,122 --> 01:27:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  So we'll do concept art.

01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:04,350
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:27:04,578 --> 01:27:08,190
SPEAKER_0:  For one reason or another, I usually have the beginning of the game.

01:27:08,514 --> 01:27:11,422
SPEAKER_0:  Worked out. I like to think about, okay, how's the game start?

01:27:11,714 --> 01:27:12,798
SPEAKER_0:  What's the player do first?

01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  We do music early

01:27:15,906 --> 01:27:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  You know, so take Elder Scrolls 6, we forgot where it's set. What's the tone? What are the big features? We discussed the beginning of the game, which we've had for a very long time.

01:27:24,354 --> 01:27:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  Where's it set again? Um, yep.

01:27:26,850 --> 01:27:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  Ehh... in Tamriel.

01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:30,046
SPEAKER_0:  And...

01:27:31,010 --> 01:27:31,902
SPEAKER_1:  Ah, dammit.

01:27:32,322 --> 01:27:36,638
SPEAKER_1:  Well, at least we know we narrowed it down that that would be epic if it was like.

01:27:37,058 --> 01:27:38,398
SPEAKER_1:  portal into another dimension.

01:27:38,818 --> 01:27:39,262
SPEAKER_1:  Anyway.

01:27:39,522 --> 01:27:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  Then I like to do music.

01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  So we've already done.

01:27:43,074 --> 01:27:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  a take on the music.

01:27:45,186 --> 01:27:46,311
SPEAKER_0:  for Elder Scrolls VI.

01:27:46,311 --> 01:27:50,811
SPEAKER_1:  So you can sit there with the concept art and the music you can feel.

01:27:50,811 --> 01:27:54,878
SPEAKER_0:  No, no, the music, we put in the teaser for it. This was 2018.

01:27:55,714 --> 01:27:57,022
SPEAKER_0:  We've taken that.

01:27:57,634 --> 01:27:58,558
SPEAKER_0:  further obviously.

01:27:59,746 --> 01:28:00,638
SPEAKER_0:  and...

01:28:01,730 --> 01:28:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  Again, we're working on the world. You're then doing concepting and design for the world. And then once

01:28:07,298 --> 01:28:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  We're wrapping up one game. We can really start prototyping.

01:28:10,754 --> 01:28:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  the new one and you're usually building kind of your initial spaces.

01:28:14,498 --> 01:28:18,142
SPEAKER_0:  And so we do like to do like a first playable, a smaller section of the game.

01:28:18,818 --> 01:28:19,134
SPEAKER_0:  that.

01:28:19,586 --> 01:28:21,790
SPEAKER_0:  we can sort of prove out and show to people, hey.

01:28:22,114 --> 01:28:24,990
SPEAKER_0:  This is how it feels different, this is what it looks like, this is what's unique about it.

01:28:25,538 --> 01:28:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  Then we turn that into a larger chunk when more of the team comes on when the other game is done.

01:28:31,074 --> 01:28:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  And that's still what we call a VS vertical slice. So you still don't have the full team on it.

01:28:37,378 --> 01:28:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  and it's a larger chunk of the game that you can play. And then once you feel good about that, you're going to bring on...

01:28:44,418 --> 01:28:45,598
SPEAKER_0:  the rest of the team.

01:28:46,274 --> 01:28:54,878
SPEAKER_0:  And we're fortunate that the other games we've done are popular enough that we can be doing DLC and content and those kind of things while we're getting the one going and then we're at full production.

01:28:55,490 --> 01:28:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  where we're sort of at maximum size.

01:28:58,050 --> 01:28:58,814
SPEAKER_0:  We just call that.

01:28:59,298 --> 01:29:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  production that's like the full production period

01:29:02,018 --> 01:29:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  And that, depending on the game...

01:29:05,026 --> 01:29:07,422
SPEAKER_0:  you know, can run a year or two years.

01:29:07,874 --> 01:29:08,766
SPEAKER_0:  maybe more.

01:29:10,210 --> 01:29:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  and then you kind of have a finalizing.

01:29:12,770 --> 01:29:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  final six months to a year on a game, which is, okay, we've built everything now.

01:29:18,434 --> 01:29:19,006
SPEAKER_0:  Um

01:29:20,322 --> 01:29:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  and usually it needs a lot of glue.

01:29:23,106 --> 01:29:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  where we have a lot of.

01:29:24,994 --> 01:29:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  very different elements that maybe aren't clicking together the way you want outside of the regular polish for levels and features

01:29:31,362 --> 01:29:39,710
SPEAKER_0:  And we're shaving and gluing and sticking things together so that it's not the schizophrenic game experience that things flow from one into another.

01:29:40,066 --> 01:29:41,191
SPEAKER_0:  In terms of story.

01:29:41,191 --> 01:29:41,941
SPEAKER_1:  I can, and that.

01:29:41,941 --> 01:29:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  It's really, no, usually the story, the designers have done a really good job. It's more about game features.

01:29:48,034 --> 01:29:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  you know, and then how they interact with the story or, Hey, I went from this experience to this experience or.

01:29:53,826 --> 01:29:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  Picking flowers in alchemy feels like a different game.

01:29:57,634 --> 01:29:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  then.

01:29:58,562 --> 01:30:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  And then how is another character referencing that?

01:30:01,602 --> 01:30:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  and how is that intersecting with

01:30:04,930 --> 01:30:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  the skill system and the interface.

01:30:07,074 --> 01:30:07,390
SPEAKER_0:  Like.

01:30:08,258 --> 01:30:11,614
SPEAKER_0:  The skill system and the interface is the party host.

01:30:12,930 --> 01:30:14,046
SPEAKER_0:  If you think about a game...

01:30:14,274 --> 01:30:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  Most games particularly.

01:30:15,746 --> 01:30:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  What?

01:30:16,450 --> 01:30:17,182
SPEAKER_0:  What I like to do.

01:30:18,242 --> 01:30:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  is that's your person who says, welcome, do this, go here, check this out.

01:30:22,594 --> 01:30:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  And the skill system.

01:30:24,738 --> 01:30:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  and the way it reacts on the HUD.

01:30:26,914 --> 01:30:28,542
SPEAKER_0:  the interface of the game is sort of.

01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:30,910
SPEAKER_0:  leading you to the next thing.

01:30:31,618 --> 01:30:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  And once you get that flow down.

01:30:34,786 --> 01:30:35,646
SPEAKER_0:  And the...

01:30:36,706 --> 01:30:42,686
SPEAKER_0:  the rate at which the game is giving you activities, then you're in like what we describe as a game flow.

01:30:43,074 --> 01:30:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  What is, and it's not till really that last year.

01:30:46,562 --> 01:30:50,078
SPEAKER_0:  Before that, the game flow was just, it doesn't even exist.

01:30:51,458 --> 01:30:53,726
SPEAKER_0:  in the way that you see it in the final game.

01:30:54,626 --> 01:30:57,182
SPEAKER_0:  And that's what we were working on a lot that last year.

01:30:58,562 --> 01:31:01,822
SPEAKER_1:  So at which point is like the set of skills a skill tree?

01:31:02,498 --> 01:31:06,238
SPEAKER_1:  the characteristics of the role playing aspect of it. When is that set?

01:31:06,370 --> 01:31:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  The ideas. We usually have it in the beginning, but it's just we know it won't be done.

01:31:11,202 --> 01:31:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  until that last year. We'll have one.

01:31:13,154 --> 01:31:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  but we know it's gonna get honed.

01:31:15,426 --> 01:31:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  because it's not until you really see

01:31:18,594 --> 01:31:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, how impactful is that one? How much are you doing it?

01:31:21,890 --> 01:31:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  how much are you really? even the main combat ones, they always win.

01:31:25,378 --> 01:31:27,038
SPEAKER_0:  You always know the players will drift toward.

01:31:27,682 --> 01:31:30,974
SPEAKER_0:  the combat type skills because every character needs some amount of that.

01:31:31,714 --> 01:31:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, well how?

01:31:32,898 --> 01:31:33,982
SPEAKER_0:  How important is cooking?

01:31:34,306 --> 01:31:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  How important is alchemy? How important is alchemy?

01:31:37,090 --> 01:31:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  Is these other type of activities and then how do you balance them where when you load up the skill menu isn't automatically give me plus ten damage.

01:31:47,970 --> 01:31:49,214
SPEAKER_1:  How do you get the...

01:31:49,474 --> 01:31:50,686
SPEAKER_1:  What about the combat system?

01:31:51,074 --> 01:31:53,662
SPEAKER_1:  That does seem to be an important part of a lot of games.

01:31:53,826 --> 01:31:55,294
SPEAKER_0:  You started in the beginning. Yeah, every time.

01:31:56,834 --> 01:31:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  Excuse me, we're making that first playable.

01:31:59,138 --> 01:32:00,926
SPEAKER_0:  It's an area you can go through.

01:32:01,282 --> 01:32:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  So I'm out of dialogue, so I'm out of company.

01:32:03,938 --> 01:32:04,478
SPEAKER_1:  Howdy-oo.

01:32:04,994 --> 01:32:06,110
SPEAKER_1:  get the combat right.

01:32:06,754 --> 01:32:09,310
SPEAKER_1:  What's the secret to a great combat system?

01:32:11,330 --> 01:32:14,590
SPEAKER_0:  Well, first on a control side, helping the player when they don't realize it.

01:32:15,074 --> 01:32:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  There's a lot of.

01:32:16,066 --> 01:32:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  tricks you can do with magnetism in terms of the controller and where the attacks go. So it has to feel.

01:32:21,762 --> 01:32:25,214
SPEAKER_0:  The minute to minute has to feel really good in your hand, so there's a lot of animation time.

01:32:26,242 --> 01:32:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  right, and changing animation so they're impactful they happen at a rate that the

01:32:31,074 --> 01:32:32,126
SPEAKER_0:  player feels.

01:32:33,410 --> 01:32:34,558
SPEAKER_0:  Like, they're really doing it?

01:32:35,522 --> 01:32:36,958
SPEAKER_0:  and then ultimately...

01:32:37,378 --> 01:32:40,126
SPEAKER_0:  It's the illusion that the enemies are smart.

01:32:41,378 --> 01:32:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  but they really.

01:32:43,746 --> 01:32:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  are there for you to guilt.

01:32:45,570 --> 01:32:47,038
SPEAKER_0:  Right, so they do.

01:32:47,330 --> 01:32:48,350
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of things.

01:32:48,962 --> 01:32:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  to just let themselves get killed.

01:32:51,586 --> 01:32:56,606
SPEAKER_0:  They're not as near as smart, near as smart as we can make them, because it turns out that is not fun.

01:32:58,018 --> 01:33:01,566
SPEAKER_1:  Right. So there's a balance between, but there's a, that is

01:33:02,114 --> 01:33:03,998
SPEAKER_1:  I guess a kind of AI.

01:33:04,770 --> 01:33:05,566
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:33:06,754 --> 01:33:09,086
SPEAKER_1:  It's a very intimate interaction with an AI.

01:33:09,378 --> 01:33:12,094
SPEAKER_1:  because I think there's a lot of stuff going on. It's not just.

01:33:12,866 --> 01:33:16,382
SPEAKER_1:  very kind of shallow like a dialogue or something like that. It's like.

01:33:17,602 --> 01:33:20,670
SPEAKER_1:  There's a time critical nature of it. A lot of stuff is happening here.

01:33:20,930 --> 01:33:23,358
SPEAKER_1:  And if anything feels off.

01:33:23,682 --> 01:33:24,894
SPEAKER_1:  it's going to feel wrong.

01:33:25,218 --> 01:33:27,550
SPEAKER_0:  Yep, all the games do it.

01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  It's not unique to what we do in terms of how they handle combat scenarios.

01:33:32,482 --> 01:33:35,934
SPEAKER_0:  And there's some games that just do it extremely well in terms of.

01:33:37,122 --> 01:33:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  Even in multiplayer where you're playing bots and most people don't

01:33:40,066 --> 01:33:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  Know it?

01:33:40,994 --> 01:33:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  Um, or how.

01:33:43,810 --> 01:33:46,654
SPEAKER_0:  A multiple enemy scenario is really...

01:33:47,266 --> 01:33:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  You know, they don't all shoot you. They trade off. They're going to wait. And I was like, all right, I'll just wait my turn. Cause we don't want to overwhelm them. But he feels like you feel like you're overwhelmed when there's six enemies.

01:33:57,954 --> 01:33:58,974
SPEAKER_0:  you know, a good game will.

01:33:59,330 --> 01:34:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  Nope, they're gonna...

01:34:00,738 --> 01:34:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  They're going to take their time.

01:34:02,562 --> 01:34:03,678
SPEAKER_1:  Is there a science?

01:34:03,906 --> 01:34:06,078
SPEAKER_1:  Is it art? Is it like...

01:34:07,906 --> 01:34:11,431
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, yes, I mean it's all of that.

01:34:11,431 --> 01:34:14,431
SPEAKER_1:  like an iterative process where you try different things, a few places, and IPO rules you know.

01:34:14,431 --> 01:34:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  There's a lot of timing.

01:34:17,890 --> 01:34:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  animation work.

01:34:19,682 --> 01:34:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  HUD work also? How does the reticule change?

01:34:24,002 --> 01:34:26,110
SPEAKER_0:  What are the little sound effects?

01:34:27,426 --> 01:34:29,694
SPEAKER_1:  What about like the game if I like that it's fun?

01:34:30,466 --> 01:34:31,902
SPEAKER_0:  Again, that goes back to the winning.

01:34:32,706 --> 01:34:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

01:34:33,442 --> 01:34:34,174
SPEAKER_1:  So winning is fun.

01:34:34,818 --> 01:34:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  Yes. Death is not. Let the Wookie win.

01:34:38,114 --> 01:34:38,974
SPEAKER_1:  Yes.

01:34:39,426 --> 01:34:42,782
SPEAKER_1:  I like how you have to dumb down the AI to make it fun for humans.

01:34:43,842 --> 01:34:49,790
SPEAKER_1:  Um, because if, if you didn't, it would just be just slaughter nonstop for, for all humans.

01:34:50,370 --> 01:34:52,478
SPEAKER_1:  That's good to know. What about?

01:34:52,962 --> 01:34:54,718
SPEAKER_1:  Things like...

01:34:55,778 --> 01:34:57,406
SPEAKER_1:  He said cooking like.

01:34:57,698 --> 01:34:58,430
SPEAKER_1:  crafting.

01:34:58,690 --> 01:35:01,278
SPEAKER_1:  making potions and poisons and-

01:35:01,986 --> 01:35:03,006
SPEAKER_1:  are smithing.

01:35:03,266 --> 01:35:04,318
SPEAKER_1:  Weapons and armor.

01:35:04,802 --> 01:35:05,854
SPEAKER_1:  cooking.

01:35:06,306 --> 01:35:10,206
SPEAKER_1:  How do you get that right? What's interesting there? Such an interesting like-

01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:12,030
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

01:35:12,450 --> 01:35:14,398
SPEAKER_1:  You know, a lot of games don't have that kind of thing.

01:35:15,010 --> 01:35:16,135
SPEAKER_1:  So what role does that play?

01:35:16,135 --> 01:35:18,814
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I think we really cracked it.

01:35:19,458 --> 01:35:27,646
SPEAKER_0:  in a way I liked with Fallout 4 actually, where when we're doing Elder Scrolls, we have like the flowers and things and you have alchemy and we

01:35:28,322 --> 01:35:29,502
SPEAKER_0:  took this to.

01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:32,702
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, if it's post-apocalyptic, what if everything in the world?

01:35:33,890 --> 01:35:34,430
SPEAKER_0:  wasn't.

01:35:35,042 --> 01:35:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  out chemical ingredients sometimes breaking it down to their components so when you.

01:35:39,554 --> 01:35:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  walk around the world. Again, we like the simulation. We like the forks and spoons and the cups and all that.

01:35:43,906 --> 01:35:44,254
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

01:35:44,930 --> 01:35:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  How can I use those to create? So I love how it starts working in Fallout 4.

01:35:49,634 --> 01:35:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  where

01:35:50,722 --> 01:35:51,166
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

01:35:51,682 --> 01:35:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  All these things I find.

01:35:53,378 --> 01:35:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  they have some value.

01:35:56,034 --> 01:35:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  in creating or crafting outside of.

01:35:59,266 --> 01:36:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  A cup is worth.

01:36:00,706 --> 01:36:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  one gold piece or one cap.

01:36:04,386 --> 01:36:10,206
SPEAKER_1:  By the way, I have to be honest, I haven't played Fallout 4, played Fallout 3, thought that was a legendary game. I've been, uh...

01:36:11,394 --> 01:36:16,675
SPEAKER_1:  Can you make a case for fallout 4 that I should or should I just wait till fallout 5 and when does that come?

01:36:16,675 --> 01:36:19,742
SPEAKER_0:  You should play Fallout 4. Love to hear your thoughts. It's a different game.

01:36:20,194 --> 01:36:21,822
SPEAKER_1:  Skyrim is too. It's a.

01:36:21,922 --> 01:36:29,182
SPEAKER_0:  We try to make them all different. They all have their own tone. Yeah, so Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 are intentionally very different.

01:36:29,346 --> 01:36:30,718
SPEAKER_1:  Oh really? Interesting.

01:36:31,682 --> 01:36:34,654
SPEAKER_1:  So what's that world like? What's..

01:36:35,138 --> 01:36:38,398
SPEAKER_1:  the post-apocalyptic world of Fallout. Wait, you can just-

01:36:38,690 --> 01:36:41,214
SPEAKER_1:  briefly take a stroll into that world tone wise.

01:36:41,570 --> 01:36:45,054
SPEAKER_0:  Well, there's, look, in entertainment, there's a lot of post-apocalyptic stuff.

01:36:45,634 --> 01:36:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  And what makes Fallout tick is...

01:36:49,218 --> 01:36:59,294
SPEAKER_0:  the world that was left behind, the world that blew itself up, this utopian world of nuclear energy and it all goes wrong. So I love the American dream.

01:36:59,970 --> 01:37:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  of that, like how they visioned the future in the 50s and that.

01:37:04,162 --> 01:37:04,958
SPEAKER_0:  Blowing itself up.

01:37:05,634 --> 01:37:07,422
SPEAKER_0:  I think that's like a super interesting.

01:37:07,874 --> 01:37:09,854
SPEAKER_0:  to explore which is why we always wanted to

01:37:10,530 --> 01:37:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  play in that world.

01:37:11,778 --> 01:37:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:37:13,058 --> 01:37:15,678
SPEAKER_0:  And it does an amazing job of sort of weaving.

01:37:17,122 --> 01:37:21,630
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the drama and darkness of a post-apocalyptic world with...

01:37:22,530 --> 01:37:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  B-movie humor.

01:37:24,642 --> 01:37:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:37:25,762 --> 01:37:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it winks at the camera.

01:37:27,938 --> 01:37:28,894
SPEAKER_0:  Sometimes.

01:37:29,666 --> 01:37:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  often actually.

01:37:30,946 --> 01:37:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  And...

01:37:33,954 --> 01:37:37,374
SPEAKER_0:  that when you're in that world, it just has this.

01:37:37,730 --> 01:37:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  this its own unique flow.

01:37:40,098 --> 01:37:42,686
SPEAKER_0:  and vibe outside of anything else.

01:37:42,978 --> 01:37:44,190
SPEAKER_0:  kind of in that genre.

01:37:45,026 --> 01:37:48,574
SPEAKER_1:  So Elder Scrolls has, or at least Skyrim has some humor.

01:37:49,314 --> 01:37:49,886
SPEAKER_1:  Just a little bit.

01:37:50,210 --> 01:37:52,254
SPEAKER_1:  but Fallout leans into it a little more.

01:37:52,514 --> 01:37:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  A little bit more, a little bit more, yeah?

01:37:54,754 --> 01:38:00,990
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it does. It's like ironic humor. It's the duck in a cover. It's a get under your desk if the bomb comes and everything will be fine.

01:38:01,506 --> 01:38:02,494
SPEAKER_0:  It's that type of humor.

01:38:02,882 --> 01:38:05,758
SPEAKER_1:  So the funny thing is I do think Fallout 3 is one of the...

01:38:06,562 --> 01:38:07,678
SPEAKER_1:  greatest games ever.

01:38:08,258 --> 01:38:12,830
SPEAKER_1:  You've said that quote when we started Fallout 3 in 2004.

01:38:13,346 --> 01:38:17,534
SPEAKER_1:  We obviously had big ideas of what we could do with it, and I talked to a lot of people.

01:38:17,986 --> 01:38:20,734
SPEAKER_1:  from ex-developers to press folks to fans.

01:38:21,122 --> 01:38:22,110
SPEAKER_1:  What made it special?

01:38:22,370 --> 01:38:25,694
SPEAKER_1:  What are the key things you'd want out in a new one?

01:38:26,210 --> 01:38:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  The opinions.

01:38:27,490 --> 01:38:29,854
SPEAKER_1:  and I'll put this mildly varied a lot.

01:38:30,178 --> 01:38:30,494
SPEAKER_1:  But...

01:38:31,042 --> 01:38:32,798
SPEAKER_1:  they would all end the same.

01:38:33,058 --> 01:38:35,326
SPEAKER_1:  like a stern father pausing for effect.

01:38:35,938 --> 01:38:36,958
SPEAKER_1:  But do not.

01:38:37,314 --> 01:38:38,142
SPEAKER_1:  Screw it up.

01:38:38,882 --> 01:38:39,966
SPEAKER_1:  How do you not screw up?

01:38:40,642 --> 01:38:41,086
SPEAKER_1:  A game.

01:38:41,314 --> 01:38:42,974
SPEAKER_1:  You have not screwed up many games.

01:38:43,650 --> 01:38:43,966
SPEAKER_1:  Yep.

01:38:45,186 --> 01:38:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, back to the Fallout one.

01:38:49,858 --> 01:38:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, that was look that I remember that we were met with a lot of skepticism.

01:38:54,626 --> 01:39:01,886
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of, oh, what are they gonna do with this? It was a beloved kind of isometric, turn-based role-playing game, awesome for when it came out.

01:39:02,658 --> 01:39:04,958
SPEAKER_0:  And actually it was announced.

01:39:05,314 --> 01:39:07,678
SPEAKER_0:  We had finished Morrowind, but not announced Oblivion.

01:39:08,674 --> 01:39:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  But because we'd acquired the rights...

01:39:10,786 --> 01:39:11,742
SPEAKER_0:  We had to announce it.

01:39:12,450 --> 01:39:14,494
SPEAKER_0:  I think Interplay was a public company. I don't remember.

01:39:15,266 --> 01:39:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  I just remember we had to announce it and we're thinking there, well, you're gonna, we're gonna piss off all the Elder Scrolls fans because we're announcing a Fallout game or-

01:39:23,362 --> 01:39:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  probably gonna piss off the hardcore fallout fans cuz

01:39:26,754 --> 01:39:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  We didn't make the original and clearly we'll probably make a different kind of game.

01:39:30,530 --> 01:39:36,670
SPEAKER_0:  So I do remember, you know, there was a lot of concern with all of our fans.

01:39:37,218 --> 01:39:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  and fans of Fallout at the time.

01:39:39,522 --> 01:39:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  And so...

01:39:42,242 --> 01:39:44,606
SPEAKER_0:  I think it was pretty rewarding for us.

01:39:45,026 --> 01:39:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  that that game...

01:39:46,370 --> 01:39:48,222
SPEAKER_0:  found the audience and success that it.

01:39:48,578 --> 01:39:49,214
SPEAKER_0:  that it did?

01:39:49,890 --> 01:39:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  Um, is one of my favorite projects that I've ever.

01:39:53,314 --> 01:39:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  ever worked on?

01:39:55,202 --> 01:39:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  And because it was so fresh for us, and we had a very clear like...

01:39:59,746 --> 01:40:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  even before we had the rights, like this is the game we're gonna make, like this is the kind of thing we're gonna do.

01:40:05,506 --> 01:40:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  and-

01:40:06,594 --> 01:40:06,974
SPEAKER_0:  We had.

01:40:07,202 --> 01:40:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  done more when than we were working on Oblivion.

01:40:10,530 --> 01:40:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  and it was kind of a breath of fresh air to do it.

01:40:13,410 --> 01:40:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  And what's kind of remarkable is Fallout 3 comes out.

01:40:17,090 --> 01:40:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  you know, two and a half years after oblivion.

01:40:19,778 --> 01:40:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  And we did all this DLC for Oblivion. So we were really, really.

01:40:23,554 --> 01:40:25,182
SPEAKER_0:  kind of prolific in how.

01:40:25,826 --> 01:40:28,030
SPEAKER_0:  our development and how it was going.

01:40:29,026 --> 01:40:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:40:31,266 --> 01:40:33,758
SPEAKER_0:  I just remember enjoying making that game.

01:40:34,210 --> 01:40:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  so much because it was everything we were doing was new.

01:40:37,922 --> 01:40:43,547
SPEAKER_1:  Which, which asked if the world creation, uh, was there some innovation like technically that was happening?

01:40:43,547 --> 01:40:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  World creation, like it was.

01:40:45,218 --> 01:40:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  you know, obviously a different look, even though some of us, very few of us, had worked on the Terminator things.

01:40:50,818 --> 01:40:57,758
SPEAKER_0:  the VAT system, the skill system, and we love the original game so much, so you felt this responsibility.

01:40:58,530 --> 01:41:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  to bring it back in a big way and reintroduce it.

01:41:02,370 --> 01:41:03,262
SPEAKER_0:  in a way that

01:41:03,522 --> 01:41:04,894
SPEAKER_0:  You know, as much as we could.

01:41:05,762 --> 01:41:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  Scratch the same itch.

01:41:07,810 --> 01:41:11,198
SPEAKER_0:  when you played the original game that had the same tone.

01:41:11,906 --> 01:41:13,918
SPEAKER_1:  Are there some favorite things to you about that world?

01:41:14,882 --> 01:41:16,007
SPEAKER_1:  that just kind of connect.

01:41:16,007 --> 01:41:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  Ball out three, I love, again, I usually start with the beginning. I love the beginning.

01:41:20,866 --> 01:41:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  I love the character generation. If you go, if you played it a lot, or you're developing it,

01:41:26,210 --> 01:41:27,806
SPEAKER_0:  it starts to feel really long.

01:41:28,578 --> 01:41:30,782
SPEAKER_0:  But the first time you play it or second.

01:41:31,650 --> 01:41:33,662
SPEAKER_0:  I just think it's awesome.

01:41:34,402 --> 01:41:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:41:35,586 --> 01:41:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  this idea.

01:41:37,186 --> 01:41:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  It's a hard thing to say, okay.

01:41:38,978 --> 01:41:40,478
SPEAKER_0:  We want you to feel...

01:41:40,834 --> 01:41:42,526
SPEAKER_0:  like your character on the screen.

01:41:43,106 --> 01:41:46,174
SPEAKER_0:  Even when you play like a Skyrim, you don't know what you were doing before that.

01:41:46,882 --> 01:41:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  But Fallout 3.

01:41:48,578 --> 01:41:49,022
SPEAKER_0:  You.

01:41:49,730 --> 01:41:54,878
SPEAKER_0:  You were born in the vault and you raised in the vault and you lived in the vault, but you experienced a part of that.

01:41:55,362 --> 01:41:57,790
SPEAKER_0:  So it's a very different, when you step out.

01:41:58,178 --> 01:41:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  I think it really...

01:42:01,410 --> 01:42:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, the visuals are the visuals, but the emotional moment of stepping out of the vault, you feel like you lived your life.

01:42:08,578 --> 01:42:11,006
SPEAKER_1:  that in you feel like you have a sense of.

01:42:11,938 --> 01:42:12,606
SPEAKER_1:  You're passed.

01:42:14,242 --> 01:42:15,646
SPEAKER_0:  and I need to find my father.

01:42:17,122 --> 01:42:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  We should.

01:42:18,370 --> 01:42:21,662
SPEAKER_1:  Isn't it possible to have that sense with like Elder Scrolls?

01:42:22,178 --> 01:42:23,390
SPEAKER_1:  like a life story.

01:42:23,650 --> 01:42:26,014
SPEAKER_1:  Like childhood trauma and stuff.

01:42:26,594 --> 01:42:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  Back to the image. You'd have to like.

01:42:28,418 --> 01:42:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  I'll let you do some of that stuff but they go through menus you pick your background we're doing that in starfield hey pick your background what you doing before this moment

01:42:35,394 --> 01:42:42,078
SPEAKER_1:  Can you pick your traumas and stuff? That's a mod. If you want to make a mod, you want to make a mod. Yeah, thank you.

01:42:42,626 --> 01:42:44,501
SPEAKER_1:  and then also make a mod for like a therapist.

01:42:44,501 --> 01:42:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  But a lot of it is in your head, so you're gonna pick this background, you're gonna do these things, and you're sort of like, this is who I was. And we intentionally with Elder Scrolls kind of make it a-

01:42:52,866 --> 01:42:54,174
SPEAKER_0:  as much of a blank slate.

01:42:54,466 --> 01:42:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  You know, Elder Scrolls is a little bit more of a blank slate game to who you are.

01:42:58,210 --> 01:43:02,046
SPEAKER_0:  which has a lot of positives and Fallout for us has been more of a...

01:43:02,434 --> 01:43:05,758
SPEAKER_0:  This was your life before, here's who you were.

01:43:06,146 --> 01:43:09,310
SPEAKER_0:  Go be who you want to be, but this is the background. It's a little more.

01:43:09,794 --> 01:43:10,206
SPEAKER_1:  strict.

01:43:11,490 --> 01:43:13,790
SPEAKER_1:  Now this might reveal something about me.

01:43:14,658 --> 01:43:15,902
SPEAKER_1:  and uh...

01:43:16,994 --> 01:43:18,206
SPEAKER_1:  Speaking of childhood trauma.

01:43:18,530 --> 01:43:20,478
SPEAKER_1:  But I...

01:43:20,930 --> 01:43:22,174
SPEAKER_1:  I feel like there's...

01:43:22,818 --> 01:43:23,550
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of...

01:43:24,770 --> 01:43:30,014
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of the meaningful experience of a role-playing game is not just the development of the character throughout the game.

01:43:30,242 --> 01:43:32,478
SPEAKER_1:  but the initial character creation, like you said.

01:43:33,090 --> 01:43:35,006
SPEAKER_1:  Is there something to that process?

01:43:35,874 --> 01:43:38,590
SPEAKER_1:  that you found to be powerful.

01:43:39,426 --> 01:43:43,134
SPEAKER_1:  like the design of that process, because you think so much about that beginning.

01:43:44,450 --> 01:43:46,110
SPEAKER_1:  How much should be controlled?

01:43:46,818 --> 01:43:48,350
SPEAKER_1:  How much should be defined?

01:43:49,058 --> 01:43:50,238
SPEAKER_1:  the interface itself.

01:43:50,850 --> 01:43:52,638
SPEAKER_1:  The visual appearance of the character too.

01:43:53,026 --> 01:43:55,710
SPEAKER_1:  because I feel like that you're loading in.

01:43:56,002 --> 01:44:00,190
SPEAKER_1:  you start to load in the world that you're about to enter by creating that character.

01:44:02,178 --> 01:44:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, we think about it a lot.

01:44:03,714 --> 01:44:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  That's that really, really good.

01:44:05,154 --> 01:44:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

01:44:05,922 --> 01:44:07,070
SPEAKER_0:  Comment and question.

01:44:07,970 --> 01:44:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  and it's more than

01:44:11,010 --> 01:44:15,646
SPEAKER_0:  It has to set the whole stage, it has to peak your interest for the world you're going to enter.

01:44:16,770 --> 01:44:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  And...

01:44:19,554 --> 01:44:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  We've done it so many different ways.

01:44:22,370 --> 01:44:25,950
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of when you actually go to make your...

01:44:26,274 --> 01:44:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  character when you're making the choice.

01:44:30,146 --> 01:44:30,974
SPEAKER_0:  And.

01:44:31,362 --> 01:44:35,710
SPEAKER_0:  One of the things over time that we've wanted to avoid.

01:44:36,354 --> 01:44:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  is people starting over.

01:44:40,034 --> 01:44:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  So there's a lot of intentionality around.

01:44:43,266 --> 01:44:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  the types of choices you have.

01:44:45,378 --> 01:44:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  that can be undone or not undone.

01:44:48,226 --> 01:44:48,766
SPEAKER_0:  It's about you.

01:44:49,218 --> 01:44:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  What game players want to is I'll play it and then I'll make a new character.

01:44:53,218 --> 01:44:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  But sometimes they do that because they realize they made the wrong type of character.

01:44:58,242 --> 01:45:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  And as a designer, you don't want that to happen.

01:45:03,426 --> 01:45:04,094
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:45:05,410 --> 01:45:12,190
SPEAKER_0:  Some people, when you get this comment out, it just goes like, oh, you simplified it. No, no, no, no. We moved those choices into the gameplay.

01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:14,366
SPEAKER_0:  so that you don't.

01:45:15,266 --> 01:45:17,246
SPEAKER_0:  you know, make this character in the beginning.

01:45:17,922 --> 01:45:21,630
SPEAKER_0:  and then eight hours later realize you make a horrible mistake.

01:45:22,338 --> 01:45:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  And so, okay, I'm gonna start out like that. To me, it's a really, really bad experience.

01:45:26,850 --> 01:45:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:45:27,842 --> 01:45:30,279
SPEAKER_1:  Also like life itself, but yes, go ahead.

01:45:30,279 --> 01:45:30,782
SPEAKER_0:

01:45:31,330 --> 01:45:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  But like life is okay, so you can then.

01:45:34,114 --> 01:45:40,318
SPEAKER_0:  fix it in game. Right. I wish I had learned archery. Well, I'm going to start tomorrow.

01:45:40,866 --> 01:45:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  So you can do that like the Skyrim character system.

01:45:44,034 --> 01:45:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:45:44,802 --> 01:45:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  It was really designed around that all you pick is like what's your race and that gives you some things

01:45:49,826 --> 01:45:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  But there's nothing you can't get then on your own. Mostly.

01:45:54,306 --> 01:45:56,382
SPEAKER_0:  That sounds weird, but you mostly want that.

01:45:57,378 --> 01:45:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  beginning character generation to be visual.

01:46:00,578 --> 01:46:02,878
SPEAKER_0:  which you then can also change in the game.

01:46:03,490 --> 01:46:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  and some starting skills.

01:46:06,018 --> 01:46:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  that

01:46:07,106 --> 01:46:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  Get you off to the-

01:46:08,386 --> 01:46:08,926
SPEAKER_0:  hype of.

01:46:09,506 --> 01:46:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  that you want, but if you discover you don't like that type of play...

01:46:13,410 --> 01:46:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  as you play, you can move your character along. So we have.

01:46:19,106 --> 01:46:20,062
SPEAKER_0:  Moved away.

01:46:20,418 --> 01:46:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  post oblivion to a classless.

01:46:24,610 --> 01:46:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  Meaning you don't have a strict character class, warrior mage thief, whatever.

01:46:29,122 --> 01:46:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  in our games.

01:46:30,818 --> 01:46:34,558
SPEAKER_1:  And that's continuing for the... Are you like...

01:46:35,042 --> 01:46:40,734
SPEAKER_1:  thinking of Elder Scrolls 6, you're already thinking about that kind of stuff. You think of early on the...

01:46:41,026 --> 01:46:41,790
SPEAKER_1:  The end.

01:46:42,018 --> 01:46:45,342
SPEAKER_1:  Like you said, the first few experiences in the game, you already think it through now.

01:46:46,114 --> 01:46:46,430
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:46:46,690 --> 01:46:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  We know what the first few hours are like. We-

01:46:50,242 --> 01:46:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  We know what the-

01:46:51,138 --> 01:46:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  character system.

01:46:52,866 --> 01:46:54,174
SPEAKER_0:  is basically like and.

01:46:54,530 --> 01:46:58,686
SPEAKER_1:  So tonally, what's the difference to you between oblivion?

01:46:59,362 --> 01:47:00,126
SPEAKER_1:  Skyrim

01:47:00,354 --> 01:47:03,774
SPEAKER_1:  Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, and Elder Scrolls 6.

01:47:04,738 --> 01:47:06,302
SPEAKER_1:  Like, could to me...

01:47:07,106 --> 01:47:10,686
SPEAKER_1:  Man, stuff blends together. Yeah. Oblivion.

01:47:11,458 --> 01:47:12,286
SPEAKER_1:  That's when you can make

01:47:12,770 --> 01:47:13,854
SPEAKER_1:  spells and stuff.

01:47:14,626 --> 01:47:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  You could do it in Morrowind as well. Oblivion has some more guardrails on it.

01:47:19,362 --> 01:47:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  more ones where you can really go, and Daggerfall.

01:47:22,082 --> 01:47:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  and a-er-getr-

01:47:24,066 --> 01:47:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  I don't remember if you can make spells in arena. I think you can.

01:47:27,138 --> 01:47:30,462
SPEAKER_0:  Someone will correct me. You definitely can, it's crazy Morrowind.

01:47:31,234 --> 01:47:35,550
SPEAKER_0:  Um, you can somewhat, and then we start, we start putting guardrails on it. Cause people started.

01:47:36,418 --> 01:47:37,543
SPEAKER_0:  Breaking the game in certain ways.

01:47:37,543 --> 01:47:40,446
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, why is it bad to break the game like you always want?

01:47:41,090 --> 01:47:46,654
SPEAKER_0:  Well, there's like one people love in Morrowind where you can make these recall stones.

01:47:47,682 --> 01:47:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  And...

01:47:48,706 --> 01:47:49,150
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:47:49,538 --> 01:47:50,494
SPEAKER_0:  you could teleport.

01:47:51,106 --> 01:47:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  to different areas, which you really need in that game. It breaks so many quests.

01:47:55,042 --> 01:48:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  And so as we, any quests, we would do this exercise of designing a quest.

01:48:01,730 --> 01:48:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  And then someone would say, and then I recall away. Okay, the quest is broken.

01:48:06,402 --> 01:48:09,598
SPEAKER_0:  And then one day someone says, can we just get rid of that spell effect?

01:48:09,922 --> 01:48:11,006
SPEAKER_0:  Everyone's like, yes, please.

01:48:11,618 --> 01:48:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  That's what allowed us to make better content.

01:48:13,634 --> 01:48:14,846
SPEAKER_1:  So, uh...

01:48:15,298 --> 01:48:19,422
SPEAKER_1:  The tangent upon a tangent upon a tangent. How do you create a compelling quest?

01:48:19,874 --> 01:48:23,550
SPEAKER_1:  because there's all kinds of personalities of humans that play these games, right?

01:48:23,810 --> 01:48:24,830
SPEAKER_1:  Cause I like the grind.

01:48:26,114 --> 01:48:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  Well, there's...

01:48:27,330 --> 01:48:30,334
SPEAKER_0:  Look, there's multiple flavors of a compelling quest.

01:48:30,754 --> 01:48:31,358
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:48:32,834 --> 01:48:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  You know, some of them have very good upfront.

01:48:35,298 --> 01:48:40,190
SPEAKER_0:  Storytelling you just like the story and the NPC that's giving you this task

01:48:40,802 --> 01:48:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

01:48:42,082 --> 01:48:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  you'll go through a more handcrafted experience that...

01:48:46,338 --> 01:48:49,278
SPEAKER_0:  The designers have done a really, really good job on the space.

01:48:49,666 --> 01:48:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  It has some some twist or surprise in the middle and then.

01:48:53,922 --> 01:48:55,710
SPEAKER_0:  The ending has some...

01:48:56,738 --> 01:49:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  You know, multiple options that the player feels like they had, they got to do something, they made an interesting choice.

01:49:02,562 --> 01:49:05,214
SPEAKER_0:  But the best ones for me are actually were...

01:49:06,594 --> 01:49:08,702
SPEAKER_0:  All of that was far more open-ended.

01:49:09,346 --> 01:49:10,206
SPEAKER_0:  the how.

01:49:10,530 --> 01:49:12,414
SPEAKER_0:  I am going to accomplish this task.

01:49:14,562 --> 01:49:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  is.

01:49:16,802 --> 01:49:20,958
SPEAKER_0:  completely up to me and I'm gonna find some ingenious solution.

01:49:21,922 --> 01:49:27,038
SPEAKER_0:  A silly... this sounds very basic. It's going to sound quite cliche and silly.

01:49:27,554 --> 01:49:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  Go find me.

01:49:28,930 --> 01:49:32,798
SPEAKER_0:  five Daedric hearts or whatever, like find me X of something that's hard to get.

01:49:34,466 --> 01:49:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  It's a very simple set. You can give a simple story set up for that.

01:49:38,722 --> 01:49:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  And we're not telling the player where to get those.

01:49:41,314 --> 01:49:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  Where could I get?

01:49:44,034 --> 01:49:46,014
SPEAKER_0:  and I actually find those.

01:49:46,690 --> 01:49:51,358
SPEAKER_0:  to be just as rewarding as the really handcrafted well done.

01:49:51,746 --> 01:49:54,718
SPEAKER_0:  little bit more linear with an interesting choice at the end.

01:49:54,946 --> 01:49:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  If those objects...

01:49:56,866 --> 01:49:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  are in the world in some.

01:49:58,882 --> 01:50:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  you know, believable way.

01:50:00,610 --> 01:50:03,038
SPEAKER_0:  that there's usually some challenge of getting.

01:50:03,330 --> 01:50:03,678
SPEAKER_0:  Getting.

01:50:05,026 --> 01:50:09,859
SPEAKER_1:  How do you place objects in a world in an interesting way? Because a big part of our-

01:50:09,859 --> 01:50:11,518
SPEAKER_0:  We have a level design.

01:50:11,778 --> 01:50:14,494
SPEAKER_0:  You cannot, people, if they only knew.

01:50:14,754 --> 01:50:18,654
SPEAKER_0:  how much we spend on, we have a clutter group, a group of people who clutter.

01:50:19,842 --> 01:50:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  Like we like clutters all the stuff around. That's like interior decorators for treasure and stuff and trash and.

01:50:28,002 --> 01:50:30,590
SPEAKER_0:  They go through every space and they...

01:50:30,946 --> 01:50:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  clutter it.

01:50:32,098 --> 01:50:34,110
SPEAKER_0:  Our level designers think about it a lot.

01:50:34,498 --> 01:50:35,838
SPEAKER_0:  These also become.

01:50:36,066 --> 01:50:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  landmarks for the player when you're walking through a space and oh this is the place with this and there is a

01:50:41,730 --> 01:50:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  logic to...

01:50:43,298 --> 01:50:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  making a good level.

01:50:45,762 --> 01:50:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  Um, as they say with, even if you walk by like a little T intersection, that becomes like a decision point in the player's head, like, Oh, I didn't go down that way.

01:50:54,338 --> 01:50:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  but the more you do that looks easy on paper when you're playing a game

01:50:58,562 --> 01:51:00,702
SPEAKER_0:  You actually kind of want to limit those.

01:51:01,474 --> 01:51:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  because he's trying to keep track of all his decision points.

01:51:05,314 --> 01:51:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  then they get lost.

01:51:07,042 --> 01:51:11,678
SPEAKER_0:  And yes, we have maps, but anytime the player is going to check a map in a place like that, I feel that.

01:51:11,970 --> 01:51:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  It's more of like a backstop.

01:51:13,954 --> 01:51:18,750
SPEAKER_0:  for certain players, if they need to check the map, I feel like we've kind of failed.

01:51:20,482 --> 01:51:24,702
SPEAKER_1:  Got it. So there's a momentum to it. Just pulls.

01:51:24,962 --> 01:51:26,087
SPEAKER_1:  pulls them in..

01:51:26,087 --> 01:51:33,022
SPEAKER_0:  You played a lot of games, you played a lot of levels where you're just like, I'm a little confused or I don't know enough. And you play other levels where like, man, I just, yeah, I-

01:51:33,602 --> 01:51:37,630
SPEAKER_0:  It was great, I went through it, it was well balanced, I knew where I was going.

01:51:37,954 --> 01:51:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  And it's not, you don't want to ever be mazy, as long as you know where you're going, as long as you know you made those choices.

01:51:44,034 --> 01:51:44,574
SPEAKER_0:  Then...

01:51:45,282 --> 01:51:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  It feels fine.

01:51:46,498 --> 01:51:49,214
SPEAKER_0:  But as far as the treasure and all of the loot...

01:51:50,178 --> 01:51:53,470
SPEAKER_0:  It is really an art. We will.

01:51:53,986 --> 01:51:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  not do enough clutter, and then we will over clutter.

01:51:57,154 --> 01:52:04,158
SPEAKER_0:  and then there's too much stuff everywhere and then we declutter every single game. I wish we got better at it. It would save us a lot of time.

01:52:04,514 --> 01:52:07,889
SPEAKER_1:  But you're constantly going by feel like this is not as too much.

01:52:07,889 --> 01:52:09,886
SPEAKER_0:  Right, right, because the other thing is...

01:52:10,594 --> 01:52:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  Look, it creates...

01:52:12,866 --> 01:52:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  People wanna pick everything up. They wanna click everything.

01:52:16,322 --> 01:52:20,094
SPEAKER_0:  So if you have too many things of importance in a room, it's like...

01:52:20,706 --> 01:52:23,934
SPEAKER_0:  it actually makes you feel a little tight as a player. You're like, well, I need-

01:52:24,418 --> 01:52:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  I'm basically an idiot.

01:52:25,890 --> 01:52:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  If I don't pick all the stuff up here.

01:52:28,450 --> 01:52:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  You probably felt this way. Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. I'm like.

01:52:30,978 --> 01:52:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  The moment where you decide, you're just like, I've clicked so many things in this room, I actually am going to leave.

01:52:36,610 --> 01:52:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  That ammo canister there. But you feel like a dope.

01:52:40,706 --> 01:52:42,581
SPEAKER_0:  You've probably experienced this. Yes.

01:52:42,581 --> 01:52:47,806
SPEAKER_1:  But also you have a joy from if there's not many items and you found the one and you got it.

01:52:48,162 --> 01:52:49,287
SPEAKER_1:  Right. And in

01:52:49,287 --> 01:52:52,350
SPEAKER_0:  And then it's finding like, oh, I stuck my head in this corner and...

01:52:52,578 --> 01:52:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I picked this lock and I opened this locker and...

01:52:55,362 --> 01:52:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  there was this thing I've been waiting for.

01:52:57,378 --> 01:52:57,758
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:52:58,594 --> 01:53:00,469
SPEAKER_1:  What about like rare and rare?

01:53:00,469 --> 01:53:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  items.

01:53:01,442 --> 01:53:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  That's an art.

01:53:02,370 --> 01:53:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  even more so of an art.

01:53:04,802 --> 01:53:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:53:06,018 --> 01:53:07,390
SPEAKER_0:  But I will say we have a ways to go there.

01:53:07,842 --> 01:53:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of finding the right...

01:53:10,434 --> 01:53:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  drop rate for.

01:53:12,578 --> 01:53:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  special items we call them, your epic, rare, legendary.

01:53:16,162 --> 01:53:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  You look at games, like so many games do it.

01:53:19,010 --> 01:53:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:53:20,066 --> 01:53:24,478
SPEAKER_0:  There are ones that you just play and love because they have it down.

01:53:24,898 --> 01:53:25,822
SPEAKER_0:  Destiny.

01:53:26,114 --> 01:53:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  Destiny 2 is great at it, Diablo.

01:53:29,218 --> 01:53:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  A series I love.

01:53:30,882 --> 01:53:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  you know, sort of famously Diablo 3, which I think is great.

01:53:34,594 --> 01:53:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  And they did an update, it mostly just changed the loot drops. It's like this whole new experience.

01:53:39,586 --> 01:53:41,598
SPEAKER_0:  and there's a really real art to it.

01:53:41,922 --> 01:53:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  Um, I think that-

01:53:43,298 --> 01:53:46,910
SPEAKER_0:  that we're still learning. We're still learning a lot and have to, we're trying to.

01:53:47,202 --> 01:53:50,142
SPEAKER_0:  you know, get better at it, because it's one of those things where it drives you.

01:53:50,722 --> 01:53:52,414
SPEAKER_0:  through the game, it's fun to get.

01:53:52,674 --> 01:53:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  the treasure in.

01:53:54,018 --> 01:53:57,182
SPEAKER_1:  Diablo and Skyrim have this interesting quality of...

01:53:57,986 --> 01:53:58,398
SPEAKER_1:  being it.

01:53:58,690 --> 01:53:59,934
SPEAKER_1:  extremely popular.

01:54:01,058 --> 01:54:04,958
SPEAKER_1:  and there's a lore around like rare items. So it's a-

01:54:05,186 --> 01:54:09,982
SPEAKER_1:  it changes the dynamic of like, you could afford to have really rare items.

01:54:10,402 --> 01:54:10,814
SPEAKER_1:  Yes.

01:54:11,042 --> 01:54:11,486
SPEAKER_1:  and then.

01:54:11,810 --> 01:54:15,934
SPEAKER_1:  And then somebody finds it and that becomes like a thing.

01:54:16,290 --> 01:54:26,654
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, as you release a game, there's a lot of people play and they start sharing stories and so on. It's so interesting, because that's part of the game experience as the stories of others, right?

01:54:26,946 --> 01:54:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  For us, 100%.

01:54:28,642 --> 01:54:31,870
SPEAKER_0:  Because we've been classically, with most of our stuff, single player.

01:54:32,802 --> 01:54:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  that that water cooler shared experience, we would have a thing like, where we call them, did you know moments.

01:54:38,338 --> 01:54:41,438
SPEAKER_0:  Like we gotta have a bunch, so you meet someone, they do.

01:54:41,922 --> 01:54:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  What are you doing? They say.

01:54:43,938 --> 01:54:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  Did you know?

01:54:45,762 --> 01:54:47,390
SPEAKER_0:  If you go here and do this, what?

01:54:47,682 --> 01:54:48,446
SPEAKER_0:  Did you know?

01:54:49,186 --> 01:54:50,814
SPEAKER_0:  And that to us.

01:54:51,170 --> 01:54:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  uh, is aware of a lot of our community.

01:54:54,562 --> 01:54:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  has been sharing their stories.

01:54:57,026 --> 01:54:57,694
SPEAKER_1:  Here's what you can do.

01:54:58,178 --> 01:55:00,862
SPEAKER_1:  Has there ever been a temptation to create?

01:55:01,666 --> 01:55:02,270
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:55:02,690 --> 01:55:04,158
SPEAKER_1:  Not a single player game.

01:55:04,738 --> 01:55:06,613
SPEAKER_1:  That's gigantic. That's what we did.

01:55:06,613 --> 01:55:07,550
SPEAKER_0:  76.

01:55:08,130 --> 01:55:10,846
SPEAKER_0:  We have Elder Scrolls Online, not a game I created.

01:55:11,266 --> 01:55:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  But look, that started as more classic MMO. Know the folks, they're part of a company who made that game.

01:55:17,730 --> 01:55:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  Um

01:55:18,466 --> 01:55:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  And it's.

01:55:19,330 --> 01:55:21,022
SPEAKER_0:  insanely insanely popular.

01:55:21,122 --> 01:55:22,997
SPEAKER_1:  It is. Okay, so I should try it out.

01:55:22,997 --> 01:55:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  do some great storytelling quests, like the actual mechanics aren't the same as Skyrim, what the world is.

01:55:29,186 --> 01:55:31,358
SPEAKER_0:  Awesome. They've just done an incredible job.

01:55:31,874 --> 01:55:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it's about to...

01:55:34,146 --> 01:55:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  be 10 years for that game as well.

01:55:36,642 --> 01:55:39,774
SPEAKER_0:  And this is, you know, great community around that.

01:55:41,186 --> 01:55:47,582
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, that's a I haven't played because there's a there's a mobile Fallout game, right? I need to play that.

01:55:48,258 --> 01:55:50,686
SPEAKER_1:  I was thinking of playing Diablo Mobile 2.

01:55:50,946 --> 01:55:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, you can debate the monetization, but I would not. It's,

01:55:54,146 --> 01:55:56,021
SPEAKER_0:  I think they did a fun, it's really fun.

01:55:56,021 --> 01:55:58,271
SPEAKER_1:  Diablo. Put some focus.

01:55:58,271 --> 01:56:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, well Fallout, I definitely recommend that one. Fallout Shelter, completely different game.

01:56:02,274 --> 01:56:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  Diablo Immortal is a...

01:56:04,738 --> 01:56:06,613
SPEAKER_0:  I was very, very impressed with that. I had a lot of fun.

01:56:06,613 --> 01:56:11,582
SPEAKER_1:  What's the challenge of designing a game for mobile versus the PC and console?

01:56:12,290 --> 01:56:14,398
SPEAKER_0:  Well, obviously the screen size.

01:56:15,074 --> 01:56:16,350
SPEAKER_1:  Is that what you feel first?

01:56:16,802 --> 01:56:18,238
SPEAKER_1:  What's the...

01:56:18,562 --> 01:56:22,558
SPEAKER_1:  What's the fundamental change in the philosophy of design?

01:56:22,850 --> 01:56:24,286
SPEAKER_1:  Does it, does it constrain?

01:56:24,802 --> 01:56:26,334
SPEAKER_1:  Does it change the tone of the game?

01:56:27,618 --> 01:56:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  Well, we've done a few things and we have a new mobile game that we're working on that we haven't announced yet that I'm in love with.

01:56:34,178 --> 01:56:34,750
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:56:35,714 --> 01:56:36,990
SPEAKER_0:  There are a couple things that you have-

01:56:37,250 --> 01:56:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  approach on mobile. Now

01:56:39,234 --> 01:56:42,238
SPEAKER_0:  I can give you sort of the classic mobile gaming thing and then what we do.

01:56:43,394 --> 01:56:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:56:44,514 --> 01:56:46,334
SPEAKER_0:  You know, a classic mobile gaming.

01:56:46,946 --> 01:56:48,734
SPEAKER_0:  is really for

01:56:50,434 --> 01:56:51,006
SPEAKER_0:  Play session.

01:56:52,866 --> 01:56:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  because...

01:56:54,882 --> 01:56:57,246
SPEAKER_0:  for the amount of people you're gonna get the...

01:56:57,474 --> 01:57:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  the number that I have the amount of time to sit there for a long time and play it

01:57:01,794 --> 01:57:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  like a console game or a PC game is lower because people are playing mobile games on the move or whatever.

01:57:07,234 --> 01:57:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:57:08,290 --> 01:57:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  how it onboards you, because obviously most of them are free.

01:57:11,266 --> 01:57:12,574
SPEAKER_0:  So the tutorial.

01:57:12,962 --> 01:57:14,206
SPEAKER_0:  how the tutorial works.

01:57:14,786 --> 01:57:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  how it gets you into the game. Because you haven't bought it, you haven't done this investment of buying it and saying, no, I'm going to learn it.

01:57:20,898 --> 01:57:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  People don't care.

01:57:22,114 --> 01:57:27,742
SPEAKER_0:  So really understanding how they get into the game. Those two things are really the magic to mobile gaming.

01:57:28,194 --> 01:57:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  We have found though with our games, particularly Fallout Shelter.

01:57:31,938 --> 01:57:35,134
SPEAKER_0:  people will sit there for an hour or two. Like they will just sit there and play it.

01:57:35,554 --> 01:57:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  like large numbers of people who play it for hours a day.

01:57:39,586 --> 01:57:41,182
SPEAKER_1:  So there is a more.

01:57:42,146 --> 01:57:44,254
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know, addicting element to the mobile.

01:57:44,482 --> 01:57:45,607
SPEAKER_1:  Cause I guess you can spend.

01:57:45,607 --> 01:57:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  And if you look at...

01:57:47,586 --> 01:57:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  You know, if you look at kids these days...

01:57:49,794 --> 01:57:53,310
SPEAKER_0:  They can stare at their phone for hours. That's all they do. Or they watch everything.

01:57:53,666 --> 01:57:54,046
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:57:54,434 --> 01:57:57,118
SPEAKER_0:  It's also like a demographic thing, the younger audience.

01:57:57,826 --> 01:57:59,742
SPEAKER_0:  they would rather sit and stare at their phone.

01:58:00,322 --> 01:58:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  then.

01:58:01,666 --> 01:58:02,814
SPEAKER_0:  play it on a big screen.

01:58:02,914 --> 01:58:04,222
SPEAKER_1:  I would just love-

01:58:04,866 --> 01:58:07,870
SPEAKER_1:  to sort of list out throughout human history the evolution.

01:58:08,354 --> 01:58:12,478
SPEAKER_1:  of sentences that began with, if you look at kids these days. are

01:58:12,962 --> 01:58:14,526
SPEAKER_1:  It's true. It's true.

01:58:14,978 --> 01:58:18,686
SPEAKER_1:  The kids, the kids of the kids these days will probably be talking well.

01:58:18,946 --> 01:58:20,071
SPEAKER_1:  be doing like

01:58:20,071 --> 01:58:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  Like I love...

01:58:21,890 --> 01:58:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  Mobile games though, I play a ton of them. I am like the game, my favorite game this year is Marvel Snap.

01:58:29,058 --> 01:58:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  card game.

01:58:30,466 --> 01:58:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  from the folks who did Hearthstone.

01:58:32,386 --> 01:58:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  You should really play it.

01:58:33,538 --> 01:58:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  If you like, do you like card games?

01:58:35,170 --> 01:58:36,766
SPEAKER_0:  Oh yeah. Superheroes?

01:58:37,346 --> 01:58:37,886
SPEAKER_1:  N-no.

01:58:38,018 --> 01:58:39,893
SPEAKER_0:  It's genius. You don't like superheroes? Uh, no.

01:58:39,893 --> 01:58:40,894
SPEAKER_1:  I don't like superheroes.

01:58:41,186 --> 01:58:47,134
SPEAKER_1:  I never understood, listen, this is growing updirectly,

01:58:47,618 --> 01:58:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  What, I don't understand the, all right, well, I don't understand you wearing a costume.

01:58:52,546 --> 01:58:55,582
SPEAKER_1:  It's silly to me. I can't so you have to.

01:58:55,906 --> 01:58:56,766
SPEAKER_1:  Suspend.

01:58:57,634 --> 01:58:58,174
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:58:58,978 --> 01:59:07,614
SPEAKER_1:  Like you have to be able to immerse yourself. And for some reason there's something about costumes. It doesn't get me. But then again, I'm like into elves and dragons. I don't understand.

01:59:08,162 --> 01:59:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  And I'm fine. I think I get it.

01:59:10,658 --> 01:59:14,622
SPEAKER_1:  but the rest, at least the American, the Western world disagrees with me.

01:59:15,746 --> 01:59:18,782
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, you and Batman, you have like little ears, but alright, that's fine.

01:59:19,138 --> 01:59:20,510
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I believe in einf hardest but still!

01:59:21,506 --> 01:59:22,622
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:59:23,362 --> 01:59:26,494
SPEAKER_1:  Well, back to Elder Scrolls Starfield.

01:59:26,786 --> 01:59:28,862
SPEAKER_1:  So one thing I didn't ask you about.

01:59:29,922 --> 01:59:34,910
SPEAKER_1:  when you look at the timeline of five, six, seven, eight years, whatever it is to create a game.

01:59:35,458 --> 01:59:36,734
SPEAKER_1:  What's the role of the deadline?

01:59:37,474 --> 01:59:39,838
SPEAKER_1:  internally, not publicly announced.

01:59:40,130 --> 01:59:41,374
SPEAKER_1:  Do you try to keep?

01:59:41,602 --> 01:59:44,574
SPEAKER_1:  In your own brain a deadline for the team a deadline.

01:59:45,442 --> 01:59:45,886
SPEAKER_1:  all the time.

01:59:46,402 --> 01:59:46,814
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:59:47,042 --> 01:59:49,598
SPEAKER_1:  when you set that deadline early in the development.

01:59:50,370 --> 01:59:52,254
SPEAKER_1:  Do you try to set deadline?

01:59:52,866 --> 01:59:55,262
SPEAKER_1:  Like that's really tough to reach.

01:59:55,650 --> 02:00:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  No, we try to make it like, hey, this is our best guess. If you make it tough to reach, it's sort of, you know, you're going to miss it. It's arbitrary.

02:00:02,594 --> 02:00:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  We really try to keep ourselves honest because it will let you know where you're at.

02:00:07,714 --> 02:00:12,990
SPEAKER_0:  We want to have first playable. We want to be done with prototyping or design by this date. We want to have first playable this date. We want to have this.

02:00:14,050 --> 02:00:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  Look, you know, things happen. Pandemic happens, people go home, it's-

02:00:17,602 --> 02:00:19,262
SPEAKER_0:  throws everything off or.

02:00:20,002 --> 02:00:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  you know what you needed to do because we're not just like making a game and then moving everybody on

02:00:24,866 --> 02:00:29,726
SPEAKER_0:  you know, what you needed to do. Like Skyrim was so popular, we kept people on that game for longer.

02:00:30,370 --> 02:00:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  So it.

02:00:31,138 --> 02:00:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  delayed a little bit we were doing with Fallout 4 at the time because we can't, you know, hey!

02:00:35,810 --> 02:00:40,126
SPEAKER_0:  We really shouldn't move the people on the fallout yet because we're doing these things in Skyrim and we should.

02:00:40,418 --> 02:00:43,518
SPEAKER_0:  So it just sort of keeps you honest for where you're at.

02:00:43,938 --> 02:00:45,950
SPEAKER_1:  Does it get super stressful as you get closer?

02:00:46,242 --> 02:00:49,617
SPEAKER_1:  I used to, you tried to avoid announcing anything. Is there a temptation to announce?

02:00:49,617 --> 02:00:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I've done it always, right? I've announced, you know, Starfield, we're pretty, you know, loud with a release date that we then had to delay.

02:00:57,794 --> 02:00:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  So...

02:00:59,234 --> 02:00:59,870
SPEAKER_0:  um...

02:01:00,194 --> 02:01:00,734
SPEAKER_1:  Was that tough?

02:01:02,146 --> 02:01:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  to us.

02:01:03,330 --> 02:01:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  It was.

02:01:04,066 --> 02:01:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  but it was the right thing to do.

02:01:05,698 --> 02:01:06,494
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

02:01:06,722 --> 02:01:08,670
SPEAKER_1:  How do you know it's the right thing? Like one your

02:01:09,026 --> 02:01:11,774
SPEAKER_1:  when you sat down and looked at it like, this is not ready.

02:01:12,066 --> 02:01:13,630
SPEAKER_0:  It's not an exact science.

02:01:13,922 --> 02:01:17,246
SPEAKER_0:  but you can look at what needs to be done the amount of time you have.

02:01:17,794 --> 02:01:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  And...

02:01:19,074 --> 02:01:22,878
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we've done it in the past where we can get it done. We believe we can.

02:01:23,458 --> 02:01:27,550
SPEAKER_0:  And so you're fighting that personal belief that you can get something done.

02:01:28,386 --> 02:01:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  but there's a lot of things that go into release date with marketing and publishing.

02:01:33,122 --> 02:01:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  And...

02:01:34,562 --> 02:01:36,222
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we've reached a point where...

02:01:36,578 --> 02:01:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  on Starfield where...

02:01:38,434 --> 02:01:40,222
SPEAKER_0:  It was pretty clear to us.

02:01:41,122 --> 02:01:42,814
SPEAKER_0:  Even though you want to say you can get it done.

02:01:43,202 --> 02:01:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  that.

02:01:44,642 --> 02:01:46,014
SPEAKER_0:  the risk involved with that.

02:01:46,850 --> 02:01:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  to the fans, to the game, to the team, to the company, we're part of Xbox now to everybody was.

02:01:52,194 --> 02:01:55,102
SPEAKER_0:  we should really, we should really move it.

02:01:56,066 --> 02:01:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  and give it.

02:01:57,282 --> 02:01:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  the time it needs.

02:01:59,202 --> 02:02:01,150
SPEAKER_1:  So you mentioned part of Xbox.

02:02:01,922 --> 02:02:06,942
SPEAKER_1:  Microsoft bought, but that's then and as an MX for 7.5.

02:02:07,682 --> 02:02:08,862
SPEAKER_1:  billion dollars.

02:02:09,410 --> 02:02:10,270
SPEAKER_1:  Ah business Stepping

02:02:11,010 --> 02:02:15,326
SPEAKER_1:  Well, what's it like joining the Xbox team? You've, you've, um...

02:02:15,842 --> 02:02:16,958
SPEAKER_1:  I think written about it.

02:02:17,442 --> 02:02:19,102
SPEAKER_1:  What's what are the?

02:02:19,522 --> 02:02:21,470
SPEAKER_1:  What are the exciting aspects of that?

02:02:22,274 --> 02:02:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

02:02:23,842 --> 02:02:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  When your company goes through a change like that, no matter what it is, even if it's somebody that you've worked with for a long time, you never know.

02:02:30,562 --> 02:02:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  What you're in for you hope.

02:02:32,834 --> 02:02:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  and I had worked with them.

02:02:35,266 --> 02:02:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  uh, for, since we started doing console stuffs with Morrowind was, you know, they came to us, came to me and the, Hey, you should make this game for the Xbox. And so when they were making that console.

02:02:45,954 --> 02:02:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  um... had a great experience with them.

02:02:48,578 --> 02:02:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  and then on the 360 with oblivion. So I guess the point is...

02:02:52,802 --> 02:02:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  We felt that we had a very good relationship with everybody there.

02:02:57,186 --> 02:02:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  and we understood.

02:02:58,786 --> 02:03:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  what their culture was, but you never really know.

02:03:02,786 --> 02:03:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  And I mean this honestly.

02:03:05,026 --> 02:03:05,982
SPEAKER_0:  It's been awesome.

02:03:06,210 --> 02:03:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  that the culture inside of Microsoft and Xbox that people see from the outside is the culture inside, the way they talk about players.

02:03:14,178 --> 02:03:18,366
SPEAKER_0:  the way they'll invest in the players, the risks they'll take.

02:03:19,074 --> 02:03:20,734
SPEAKER_0:  the thoughtfulness from.

02:03:21,378 --> 02:03:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  Phil Spencer on down.

02:03:23,362 --> 02:03:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  has been, you know, feel really, really...

02:03:25,826 --> 02:03:26,334
SPEAKER_0:  Lucky.

02:03:27,010 --> 02:03:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  And then a game like Starfield where, look, we've had a lot of success with the games that you talked about, but we've never been kind of the...

02:03:34,530 --> 02:03:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  platform.

02:03:35,618 --> 02:03:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  Seller?

02:03:37,186 --> 02:03:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  You know THE game?

02:03:38,786 --> 02:03:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  for a platform for a period of time. And so.

02:03:41,890 --> 02:03:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  You know, there is a lot of pressure there. There's a lot of responsibility there to make sure we deliver for everybody.

02:03:48,194 --> 02:03:52,743
SPEAKER_1:  Is there a chance that Starfield is exclusive to Xbox? It is exclusive.

02:03:52,743 --> 02:03:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  It's officially released.

02:03:54,466 --> 02:03:54,878
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

02:03:56,898 --> 02:04:02,526
SPEAKER_1:  Europe. I get it. So extra pressure also creating a new world.

02:04:03,394 --> 02:04:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it's new, but keep in mind.

02:04:05,570 --> 02:04:15,934
SPEAKER_0:  For us, that exclusivity is not unique, even though we've done PlayStation stuff, and I think the PlayStation 5 is just an insane machine. They've done a great job, we've had great success on PlayStation.

02:04:16,578 --> 02:04:18,366
SPEAKER_0:  We were traditionally a PC.

02:04:18,978 --> 02:04:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  developers in the beginning.

02:04:21,122 --> 02:04:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  We transitioned to Xbox, became our lead platform. Like Morrowind's basically exclusive to Xbox. Oblivion was exclusive to Xbox for a long period of time.

02:04:29,858 --> 02:04:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  Skyrim DLC was so we've done a lot of like our initial stuff is all Xbox. So.

02:04:35,042 --> 02:04:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  We get in development and saying we're focused on Xbox and.

02:04:38,402 --> 02:04:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  It's not.

02:04:39,554 --> 02:04:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  Abnormal for us in any way.

02:04:41,634 --> 02:04:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  been kind of the norm.

02:04:43,778 --> 02:04:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  And from a development side, I, you know...

02:04:46,530 --> 02:04:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  I like the ability to focus. So our ability to focus and say,

02:04:50,786 --> 02:04:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  and have help from them.

02:04:52,194 --> 02:04:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  you know the top engineers at Xbox to say we're gonna make this look incredible.

02:04:57,474 --> 02:05:01,790
SPEAKER_0:  on the new systems is like from my standpoint, it's just awesome.

02:05:02,306 --> 02:05:06,782
SPEAKER_1:  What's the difference in creating the console versus the PC? I also have to admit...

02:05:07,010 --> 02:05:07,774
SPEAKER_1:  I've never.

02:05:08,546 --> 02:05:13,630
SPEAKER_1:  Um, is this shameful? Actually, you should recommend to me. I've never played Skyrim or any.

02:05:14,146 --> 02:05:14,750
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

02:05:15,074 --> 02:05:17,118
SPEAKER_1:  any of the games you've created on Xbox.

02:05:17,442 --> 02:05:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  Really.

02:05:18,658 --> 02:05:21,283
SPEAKER_1:  and on console. I played, I mean I played very little.

02:05:21,283 --> 02:05:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, sure. I mean look, there's the obvious interface part between mouse and keyboard and then a controller.

02:05:27,362 --> 02:05:30,014
SPEAKER_0:  But when you're looking at hardware, PCs, it's tough.

02:05:30,498 --> 02:05:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  Right, because you're looking at, well...

02:05:33,826 --> 02:05:40,862
SPEAKER_0:  You know what are their driver versions? What kind of monitor they have? What is the actual refresh rate of X, Y, and Z?

02:05:41,410 --> 02:05:41,982
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:05:42,626 --> 02:05:43,390
SPEAKER_0:  We're used to it.

02:05:43,618 --> 02:05:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  But if you know anyone will tell you

02:05:45,762 --> 02:05:53,630
SPEAKER_0:  give me the hardware that I know I'm writing it for. You know this. And the series X is just a incredible.

02:05:54,242 --> 02:05:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  Machine.

02:05:55,714 --> 02:06:03,166
SPEAKER_0:  And now that we're part of Xbox, getting the people who built it to show you.

02:06:03,394 --> 02:06:06,014
SPEAKER_0:  how to make it really, really dance is.

02:06:06,242 --> 02:06:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  This is just awesome.

02:06:09,154 --> 02:06:11,998
SPEAKER_1:  Is there a case to be made? Did you get people that enjoy?

02:06:12,386 --> 02:06:15,742
SPEAKER_1:  people that do both PC and Xbox, then enjoy Xbox more.

02:06:16,354 --> 02:06:19,486
SPEAKER_1:  Like that, if they have a choice, they enjoy it.

02:06:19,714 --> 02:06:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  I think that depends on...

02:06:22,338 --> 02:06:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  And look, now that you can kind of cross...

02:06:25,122 --> 02:06:27,390
SPEAKER_0:  You can take your save and go between and all those things.

02:06:27,650 --> 02:06:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  You can.

02:06:29,634 --> 02:06:30,782
SPEAKER_0:  If you, depends on.

02:06:32,098 --> 02:06:32,862
SPEAKER_1:  Forge Games.

02:06:33,282 --> 02:06:34,270
SPEAKER_1:  So forward the scour.

02:06:34,978 --> 02:06:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  If you have the...

02:06:36,994 --> 02:06:41,246
SPEAKER_0:  game pass PC version of it versus Steam. Not via Steam right now.

02:06:41,538 --> 02:06:47,262
SPEAKER_1:  I got it. And so there's the game. So I'm like learning about this. So there's a Microsoft gate. So this could be a game pass.

02:06:48,034 --> 02:06:51,409
SPEAKER_1:  And then you can, if yeah, if you can take it from PC through Game Pass.

02:06:51,409 --> 02:06:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  But I think it depends on, like...

02:06:54,082 --> 02:06:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  For me?

02:06:55,490 --> 02:06:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  What's my physical mood?

02:06:57,218 --> 02:07:06,974
SPEAKER_0:  Do I wanna lean back on a sofa? Exactly. Like the actual physicality of it is what determines where I wanna play. Do I wanna be two feet from a thing right now?

02:07:07,490 --> 02:07:08,702
SPEAKER_0:  And sometimes I like that.

02:07:09,090 --> 02:07:11,454
SPEAKER_0:  I am more of a console player just because.

02:07:12,258 --> 02:07:14,366
SPEAKER_0:  I sit at my PC at work all day, like.

02:07:15,042 --> 02:07:18,142
SPEAKER_0:  I play a lot of video games, so when I get home...

02:07:18,402 --> 02:07:22,270
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm like, I am a sofa screen controller person.

02:07:24,514 --> 02:07:29,246
SPEAKER_1:  Let me ask you a ridiculous question. So you've created some of the greatest games ever. I think there's

02:07:29,922 --> 02:07:32,702
SPEAKER_1:  The question would be what's the best game of all time?

02:07:33,410 --> 02:07:35,966
SPEAKER_1:  Alright, just give me a second. Tetris. At the beginning of the video I was going to say

02:07:36,386 --> 02:07:37,511
SPEAKER_1:  All right, that's interesting.

02:07:37,511 --> 02:07:38,846
SPEAKER_0:  Have you read the book on Tetris? No

02:07:39,234 --> 02:07:39,678
SPEAKER_0:  You should read.

02:07:39,906 --> 02:07:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  Pickly someone who grew up in Russia.

02:07:42,754 --> 02:07:48,926
SPEAKER_1:  I'm sure there's an interesting story. The fact that there's a book about Tetris is fascinating. Is there a book about Mario?

02:07:50,114 --> 02:07:50,558
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:07:50,818 --> 02:07:55,038
SPEAKER_1:  I would love to find out more, but I think I would put.

02:07:55,266 --> 02:07:56,574
SPEAKER_1:  personal poscarum.

02:07:57,282 --> 02:07:57,854
SPEAKER_1:  I'll take that.

02:07:58,050 --> 02:07:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  Good answer.

02:07:59,138 --> 02:08:00,446
SPEAKER_1:  Number 1.

02:08:01,058 --> 02:08:01,502
SPEAKER_1:  me.

02:08:02,402 --> 02:08:08,286
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, which is tough, however you put it, cause you could also make the case out of the Elder Scrolls series.

02:08:08,514 --> 02:08:13,150
SPEAKER_1:  Like what do you actually value more? If you put Tetris and Super Mario up there, then like.

02:08:13,730 --> 02:08:18,558
SPEAKER_1:  The credit goes to Morrowind maybe or Skyrim. I don't know where the biggest leaps are.

02:08:19,042 --> 02:08:19,518
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:08:19,842 --> 02:08:21,982
SPEAKER_1:  but overall I think it's Skyrim Belt.

02:08:22,722 --> 02:08:27,102
SPEAKER_1:  For you if you're not allowed to pick any of the games you were involved with

02:08:27,426 --> 02:08:29,406
SPEAKER_1:  What are some interesting candidates for you?

02:08:29,762 --> 02:08:30,366
SPEAKER_1:  They're just.

02:08:31,106 --> 02:08:32,190
SPEAKER_1:  games that...

02:08:34,370 --> 02:08:39,454
SPEAKER_1:  inspired the world, impacted the world, shook the world in terms of what video games are able to do.

02:08:40,162 --> 02:08:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  Well first-

02:08:42,434 --> 02:08:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  I'm just sort of like.

02:08:43,650 --> 02:08:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  Hearing you say that you think Skyrim is the best game of all time is quite...

02:08:47,970 --> 02:08:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  like, thank you.

02:08:51,010 --> 02:08:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  Incredible thing to hear.

02:08:52,738 --> 02:08:53,310
SPEAKER_0:  Um

02:08:53,762 --> 02:08:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  End.

02:08:55,714 --> 02:08:57,694
SPEAKER_0:  You know, when I think about...

02:08:58,818 --> 02:09:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  I have a couple of answers, there's ones that are like personal to me.

02:09:01,762 --> 02:09:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  Ultima VII.

02:09:03,074 --> 02:09:06,238
SPEAKER_1:  You can't talk about Altamira. Like you said that as an inspiration.

02:09:06,562 --> 02:09:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  I've never...

02:09:07,970 --> 02:09:08,990
SPEAKER_1:  across that world.

02:09:09,730 --> 02:09:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  Well.

02:09:10,498 --> 02:09:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  Which, what kind of game is it? It's a roleplaying game.

02:09:13,538 --> 02:09:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  you know, circa 1992, 1993, 1994, and Ultima Online first, you know.

02:09:20,162 --> 02:09:25,726
SPEAKER_0:  really visual online world in that way. But for me, that was a virtual fantasy world.

02:09:26,050 --> 02:09:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  where I had, you know, you could bake bread, you could pick all the stuff up. I mean, anyone who's played Ultimas and plays our stuff can see the...

02:09:33,378 --> 02:09:33,854
SPEAKER_0:  kind of.

02:09:34,210 --> 02:09:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  touchstones and callbacks to that or inspirations.

02:09:38,530 --> 02:09:41,598
SPEAKER_0:  And the other thing that I loved about Ultima...

02:09:42,690 --> 02:09:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  was

02:09:44,226 --> 02:09:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  they were all different.

02:09:47,266 --> 02:09:50,846
SPEAKER_0:  right, that they iterated and they weren't necessarily.

02:09:51,170 --> 02:09:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  what I'll call a plus one sequel outside of Ultima 7, part two clearly a plus one sequel.

02:09:56,706 --> 02:09:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  but they each had their own tone.

02:09:59,138 --> 02:10:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  Um, I love like the boxes.

02:10:01,954 --> 02:10:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  You know something that we get into as well. I love this idea that a game also is this tangible.

02:10:07,938 --> 02:10:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  DING

02:10:08,674 --> 02:10:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, when you buy it with the cardboard boxes and the way they were designed and...

02:10:13,442 --> 02:10:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  Ultima 7 is black and Ultima 8 is the fiery gate and...

02:10:16,962 --> 02:10:18,302
SPEAKER_0:  The paintings on them and-

02:10:18,914 --> 02:10:20,551
SPEAKER_0:  I just, you know, if you look.

02:10:20,551 --> 02:10:21,630
SPEAKER_1:  heart a little bit that

02:10:22,082 --> 02:10:23,957
SPEAKER_1:  that culture is a bit gone. if that's your actually factor 1 beef.

02:10:23,957 --> 02:10:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  A little bit, a little bit.

02:10:26,402 --> 02:10:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  And that's also why I like...

02:10:28,866 --> 02:10:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  You know, this goes to video gaming or any other digital things where digital ownership has great value to people. So I like.

02:10:36,034 --> 02:10:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  looking at my collections of games, even digitally.

02:10:39,650 --> 02:10:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  I wanna see nice.

02:10:41,122 --> 02:10:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  You know, in the same way you want to see nice album art.

02:10:43,938 --> 02:10:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  Wanna see nice.

02:10:44,930 --> 02:10:46,494
SPEAKER_0:  cover art for our games.

02:10:47,138 --> 02:10:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  and we spend a lot of time in them so that...

02:10:49,154 --> 02:10:51,806
SPEAKER_0:  Take a look at Elder Scrolls and Morrowind Oblivion in Skyrim.

02:10:52,130 --> 02:10:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  We want those boxes to look good next to each other.

02:10:55,714 --> 02:10:57,182
SPEAKER_0:  Going back to the video games.

02:10:57,858 --> 02:11:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I always mention Tetris because I think...

02:11:01,250 --> 02:11:01,758
SPEAKER_0:  It's...

02:11:03,330 --> 02:11:06,942
SPEAKER_0:  You know, obviously I love virtual worlds and those kind of things, but for the time...

02:11:07,234 --> 02:11:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  and what.

02:11:08,034 --> 02:11:11,518
SPEAKER_0:  an interactive like video game, sort of the simplest form.

02:11:12,962 --> 02:11:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  I sort of think you can put Tetris in front of just about anybody.

02:11:18,178 --> 02:11:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  E E N D

02:11:19,746 --> 02:11:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  They'll enjoy it.

02:11:22,050 --> 02:11:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  and it's got some.

02:11:23,170 --> 02:11:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  moment of challenge and...

02:11:25,218 --> 02:11:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:11:25,922 --> 02:11:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  It's just so elegant.

02:11:27,970 --> 02:11:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  It's like to me, this very pure game.

02:11:32,290 --> 02:11:34,110
SPEAKER_0:  That only works because it's a video game.

02:11:35,842 --> 02:11:37,918
SPEAKER_1:  And I think mobile games figured out.

02:11:38,274 --> 02:11:40,574
SPEAKER_1:  some of the magic of Tetris, the simple.

02:11:41,538 --> 02:11:50,065
SPEAKER_1:  Some of them have, yeah. But Defters did it a long, long time ago. Right. You can really create that immersive experience without...

02:11:50,065 --> 02:11:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  But for me, you know, the ultimate civilization.

02:11:53,314 --> 02:11:54,302
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

02:11:54,626 --> 02:11:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  as far as.

02:11:56,226 --> 02:11:59,198
SPEAKER_0:  you know, a grand strategy game.

02:12:00,290 --> 02:12:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  Pac-Man I mentioned in terms of bringing games into...

02:12:04,514 --> 02:12:08,222
SPEAKER_0:  mainstream in a way that captured people that nothing before it had.

02:12:09,186 --> 02:12:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  Super Mario, Donkey Kong, everything. Nintendo, probably the best game makers in the world still.

02:12:14,114 --> 02:12:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  They know who they are. They know what they want to do.

02:12:17,218 --> 02:12:19,870
SPEAKER_0:  I'm always in awe of what they create.

02:12:21,218 --> 02:12:22,622
SPEAKER_1:  I gotta ask you about the...

02:12:22,882 --> 02:12:23,742
SPEAKER_1:  A game.

02:12:24,322 --> 02:12:25,374
SPEAKER_1:  I haven't played.

02:12:25,698 --> 02:12:27,166
SPEAKER_1:  but people put up there.

02:12:27,778 --> 02:12:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  as one of the greats Zelda Breath of the Wild.

02:12:30,978 --> 02:12:32,853
SPEAKER_1:  Have you gotten a chance to play? A lot of it.

02:12:32,853 --> 02:12:34,270
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, yes, it's fantastic.

02:12:34,530 --> 02:12:42,014
SPEAKER_1:  Fantastic. What do you think about? I mean, it's a very different experience. I've played other Zelda's than the open worlds you've created, but it is also an open world.

02:12:42,338 --> 02:12:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  It is.

02:12:43,970 --> 02:12:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  It's my favorite Zelda, because I obviously like open world stuff.

02:12:47,362 --> 02:12:48,062
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:12:49,154 --> 02:12:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  The-

02:12:50,050 --> 02:12:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  The one thing that they do really, really well is they don't constrain you. Some people, you know.

02:12:54,850 --> 02:12:58,718
SPEAKER_0:  Even some of the things we do constrain you a little bit more. Zelda says here's the whole thing.

02:13:00,034 --> 02:13:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  and you are constrained by the actual...

02:13:04,738 --> 02:13:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:13:05,698 --> 02:13:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  player abilities you haven't earned yet, not some arbitrary barriers.

02:13:11,202 --> 02:13:14,334
SPEAKER_0:  And so I think they just did a phenomenal job. This was a magical game.

02:13:15,106 --> 02:13:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  It really feels open.

02:13:16,610 --> 02:13:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  It's because it truly is. Yes.

02:13:19,138 --> 02:13:19,838
SPEAKER_1:  What about...

02:13:20,258 --> 02:13:23,742
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I just like asking you about some open world.

02:13:24,194 --> 02:13:26,782
SPEAKER_1:  A very different one is the world of.

02:13:27,522 --> 02:13:30,494
SPEAKER_1:  Either Grand Theft Auto or Red Dead Redemption.

02:13:30,850 --> 02:13:31,646
SPEAKER_0:  Both love.

02:13:32,130 --> 02:13:33,982
SPEAKER_0:  I would put GTA 3.

02:13:34,210 --> 02:13:40,894
SPEAKER_0:  Grand Theft Auto 3 up there with the landmark kind of usher in the open world when that comes out on the PlayStation 2.

02:13:41,634 --> 02:13:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  Even though there was GTA 1 and 2, this was an all new thing with the mobster storytelling.

02:13:46,594 --> 02:13:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  Uh

02:13:47,682 --> 02:13:52,798
SPEAKER_0:  Is that the first 3D version, I guess? It was, then Vice City's kind of a fast follow, which...

02:13:54,146 --> 02:13:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  Could be my favorite one.

02:13:55,906 --> 02:13:56,478
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:13:57,314 --> 02:13:59,646
SPEAKER_0:  I loved all the Grand Theft Auto's, I think they're really...

02:14:00,450 --> 02:14:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  Phenomenally well made game, same with Red Dead.

02:14:03,266 --> 02:14:05,118
SPEAKER_0:  I think Red Dead Redemption.

02:14:05,666 --> 02:14:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  One.

02:14:07,266 --> 02:14:08,862
SPEAKER_0:  Could be my favorite story.

02:14:10,498 --> 02:14:10,846
SPEAKER_0:  Like.

02:14:11,970 --> 02:14:13,095
SPEAKER_0:  I highly recommend finishing.

02:14:13,095 --> 02:14:13,566
SPEAKER_1:  that game.

02:14:14,146 --> 02:14:18,302
SPEAKER_1:  So you like both the story, you like the grittiness of that. Is there a little bit of the-

02:14:19,330 --> 02:14:22,334
SPEAKER_1:  Like, I guess if you like the fall out, there's the humor.

02:14:22,850 --> 02:14:23,486
SPEAKER_1:  Duh.

02:14:24,066 --> 02:14:31,038
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know. I don't know what it is. It's the lighthearted humor of it, but also the brutality of human nature is in there too.

02:14:31,746 --> 02:14:32,798
SPEAKER_1:  where it's like a...

02:14:34,178 --> 02:14:41,303
SPEAKER_1:  And also some of the fun they create with the music when you drive and stuff like that. They create a world. There's a tone. There's a very strong.

02:14:41,303 --> 02:14:45,054
SPEAKER_0:  Very strong tone, you know, the satire on.

02:14:45,506 --> 02:14:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  The world is just so well done. The gameplay is great.

02:14:49,954 --> 02:14:50,590
SPEAKER_0:  um...

02:14:51,010 --> 02:14:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  I think they've just done a...

02:14:53,410 --> 02:14:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  A phenomenal job.

02:14:55,138 --> 02:14:57,950
SPEAKER_1:  Is there any others that pop to mind? Portal

02:14:58,562 --> 02:14:59,518
SPEAKER_1:  portal. Yeah.

02:15:01,122 --> 02:15:03,710
SPEAKER_1:  That's another weird creation.

02:15:04,514 --> 02:15:06,389
SPEAKER_0:  I could just sit here and list games forever.

02:15:06,389 --> 02:15:07,902
SPEAKER_1:  For now, I'm enjoying this.

02:15:08,578 --> 02:15:15,825
SPEAKER_0:  Hearthstone's a game I love. I love all types of sports. College football, NCAA football was my favorite. It's like, I would say this is a great role.

02:15:15,825 --> 02:15:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  you would actually keep getting real.

02:15:17,634 --> 02:15:22,014
SPEAKER_0:  It's a role-playing game because I have all these characters. I have like 60 characters.

02:15:22,530 --> 02:15:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  and they're all leveling up.

02:15:24,130 --> 02:15:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  and then I have to play them. And then the college one, because I like college football, they'd graduate so you lose your players. And then they stop making the series.

02:15:30,658 --> 02:15:35,262
SPEAKER_0:  I know the folks at EA and they will say, I have bugged them, when is this coming? And they're doing it, so it's finally coming back.

02:15:35,746 --> 02:15:36,094
SPEAKER_1:  this.

02:15:36,674 --> 02:15:38,366
SPEAKER_1:  What would you say is the...

02:15:38,946 --> 02:15:40,702
SPEAKER_1:  is the greatest sports game of all time.

02:15:41,314 --> 02:15:41,918
SPEAKER_1:  Hmm

02:15:44,578 --> 02:15:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  Well, it's NCAA football. I have to pick the year.

02:15:47,714 --> 02:15:48,542
SPEAKER_1:  That's you.

02:15:48,866 --> 02:15:49,758
SPEAKER_1:  versus Madden?

02:15:51,010 --> 02:15:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  Give us more teams.

02:15:52,610 --> 02:15:53,726
SPEAKER_0:  You get the college.

02:15:54,146 --> 02:15:54,622
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

02:15:54,914 --> 02:15:56,990
SPEAKER_0:  fight songs, more pageantry.

02:15:57,314 --> 02:16:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  and the players turn over. They're only there for four seasons, so you have to-

02:16:01,794 --> 02:16:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  the, so, you know, it's more dynamic.

02:16:06,082 --> 02:16:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  So you like variety versus... So what was the last one?

02:16:08,770 --> 02:16:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  2014, maybe it was.

02:16:12,930 --> 02:16:13,342
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:16:13,762 --> 02:16:15,294
SPEAKER_1:  You don't like FIFA and...

02:16:15,874 --> 02:16:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  Look, FIFA's incredible.

02:16:18,082 --> 02:16:22,110
SPEAKER_0:  Look, I'm a college football fan. They give you that fantasy. If you like, if you like.

02:16:22,562 --> 02:16:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  European football slash soccer, FIFA is incredible. I love that game too.

02:16:27,266 --> 02:16:30,686
SPEAKER_1:  Have you been paying attention to the game design of that world?

02:16:31,074 --> 02:16:32,158
SPEAKER_1:  of those worlds.

02:16:32,290 --> 02:16:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, and the thing people, I think, with those kind of games...

02:16:35,938 --> 02:16:37,342
SPEAKER_0:  It is re- like-

02:16:37,858 --> 02:16:40,318
SPEAKER_0:  Or racing games, Forza, put up there, I love Forza.

02:16:40,770 --> 02:16:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  um, play them all.

02:16:42,306 --> 02:16:48,542
SPEAKER_0:  When you have to recreate something that's real in the real world, say it's cars or sports games, everybody knows how it should work.

02:16:50,018 --> 02:16:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  That's a really difficult task.

02:16:52,546 --> 02:16:53,950
SPEAKER_0:  when people know how it should work.

02:16:54,562 --> 02:16:57,886
SPEAKER_0:  Then you're going to balance it for single player, the multiplayer parts of it.

02:16:58,178 --> 02:16:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:16:59,042 --> 02:17:00,382
SPEAKER_0:  keep very, very competitive.

02:17:01,026 --> 02:17:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  And in many respects, you're forced to put out a new version every year.

02:17:05,346 --> 02:17:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  And.

02:17:06,786 --> 02:17:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  I say forced in quotes because they're, you know.

02:17:09,090 --> 02:17:10,686
SPEAKER_0:  count them as big updates.

02:17:11,298 --> 02:17:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  But it's a much more difficult development process than I think.

02:17:17,794 --> 02:17:18,750
SPEAKER_0:  People understand?

02:17:19,458 --> 02:17:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  and how hard those teams work and know a lot of people who do it and

02:17:23,298 --> 02:17:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  I think they just do.

02:17:25,026 --> 02:17:26,974
SPEAKER_0:  I've enjoyed them all. I buy Madden every year.

02:17:27,810 --> 02:17:29,438
SPEAKER_1:  So yeah, every single year.

02:17:30,178 --> 02:17:33,639
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, they do refresh it. There's a feeling of freshness. I don't know what that is. Yeah.

02:17:33,639 --> 02:17:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  Look, there have been years where it feels like less was done and more was done, but I enjoy it every year.

02:17:40,738 --> 02:17:41,726
SPEAKER_1:  What is a

02:17:42,082 --> 02:17:45,182
SPEAKER_1:  perfectly productive day in the life of Todd Howard looked like.

02:17:46,594 --> 02:17:51,550
SPEAKER_1:  So maybe not perfectly, but just like a perfectly average productive.

02:17:51,938 --> 02:17:52,286
SPEAKER_1:

02:17:52,578 --> 02:17:55,550
SPEAKER_1:  What what are you a morning person evening person?

02:17:55,970 --> 02:17:58,398
SPEAKER_1:  Is it chaos? Is it pretty regular?

02:17:59,074 --> 02:18:00,199
SPEAKER_1:  Ahh...pezcho!

02:18:00,199 --> 02:18:07,358
SPEAKER_0:  I'm in a good flow right now. I'm still doing a lot of stuff. So there's things I'm executive producing and then...

02:18:08,610 --> 02:18:12,254
SPEAKER_0:  you know, Starfield I'm directing. So I sort of view that as that's an everyday thing.

02:18:12,674 --> 02:18:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  Fortunately I get to do a lot of stuff from...

02:18:16,962 --> 02:18:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  look at the TV show we're making and...

02:18:19,458 --> 02:18:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  This Indiana Jones game that's being developed, a machine game, so we have to look at that.

02:18:25,250 --> 02:18:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  But you know, the best...

02:18:26,882 --> 02:18:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  really day or.

02:18:28,674 --> 02:18:30,878
SPEAKER_0:  where I feel it's fulfilling is...

02:18:32,482 --> 02:18:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  um...

02:18:33,730 --> 02:18:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  Get to play some of a game. The game will say Starfield. Get to play some of Starfield.

02:18:37,794 --> 02:18:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  Look at.

02:18:39,202 --> 02:18:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  the problem set of what it.

02:18:40,962 --> 02:18:41,598
SPEAKER_0:  is doing.

02:18:42,466 --> 02:18:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  and then get in a room with

02:18:44,994 --> 02:18:48,030
SPEAKER_0:  the other developers that I work closely with and we.

02:18:48,578 --> 02:18:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  solve that problem together.

02:18:50,050 --> 02:18:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:18:51,490 --> 02:18:54,334
SPEAKER_0:  That's the most rewarding thing when you can say, okay.

02:18:54,594 --> 02:18:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  What do we want this to do? What's the real player experience we want?

02:18:58,690 --> 02:19:03,518
SPEAKER_0:  What are all the pieces in front of us? Where you know the actual tangible pieces as opposed to the...]

02:19:03,842 --> 02:19:07,422
SPEAKER_0:  The beginning, the pie in the sky part is always fun.

02:19:08,226 --> 02:19:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  but it's like anything is possible, that's fun.

02:19:10,882 --> 02:19:11,422
SPEAKER_0:  But it's not.

02:19:12,450 --> 02:19:15,806
SPEAKER_0:  rewarding in the same way because you haven't solved something, whereas

02:19:16,226 --> 02:19:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  These are the elements you have to play with.

02:19:18,914 --> 02:19:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  how do we make this all work together? and you come out of it at the end of the day like

02:19:23,330 --> 02:19:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  Now that feels great.

02:19:26,754 --> 02:19:32,542
SPEAKER_1:  So brainstorming about specific big picture, both big picture and very specific big picture.

02:19:32,962 --> 02:19:33,854
SPEAKER_1:  specific detail.

02:19:34,114 --> 02:19:37,406
SPEAKER_1:  of a game that's not working, something's not working, you want to fix it, that kind of stuff.

02:19:38,210 --> 02:19:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  Because you feel like, okay, you've made tangible progress on the actual build of the game. Or something you played in the beginning of the day, didn't feel great.

02:19:46,530 --> 02:19:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  You've

02:19:47,298 --> 02:19:50,718
SPEAKER_0:  figured out a solution with a group of people. Like it's always with a group.

02:19:51,522 --> 02:19:53,278
SPEAKER_0:  And then the next day you're like, yeah, that was.

02:19:54,498 --> 02:19:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  worked out.

02:19:55,266 --> 02:19:58,398
SPEAKER_1:  Who's on the team? Is it designers, engineers?

02:19:58,626 --> 02:19:59,934
SPEAKER_0:  All the above artists.

02:20:00,162 --> 02:20:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  voice.

02:20:01,378 --> 02:20:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  over so it internal to the studio it's you know a lot of programming lot of art

02:20:06,402 --> 02:20:19,870
SPEAKER_0:  You have design, which breaks into some quest design, writing, systems design, who are like doing all the treasure and the loot and the skill systems. And then level design is making the spaces like those that you'll play through.

02:20:20,194 --> 02:20:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  Production is a big part of it. The producers who organize everything.

02:20:24,194 --> 02:20:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  I can't remember if I mentioned art, a lot of artists.

02:20:26,850 --> 02:20:30,046
SPEAKER_0:  QA staff as well. They're hugely valuable in saying.

02:20:30,690 --> 02:20:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  Hey, we broke your game in these magical ways. What are you going to do about it?

02:20:34,658 --> 02:20:42,467
SPEAKER_1:  Is the Loo Design team still hiring? How do I apply? That seems like the most fun job. Always. And all of this seems like the most fun job.

02:20:42,467 --> 02:20:45,150
SPEAKER_0:  like a super fun job. It is, you know what, it's the best. Then you have audio.

02:20:45,634 --> 02:20:46,206
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:20:46,562 --> 02:20:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:20:48,866 --> 02:20:51,998
SPEAKER_0:  it by far is the greatest job you could possibly have.

02:20:52,354 --> 02:20:53,406
SPEAKER_0:  So if you're into like

02:20:53,634 --> 02:20:58,974
SPEAKER_0:  Technology, it's great. If you're into storytelling, creativity and art, it's great. And it's really good gaming.

02:20:59,554 --> 02:21:01,022
SPEAKER_0:  you know the combination of that

02:21:01,922 --> 02:21:05,406
SPEAKER_1:  And like I mentioned to you offline, I think of video games as...

02:21:05,762 --> 02:21:09,118
SPEAKER_1:  to me has brought thousands of hours of happiness.

02:21:09,570 --> 02:21:15,390
SPEAKER_1:  And so when you're designing the game, whatever you're doing, you have a part to play and a thing that's going to bring.

02:21:17,282 --> 02:21:18,686
SPEAKER_1:  like millions.

02:21:19,330 --> 02:21:22,430
SPEAKER_1:  hundreds of millions of hours of happiness to people.

02:21:23,234 --> 02:21:24,359
SPEAKER_1:  It's crazy, right?

02:21:24,359 --> 02:21:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  It is and I'm gonna I'm gonna play

02:21:26,946 --> 02:21:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  I'm gonna play you saying that back to our team, because people forget, your head's down, you're trying to solve these problems and then-

02:21:32,866 --> 02:21:34,686
SPEAKER_0:  You do forget how many people.

02:21:35,778 --> 02:21:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  It touches.

02:21:37,218 --> 02:21:38,814
SPEAKER_1:  Like even tiny decisions.

02:21:39,234 --> 02:21:41,022
SPEAKER_1:  You make tiny little things you create.

02:21:41,666 --> 02:21:43,806
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's weird. I wish there was a way to like...

02:21:45,282 --> 02:21:48,062
SPEAKER_1:  I would notice things in a video game and it's like, huh.

02:21:48,514 --> 02:21:52,190
SPEAKER_1:  like it feels good but you don't get that signal.

02:21:53,058 --> 02:21:54,814
SPEAKER_1:  The creator doesn't get that signal.

02:21:55,362 --> 02:21:56,190
SPEAKER_1:  I wish they did.

02:21:56,610 --> 02:21:58,878
SPEAKER_1:  I guess you could get that signal by

02:21:59,906 --> 02:22:04,565
SPEAKER_1:  You know, why is like stuck in this room like digging through the loop?

02:22:04,565 --> 02:22:14,846
SPEAKER_0:  We do now get a lot of good data on what the players are doing. Enjoying and not that kind of thing? Well, we know where they've been and where they've died and how long they play in certain sections, and we can sort of tell.

02:22:15,234 --> 02:22:18,526
SPEAKER_0:  outside of people just telling us on forums or calling or other things.

02:22:18,914 --> 02:22:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  We can tell for some data where...

02:22:21,634 --> 02:22:22,686
SPEAKER_0:  People are dropping off.

02:22:23,074 --> 02:22:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  or having a...

02:22:24,322 --> 02:22:25,822
SPEAKER_0:  You know we can tell if there's a key.

02:22:26,306 --> 02:22:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  frustration point.

02:22:29,058 --> 02:22:29,630
SPEAKER_1:  Divert.

02:22:30,658 --> 02:22:32,638
SPEAKER_1:  Think about making people feel.

02:22:33,154 --> 02:22:35,582
SPEAKER_1:  like human feelings when they play.

02:22:36,098 --> 02:22:37,214
SPEAKER_1:  like designing.

02:22:37,922 --> 02:22:41,086
SPEAKER_1:  like make them feel fear or excitement.

02:22:41,346 --> 02:22:42,078
SPEAKER_1:  Anger

02:22:42,850 --> 02:22:44,030
SPEAKER_1:  uh, longing.

02:22:44,386 --> 02:22:45,822
SPEAKER_1:  loneliness started up

02:22:46,114 --> 02:22:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, of course.

02:22:47,298 --> 02:22:47,934
SPEAKER_0:  The big one.

02:22:48,930 --> 02:22:51,518
SPEAKER_0:  I like to say is the video games give you is pride.

02:22:52,290 --> 02:22:53,470
SPEAKER_0:  outside of other.

02:22:53,890 --> 02:22:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  you know, if you watch movies or things like that.

02:22:56,866 --> 02:22:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  Like yeah, but you never...

02:22:58,082 --> 02:22:59,230
SPEAKER_0:  think, like, look what I did.

02:23:00,578 --> 02:23:04,894
SPEAKER_0:  And that feeling of accomplishment and pride in what you did?

02:23:05,346 --> 02:23:06,494
SPEAKER_0:  or you overcame?

02:23:07,458 --> 02:23:09,502
SPEAKER_0:  You talked about going back to a game that like...

02:23:10,146 --> 02:23:11,422
SPEAKER_0:  Those are real feelings.

02:23:11,938 --> 02:23:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  of accomplishment.

02:23:14,690 --> 02:23:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  that I've felt in games.

02:23:16,738 --> 02:23:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  that I've played.

02:23:18,786 --> 02:23:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:23:21,282 --> 02:23:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  when we get to see a player feel that.

02:23:24,386 --> 02:23:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  It's really, really special.

02:23:26,882 --> 02:23:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  The other one is there is a...

02:23:29,730 --> 02:23:31,294
SPEAKER_0:  You know, there is an escape.

02:23:31,586 --> 02:23:32,030
SPEAKER_0:  or to.

02:23:32,418 --> 02:23:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  Be someone else that's more powerful.

02:23:35,362 --> 02:23:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  in our games that.

02:23:37,762 --> 02:23:41,246
SPEAKER_0:  You are in real life that gives you a confidence or a perspective.

02:23:42,050 --> 02:23:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:23:43,906 --> 02:23:44,478
SPEAKER_0:  We're doing.

02:23:44,706 --> 02:23:47,998
SPEAKER_0:  one next week we've done a number of make-a-wish visits kids who could

02:23:48,642 --> 02:23:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  wish for anything.

02:23:50,466 --> 02:23:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  and they want to come and...

02:23:52,226 --> 02:23:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  I want to see the next game and meet the creators and see how you do it. They come with their family.

02:23:58,114 --> 02:24:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  And it is like the greatest.

02:24:00,642 --> 02:24:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  thing that we do.

02:24:02,850 --> 02:24:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:24:04,738 --> 02:24:06,814
SPEAKER_0:  It reminds you of like how important it is.

02:24:07,138 --> 02:24:09,310
SPEAKER_0:  And the other really awesome thing is...

02:24:10,690 --> 02:24:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  that you can see like.

02:24:12,386 --> 02:24:15,294
SPEAKER_0:  the family change by the end of the day. Like they don't.

02:24:15,522 --> 02:24:17,118
SPEAKER_0:  They didn't even realize what it meant.

02:24:17,730 --> 02:24:19,646
SPEAKER_0:  to their child, or what went into it.

02:24:20,002 --> 02:24:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  And it's just.

02:24:21,762 --> 02:24:23,166
SPEAKER_0:  That to me is like.

02:24:23,938 --> 02:24:27,454
SPEAKER_0:  been involved with that foundation for a number of years. Let me know whether you've seen a full-length pull-outwhich is available on Irish newspapers.

02:24:28,002 --> 02:24:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  really good.

02:24:29,506 --> 02:24:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  you know, reminder.

02:24:31,554 --> 02:24:32,542
SPEAKER_0:  of how lucky we are.

02:24:33,282 --> 02:24:37,630
SPEAKER_1:  And in general for young people, that sense of accomplishment is hard to find.

02:24:38,594 --> 02:24:39,294
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, yeah.

02:24:39,554 --> 02:24:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  Where they don't, not everybody has it in the outlets.

02:24:45,154 --> 02:24:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  real life provides.

02:24:46,818 --> 02:24:48,414
SPEAKER_1:  Well, that's the thing, I mean...

02:24:48,770 --> 02:24:51,198
SPEAKER_1:  The world is cruel when you're young.

02:24:52,258 --> 02:24:54,846
SPEAKER_1:  Nobody takes you seriously. You don't get like-

02:24:55,202 --> 02:24:58,823
SPEAKER_1:  That's why you everybody always wants to grow up and get all this.

02:24:58,823 --> 02:25:00,574
SPEAKER_0:  That's the hardest thought.

02:25:01,506 --> 02:25:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  is hard.

02:25:02,338 --> 02:25:04,094
SPEAKER_1:  and then video games allow you

02:25:04,866 --> 02:25:13,790
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, to build that sense of confidence, sense of pride and something. That's why when people talk down to video games, like it's a culture and so on, it's not.

02:25:14,626 --> 02:25:17,598
SPEAKER_1:  It misses out on that really deeply meaningful thing.

02:25:17,922 --> 02:25:19,038
SPEAKER_1:  Especially with like...

02:25:19,298 --> 02:25:26,046
SPEAKER_1:  single player, there's some darker aspects to multiplayer that people create communities and you know, it can go off the rails a bit.

02:25:26,466 --> 02:25:28,318
SPEAKER_1:  but the actual experience of the game.

02:25:29,954 --> 02:25:33,470
SPEAKER_1:  especially one we stick with for a while. That's really beautiful.

02:25:35,010 --> 02:25:36,702
SPEAKER_1:  Do you have advice?

02:25:37,026 --> 02:25:38,558
SPEAKER_1:  for those same young folks.

02:25:40,290 --> 02:25:42,462
SPEAKER_1:  given that your life is an interesting one.

02:25:43,490 --> 02:25:47,614
SPEAKER_1:  given what kind of degree you got and being a legendary game designer.

02:25:47,842 --> 02:25:50,974
SPEAKER_1:  Do you have advice for young folks in high school, maybe college?

02:25:51,586 --> 02:25:53,566
SPEAKER_1:  I don't have a career or a life.

02:25:53,922 --> 02:25:54,910
SPEAKER_1:  they can be proud of.

02:25:56,706 --> 02:25:58,814
SPEAKER_0:  Well, you have to find something that you love.

02:25:59,458 --> 02:26:00,638
SPEAKER_0:  so much that...

02:26:01,474 --> 02:26:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:26:02,402 --> 02:26:03,934
SPEAKER_0:  it's never gonna feel like a job.

02:26:05,634 --> 02:26:08,990
SPEAKER_0:  and don't do it for money, don't do it for find something you love and-

02:26:09,442 --> 02:26:09,886
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:26:12,258 --> 02:26:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  the rest of it will come. It won't be a straight.

02:26:15,138 --> 02:26:15,582
SPEAKER_0:  path.

02:26:16,930 --> 02:26:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:26:18,434 --> 02:26:21,406
SPEAKER_0:  Do not ever underestimate yourself.

02:26:23,234 --> 02:26:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  It's gonna take hard work.

02:26:26,018 --> 02:26:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  The worst thing that young people do is think they can't accomplish something or they underestimate themselves.

02:26:32,994 --> 02:26:35,870
SPEAKER_0:  and maybe those first few times through.

02:26:36,482 --> 02:26:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  where they do fail.

02:26:39,490 --> 02:26:44,318
SPEAKER_0:  If they love it enough, they're gonna be resilient and push past that. Anyone who's had...

02:26:44,642 --> 02:26:46,494
SPEAKER_0:  success or gotten somewhere it's been.

02:26:47,618 --> 02:26:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  They've had those times, right?

02:26:49,602 --> 02:26:50,782
SPEAKER_0:  and they've stayed resilient.

02:26:51,170 --> 02:26:51,838
SPEAKER_0:  because

02:26:52,546 --> 02:26:53,662
SPEAKER_0:  They love it so much.

02:26:54,178 --> 02:26:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  that this is what?

02:26:55,394 --> 02:26:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  they want to do.

02:26:56,802 --> 02:26:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  When you do it for other reasons.

02:26:59,330 --> 02:27:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  I just don't think it's going to work out the same.

02:27:01,570 --> 02:27:02,494
SPEAKER_1:  Did you have?

02:27:02,786 --> 02:27:03,710
SPEAKER_1:  Low points.

02:27:04,962 --> 02:27:09,470
SPEAKER_1:  uh in your life dark points or your mind went to a dark place

02:27:10,114 --> 02:27:15,518
SPEAKER_1:  whether it's struggling to get a job, but does the softworks or...

02:27:15,842 --> 02:27:17,470
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe with a...

02:27:18,658 --> 02:27:20,478
SPEAKER_1:  Redguard flop or...

02:27:21,538 --> 02:27:24,163
SPEAKER_1:  where you kind of start to doubt yourself or anything.

02:27:24,163 --> 02:27:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  that. I'm Chillin vin Da Da deaf

02:27:25,570 --> 02:27:26,814
SPEAKER_0:  What's weird looking back?

02:27:27,842 --> 02:27:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  I was so.

02:27:29,058 --> 02:27:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  I was always so like in love with doing this.

02:27:32,802 --> 02:27:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  that I didn't view them.

02:27:34,370 --> 02:27:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  as

02:27:37,090 --> 02:27:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  Dark.

02:27:37,986 --> 02:27:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  per se.

02:27:39,618 --> 02:27:41,086
SPEAKER_0:  Looking back, I was like, oh, that was...

02:27:41,538 --> 02:27:42,686
SPEAKER_0:  I just wanted to...

02:27:43,170 --> 02:27:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, let me find a way to make this work.

02:27:45,826 --> 02:27:48,990
SPEAKER_1:  Even when it's hard and it's failing and all that kind of stuff, you just kind of like.

02:27:49,378 --> 02:27:50,590
SPEAKER_1:  as a problem before you.

02:27:50,978 --> 02:27:53,310
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, you know, when I started with Thesda...

02:27:54,210 --> 02:27:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, my father had moved near.

02:27:56,802 --> 02:27:58,814
SPEAKER_0:  nearby to the office. I was moving.

02:27:59,778 --> 02:28:02,398
SPEAKER_0:  And I slept on a sofa, like I didn't care.

02:28:02,754 --> 02:28:05,982
SPEAKER_0:  I got underneath a bedroom. I'll just I'll sleep on the sofa and work there

02:28:06,306 --> 02:28:06,942
SPEAKER_0:  That's all I want to do.

02:28:07,874 --> 02:28:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  Um

02:28:08,962 --> 02:28:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  When the company almost went out of business, it was, well, I hope it doesn't.

02:28:13,090 --> 02:28:13,662
SPEAKER_0:  I feel.

02:28:14,210 --> 02:28:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  somewhat responsible.

02:28:16,578 --> 02:28:19,262
SPEAKER_0:  But hey, that's a learning lesson.

02:28:19,618 --> 02:28:21,694
SPEAKER_0:  Let's go. I think I was pretty resilient.

02:28:22,306 --> 02:28:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  to it all.

02:28:23,266 --> 02:28:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  Fallout 76, like...

02:28:25,122 --> 02:28:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  really bad launch.

02:28:27,106 --> 02:28:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  And okay.

02:28:28,770 --> 02:28:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  What did we do wrong? What can we learn? Let's go edit. Now it's a...

02:28:31,906 --> 02:28:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  Now it's a success.

02:28:34,210 --> 02:28:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  but those kind of ups and downs for the length of developments that we have.

02:28:38,114 --> 02:28:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  You know, people don't see them.

02:28:39,746 --> 02:28:40,478
SPEAKER_0:  but we have them.

02:28:41,122 --> 02:28:42,302
SPEAKER_0:  You know, all the time.

02:28:43,138 --> 02:28:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  And so...

02:28:44,386 --> 02:28:47,646
SPEAKER_0:  It's that sort of belief that, you know, with the team having done it.

02:28:47,970 --> 02:28:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  time and time again to know that

02:28:50,306 --> 02:28:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  Nah, we're gonna...

02:28:51,682 --> 02:28:55,294
SPEAKER_0:  we're going to make it as good as we possibly can and whatever we're experiencing now.

02:28:56,066 --> 02:28:57,886
SPEAKER_0:  We solve it and we get it out and.

02:28:58,146 --> 02:29:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  you know, we see the millions of people who love it, it's all worth it.

02:29:02,946 --> 02:29:09,758
SPEAKER_1:  And you're getting into new spaces. First of all, new worlds with Starfield, but also new, I saw the TV show you're working on.

02:29:10,690 --> 02:29:11,934
SPEAKER_1:  ahh...

02:29:12,738 --> 02:29:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  on Fallout.

02:29:14,274 --> 02:29:15,550
SPEAKER_1:  With Amazon.

02:29:15,906 --> 02:29:18,142
SPEAKER_1:  What's that like? World's the you.

02:29:18,690 --> 02:29:21,118
SPEAKER_1:  created in the digital realm becoming.

02:29:21,794 --> 02:29:22,878
SPEAKER_1:  going on the screen.

02:29:23,106 --> 02:29:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, people asked.

02:29:24,610 --> 02:29:27,582
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I can remember ten years ago after Fallout 3 was a hit.

02:29:27,874 --> 02:29:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  you know, movie producers coming and hey, we think this will make a great movie.

02:29:32,226 --> 02:29:35,582
SPEAKER_0:  and taking a lot of meetings. And I think most people would jump at that.

02:29:36,002 --> 02:29:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  Like, sweet!

02:29:37,250 --> 02:29:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  And

02:29:38,882 --> 02:29:40,158
SPEAKER_0:  I sort of paused and like...

02:29:40,642 --> 02:29:41,278
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know.

02:29:41,986 --> 02:29:43,422
SPEAKER_0:  What is this gonna do?

02:29:44,290 --> 02:29:51,902
SPEAKER_0:  I felt like they're gonna synthesize, I met great people, well-known creatives, like it's gonna get synthesized in this two hour, I don't know, I'm not.

02:29:53,282 --> 02:29:54,718
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not seeing the great.

02:29:54,946 --> 02:29:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  thing here yet so.

02:29:58,114 --> 02:30:00,766
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I think the advent of television...

02:30:01,506 --> 02:30:02,974
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of what it's become.

02:30:03,202 --> 02:30:05,406
SPEAKER_0:  you know, nowadays with big budget.

02:30:05,698 --> 02:30:11,646
SPEAKER_0:  TV series that kind of came up again and met with people and Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy who do Westworld and...

02:30:12,322 --> 02:30:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  I always...

02:30:14,242 --> 02:30:15,518
SPEAKER_0:  Love the work he did.

02:30:15,906 --> 02:30:19,281
SPEAKER_0:  uh... writing interstellar in the dark like movies i just love

02:30:19,281 --> 02:30:20,542
SPEAKER_1:  Nothing Owen's involved with this.

02:30:20,674 --> 02:30:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, he's the...

02:30:21,794 --> 02:30:24,419
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, he's the EP and he's directed the...

02:30:24,419 --> 02:30:25,278
SPEAKER_1:  Incredible.

02:30:25,474 --> 02:30:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, this is awesome.

02:30:27,490 --> 02:30:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

02:30:29,090 --> 02:30:29,726
SPEAKER_0:  See you.

02:30:29,954 --> 02:30:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  The EP's directed the first few episodes. Um, and when I connected with him.

02:30:35,682 --> 02:30:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:30:36,610 --> 02:30:37,150
SPEAKER_0:  Jonah.

02:30:37,698 --> 02:30:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  was like, hey, you're the person I want to do this.

02:30:42,178 --> 02:30:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  So I met with people kept saying like, you know, just.

02:30:46,306 --> 02:30:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  Let me see if he wants to do it. And to my joy, he was like, Oh yeah, fall three is one of my, yeah, sign me up.

02:30:51,330 --> 02:30:52,926
SPEAKER_0:  I was like, no, how do we get this done?

02:30:53,890 --> 02:30:57,246
SPEAKER_0:  And at that time he was sort of, he was at HBO and it was, you know.

02:30:57,986 --> 02:30:59,070
SPEAKER_0:  We're trying to figure out.

02:30:59,458 --> 02:31:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  It was put a little pause on it.

02:31:01,250 --> 02:31:01,790
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:31:02,082 --> 02:31:02,814
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

02:31:04,866 --> 02:31:08,830
SPEAKER_0:  You know, got to visit the sets, reading scripts and things like that. It's all new to me.

02:31:09,442 --> 02:31:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  Um, but I-

02:31:11,234 --> 02:31:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  they're doing such an incredible job. Like I think if you like this world.

02:31:15,714 --> 02:31:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  you are gonna be.

02:31:17,538 --> 02:31:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  blown away. Keep in mind I've never made a TV show. You know, those are all the best, you know, no one ever does it.

02:31:22,562 --> 02:31:27,262
SPEAKER_0:  wanting it to not be great, but they've just done their attention to detail.

02:31:27,586 --> 02:31:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  and obsessive.

02:31:30,594 --> 02:31:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  with what's on the screen.

02:31:32,450 --> 02:31:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  and the storytelling and how it looks the whole.

02:31:35,522 --> 02:31:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  The whole thing.

02:31:36,706 --> 02:31:38,462
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I think obsession is really...

02:31:38,946 --> 02:31:42,238
SPEAKER_1:  a prerequisite for greatness. What they did.

02:31:42,562 --> 02:31:44,510
SPEAKER_1:  HBO did with Chernobyl.

02:31:45,378 --> 02:31:46,782
SPEAKER_1:  like the attention to detail.

02:31:46,978 --> 02:31:49,342
SPEAKER_0:  And he's doing The Last of Us.

02:31:50,242 --> 02:31:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  that showrunner.

02:31:51,490 --> 02:31:57,115
SPEAKER_1:  If you really care and you really put a lot of effort into the details, you can...

02:31:57,115 --> 02:31:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  I was stunned.

02:31:58,978 --> 02:31:59,870
SPEAKER_0:  That they...

02:32:00,322 --> 02:32:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  Amen.

02:32:01,954 --> 02:32:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  I don't want to spoil it, but when people see it, I think you'll just be like, wow, it's the...

02:32:06,050 --> 02:32:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  The other thing we're approaching yet...

02:32:07,714 --> 02:32:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  It's very different where when it was, people would say they wanna make a movie, they wanted to tell the story of Fallout 3 than tell the story of Fallout 4.

02:32:15,522 --> 02:32:16,446
SPEAKER_0:  And for this it was...

02:32:17,154 --> 02:32:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  Hey, let's do something that exists in the world of fallout.

02:32:20,802 --> 02:32:22,334
SPEAKER_0:  It's not retelling a game story.

02:32:22,786 --> 02:32:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  It's basically, you know.

02:32:24,834 --> 02:32:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  an area of the map and like.

02:32:26,722 --> 02:32:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  Let's tell a story here.

02:32:28,802 --> 02:32:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  that

02:32:29,698 --> 02:32:31,582
SPEAKER_0:  fits in the world that we have built.

02:32:32,322 --> 02:32:32,862
SPEAKER_0:  doesn't.

02:32:33,154 --> 02:32:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  you know, break any of the rules.

02:32:35,266 --> 02:32:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  um, can reference things in the games, but isn't a retelling of the games that exists in the same world but is its own unique thing?

02:32:43,106 --> 02:32:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  what adds to it while also people who don't.

02:32:46,050 --> 02:32:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  Haven't played the games? Who can't experience like how?

02:32:49,122 --> 02:32:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  crazy cool fallout is.

02:32:51,138 --> 02:32:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  can watch the series and so.

02:32:54,466 --> 02:32:57,854
SPEAKER_1:  Are there some similarities or interesting differences?

02:32:58,178 --> 02:33:03,230
SPEAKER_1:  between the creation of a game and a TV show that you notice from the sort of story perspective.

02:33:03,746 --> 02:33:10,558
SPEAKER_0:  Well, for them, you know, it's much more character driven. Like you can do all these things with the world and stuff that we already have.

02:33:11,362 --> 02:33:15,390
SPEAKER_0:  It's the main characters, who they are, what their motivations are.

02:33:17,058 --> 02:33:18,526
SPEAKER_0:  really is the...

02:33:18,882 --> 02:33:19,390
SPEAKER_0:  engine.

02:33:20,290 --> 02:33:22,915
SPEAKER_0:  Right, there's no... Finding the right actors to do those.

02:33:22,915 --> 02:33:23,326
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

02:33:23,586 --> 02:33:24,894
SPEAKER_1:  because you're not, there's no.

02:33:25,282 --> 02:33:26,270
SPEAKER_1:  interaction.

02:33:26,946 --> 02:33:28,510
SPEAKER_1:  There's no, uh...

02:33:28,866 --> 02:33:31,358
SPEAKER_1:  You don't get to enter that world, you have to do the work for you.

02:33:32,034 --> 02:33:33,374
SPEAKER_1:  NPCs run the show.

02:33:34,242 --> 02:33:37,918
SPEAKER_1:  I can't wait to see how it turns out. You also mentioned Indiana Jones.

02:33:38,274 --> 02:33:40,062
SPEAKER_1:  That's a weird, that's a different one.

02:33:40,418 --> 02:33:42,846
SPEAKER_1:  How do you work with a famous?

02:33:43,746 --> 02:33:44,766
SPEAKER_1:  tagging it like a

02:33:45,346 --> 02:33:46,878
SPEAKER_1:  when the character is known.

02:33:48,258 --> 02:33:49,086
SPEAKER_1:  How do you work with that?

02:33:50,306 --> 02:33:50,782
SPEAKER_0:  Well...

02:33:51,842 --> 02:33:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  It's different. It's different. Like Indiana Jones is different where like

02:33:56,354 --> 02:33:56,990
SPEAKER_0:  the name.

02:33:57,506 --> 02:34:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  It is the, it's Indiana Jones, not a world, it's him. Right, you can talk about the world of Indiana Jones, but at the end of the day.

02:34:03,330 --> 02:34:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  it's about this character.

02:34:05,506 --> 02:34:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  And Raiders, still my favorite movie of all time. No debate, it's the best movie ever.

02:34:11,234 --> 02:34:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  Um, best movie ever. Ever."

02:34:13,378 --> 02:34:13,982
SPEAKER_1:  La-

02:34:14,274 --> 02:34:16,286
SPEAKER_1:  On a tangent, what do you love about it?

02:34:18,146 --> 02:34:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  Well, you know, I saw it obviously when I was younger and I believed it. I believe this happened. And when they found the Ark, I literally, I could not.

02:34:26,466 --> 02:34:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  believe that they found it.

02:34:28,034 --> 02:34:28,542
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:34:29,410 --> 02:34:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  and I have found over my life.

02:34:32,962 --> 02:34:37,854
SPEAKER_0:  It's still really watchable every time. I enjoy it every single time.

02:34:38,466 --> 02:34:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:34:39,298 --> 02:34:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  Love the character, love the story.

02:34:41,890 --> 02:34:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  The opening is the greatest movie opening ever.

02:34:45,314 --> 02:34:46,174
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:34:47,074 --> 02:34:49,699
SPEAKER_0:  I just love everything about it.

02:34:49,699 --> 02:34:50,430
SPEAKER_1:  What was the opening?

02:34:50,530 --> 02:34:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  Is this when the what? It's the temple and then the ball rolls and tries to crush it. Oh, that's the that's the opening of Raiders. Just mechanism powers are procedures.

02:34:57,474 --> 02:35:00,849
SPEAKER_1:  I think you're deeply offended.

02:35:00,849 --> 02:35:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  What's the opening at Raiders?

02:35:02,690 --> 02:35:03,006
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:35:03,682 --> 02:35:09,598
SPEAKER_0:  So I've always wanted to, it's one of those things, like what's on your bucket list, like, oh, I want to make an Indiana Jones game.

02:35:10,018 --> 02:35:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  and I had pitched Lucas, I had met some people there and pitched them.

02:35:13,922 --> 02:35:14,942
SPEAKER_0:  Back in 09.

02:35:15,810 --> 02:35:17,438
SPEAKER_0:  This Indiana Jones game concept.

02:35:18,882 --> 02:35:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  And...

02:35:21,026 --> 02:35:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  They wanted to publish, kind of the deal fell apart. They wanted to publish it and we were a publisher and so we didn't do it.

02:35:26,306 --> 02:35:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  And I didn't really have the team to do it. I just was gonna figure that out after we agreed to a deal

02:35:32,482 --> 02:35:34,686
SPEAKER_0:  And well, you know, we made Skyrim, so it worked out.

02:35:35,714 --> 02:35:36,958
SPEAKER_0:  and then, you know, fast forward.

02:35:37,410 --> 02:35:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  10 years plus and

02:35:39,170 --> 02:35:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  You know, Lucas...

02:35:40,834 --> 02:35:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  now part of Disney and they're doing a lot more of licensing and working with people. so I knew some folks there and said oh

02:35:47,010 --> 02:35:48,222
SPEAKER_0:  I have this idea!

02:35:48,610 --> 02:35:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  that I pitched a long time ago.

02:35:50,786 --> 02:35:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  and they loved it and again.

02:35:54,082 --> 02:35:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  the internal team that I had.

02:35:56,514 --> 02:35:59,134
SPEAKER_0:  not only didn't have the time, they probably weren't as g-

02:35:59,362 --> 02:36:01,502
SPEAKER_0:  good a fit as machine games.

02:36:01,858 --> 02:36:04,702
SPEAKER_0:  who's done the Wolfenstein series, who is the perfect fit.

02:36:05,314 --> 02:36:09,054
SPEAKER_0:  for this game with storytelling and how they record it. And they are.

02:36:09,570 --> 02:36:12,190
SPEAKER_0:  It's awesome, they're just doing an incredible job.

02:36:12,610 --> 02:36:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  with that game, people are gonna be...

02:36:16,226 --> 02:36:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  If you like Indiana Jones, it is a definite love letter.

02:36:19,586 --> 02:36:21,950
SPEAKER_0:  to Indiana Jones and everything with it.

02:36:22,434 --> 02:36:26,718
SPEAKER_1:  Can you say if it's more on the action adventure side?

02:36:27,426 --> 02:36:29,214
SPEAKER_1:  I like the extra experience of the game.

02:36:30,466 --> 02:36:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  I could go back, I would just say it is a mashup. It is a unique...

02:36:35,394 --> 02:36:36,446
SPEAKER_0:  It isn't one thing.

02:36:36,738 --> 02:36:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  intentionally.

02:36:37,986 --> 02:36:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:36:39,234 --> 02:36:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:36:40,066 --> 02:36:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  It does a lot of different things.

02:36:42,626 --> 02:36:43,134
SPEAKER_0:  that

02:36:43,490 --> 02:36:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  We've, myself and Yerrick and the folks at MachineGames have wanted to...

02:36:49,186 --> 02:36:50,750
SPEAKER_0:  to do in a game, so it's...

02:36:51,618 --> 02:36:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  It's a unique thing.

02:36:54,018 --> 02:36:56,574
SPEAKER_1:  before I forget who do I have

02:36:57,634 --> 02:37:04,094
SPEAKER_1:  How many humans do I have to kill? I mean, dragons do I have to kill to get myself somehow into Elder Scrolls 6?

02:37:04,482 --> 02:37:07,486
SPEAKER_1:  So mod, if anyone wants to create mods of me.

02:37:08,290 --> 02:37:10,942
SPEAKER_1:  And is that possible? Yeah, it's possible. Let's do this!

02:37:11,650 --> 02:37:13,886
SPEAKER_1:  uh... while maintaining realism somehow

02:37:14,722 --> 02:37:15,262
SPEAKER_1:  If you don't want.

02:37:15,490 --> 02:37:17,150
SPEAKER_1:  You don't want a person in a suit and tie.

02:37:18,338 --> 02:37:21,713
SPEAKER_0:  Doesn't make sense. He puts you in fall out. You can wear that.

02:37:21,713 --> 02:37:26,963
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, exactly. Please put me so far. There's also culture of

02:37:26,963 --> 02:37:30,046
SPEAKER_0:  mod where you replace the mysterious stranger.

02:37:31,426 --> 02:37:31,934
SPEAKER_1:  There you go.

02:37:32,930 --> 02:37:34,805
SPEAKER_1:  That's a to do task. and your

02:37:34,805 --> 02:37:35,582
SPEAKER_0:  mod right there.

02:37:35,842 --> 02:37:38,110
SPEAKER_1:  and you will have my deep gratitude.

02:37:38,626 --> 02:37:39,358
SPEAKER_1:  and more.

02:37:39,714 --> 02:37:41,310
SPEAKER_1:  Dear stranger, for doing so.

02:37:42,082 --> 02:37:42,622
SPEAKER_1:  Um

02:37:42,850 --> 02:37:45,475
SPEAKER_1:  What's the programming language for mods? Is it mostly?

02:37:45,475 --> 02:37:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  Their use our internal scripting language that's built into the tool.

02:37:50,722 --> 02:37:52,766
SPEAKER_1:  I'm almost afraid to explore that world.

02:37:53,250 --> 02:37:55,358
SPEAKER_1:  because you will never, never, never turn back.

02:37:56,994 --> 02:37:57,950
SPEAKER_1:  How long?

02:37:58,338 --> 02:38:01,758
SPEAKER_1:  You've created so many incredible games.

02:38:02,626 --> 02:38:03,742
SPEAKER_1:  Is there a...

02:38:04,290 --> 02:38:05,566
SPEAKER_1:  What does the future hold?

02:38:05,954 --> 02:38:06,846
SPEAKER_1:  Is there...

02:38:07,106 --> 02:38:11,518
SPEAKER_1:  So going through this process, do you still have the energy, the passion, the drive?

02:38:12,098 --> 02:38:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  I do.

02:38:13,250 --> 02:38:14,718
SPEAKER_0:  I cannot imagine.

02:38:15,458 --> 02:38:16,606
SPEAKER_0:  doing anything else.

02:38:16,834 --> 02:38:17,342
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:38:18,402 --> 02:38:22,302
SPEAKER_0:  I'd like to do it as long as possible. I will say though, as I've done it,

02:38:23,458 --> 02:38:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:38:24,386 --> 02:38:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  you know, soon it'll be 30 years at Bethesda.

02:38:28,066 --> 02:38:29,470
SPEAKER_0:  I've learned that.

02:38:30,178 --> 02:38:32,798
SPEAKER_0:  to appreciate the developments a little bit more.

02:38:33,634 --> 02:38:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  You know, that the...

02:38:34,882 --> 02:38:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  the time it takes.

02:38:36,738 --> 02:38:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  I should.

02:38:38,178 --> 02:38:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  I should prioritize.

02:38:40,354 --> 02:38:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  All of us enjoying.

02:38:42,306 --> 02:38:45,182
SPEAKER_0:  The development process more than I did in the past.

02:38:45,794 --> 02:38:47,422
SPEAKER_0:  was like, you know, just wanted to.

02:38:48,450 --> 02:38:49,086
SPEAKER_0:  The end.

02:38:49,314 --> 02:38:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  Is this all that mattered? Yeah

02:38:50,786 --> 02:38:55,134
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and the more you do it, you realize, no, I'm, I'm spending the majority of my life.

02:38:55,426 --> 02:38:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  in Tamriel and the Wasteland and Fallout.

02:38:59,746 --> 02:39:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  you know, the moments that we're all doing this together, we need to enjoy it. Like it's a lot of work finishing Starfield, but.

02:39:06,242 --> 02:39:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  Hey, we gotta enjoy this. This is like incredible. We don't get that many shots.

02:39:11,074 --> 02:39:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:39:12,066 --> 02:39:16,254
SPEAKER_1:  So the actual process of creating the struggles along the way of stuff not working.

02:39:16,706 --> 02:39:20,318
SPEAKER_1:  Like you said, at this point, I would start feel probably creating some of the glue.

02:39:20,834 --> 02:39:21,950
SPEAKER_1:  how stuff feels.

02:39:22,210 --> 02:39:26,335
SPEAKER_1:  and going back again and again and again to try to make the beginning better. All that kind of stuff.

02:39:26,335 --> 02:39:32,190
SPEAKER_0:  And I would say it for anybody's vocation, whatever you're doing. You know, whatever people do, you're going to have...

02:39:32,834 --> 02:39:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  harder times?

02:39:34,818 --> 02:39:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  And sometimes people, it's, you know, be out of.

02:39:37,570 --> 02:39:39,934
SPEAKER_0:  you know, maybe recalibrate yourself to like, okay.

02:39:40,226 --> 02:39:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  How can we make this more enjoyable for all of us no matter what,

02:39:43,714 --> 02:39:45,438
SPEAKER_0:  what you're doing and rewarding.

02:39:46,498 --> 02:39:48,414
SPEAKER_1:  So if life is a video game...

02:39:48,770 --> 02:39:51,198
SPEAKER_1:  most likely is, what do you think is the meaning of life?

02:39:51,650 --> 02:39:53,534
SPEAKER_1:  from having created so many games.

02:39:54,978 --> 02:39:56,286
SPEAKER_1:  or the character has to.

02:39:57,218 --> 02:39:58,046
SPEAKER_1:  try to figure out.

02:39:59,394 --> 02:40:01,886
SPEAKER_1:  I mean there's bigger questions than just solving the quest.

02:40:02,146 --> 02:40:04,446
SPEAKER_1:  You're asking big questions of why am I here?

02:40:04,898 --> 02:40:06,974
SPEAKER_1:  I feel like that's good practice for answering.

02:40:07,874 --> 02:40:09,886
SPEAKER_1:  same question for this video game we're in.

02:40:11,106 --> 02:40:12,862
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think is the meaning of life, Todd Howard?

02:40:16,450 --> 02:40:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  That was very-

02:40:25,602 --> 02:40:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  I can say what motivates me.

02:40:28,994 --> 02:40:29,534
SPEAKER_1:  good.

02:40:30,658 --> 02:40:30,974
SPEAKER_1:  Start.

02:40:31,746 --> 02:40:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  Having a curiosity?

02:40:34,498 --> 02:40:36,254
SPEAKER_0:  you know, the ability to...

02:40:37,666 --> 02:40:38,782
SPEAKER_0:  I'd assume a lot.

02:40:40,130 --> 02:40:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  and be curious about the world around you.

02:40:44,034 --> 02:40:45,214
SPEAKER_0:  It's more, it's...

02:40:45,506 --> 02:40:45,918
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

02:40:46,882 --> 02:40:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  Not the same as just wanting to learn everything.

02:40:50,146 --> 02:40:51,454
SPEAKER_0:  What makes other humans?

02:40:51,842 --> 02:40:52,254
SPEAKER_0:  Tick.

02:40:52,898 --> 02:40:54,366
SPEAKER_0:  How do they feel? How do they love?

02:40:55,394 --> 02:40:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  Might be cliche to say the meaning of life is.

02:40:58,146 --> 02:40:58,718
SPEAKER_0:  to love.

02:40:59,810 --> 02:41:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  Right.

02:41:00,514 --> 02:41:00,958
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:41:01,186 --> 02:41:02,718
SPEAKER_1:  So that curiosity is just.

02:41:03,202 --> 02:41:03,774
SPEAKER_1:  is about.

02:41:04,002 --> 02:41:06,078
SPEAKER_1:  I'm noticing the world.

02:41:06,658 --> 02:41:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  Noticing the world around you. You're whose ended here.

02:41:09,026 --> 02:41:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  There's so much anecdote someone says.

02:41:12,258 --> 02:41:13,630
SPEAKER_0:  Everybody has two lives.

02:41:15,042 --> 02:41:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  and the second one starts when you realize there's only one.

02:41:18,882 --> 02:41:19,742
SPEAKER_0:  and i think

02:41:20,130 --> 02:41:23,550
SPEAKER_0:  I usually preach to my children and everything else, like have a curiosity.

02:41:24,098 --> 02:41:25,150
SPEAKER_0:  to the world around you.

02:41:25,442 --> 02:41:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:41:26,082 --> 02:41:27,902
SPEAKER_0:  you'll have the most fulfilling days.

02:41:29,378 --> 02:41:30,750
SPEAKER_1:  Are you able to be inside?

02:41:31,138 --> 02:41:33,918
SPEAKER_1:  the worlds that you've created and be able to notice them.

02:41:34,530 --> 02:41:35,294
SPEAKER_1:  Like really.

02:41:36,322 --> 02:41:37,470
SPEAKER_1:  Like really enjoy them.

02:41:37,698 --> 02:41:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  It takes time. So like Skyrim had its 10th anniversary. So when I went back into it.

02:41:42,850 --> 02:41:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  I think I got to see it for what it is. My younger son got really into it a few years back on the Switch.

02:41:50,242 --> 02:41:51,998
SPEAKER_0:  That's what we know, people age up into it.

02:41:53,314 --> 02:41:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  Right, so one of the reasons it's so popular is...

02:41:56,066 --> 02:41:58,238
SPEAKER_0:  You know, people come in to, you know.

02:41:58,466 --> 02:42:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  They're now becoming, you know...

02:42:00,610 --> 02:42:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  teenagers and oh, okay, I'll finally play Skyrim.

02:42:03,618 --> 02:42:04,318
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

02:42:05,634 --> 02:42:07,422
SPEAKER_0:  You know, he got obsessed with it.

02:42:08,130 --> 02:42:18,526
SPEAKER_0:  And he wasn't usually I'd say, hey, check out my games. And he's like, ah, shut up, dad. We don't, we're playing other stuff. And he got like obsessed with Skyrim. Like we're having like deep Elder Scrolls lore conversations at dinner.

02:42:18,978 --> 02:42:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  Um

02:42:19,810 --> 02:42:20,414
SPEAKER_0:  end.

02:42:20,770 --> 02:42:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I saw it through his eyes.

02:42:22,882 --> 02:42:24,286
SPEAKER_0:  and that was pretty special.

02:42:24,994 --> 02:42:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  and then the mods he was downloading.

02:42:26,850 --> 02:42:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  the YouTubers he was following talking about stuff.

02:42:30,082 --> 02:42:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  The people who like the Elder Scrolls people don't realize how much of that I have watched with my son.

02:42:34,914 --> 02:42:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  And then I kind of when the 10th anniversary came out like, oh I'm gonna

02:42:38,594 --> 02:42:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  I have to check out the build out, but I hadn't played it in so long.

02:42:44,386 --> 02:42:45,022
SPEAKER_0:  does.

02:42:46,178 --> 02:42:49,022
SPEAKER_0:  it has this flow, we're like, oh my god, I just played for four hours.

02:42:49,314 --> 02:42:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  I need to...

02:42:50,690 --> 02:42:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  I need to turn it off.

02:42:53,378 --> 02:43:00,702
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean there's something about enjoying and joining against the people you love to or the the water cooler discussion

02:43:01,218 --> 02:43:05,310
SPEAKER_1:  and with kids. So I actually I would love to have kids and hopefully.

02:43:05,826 --> 02:43:07,102
SPEAKER_1:  soon in the future so...

02:43:07,362 --> 02:43:09,918
SPEAKER_1:  I guess the thing I need your advice on is...

02:43:10,658 --> 02:43:13,406
SPEAKER_1:  How do I time in such a way when they're old enough?

02:43:14,370 --> 02:43:16,126
SPEAKER_1:  right at the age they're old enough.

02:43:16,962 --> 02:43:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  Like I want to know when to have them so that...

02:43:19,490 --> 02:43:20,542
SPEAKER_1:  when they're old enough.

02:43:21,346 --> 02:43:27,721
SPEAKER_1:  That's exactly when Elder Scrolls 6 comes out. Can you give me a hint when I should have kids? Alright, nevermind.

02:43:27,721 --> 02:43:29,971
SPEAKER_0:  You are a genius at how to ask that question.

02:43:29,971 --> 02:43:30,430
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

02:43:31,074 --> 02:43:32,190
SPEAKER_1:  the number of times.

02:43:32,514 --> 02:43:36,126
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, you told the anecdote that your son asked you the same question.

02:43:36,738 --> 02:43:45,854
SPEAKER_1:  Um, but, but of course it's all for good fun. Uh, take as much time as is needed. It's a Skyrim is still an incredible game. It has an impact on millions of people.

02:43:46,498 --> 02:43:49,438
SPEAKER_1:  as do all of your games. It's
