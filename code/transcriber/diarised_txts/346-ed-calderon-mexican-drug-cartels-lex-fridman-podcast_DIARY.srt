00:00:00,098 --> 00:00:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  when it's quiet.

00:00:01,314 --> 00:00:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  That's when it hits ya.

00:00:02,914 --> 00:00:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  That's what I think that's what a lot of people experience when they come back from a conflict zone.

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the uh...

00:00:09,474 --> 00:00:11,166
SPEAKER_0:  everything that was life and death.

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:17,022
SPEAKER_0:  Everything that mattered, all the noise, all the chaos, all the people that are around you that would die for you, kill for you.

00:00:17,442 --> 00:00:18,398
SPEAKER_0:  you would kill for them.

00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:20,446
SPEAKER_0:  I'll leave.

00:00:20,962 --> 00:00:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  millions of dollars worth of equipment and stuff like that you were responsible for now are all gone and it's just you

00:00:28,898 --> 00:00:31,902
SPEAKER_1:  The following is a conversation with Ed Calderon.

00:00:32,354 --> 00:00:35,070
SPEAKER_1:  a security specialist who has worked for many years.

00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,526
SPEAKER_1:  encounter narcotics and organize crime investigation.

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,958
SPEAKER_1:  in the northern border region of Mexico.

00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,654
SPEAKER_1:  I highly recommend.

00:00:42,978 --> 00:00:44,958
SPEAKER_1:  You follow the writing and courses.

00:00:45,314 --> 00:00:47,070
SPEAKER_1:  on his Patreon and website.

00:00:47,554 --> 00:00:49,342
SPEAKER_1:  EdsManifesto.com

00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,806
SPEAKER_1:  This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:54,686
SPEAKER_1:  To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:00:55,074 --> 00:00:55,550
SPEAKER_1:  And now...

00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:56,478
SPEAKER_1:  Dear friends

00:00:56,802 --> 00:00:57,534
SPEAKER_1:  Here's Ed.

00:00:57,858 --> 00:00:58,398
SPEAKER_1:  I'll do wrong.

00:00:59,522 --> 00:01:05,854
SPEAKER_1:  What does your experience in counter-narcotics, investigating the Mexican drug cartel, teach you about human nature?

00:01:06,722 --> 00:01:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  Wow.

00:01:07,394 --> 00:01:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  I mean...

00:01:08,226 --> 00:01:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  First off, anybody can be God.

00:01:10,178 --> 00:01:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  anybody can be corrupted.

00:01:12,642 --> 00:01:13,918
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, you know, you...

00:01:14,626 --> 00:01:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  You work in that field and you...

00:01:17,026 --> 00:01:17,406
SPEAKER_0:  you.

00:01:17,762 --> 00:01:24,702
SPEAKER_0:  Realistically the training we got and profiling and investigation and stuff like that was basically you learn from the older guys there

00:01:25,378 --> 00:01:28,926
SPEAKER_0:  And some of those guys were already corrupted from the start. So...

00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  Trust no one.

00:01:30,946 --> 00:01:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  I remember seeing that X-Files episode where that was stated.

00:01:34,338 --> 00:01:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  you quickly learn that even if you are somebody that, to your own mind appears incorruptible.

00:01:41,474 --> 00:01:48,414
SPEAKER_0:  you know, small changes happen around you, wheels get greased, money gets put in front of you and or things get threatened like your life.

00:01:49,186 --> 00:01:53,310
SPEAKER_0:  And sometimes a payment for some of this corruption is just to continue on living.

00:01:54,082 --> 00:02:01,502
SPEAKER_0:  you encounter people that seem incorruptible, that go through FBI background checks, that go through all of the uh...

00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  the security measures that all of us were put through, polygraph test. And then later on, you know.

00:02:09,794 --> 00:02:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  turns out they were on the take or they became somebody that was corrupted.

00:02:14,114 --> 00:02:16,606
SPEAKER_0:  I think what I found out is that anybody...

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  at any level. They could be a very strong, hard to get person right now.

00:02:24,258 --> 00:02:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  people.

00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,686
SPEAKER_0:  corrupted through their families.

00:02:26,978 --> 00:02:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  uh, through need.

00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  Mexico is a

00:02:30,274 --> 00:02:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  place where a lot of uh...

00:02:31,874 --> 00:02:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  instability occurs.

00:02:33,858 --> 00:02:36,094
SPEAKER_0:  So financial needs, health.

00:02:36,354 --> 00:02:39,230
SPEAKER_1:  so a crack could form through the wall of integrity and then...

00:02:39,682 --> 00:02:40,414
SPEAKER_1:  over time.

00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,470
SPEAKER_1:  It seeps in.

00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:50,718
SPEAKER_0:  Mexico has a culture of corruption. Like, you know, you have your kid that goes to school at public school and you want him to be in the morning, not in the afternoon school.

00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  time period.

00:02:53,858 --> 00:03:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  You go off and grease the wheels with the director of the school. People hearing this in Mexico will nod their heads because this is something that happens from early on.

00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  So there's a systemic and cultural thing to it, as far as getting around rules. And this happens because the people that are in charge in Mexico, the government is.

00:03:11,746 --> 00:03:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  You know, there are tandem amount of trust between criminals and the cartels down there for a lot of the culture. So people don't trust the government and much less criminality.

00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:22,238
SPEAKER_1:  When you meet a person...

00:03:22,882 --> 00:03:26,558
SPEAKER_1:  sticking on human nature, do you think it's possible to figure out if they can be trusted?

00:03:26,882 --> 00:03:27,902
SPEAKER_1:  So you said...

00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,206
SPEAKER_1:  Anyone can be corrupted.

00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,470
SPEAKER_1:  You know, how long would you need to talk to a person?

00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,086
SPEAKER_1:  and you're even in your own personal private life, just a friend.

00:03:37,858 --> 00:03:40,254
SPEAKER_1:  or is trust a thing that's never really guaranteed.

00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:47,934
SPEAKER_0:  I think trust is never really guaranteed. I know a lot of people are going to say that's a sad way and hard way of living your life, but life experience is my end.

00:03:49,154 --> 00:03:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  You know, people change. You know, the dynamics of a relationship might change. I look at people's character, specifically their past and past experiences if I can.

00:03:58,562 --> 00:04:07,454
SPEAKER_0:  somebody that presents themselves in front of you as somebody, but you quickly learn that that somebody is just a mask or a persona that they kind of created for themselves.

00:04:07,938 --> 00:04:11,015
SPEAKER_1:  And they might not even be aware of the persona. Like is there some deep sex?

00:04:11,015 --> 00:04:12,318
SPEAKER_0:  stuff sometimes.

00:04:13,026 --> 00:04:14,302
SPEAKER_0:  I've experienced a lot of a...

00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  failure in my life. You can see it in my nose. You can see it in my lack of a...

00:04:19,618 --> 00:04:19,966
SPEAKER_0:  love

00:04:20,258 --> 00:04:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  a digit, you know.

00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:22,206
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  the amount of uh...

00:04:25,634 --> 00:04:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the amount of failures you can see in somebody and how they wear them sometimes is a pretty telling thing as far as them being able to be trusted or that you can trust their story or their experience.

00:04:35,906 --> 00:04:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  And when I say experience, I mean, I've met some criminals, like former criminals or, you know, some people of that background that I trust with my life, you know, because they're not reformed.

00:04:46,338 --> 00:04:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  But they figured out that that's not not a life that can live long enough to kind of continue on and

00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  And I've also met people that are in law enforcement that I wouldn't trust with my car keys, you know.

00:04:57,058 --> 00:05:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  because whatever persona they adopted over the years.

00:05:02,114 --> 00:05:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  is a pretty good one, pretty good mask. Sometimes such a good mask they don't even know they're wearing it.

00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:10,718
SPEAKER_1:  And on top of that, it's not just the psychology, there's also in your biology to it.

00:05:12,098 --> 00:05:13,150
SPEAKER_1:  I've been very fortunate.

00:05:13,634 --> 00:05:14,430
SPEAKER_1:  and deliberate.

00:05:14,818 --> 00:05:17,758
SPEAKER_1:  to surround myself with good people throughout my life.

00:05:18,498 --> 00:05:20,766
SPEAKER_1:  but I've recently gotten to sort of observe.

00:05:21,346 --> 00:05:22,206
SPEAKER_1:  close to me but...

00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:23,934
SPEAKER_1:  Nearby.

00:05:24,546 --> 00:05:27,518
SPEAKER_1:  somebody that could be classified as a sociopath.

00:05:27,778 --> 00:05:28,126
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:05:29,154 --> 00:05:33,854
SPEAKER_1:  and a narcissist. Like I don't wanna use those psychological terms, but just-

00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,190
SPEAKER_1:  It's like, oh.

00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:37,278
SPEAKER_1:  people.

00:05:37,634 --> 00:05:39,710
SPEAKER_1:  you know, come with different biology too.

00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:45,886
SPEAKER_1:  So it's not just like the trauma you might experience in your early life and all the deep complexity that leads.

00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,958
SPEAKER_1:  all the deep complexity that leads to the

00:05:49,186 --> 00:05:51,710
SPEAKER_1:  the psychology that you have as an adult.

00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,870
SPEAKER_1:  but it's also the biology come with the nature.

00:05:56,386 --> 00:05:58,238
SPEAKER_1:  that you might not just have the...

00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,158
SPEAKER_1:  the machine.

00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:06,302
SPEAKER_1:  that can empathize deeply with the experience of others, or maybe a machine that gets off.

00:06:06,754 --> 00:06:10,129
SPEAKER_1:  gets a dopamine rush from the manipulation of other humans.

00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  Or the control of other humans. Yeah, I mean, put an example of my own background.

00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,606
SPEAKER_0:  My mom didn't have a father.

00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:22,654
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, he left really early on in their childhood. You know, my mom raised.

00:06:23,138 --> 00:06:24,030
SPEAKER_0:  her two sisters.

00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:26,526
SPEAKER_0:  and basically kept a household.

00:06:27,042 --> 00:06:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, she was.

00:06:28,706 --> 00:06:29,470
SPEAKER_0:  But great, Mom.

00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:30,206
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:37,982
SPEAKER_0:  She was a badass, she was very independent. She showed me how to be independent. She showed me how to watch out for others and build me up in that way.

00:06:38,626 --> 00:06:42,302
SPEAKER_0:  And I had a great childhood as far as, you know, as far as.

00:06:42,754 --> 00:06:43,166
SPEAKER_0:  per

00:06:43,714 --> 00:06:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  and kind of like how she molded me. And later on I figured out.

00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  that uh... when i had my own kid

00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:51,646
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I...

00:06:52,226 --> 00:06:55,230
SPEAKER_0:  I figure out that she was basically trying to make me into what she didn't have.

00:06:55,618 --> 00:06:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  in a way.

00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  and if I can get to see somebody's parents, you know, that's usually a sign of something at least for me as far as figuring out where people are.

00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  I think there's something to be said about nature and nurture and how some people come up.

00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:14,558
SPEAKER_0:  Some people are just born with that predatory instinct.

00:07:14,786 --> 00:07:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  and you'll never know. I mean, they spend their whole life practicing how to hide it.

00:07:18,946 --> 00:07:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  But if you can figure out somebody's background, childhood, where they're from.

00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  can kind of tell something about them. I'm from Tijuana, you know.

00:07:26,882 --> 00:07:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  I'm a survivor. That's my background as far as where I'm from.

00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:32,894
SPEAKER_1:  culturally, genetically.

00:07:33,634 --> 00:07:34,686
SPEAKER_1:  psychologically.

00:07:35,362 --> 00:07:36,222
SPEAKER_1:  the full shebae.

00:07:36,546 --> 00:07:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I guess some people are born with certain...

00:07:39,746 --> 00:07:40,798
SPEAKER_0:  predispositions and

00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  If they're in the right environment, some of the negative aspects might flourish more than others.

00:07:45,634 --> 00:07:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  For me, I mean, I grew up skateboarding.

00:07:47,682 --> 00:07:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  in Tijuana.

00:07:49,154 --> 00:07:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  and I remember breaking into my first backyard pool.

00:07:52,386 --> 00:07:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  It was a house that I...

00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:57,438
SPEAKER_0:  cartel guy owned and we used to skate the pool in the back of it.

00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:03,454
SPEAKER_0:  So I learned how to bop open padlocks with a small vehicle.

00:08:03,842 --> 00:08:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  hydraulic lift.

00:08:06,114 --> 00:08:12,318
SPEAKER_0:  And I remember doing that. And later on in life, I got to train with people from other parts of Mexico. And,

00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  and work with them. And I remember pulling that trick off and they were like looking at me like.

00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:17,886
SPEAKER_0:  Where'd you learn that?

00:08:18,594 --> 00:08:20,062
SPEAKER_0:  like some burglars at Tijuana.

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:20,926
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

00:08:21,186 --> 00:08:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  And they're like, wow, that's interesting. Are all people from Tijuana like that?

00:08:25,346 --> 00:08:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  And I said, no, we're not all like that, but I guess in some way we are because, you know.

00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  Tijuana produces some.

00:08:32,354 --> 00:08:35,838
SPEAKER_0:  produces kids like that, you know, she produces like the environment itself produces.

00:08:36,738 --> 00:08:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  uh... produces a pretty specific person i guess you know where our normal is our normal or baseline normal is way different than most

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,686
SPEAKER_1:  The trajectories that you can take in life are.

00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,022
SPEAKER_1:  are defined in a way that aren't.

00:08:49,506 --> 00:08:50,942
SPEAKER_1:  available elsewhere in the world.

00:08:51,202 --> 00:08:51,550
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:08:52,002 --> 00:08:55,774
SPEAKER_1:  And so you develop, I mean, part of that is psychological, part of that is cultural and so on.

00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:56,862
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:08:57,218 --> 00:08:58,622
SPEAKER_1:  part of this is cultural trauma.

00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:00,702
SPEAKER_1:  but then also the ethical lines.

00:09:00,994 --> 00:09:01,918
SPEAKER_1:  based on the corruption.

00:09:02,402 --> 00:09:05,278
SPEAKER_1:  As I grew up in the Soviet Union, there's the same kind of understanding.

00:09:05,826 --> 00:09:06,174
SPEAKER_1:  that.

00:09:06,722 --> 00:09:08,606
SPEAKER_1:  There's some gray area of corruption.

00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:09,054
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  It's always there, like on the outskirts or even in the center.

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  how you can grease things to make things easier.

00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:20,414
SPEAKER_0:  and how it's like a personal thing. I'll just pay off the-

00:09:20,962 --> 00:09:25,182
SPEAKER_0:  In Tijuana we have a mordida is what we call it, when you pay a cop off.

00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  A bite means a bite.

00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:09:29,538 --> 00:09:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

00:09:30,434 --> 00:09:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  But what's out?

00:09:32,002 --> 00:09:33,127
SPEAKER_1:  What's the bite at-

00:09:33,127 --> 00:09:41,822
SPEAKER_0:  So you get stopped for a traffic violation of some sort and the cop walks up to you. Obviously you don't say the word bite, but it's like a slang term for it.

00:09:42,562 --> 00:09:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  And he asks for your paperwork and if you...

00:09:47,362 --> 00:09:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  get fined or get a ticket, you say, can I pay the ticket here?

00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  is what they say.

00:09:52,962 --> 00:09:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  and put their money inside the paperwork and hand it over to the cops. You think it's, you know, I'm just going to do it and nobody knows.

00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  But it's a systemic thing, everybody. Like a lot of people do it and then they don't trust the police because they are fed with this.

00:10:07,426 --> 00:10:09,982
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, same thing was in the Soviet Union, it's funny.

00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:12,414
SPEAKER_1:  But then there's something inside you.

00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,558
SPEAKER_1:  or that kind of...

00:10:15,362 --> 00:10:20,158
SPEAKER_1:  Those opportunities come with a police officer where you realize you can just pay a little bit of money.

00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,374
SPEAKER_1:  and get out of the thing.

00:10:21,794 --> 00:10:24,734
SPEAKER_1:  and then you realize you can pay a little bit of money or do a favor.

00:10:25,122 --> 00:10:26,718
SPEAKER_1:  to get your kids in a better school.

00:10:26,946 --> 00:10:27,422
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,598
SPEAKER_1:  But there comes opportunities where you...

00:10:30,114 --> 00:10:31,006
SPEAKER_1:  Where, all right.

00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,022
SPEAKER_1:  If I do this little thing.

00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,206
SPEAKER_1:  I can make.

00:10:34,882 --> 00:10:38,878
SPEAKER_1:  I can get a huge promotion, I can get a huge increase in my power.

00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:40,318
SPEAKER_1:  I don't get a lot of money.

00:10:40,738 --> 00:10:42,206
SPEAKER_1:  And something inside you says no.

00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:46,430
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, that's not right. Yeah. I wonder what that is that because like, um,

00:10:47,842 --> 00:10:55,486
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I want because it feels different than the legal systems of the language operate. There's some kind of basic human integrity, human decency.

00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:59,518
SPEAKER_1:  I wonder if that's like constructed or it's always there.

00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,095
SPEAKER_1:  Again, nature versus nurture.

00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  I think for me it was looking at seeing that in somebody else.

00:11:05,826 --> 00:11:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  that I kind of learned about it.

00:11:07,874 --> 00:11:11,454
SPEAKER_0:  There's a man that I consider a mentor figure.

00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,630
SPEAKER_0:  His name is Lieutenant Colonel Liza Oda

00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:20,190
SPEAKER_0:  He was a Lieutenant Colonel from the Army that basically came over and took over the group that I used to work with.

00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  He was incorruptible. You know, that was the essence or the aura that he projected.

00:11:29,602 --> 00:11:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  Um,

00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:36,670
SPEAKER_0:  The first time he went off on patrol, when he was placed in charge of us, I actually drove him around Tijuana.

00:11:37,538 --> 00:11:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  He was one of the lead from the front type of people

00:11:40,258 --> 00:11:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:11:41,922 --> 00:11:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  the amount of assassination attempts he got.

00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  It was basically a proof of how uncorruptible he was because they kept trying to pay him off. And when that didn't work, they tried to kill him several times. I think the last assassination attempt took the use of his legs.

00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,110
SPEAKER_0:  That man is still a dangerous person in my mind.

00:11:58,562 --> 00:11:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  But for me...

00:11:59,746 --> 00:12:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  and you know people can.

00:12:01,698 --> 00:12:09,790
SPEAKER_0:  gather a little bit about my background and where I'm from and some of the access I currently have to train the federal institutions here in the US as far as

00:12:10,114 --> 00:12:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  my background and if I was corrupted or not because there's a lot of that out there.

00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:12:15,682 --> 00:12:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  The...

00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  The Catholic guilt that's kind of built into some of us is always kind of there, you know. El cucuy vive bajo la cama. The devil was under the bed.

00:12:24,866 --> 00:12:25,182
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

00:12:26,082 --> 00:12:26,942
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  I don't consider myself Catholic, consider myself culturally Catholic, I think, is what I kind of say with that.

00:12:34,882 --> 00:12:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  I had a pretty good structure with my dad and my mom at the house and you know they never let me get away with it.

00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:40,158
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

00:12:40,514 --> 00:12:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  things.

00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:45,246
SPEAKER_0:  And I think my mom was a pretty big moral compass for me.

00:12:45,794 --> 00:12:51,710
SPEAKER_0:  but Lieutenant Colonel leading from example and seeing his work and how

00:12:52,770 --> 00:13:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  how much profound change he caused in the people that work with him as far as, you know, we felt supported and we felt like we had a guiding figure.

00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  during this.

00:13:02,434 --> 00:13:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  Tijuana was the most dangerous city on the planet when I was working there and he took charge.

00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,086
SPEAKER_1:  What does it take to be a man, Lieutenant Colonel?

00:13:10,018 --> 00:13:13,374
SPEAKER_1:  who maintains integrity after assassination attempts.

00:13:13,762 --> 00:13:15,838
SPEAKER_1:  Is it possible for a normal human to do that?

00:13:16,258 --> 00:13:17,383
SPEAKER_1:  or again as a genetic.

00:13:17,383 --> 00:13:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  That's an interesting question. I'll say this.

00:13:20,418 --> 00:13:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  Seeing him, I mean, the last assassination attempt he had, that took the use of his legs, he was with his kid.

00:13:26,946 --> 00:13:27,390
SPEAKER_0:  Aha.

00:13:27,842 --> 00:13:29,182
SPEAKER_0:  There was a recklessness to it.

00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  I can see that now, now that I have enough distance from it.

00:13:34,978 --> 00:13:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  I could see that there's a recklessness to being that way.

00:13:38,722 --> 00:13:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  And also you're putting jeopardy people around you if you take that route.

00:13:43,074 --> 00:13:47,998
SPEAKER_0:  So I think there's a sacrifice to it, a very powerful and hard one to make for a lot of people.

00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:51,838
SPEAKER_0:  For me, it was I wouldn't get picked to...

00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  get on board with some of the operations groups that I wanted to work with because I was known for not

00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,614
SPEAKER_0:  taking money or...

00:14:00,322 --> 00:14:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  not being trusted by certain older segments of the organization that I was with.

00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,942
SPEAKER_0:  with stuff because they knew that I wouldn't.

00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,350
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I wasn't on the-

00:14:08,866 --> 00:14:09,886
SPEAKER_0:  I wouldn't get money.

00:14:10,594 --> 00:14:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  So there's always a weird sacrifice to it and you're almost kind of like masochistic in that way when you...

00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  When you get approached with it, they're like, why are you being an idiot? Why are you driving around that beat up car? Look at the Hummer H2 that just drove in with the other guy that is doing exactly your same job.

00:14:29,986 --> 00:14:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  Society as a whole down there.

00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:40,894
SPEAKER_0:  doesn't reward it or at least doesn't see it in the people that don't take that route in Mexico you know for them is all cops are corrupt.

00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:42,654
SPEAKER_0:  all of them.

00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:14:44,994 --> 00:14:48,382
SPEAKER_0:  you know, seeing it from the outside. I'm not there anymore.

00:14:49,218 --> 00:14:50,078
SPEAKER_0:  uh... there is

00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:52,254
SPEAKER_0:  There's almost like a, why didn't you add?

00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:54,334
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:14:54,722 --> 00:15:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  that could have been easier maybe, or you could have been dead long ago, because people that are on the take down there are usually owned by one.

00:15:03,106 --> 00:15:10,174
SPEAKER_0:  side or the other and when that gets found out, you know, if you have somebody that you're paying off that hints you off of drug operations in the area.

00:15:10,818 --> 00:15:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  your rivals are pretty keen on killing you.

00:15:13,058 --> 00:15:17,886
SPEAKER_1:  Money aside, so like a hummer aside, how much of a motivator is fear?

00:15:19,074 --> 00:15:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  big one.

00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:20,670
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

00:15:21,122 --> 00:15:22,654
SPEAKER_0:  I'll say...

00:15:22,882 --> 00:15:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  You know, for me, I didn't think I was gonna live to see 30.

00:15:27,234 --> 00:15:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  And I was sure of it.

00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,358
SPEAKER_1:  Did that concept scare you or was that just a.

00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,150
SPEAKER_1:  as a principle of life.

00:15:33,506 --> 00:15:35,326
SPEAKER_1:  That's something you're operating under.

00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhhh...

00:15:37,026 --> 00:15:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  I lost my brother when I was 13.

00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,726
SPEAKER_0:  You know, he was 19.

00:15:41,954 --> 00:15:43,134
SPEAKER_0:  He was like the...

00:15:44,386 --> 00:15:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  the VIP of the family, you know.

00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  You miss him?

00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:48,638
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, every day.

00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:49,470
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:15:49,762 --> 00:15:50,366
SPEAKER_0:  kids are.

00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  You know, he was a, you know.

00:15:53,314 --> 00:15:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  skateboarded BMX.

00:15:56,002 --> 00:15:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  motorcycle hunter.

00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,423
SPEAKER_0:  one of the best marksmen that I've ever seen shoot.

00:16:00,423 --> 00:16:01,374
SPEAKER_1:  than you at everything.

00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:04,190
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, he was the best of us is what we would say.

00:16:04,642 --> 00:16:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  And when he died, there was a, there was, it was almost like a concert at this funeral.

00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:14,110
SPEAKER_0:  I met three of his girlfriends that all introduced themselves like the one.

00:16:14,626 --> 00:16:15,230
SPEAKER_0:  I w-uh

00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:17,598
SPEAKER_0:  to this day every now and then I get uh

00:16:18,146 --> 00:16:22,654
SPEAKER_0:  pull this eye down when I go back home and the, you know, Eric's.

00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  Eric's brother.

00:16:24,898 --> 00:16:28,894
SPEAKER_0:  despite all the stuff that I've done, I'm still, you know, every now and then I get recognized.

00:16:29,634 --> 00:16:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:38,942
SPEAKER_0:  That made my mom and my dad go into a horrible depression and basically left me to my devices when I was a kid.

00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:40,542
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  from 13 onwards.

00:16:43,394 --> 00:16:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  I had this self-destructive aspect to me after that, I think. It's not something that's come up in therapy after I've gone through all that.

00:16:52,194 --> 00:16:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:16:52,898 --> 00:16:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  and had this notion that if I can only die good in some way, shape or form or.

00:16:58,178 --> 00:16:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  for something.

00:16:58,946 --> 00:16:59,422
SPEAKER_0:  that it would.

00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  it would matter and they would kind of.

00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:04,542
SPEAKER_0:  look at me with the same reverence I did to my brother.

00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:06,430
SPEAKER_1:  So dying.

00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:08,446
SPEAKER_1:  isn't the problem.

00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,166
SPEAKER_1:  The goal of life is to die for something good.

00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, at least.

00:17:13,154 --> 00:17:14,366
SPEAKER_0:  That was my...

00:17:15,298 --> 00:17:17,246
SPEAKER_0:  That was my mindset going through that job.

00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:18,654
SPEAKER_0:  I don't remember.

00:17:19,394 --> 00:17:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  I was in medical school before that.

00:17:21,858 --> 00:17:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  second year medical school.

00:17:23,746 --> 00:17:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  was doing pretty good and then 9-11 happened.

00:17:26,722 --> 00:17:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  That wasn't an option anymore for me. The economy was horrible.

00:17:30,562 --> 00:17:32,382
SPEAKER_0:  I couldn't afford to stay there.

00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,446
SPEAKER_0:  I saw this ad in the newspaper and my big brother...

00:17:36,738 --> 00:17:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  who's still live in Hed-

00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,102
SPEAKER_0:  He's like

00:17:40,258 --> 00:17:44,478
SPEAKER_0:  You're not going to do that shit. You know, we wouldn't dare.

00:17:45,826 --> 00:17:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  And all of a sudden I was in a field having my hair shaved off.

00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,590
SPEAKER_0:  a bunch of the uh...

00:17:51,586 --> 00:17:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  Gafis, the guys that later turned into the Zeta Cartel.

00:17:54,914 --> 00:17:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  military were in charge of our training.

00:17:58,658 --> 00:18:00,533
SPEAKER_0:  I went through that process. And what

00:18:00,533 --> 00:18:02,942
SPEAKER_1:  field wore you and why is your head being shaved?

00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,662
SPEAKER_1:  and what the hell was going through your mind.

00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,486
SPEAKER_1:  What was the leap that you took?

00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  I was sold the idea of this being a new...

00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:14,846
SPEAKER_0:  Americanized police force that they were constructing in Mexico

00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:16,286
SPEAKER_1:  So, Elite.

00:18:17,026 --> 00:18:18,750
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. Special force, kind of a.

00:18:18,882 --> 00:18:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  prestigious elite, the people in charge of our training were a lot, basically ex-Mexican gaffa people, gaffas are

00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  what the Special Forces kind of originated. A lot of their members turned into the Zeta Cartel. so

00:18:33,314 --> 00:18:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  they were brutal in their training.

00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:42,302
SPEAKER_0:  We were sold this idea of it being, you know, scientific, like, educated-based.

00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  career path.

00:18:44,546 --> 00:18:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  And all of a sudden we're in this, uh...

00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:47,902
SPEAKER_0:  refurbished prison.

00:18:48,162 --> 00:18:52,350
SPEAKER_0:  that wasn't good enough to be a prison and they turned it into a training ground.

00:18:53,538 --> 00:19:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  And I quickly kind of realized that they were training us to be a paramilitary group, not a community policing organization.

00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:04,254
SPEAKER_0:  which in my mind, that's what I thought, that's what we're going to be doing.

00:19:04,706 --> 00:19:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  What was the hardest?

00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:06,718
SPEAKER_1:  process of that training.

00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,310
SPEAKER_1:  Because this is like a...

00:19:10,786 --> 00:19:12,958
SPEAKER_1:  Fragile innocent boy becomes a man kind of

00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  process. It's turning us into something that they could use.

00:19:18,306 --> 00:19:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  So it's a breaking down.

00:19:20,322 --> 00:19:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:19:21,378 --> 00:19:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  they break down the individual, you know, it's a...

00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:24,670
SPEAKER_1:  physically, mentally.

00:19:24,802 --> 00:19:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I think it's a...

00:19:27,714 --> 00:19:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  It's a half-done initiation process, I think, in a way, looking at it from now.

00:19:34,626 --> 00:19:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  into the past via.

00:19:37,538 --> 00:19:42,078
SPEAKER_0:  the shaving of the hair, the stripping off your identity, you know, everybody gets a...

00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  gets a number.

00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:45,214
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,934
SPEAKER_0:  the uniforms, the...

00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:49,950
SPEAKER_0:  running around and

00:19:50,882 --> 00:19:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  and being treated like human garbage.

00:19:54,722 --> 00:19:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  The first thing they said to us when we were lined up in that field was,

00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  There's bread and shit to eat here, the bread is over.

00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:06,398
SPEAKER_0:  which means there's bread and dick to eat here, and the bread ran out.

00:20:06,626 --> 00:20:07,262
SPEAKER_0:  a week ago.

00:20:08,162 --> 00:20:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:20:09,506 --> 00:20:11,006
SPEAKER_0:  It was, I mean...

00:20:11,426 --> 00:20:17,246
SPEAKER_0:  I can't equate it to anything in the military over here in the United States because people down there could actually get physical with us. I mean they could actually.

00:20:17,538 --> 00:20:19,870
SPEAKER_0:  and punches and shit like that which is...

00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  not allowed here anymore, at least in most of the military, as horrible as down there.

00:20:27,362 --> 00:20:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  The AK-47 is being shot around us too.

00:20:30,114 --> 00:20:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  simulate reality, basically causing hearing loss, that type of stuff.

00:20:34,178 --> 00:20:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,646
SPEAKER_1:  to chaos.

00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:39,975
SPEAKER_1:  abuse really challenging you again physically.

00:20:39,975 --> 00:20:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  And an open door there always so if you don't want to be here you can just walk out and the more you go into it

00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:48,958
SPEAKER_0:  time wise you're more invested you are so.

00:20:49,826 --> 00:20:52,990
SPEAKER_0:  in a way you're kind of building your own chains while you're going through that process.

00:20:53,282 --> 00:20:54,407
SPEAKER_1:  Were you tempted to walk out?

00:20:54,407 --> 00:20:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, several times.

00:20:56,226 --> 00:20:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  several times, specifically seeing some of the ways that...

00:21:00,674 --> 00:21:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  people that I thought were better.

00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  were stronger than we were walking out or quitting.

00:21:06,274 --> 00:21:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  Ah.

00:21:07,138 --> 00:21:09,598
SPEAKER_0:  because of something that happened in there.

00:21:10,754 --> 00:21:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  or with some sexual.

00:21:11,906 --> 00:21:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  assault stuff happening in there as well.

00:21:15,138 --> 00:21:16,094
SPEAKER_1:  Are you afraid of that?

00:21:17,282 --> 00:21:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  Always, you know.

00:21:18,818 --> 00:21:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  you're in a place like that and there's females in the environment and some of the instructors are...

00:21:23,906 --> 00:21:24,670
SPEAKER_0:  doing what they do.

00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  So that was like a cause for alarm. I mean, these people are in charge of our safety and education and look at what's happening here. So you could see some of the.

00:21:32,226 --> 00:21:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  the smarter.

00:21:33,474 --> 00:21:37,886
SPEAKER_0:  one's leaving, you know, not looking at this as a viable choice for life.

00:21:38,018 --> 00:21:40,798
SPEAKER_1:  How did that change those few months?

00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  I had this idealistic motivation in my head of making a difference.

00:21:48,258 --> 00:21:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  they drill.

00:21:50,402 --> 00:21:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  They drill a lot of, uh...

00:21:53,218 --> 00:21:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  Nationalistic.

00:21:54,818 --> 00:21:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  uh, you know, the flag marching.

00:21:58,018 --> 00:22:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  it being part of a group and the group being behind you and all of this.

00:22:02,306 --> 00:22:04,862
SPEAKER_1:  What was the nationalistic pride?

00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:13,223
SPEAKER_1:  It was in the nation of Mexico. Yeah, yeah. What's the vision of this great nation of Mexico that you were, did you believe that it'd get into your-

00:22:13,223 --> 00:22:13,630
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:22:13,922 --> 00:22:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  I got into my, I mean, it's indoctrination, you know, it's a

00:22:17,762 --> 00:22:25,150
SPEAKER_0:  It's a paramilitary group, so everything there is basically modeled after the military. So that's what they were trying to kind of instill in us.

00:22:25,954 --> 00:22:26,782
SPEAKER_0:  I was a...

00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,886
SPEAKER_0:  I was a team leader in there after.

00:22:30,114 --> 00:22:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  Three months, basically I was...

00:22:31,906 --> 00:22:32,350
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:22:33,634 --> 00:22:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  We went through a bunch of trials, physical trials, mental trials and stuff like that. Some of us were named team leaders.

00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  and I bought into it.

00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I'm the, uh...

00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  I'm supposed to be here, look at me, I'm-

00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  I'm

00:22:47,842 --> 00:22:48,958
SPEAKER_0:  I'm making headways.

00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:49,822
SPEAKER_0:  Mama.

00:22:51,138 --> 00:22:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  I'm sticking out a bit.

00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

00:22:54,594 --> 00:22:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  I was pretty proud of.

00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  what I was going through there, six months.

00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  then you get the reality check when you sign the dotted line.

00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,638
SPEAKER_0:  and how that none of it really.

00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:08,926
SPEAKER_0:  meant anything as far as what we were about to go out and do.

00:23:09,858 --> 00:23:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:23:11,554 --> 00:23:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  An example of this, we were trained with a 92FS Beretta.

00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  which is a 9mm pistol.

00:23:18,882 --> 00:23:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  Italian made.

00:23:20,802 --> 00:23:23,326
SPEAKER_0:  We got to shoot 20 rounds out of that gun.

00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  And then when we got out, we were handed a Glock.

00:23:28,034 --> 00:23:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  uh, 17.

00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  Which

00:23:30,754 --> 00:23:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  I've never seen one in my life.

00:23:33,858 --> 00:23:36,926
SPEAKER_0:  I was trying to figure out where the safety was and...

00:23:38,146 --> 00:23:39,614
SPEAKER_0:  A few other people there were...

00:23:39,842 --> 00:23:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  uh... handling those guns in a horrible manner

00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:43,166
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:23:44,418 --> 00:23:53,214
SPEAKER_0:  So we were very under trained under equipped and there was a lot of assumptions about what we knew and all of a sudden we were being cast into this the start of one of the

00:23:54,722 --> 00:23:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  you know, bloodiest and longest lived modern conflicts.

00:23:58,402 --> 00:24:04,702
SPEAKER_0:  in our history that doesn't get called that, but it's basically been an ongoing war in Mexico that...

00:24:05,954 --> 00:24:07,678
SPEAKER_0:  that is still to this day.

00:24:08,098 --> 00:24:08,958
SPEAKER_0:  amassing bodies.

00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:10,526
SPEAKER_0:  to the Mexican drug war.

00:24:11,362 --> 00:24:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  the Mexican drug war, which is...

00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:14,558
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

00:24:14,882 --> 00:24:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  It's hard to pinpoint exactly when it started because when I was going through training, there was already stuff going on. I went into training in 2004 and there were already, you know...

00:24:25,602 --> 00:24:33,854
SPEAKER_0:  major cartel related events all over Mexico by then, but not at the size or scope as I was about to go into.

00:24:34,626 --> 00:24:38,494
SPEAKER_0:  President Felipe Calderon took office down there and actually officially kind of...

00:24:38,914 --> 00:24:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  kicked it off by...

00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  putting the military in play as part of a...

00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:48,382
SPEAKER_0:  part of it is basically militarize the drug war, including us.

00:24:48,898 --> 00:24:51,678
SPEAKER_1:  Who are the major players in this drug war?

00:24:52,194 --> 00:24:54,046
SPEAKER_1:  So the politicians...

00:24:54,434 --> 00:24:56,670
SPEAKER_1:  The military, the police force.

00:24:57,154 --> 00:24:57,982
SPEAKER_1:  cartels.

00:24:58,434 --> 00:24:59,294
SPEAKER_1:  All Mexican.

00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,278
SPEAKER_1:  and the United States.

00:25:02,018 --> 00:25:02,814
SPEAKER_1:  China.

00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,126
SPEAKER_1:  Just the layout.

00:25:04,674 --> 00:25:06,110
SPEAKER_1:  all the pieces on the board.

00:25:06,786 --> 00:25:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  First off, there are giant local drug markets in Mexico that are fought over.

00:25:11,778 --> 00:25:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  you know, just local drug markets that are.

00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,175
SPEAKER_0:  huge in scope.

00:25:15,175 --> 00:25:16,675
SPEAKER_1:  exporting to other locations.

00:25:16,675 --> 00:25:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  Just a start. Yeah. Yeah. So a big problem in Mexico is basically those local drug markets and

00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:26,526
SPEAKER_0:  An example of that and one I have a lot of experience with is the one in Tijuana.

00:25:27,138 --> 00:25:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  which not only feeds the local populace, but also feeds the populace from San Diego that crosses down into Tijuana and buys their product there.

00:25:36,162 --> 00:25:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:25:37,218 --> 00:25:46,302
SPEAKER_0:  And now, you know, a phenomenon that's occurring now is marijuana trafficking is going from California down into Mexico because they produce better weed, you know, which is.

00:25:46,562 --> 00:25:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  Fascinating to see now.

00:25:48,002 --> 00:25:50,627
SPEAKER_1:  So there's already a channel and you're kind of reusing it.

00:25:50,627 --> 00:25:55,486
SPEAKER_0:  channel. Yeah, there's a lot of people in vehicles getting checked when they drive down in Tijuana.

00:25:56,034 --> 00:26:01,534
SPEAKER_0:  is being called San Diego South now because all the economic migrants are living down their own就是說 Apply

00:26:02,242 --> 00:26:09,886
SPEAKER_0:  90% of all houses in Tijuana, new houses are being bought up by Americans. So that'll tell you something about the impact and change that's going on down there.

00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  So you have these local drug markets that are being fought over.

00:26:13,954 --> 00:26:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  You also have these drug routes that go through Mexico, up into Mexico, around Mexico, through the ocean, under the wall, drug tunnels.

00:26:22,562 --> 00:26:23,262
SPEAKER_0:  over the wall.

00:26:24,098 --> 00:26:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  and on backpacks and on

00:26:27,746 --> 00:26:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  migrants that go up into the United States.

00:26:30,786 --> 00:26:36,414
SPEAKER_0:  Not only do the cartels make money off drug trafficking, but also extortion.

00:26:37,154 --> 00:26:39,902
SPEAKER_0:  money laundering, paid protection schemes.

00:26:40,546 --> 00:26:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:26:41,442 --> 00:26:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  You know, any mining operation in Mexico will have to pay protection, you know, or else they'll get hit.

00:26:46,658 --> 00:26:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:26:47,618 --> 00:26:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of times the largest money makers for some of these criminal groups are...

00:26:53,186 --> 00:26:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  protecting and taxing anybody that goes across the border.

00:26:56,322 --> 00:26:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  So that's also a big issue.

00:26:58,402 --> 00:27:05,406
SPEAKER_0:  And it's not just, again, some Americans think it's like the cartels, you know, they imagine this single or-

00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  maybe two or three groups, there's several out there.

00:27:09,442 --> 00:27:13,918
SPEAKER_0:  I don't have a current estimate, but last time I checked it was somewhere in the vicinity of...

00:27:14,306 --> 00:27:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  50, 70.

00:27:16,578 --> 00:27:20,734
SPEAKER_0:  different groups, some small, that just dedicate themselves to a single little town somewhere.

00:27:21,346 --> 00:27:27,166
SPEAKER_0:  there are armed groups that are basically in control of that area to some bigger federations like the Sinaloa cartel which is

00:27:27,682 --> 00:27:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  probably currently the largest and most powerful one in Mexico.

00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  and the new generation cartel which is...

00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,710
SPEAKER_0:  growing exponentially right now.

00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:37,662
SPEAKER_0:  So

00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  these criminal groups are players in that conflict.

00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  then...

00:27:43,394 --> 00:27:46,334
SPEAKER_0:  Another player that doesn't get talked about is politics, politicians.

00:27:47,138 --> 00:27:48,350
SPEAKER_0:  There's a...

00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:52,670
SPEAKER_0:  There's an ongoing discussion that has been going on, I think, since Trump was elected.

00:27:53,282 --> 00:27:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  about cartels being terrorist organizations or not, or if they fit that description.

00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,814
SPEAKER_0:  Well, you know, we are living through...

00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:28:04,002 --> 00:28:09,022
SPEAKER_0:  multiple assassinations on political candidates on New Mexico right now. And

00:28:09,442 --> 00:28:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  Most of those assassinations are motivated by...

00:28:12,322 --> 00:28:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  One side.

00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:18,878
SPEAKER_0:  sponsoring one candidate and the other side sponsoring the other. What I mean by sides, I mean cartel groups.

00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:24,222
SPEAKER_0:  So they have elected officials that are on the take. And this is we have, you know.

00:28:24,642 --> 00:28:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  many governors who are under investigation on the run or in prison right now.

00:28:29,282 --> 00:28:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  state governors.

00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  So politics is involved in it. That's a big player as well. That doesn't, you know, when you think about cartel problems, you don't think.

00:28:36,866 --> 00:28:40,190
SPEAKER_0:  Well, at least most people don't think about that aspect of it.

00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:43,646
SPEAKER_1:  So to have integrity as a politician in Mexico means...

00:28:44,674 --> 00:28:45,982
SPEAKER_1:  You have no protection.

00:28:46,338 --> 00:28:48,766
SPEAKER_1:  and under constant threat of assassination.

00:28:49,442 --> 00:28:56,990
SPEAKER_0:  We just seen the arrest and prosecution of the head of all Conrad Cartel operations when I was active in the form of Garcia Luna.

00:28:57,474 --> 00:28:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  who was the guy.

00:28:59,522 --> 00:29:02,334
SPEAKER_0:  Felipe Calderon who kicked off the drug war. That was his guy.

00:29:02,626 --> 00:29:03,262
SPEAKER_0:  Turns out he was.

00:29:04,002 --> 00:29:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  Turns out he was on the dig, at that level.

00:29:06,338 --> 00:29:07,678
SPEAKER_1:  Is there like a...

00:29:08,002 --> 00:29:10,206
SPEAKER_1:  spectrum of how on the take you can be.

00:29:10,754 --> 00:29:12,830
SPEAKER_1:  Are there ethical lines that you can cross?

00:29:13,122 --> 00:29:14,686
SPEAKER_1:  Some of it is money and then.

00:29:15,618 --> 00:29:17,854
SPEAKER_1:  Is it possible to operate in a gray area?

00:29:19,394 --> 00:29:20,510
SPEAKER_1:  that does not.

00:29:22,306 --> 00:29:23,934
SPEAKER_1:  result in destructive.

00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:25,342
SPEAKER_1:  ethical violations.

00:29:25,442 --> 00:29:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  I have no idea. I don't think there is, realistically. I mean, anything that kind of supports some of these groups.

00:29:34,114 --> 00:29:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  You know, you're supporting things of a horrible nature.

00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  Ah.

00:29:39,042 --> 00:29:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  There, I just posted recently on my Instagram account of a lady that was in Guanajuato.

00:29:45,442 --> 00:29:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  She's one of seven recently assassinated women that are looking for their...

00:29:50,178 --> 00:29:51,166
SPEAKER_0:  Kids, basically.

00:29:52,002 --> 00:29:56,254
SPEAKER_0:  There's a bunch of groups and organizations out there in Mexico.

00:29:56,514 --> 00:29:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  some in Tijuana that I've actually walked with.

00:29:59,266 --> 00:29:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  who are...

00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:02,206
SPEAKER_0:  taking control of

00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:04,542
SPEAKER_0:  trying to find the bodies of their kids.

00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  That's her up there.

00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:10,462
SPEAKER_1:  Maria Carmela Vasquez, a mother who searched

00:30:10,882 --> 00:30:13,470
SPEAKER_1:  our missing son was shot to death outside her home.

00:30:15,042 --> 00:30:26,590
SPEAKER_1:  On Sunday, her son, Osmar Vasquez, disappeared on June 14th. The 46-year-old woman is the fifth mother to be killed this year while searching for their missing loved ones. She was a member.

00:30:27,106 --> 00:30:30,398
SPEAKER_1:  of the Pyamore Missing Person Collective.

00:30:30,658 --> 00:30:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  there's many groups out in Mexico who basically have given up on trusting the government to find their kids.

00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:36,446
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:30:37,122 --> 00:30:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  the number of missing in Mexico.

00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,894
SPEAKER_0:  is.....

00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  debated topic because the government itself doesn't release those numbers or at least hasn't done a good job about keeping them and or releasing them.

00:30:51,234 --> 00:30:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  Mexico is a country that has industrialized body disposal.

00:30:55,138 --> 00:31:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  You know, in Tijuana we had the stew maker, the legendary stew maker, which is a guy that basically...

00:31:01,858 --> 00:31:04,606
SPEAKER_0:  use caustic acid.

00:31:05,026 --> 00:31:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  to.

00:31:06,082 --> 00:31:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  get rid of bodies at a.

00:31:08,706 --> 00:31:10,919
SPEAKER_0:  massive level.

00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:13,169
SPEAKER_1:  for getting rid of bodies and muscles.

00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  At least in Tijuana we saw that phenomenon and it's obvious that it's going on all over Mexico.

00:31:19,906 --> 00:31:21,031
SPEAKER_0:  Who's having those discussions?

00:31:21,031 --> 00:31:21,598
SPEAKER_1:  about.

00:31:22,402 --> 00:31:25,342
SPEAKER_1:  mass murder and getting rid of people. I've been reading a lot about

00:31:25,986 --> 00:31:27,486
SPEAKER_1:  World War II recently and there's

00:31:27,938 --> 00:31:31,774
SPEAKER_1:  was aggressive innovation on the Nazi side of how to get rid of a large number of people.

00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:36,062
SPEAKER_1:  For the longest time both the Soviets and the Soviets were more brutal with this.

00:31:36,546 --> 00:31:40,126
SPEAKER_1:  It's literally, it's a engineering problem of how you kill.

00:31:40,546 --> 00:31:42,430
SPEAKER_1:  a large number of people and get rid of their bodies.

00:31:42,754 --> 00:31:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  So the Soviets were more into...

00:31:45,858 --> 00:31:47,358
SPEAKER_1:  Just lame people

00:31:48,002 --> 00:31:49,758
SPEAKER_1:  Laying people down into the grave.

00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,414
SPEAKER_1:  face down and shooting them in the back of the head.

00:31:52,706 --> 00:31:55,454
SPEAKER_1:  and then doing that on my scale. So you just pile people on.

00:31:55,746 --> 00:31:59,871
SPEAKER_1:  And then there's obviously innovation with the Holocaust in terms of gassing people and all that kind of stuff.

00:31:59,871 --> 00:32:00,254
SPEAKER_0:  of stuff.

00:32:00,802 --> 00:32:02,974
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not sure exactly where these...

00:32:03,874 --> 00:32:11,934
SPEAKER_0:  Tradecraft skills are coming from specifically you hear discussions of Israelis training some of the cartel groups back in the

00:32:12,162 --> 00:32:16,510
SPEAKER_0:  late 90s, specifically the Ariana Fias cartel. There's a lot of stories about that.

00:32:17,218 --> 00:32:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  security specialist coming down and showing them things like how to make caustic soda.

00:32:21,794 --> 00:32:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  how to put rocks inside of bodies and then chicken wire them around and throw them into the ocean or rivers so that their bodies don't float.

00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,757
SPEAKER_0:  And when you kind of put rocks inside.

00:32:32,757 --> 00:32:34,257
SPEAKER_1:  of body to make sure the body doesn't

00:32:34,257 --> 00:32:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  So you open up the intestinal tract, put rocks inside.

00:32:39,266 --> 00:32:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  You cut where tattoos are, you take off hands and faces and throw them somewhere else.

00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  and you wrap them in chicken wire. To make it not identifiable.

00:32:48,482 --> 00:32:50,238
SPEAKER_0:  and throw them into a body of water.

00:32:50,658 --> 00:32:51,294
SPEAKER_0:  And this is.

00:32:52,162 --> 00:32:53,598
SPEAKER_0:  This is a horrible thing.

00:32:54,018 --> 00:32:58,814
SPEAKER_0:  but it's actually a craft. It's a trade craft. It's trade craft and it's a

00:32:59,426 --> 00:33:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  there's a link to the US as far as that Melladrait graph. You have to remember that.

00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  The United States had a thing called School of the Americas.

00:33:06,562 --> 00:33:07,006
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  and the CIA and they showed things and a lot of that stuff is out there in the hands of people that are

00:33:14,754 --> 00:33:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  of that generation.

00:33:16,546 --> 00:33:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  There's a manual.

00:33:18,306 --> 00:33:19,431
SPEAKER_0:  There's a manual somewhere.

00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:21,681
SPEAKER_1:  like with chapters and it's like how to get

00:33:21,681 --> 00:33:23,931
SPEAKER_0:  of the body. There's manuals out there.

00:33:23,931 --> 00:33:25,438
SPEAKER_1:  time constraints.

00:33:25,794 --> 00:33:27,486
SPEAKER_1:  or what are how

00:33:28,226 --> 00:33:30,622
SPEAKER_1:  Identifiable can the body be afterwards.

00:33:31,074 --> 00:33:32,949
SPEAKER_1:  What are geographical constraints?

00:33:32,949 --> 00:33:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  all that kind of stuff. I think that was common back in the early 2000s and maybe the late 90s when some of these things were going on.

00:33:41,218 --> 00:33:42,174
SPEAKER_0:  but they've lost.

00:33:42,402 --> 00:33:43,070
SPEAKER_0:  Even that.

00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  As far as respect for the government or bodies being found, right now, what you usually see is just bodies being burnt to a crisp and buried in a field somewhere. That's usually what you'll see.

00:33:53,218 --> 00:34:00,030
SPEAKER_0:  Some of the groups like this woman belong to basically taking upon themselves to go out.

00:34:00,578 --> 00:34:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  find clandestine graves in.

00:34:04,194 --> 00:34:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  the outskirts of the towns that they live in.

00:34:08,258 --> 00:34:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  I'm probing the ground with these metal probes.

00:34:12,514 --> 00:34:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  and seeing if the whatever they encounter in the bottom of these.

00:34:17,954 --> 00:34:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  These clandestine graves stinks or not. If they find IDs or clothing, they kind of gather that and they basically present it to the investigative authorities in the towns or the states they live in, which basically are doing their jobs.

00:34:31,042 --> 00:34:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  You know, over 90% of all murders in Mexico were never solved.

00:34:34,786 --> 00:34:35,998
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's...

00:34:36,226 --> 00:34:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  So they've even stopped trying to get rid of bodies in that way.

00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,230
SPEAKER_1:  How does a cartel?

00:34:44,034 --> 00:34:44,830
SPEAKER_1:  Take power.

00:34:45,698 --> 00:34:48,382
SPEAKER_1:  How does it gain control of this local?

00:34:48,674 --> 00:34:50,526
SPEAKER_1:  area that you mentioned and then grow.

00:34:51,234 --> 00:34:52,990
SPEAKER_1:  get take control of a region.

00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,806
SPEAKER_1:  And how does it do so in this?

00:34:56,322 --> 00:34:57,054
SPEAKER_1:  dynamic.

00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,870
SPEAKER_1:  relationship between.

00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:03,555
SPEAKER_1:  politicians and the military and the police force.

00:35:03,555 --> 00:35:05,150
SPEAKER_0:  It's a thing that happens over time.

00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  there has always been a big effort, even when I was in, to...

00:35:10,146 --> 00:35:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  or own certain members of the police force. Even when we're going through training, some people get pulled out during training because they...

00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:19,742
SPEAKER_0:  or found out to have some sort of parent or...

00:35:20,258 --> 00:35:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  sibling that was a cartel member or the uh...

00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  Their FBI background check came back negative, you know, when they were already in the training program.

00:35:29,538 --> 00:35:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  Um, so.

00:35:31,074 --> 00:35:32,798
SPEAKER_0:  I think part of it is.

00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  First off, they take advantage of the fact that Mexico is a young country. It's a country of young people.

00:35:39,234 --> 00:35:39,614
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:35:40,418 --> 00:35:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  We have a big group of young people that have.

00:35:45,026 --> 00:35:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  little to no opportunities to come up.

00:35:48,418 --> 00:35:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  When I was in when I went to take that career path a lot of my friends took the other option

00:35:54,466 --> 00:35:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  they went to work for some of these criminal groups.

00:35:57,858 --> 00:35:58,334
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:35:58,882 --> 00:36:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  So they have this going for them. They basically have a lot of bodies to hire cheaply.

00:36:04,258 --> 00:36:06,110
SPEAKER_1:  and leverage in terms of

00:36:06,434 --> 00:36:06,974
SPEAKER_1:  forcing.

00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:11,583
SPEAKER_1:  those bodies to do whatever is needed because the alternative for those people is

00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:13,758
SPEAKER_0:  There's nothing. No options.

00:36:14,242 --> 00:36:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  You have a kid somewhere who is working on a field, you know, or you have a kid like me that was out of the job, out of school.

00:36:21,442 --> 00:36:23,678
SPEAKER_0:  and the only options for me was...

00:36:24,354 --> 00:36:27,198
SPEAKER_0:  that in the newspaper, which seemed like a long shot or...

00:36:27,682 --> 00:36:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  going with some of my friends that had cars now and were hanging out all night at these bars and some of them had, you know, just...

00:36:35,714 --> 00:36:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  Draco, AK-47.

00:36:38,306 --> 00:36:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  pistols in their cars and it would look cool, you know.

00:36:41,314 --> 00:36:45,726
SPEAKER_1:  So there is a trajectory, there's many trajectories possibly in your life where you could have been.

00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:47,550
SPEAKER_1:  still operating.

00:36:48,098 --> 00:36:49,278
SPEAKER_1:  in a...

00:36:49,762 --> 00:36:50,887
SPEAKER_1:  criminal organization.

00:36:50,887 --> 00:36:54,462
SPEAKER_0:  in Mexico. I mean, there's not a lot of options, you know.

00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  Do you think you'd be good at it?

00:36:56,770 --> 00:37:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know. I mean, I'm pretty good at what I do now, which is teaching people how to detect it and kind of fight against it. Yeah, so I think, uh.

00:37:03,266 --> 00:37:04,350
SPEAKER_1:  I have a sense of that.

00:37:05,282 --> 00:37:06,846
SPEAKER_1:  the skills transfer pretty well.

00:37:07,138 --> 00:37:09,566
SPEAKER_1:  That's also the dark side of this whole thing.

00:37:09,954 --> 00:37:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of the people that I used to work with, you know, I know things and I have some training and I have some specialized training and I currently do, I've done, you know, presentations for the Secret Service and the FBI and...

00:37:21,122 --> 00:37:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  You name it, I'll-

00:37:21,954 --> 00:37:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  gone there and showing them what I do.

00:37:24,802 --> 00:37:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of the people that I used to work with who are out of the job are in the wind. Some of these people are way more trained than I am.

00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,686
SPEAKER_0:  It's interesting what the.

00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  The reason why I get so-

00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  get looked for and they ask me questions is because I actually have the experience that my university was.

00:37:42,978 --> 00:37:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  the most dangerous city on the planet.

00:37:45,186 --> 00:37:50,558
SPEAKER_0:  And when people ask me about some of that stuff, I could speak from experience as far as encountering some of that directly.

00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  Some of the people that I used to work with were way better at it than I am.

00:37:54,658 --> 00:37:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  are in the wind.

00:37:55,714 --> 00:38:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  interesting thing in Mexico, if you are of a police organization and you get

00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,070
SPEAKER_0:  fired or you quit.

00:38:03,554 --> 00:38:06,558
SPEAKER_0:  you are ineligible to join another police organization.

00:38:07,426 --> 00:38:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  that discounts you. So for somebody like me who is a professional.

00:38:11,586 --> 00:38:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  operations group member or police officer in Mexico of that region.

00:38:15,842 --> 00:38:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  There's no options for me outside of that.

00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  So they themselves basically have created this.

00:38:22,146 --> 00:38:25,950
SPEAKER_0:  inescapable box for some of these people that go into that line of work.

00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,390
SPEAKER_0:  What do they go after?

00:38:27,714 --> 00:38:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

00:38:29,762 --> 00:38:32,510
SPEAKER_0:  I've heard offers of $12,000 to join.

00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:34,558
SPEAKER_0:  some of the organizations out there.

00:38:35,298 --> 00:38:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  plus, you know.

00:38:37,186 --> 00:38:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  They get benefits, not like the government, you know? I'm still waiting for my liquidation check. This has been out of service for like six, seven years. I'm still waiting for my check.

00:38:47,874 --> 00:38:48,414
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:38:49,122 --> 00:38:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  So some of these people, it's obvious that the opportunities are presented to them out there are stronger, you know.

00:38:55,138 --> 00:38:56,606
SPEAKER_0:  And again, the youth is.

00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,134
SPEAKER_0:  what gets eaten by this war.

00:38:59,554 --> 00:39:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  And that's...

00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  one of the main things that they start with.

00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  Just the youth.

00:39:04,002 --> 00:39:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  We had a phenomenon in Tijuana.

00:39:05,954 --> 00:39:09,982
SPEAKER_0:  early early night late 90s early 2000s called the Narco juniors

00:39:10,242 --> 00:39:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  Nakojunas are basically bored.

00:39:12,322 --> 00:39:16,670
SPEAKER_0:  middle-class or upper-class families.

00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,966
SPEAKER_0:  had kids that were bored and they just joined some of these cartel groups.

00:39:20,802 --> 00:39:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  these cartel groups on them.

00:39:22,786 --> 00:39:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  opportunities to get into regular industry.

00:39:25,634 --> 00:39:29,886
SPEAKER_0:  to go through the family businesses to kind of establish themselves, use.

00:39:30,498 --> 00:39:32,798
SPEAKER_0:  some of those businesses for storage or.

00:39:33,442 --> 00:39:36,990
SPEAKER_0:  figure out how to use some of their transportation businesses for drug mueling.

00:39:37,218 --> 00:39:38,718
SPEAKER_0:  So this is how they start.

00:39:39,938 --> 00:39:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  in getting into different areas that they regularly couldn't.

00:39:44,258 --> 00:39:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:39:45,762 --> 00:39:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  That's how it starts. You owe somebody, they get into paid protection type schemes, which are also common all over Mexico.

00:39:56,258 --> 00:39:59,646
SPEAKER_0:  and sooner or later they start owning businesses.

00:40:00,322 --> 00:40:00,990
SPEAKER_0:  They regulate.

00:40:01,314 --> 00:40:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  some of their income.

00:40:02,498 --> 00:40:04,830
SPEAKER_0:  So they become part of the...

00:40:05,282 --> 00:40:06,846
SPEAKER_0:  of the local economy in a big way.

00:40:07,586 --> 00:40:11,102
SPEAKER_0:  I had this experience in Sinaloa where we were driving down this shitty street.

00:40:11,746 --> 00:40:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  And all of a sudden it became a cool, nice, curvy highway type thing. And I looked around there, it's like, this is a nice road.

00:40:19,362 --> 00:40:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  And the guy was with me, he said, Yeah, the cartels built it.

00:40:21,858 --> 00:40:22,398
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,862
SPEAKER_0:  You go to some of these towns and...

00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  The cartels are the government there. They build the hospitals, they build the churches, they build the schools.

00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:33,982
SPEAKER_0:  COVID happens, they're enforcing the mask mandates.

00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  They're out enforcing the mass mandates, the stay-at-home policies.

00:40:39,074 --> 00:40:45,246
SPEAKER_0:  They're the ones delivering supplies to the townspeople in bags, courtesy of so-and-so cartel.

00:40:46,114 --> 00:40:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  You know, so.

00:40:47,682 --> 00:40:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  They become the Robin Hood characters of their environments. If they're smart, these groups basically turn into that Robin Hood, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor, or at least that's the projection that they give.

00:41:02,242 --> 00:41:04,734
SPEAKER_1:  What's the role of violence in this operation?

00:41:05,154 --> 00:41:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  Ah.

00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:10,174
SPEAKER_0:  extreme. It used to be that there were rules, as you say, like...

00:41:11,042 --> 00:41:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  You know, don't go after kids, don't go after women.

00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  but all those things are gone now. You know, they had been gone for...

00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  decades, I think.

00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:19,838
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:41:20,418 --> 00:41:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  the escalation of violence. You kill one of mine, I'll kill four of yours. You kill four of mine, I'll go after your family because you are hiding.

00:41:28,546 --> 00:41:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  There's stories of...

00:41:31,362 --> 00:41:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  high-level cartel people getting there.

00:41:33,506 --> 00:41:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  sons and daughters murdered, mutilated in revenge killings.

00:41:40,002 --> 00:41:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's at a point where it spiraled out of.

00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  semblance of a rule set as far as who can get exposed to some of this violence.

00:41:49,058 --> 00:41:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  those highly produced ISIS videos.

00:41:52,162 --> 00:41:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  or they show torture in executions.

00:41:55,042 --> 00:41:55,550
SPEAKER_0:  Ah.

00:41:56,002 --> 00:42:00,414
SPEAKER_0:  according to some of the sources that I've talked to here in the United States, that we're looking at that phenomenon.

00:42:01,314 --> 00:42:10,238
SPEAKER_0:  They said that it seems to be that that was influenced by some of the narco blog videos that were coming out of Mexico in the early 2000s.

00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  Basically that some of these groups were the first ones that got wind of the fact that you can.

00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  export.

00:42:16,962 --> 00:42:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  Terror.

00:42:17,922 --> 00:42:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  or the horror that an execution has through social media.

00:42:22,018 --> 00:42:24,702
SPEAKER_0:  Way back when Facebook was a bit more.

00:42:25,282 --> 00:42:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  bit more of a wildland area. You could see these in news feeds, videos of executions, tortures and stuff like that coming out of Mexico. on Facebook.

00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,926
SPEAKER_0:  Way back when. Wow. This was a different time.

00:42:37,538 --> 00:42:37,982
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:42:38,594 --> 00:42:41,278
SPEAKER_1:  people who criticize social media in the moderation

00:42:41,634 --> 00:42:42,398
SPEAKER_1:  Is it tough?

00:42:43,106 --> 00:42:44,158
SPEAKER_1:  It's a tough job.

00:42:44,386 --> 00:42:46,398
SPEAKER_1:  because the brutal world out there.

00:42:46,722 --> 00:42:53,182
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I remember seeing some of these ISIS videos on Facebook way back when and they cracked down on all that.

00:42:53,986 --> 00:42:54,686
SPEAKER_0:  But, uh...

00:42:55,362 --> 00:42:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  One that's kind of clear and I'll see ya.

00:42:57,602 --> 00:42:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not gonna...

00:42:58,978 --> 00:43:04,542
SPEAKER_0:  say where to find it but people out there might have seen it because some of these videos get shared through whatsapp groups and

00:43:05,506 --> 00:43:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  chat groups out there. One of the ones that caught my attention way back when was a guy getting two guys getting executed by chainsaw.

00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:14,398
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:43:14,626 --> 00:43:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  you know.

00:43:16,866 --> 00:43:17,854
SPEAKER_0:  people can kind of...

00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,795
SPEAKER_0:  I can't imagine what that would be like, but...

00:43:21,795 --> 00:43:24,045
SPEAKER_1:  produced on purpose. Like it's videotaped.

00:43:24,045 --> 00:43:27,486
SPEAKER_0:  It's a cartel group caught two rival cartel members.

00:43:28,098 --> 00:43:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  and a way to send a message to those of the rival cartel is to

00:43:33,282 --> 00:43:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  Basically, I execute these people in front of a camera.

00:43:36,226 --> 00:43:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:43:37,218 --> 00:43:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, you can't get to your rivals, but you can.

00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:45,182
SPEAKER_0:  you can make them see what they're doing, or at least make their people look at what happens.

00:43:45,634 --> 00:43:47,646
SPEAKER_0:  if you invade their territory.

00:43:48,354 --> 00:43:50,878
SPEAKER_1:  So it's an escalation of brutality in the violence as well.

00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:53,598
SPEAKER_1:  mean, and that leads to terror.

00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:55,326
SPEAKER_1:  to a mass communication of terror.

00:43:55,714 --> 00:44:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I mean, you have videos of some of these people engaging in cannibalism in front of a video to see how brutal they are, or...

00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:12,350
SPEAKER_0:  uh... people taking out somebody's heart while they're alive you know and filming it and you know it used to be social media as a whole you'll see some of these videos they would

00:44:13,346 --> 00:44:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  put down in a few days.

00:44:16,578 --> 00:44:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  but now there's telegram groups. There's a...

00:44:20,002 --> 00:44:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  There's live leaks, there's a bunch of other sites out there that kind of disperse some of these videos.

00:44:26,882 --> 00:44:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  It's basically a bulletin board for them as far as, you know, hey, you got into my territory. Well, this is what's going to happen to you.

00:44:34,562 --> 00:44:36,126
SPEAKER_1:  Is there a game theoretic?

00:44:38,018 --> 00:44:39,262
SPEAKER_1:  way to uh...

00:44:39,746 --> 00:44:44,862
SPEAKER_1:  remove this kind of brutality to de-escalate the brutality because it seems like if a cartel takes

00:44:45,538 --> 00:44:48,094
SPEAKER_1:  power that exceeds the power of politicians.

00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:52,094
SPEAKER_1:  in a locality, there's a strong incentive to reduce the brutality.

00:44:52,834 --> 00:44:55,710
SPEAKER_1:  to crack down on this kind of chainsaw.

00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:57,758
SPEAKER_1:  executions.

00:44:58,050 --> 00:44:59,614
SPEAKER_0:  There was a recent leak.

00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  of government files.

00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:07,550
SPEAKER_0:  the Wacamaya Lakes. It's our version of the Wicky Lakes I guess.

00:45:08,226 --> 00:45:09,854
SPEAKER_0:  And it was mostly.

00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  documents coming out of the Mexican military.

00:45:13,538 --> 00:45:17,982
SPEAKER_0:  I haven't seen it talked about a lot here in stateside, but it's a pretty big thing down in Mexico.

00:45:18,722 --> 00:45:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  And in some of those documents it reveals how.

00:45:21,858 --> 00:45:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  powerless the government is. I mean as far as the military goes.

00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:25,630
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:45:25,858 --> 00:45:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  That's another player in Mexico, the military.

00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  the military.

00:45:30,242 --> 00:45:39,678
SPEAKER_0:  has been out in the streets basically doing a policing role since Felipe Calderon was in his administration. He basically militarized the drug war.

00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:41,406
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  Philippe Calderon was to the right of the political spectrum.

00:45:45,602 --> 00:45:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  and his main rival who was his way to the left is now in power.

00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:55,710
SPEAKER_0:  And one of the campaign promises he had was to demilitarize the

00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:59,774
SPEAKER_0:  the drug war to send the military back to its barracks and all that.

00:46:00,482 --> 00:46:08,062
SPEAKER_0:  And he's basically continuing on. And he just passed some legislation that basically keeps the military on the streets for a few more years.

00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:09,854
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:46:10,946 --> 00:46:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  And I think some of these documents that were leaked are very telling as far as why that is.

00:46:17,218 --> 00:46:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, we have...

00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  The military now has a vast amount of power when it comes to security.

00:46:23,426 --> 00:46:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  industry. I mean, they're in charge of building airports and train lines in Mexico now.

00:46:28,258 --> 00:46:28,734
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:46:29,506 --> 00:46:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  their documents themselves show how certain regions in Mexico who have a specific military presence.

00:46:37,666 --> 00:46:40,291
SPEAKER_0:  work for one side or favor one side of the cartel.

00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:41,406
SPEAKER_1:  They're corrupted too.

00:46:42,242 --> 00:46:45,534
SPEAKER_1:  So there's these military forces that are in part corrupted? Yes.

00:46:46,146 --> 00:46:46,622
SPEAKER_1:  and uh

00:46:46,946 --> 00:46:51,390
SPEAKER_1:  cartel who operates with violence somehow finding a balance between each other and no

00:46:52,482 --> 00:46:53,822
SPEAKER_1:  It just feels like...

00:46:54,402 --> 00:46:55,998
SPEAKER_1:  Throughout human history, there's a...

00:46:57,858 --> 00:47:00,126
SPEAKER_1:  dictators or leaders that come.

00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:03,774
SPEAKER_1:  into situations like this and really crack down on the violin.

00:47:03,938 --> 00:47:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, uh...

00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:06,750
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like that's not happening.

00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,798
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like there's a kind of a-

00:47:09,122 --> 00:47:10,997
SPEAKER_1:  Market of violence happening here.

00:47:10,997 --> 00:47:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  There's a systemic amnesia that happens every presidency in Mexico.

00:47:15,234 --> 00:47:15,582
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:47:16,386 --> 00:47:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  The president comes in, he has five to six years to do whatever he needs to do.

00:47:21,154 --> 00:47:23,422
SPEAKER_0:  and he does everything and as soon as he's gone...

00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  everything he did, even the...

00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  what was working.

00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:28,734
SPEAKER_0:  Good.

00:47:29,442 --> 00:47:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  chopped off.

00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:32,862
SPEAKER_0:  police organizations get defunct.

00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:34,814
SPEAKER_0:  or the names get changed.

00:47:35,266 --> 00:47:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  Uniforms change.

00:47:36,962 --> 00:47:38,270
SPEAKER_0:  So there's a lot of turnover.

00:47:38,818 --> 00:47:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, everywhere. Every five years federally, there's a turnover.

00:47:41,986 --> 00:47:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  and that things change.

00:47:43,522 --> 00:47:45,182
SPEAKER_1:  What about the cartels? Do they persist?

00:47:45,602 --> 00:47:47,198
SPEAKER_1:  the leadership persist.

00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, the Sina Law Cartel has had a figurehead.

00:47:52,226 --> 00:47:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  behind it since the 80s, the same one.

00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:55,454
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

00:47:56,194 --> 00:48:03,678
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's a federation of smaller cartels that are all kind of linked up, but that pretty much historically was considered the head of the Sino-Lock Cartel.

00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  Omaya Sambhata has been there since, you know.

00:48:07,394 --> 00:48:11,070
SPEAKER_0:  since the 80s. So in a way, yeah, he's persisting.

00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:12,990
SPEAKER_0:  He's surviving all of these, uh...

00:48:13,634 --> 00:48:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  presidencies.

00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  Again, these documents that were leaked are a clear sign of.

00:48:19,586 --> 00:48:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  what strengths and weaknesses there are as far as the government's main weapon against some of these criminal group which is the military.

00:48:27,042 --> 00:48:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  and if people doubt.

00:48:28,994 --> 00:48:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  this. They can look it up now online because all these documents are out there. But you know, just a clear thing.

00:48:36,066 --> 00:48:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  the Mexican

00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  Navy or the marina doesn't work with the Mexican army. They don't speak to each other.

00:48:41,858 --> 00:48:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  So that should tell you everything you need to know as far as trust.

00:48:46,146 --> 00:48:48,990
SPEAKER_1:  That could be just bureaucratic dysfunction. They don't trust each other.

00:48:49,698 --> 00:48:51,486
SPEAKER_1:  Are they both struggling with the co-

00:48:51,682 --> 00:48:52,510
SPEAKER_0:  problem of corruption.

00:48:53,058 --> 00:48:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  some of these documents that are already out there talk about the ports in Mexico.

00:48:59,074 --> 00:49:05,918
SPEAKER_0:  which are probably the main conduit of precursors of methamphetamines and precursors of things like fentanyl into the country.

00:49:06,594 --> 00:49:08,894
SPEAKER_0:  They're operated and guarded by the marina.

00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  So these things are happening under their watch.

00:49:13,698 --> 00:49:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  then you get talks about the army in certain places, basically working,

00:49:19,586 --> 00:49:26,686
SPEAKER_0:  uh... counter cartel operations on to to specifically one side not not another you know as far as the rival groups out there

00:49:27,554 --> 00:49:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  And we have a long history of some of these military groups going rogue. Los Etas are a prime example of this. These special forces units that basically...

00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:40,606
SPEAKER_0:  turned around and went to work as bodyguards for the golf cartel.

00:49:41,634 --> 00:49:42,494
SPEAKER_0:  Decided to...

00:49:42,722 --> 00:49:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  But what they basically did was an internship with a cartel.

00:49:46,466 --> 00:49:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  They went out there, did bodyguarding for the golf cartel.

00:49:50,562 --> 00:49:54,334
SPEAKER_0:  and then realize they can do a better job than they were doing, so they start their own.

00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:58,686
SPEAKER_0:  barking off one of these, again, one of the bloodiest, kind of like a

00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,662
SPEAKER_0:  internal cartel wars in Mexico's history.

00:50:02,786 --> 00:50:12,446
SPEAKER_0:  Who was El Chapo? El Chapo was a part of the leadership, or at least a faction of the leadership in the cartel. A faction of small organizations.

00:50:13,122 --> 00:50:20,638
SPEAKER_0:  basically families or organizations that conform this larger group, which is the Sinaloa cartel that is based out of Sinaloa.

00:50:21,314 --> 00:50:22,814
SPEAKER_0:  basically, uh...

00:50:23,714 --> 00:50:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  They are people that...

00:50:25,666 --> 00:50:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  have family and power nucleuses there in Sinaloa.

00:50:31,234 --> 00:50:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  Who was he? I think he was a high-level operator for the scene in La Carte. He had his own drug routes, his own networks, his family. His family nucleus down there is still in control of...

00:50:43,074 --> 00:50:44,318
SPEAKER_0:  of those operations so

00:50:44,802 --> 00:50:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  his arrest really didn't change anything.

00:50:47,394 --> 00:50:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:50:48,194 --> 00:50:49,470
SPEAKER_0:  But he wasn't the...

00:50:49,698 --> 00:50:52,638
SPEAKER_0:  mastermind, number one leader that I think...

00:50:53,666 --> 00:50:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  the media and the government kind of portrayed him as.

00:50:56,642 --> 00:50:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  Who was the mastermind?

00:50:58,658 --> 00:50:59,326
SPEAKER_0:  If you...

00:50:59,554 --> 00:51:03,902
SPEAKER_0:  go down there and you read what most of the

00:51:04,482 --> 00:51:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  brave journalist in Mexico that we have.

00:51:08,002 --> 00:51:12,382
SPEAKER_0:  I'd say another aspect of this war is that a lot of journalists get killed. I think Mexico has a...

00:51:12,738 --> 00:51:14,686
SPEAKER_0:  I think has some of the top numbers in the world.

00:51:15,874 --> 00:51:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  This is not no secret to anybody. El Mayo Zambada is the name of the historical.

00:51:22,114 --> 00:51:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  figurehead of this cartel or at least

00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:25,534
SPEAKER_0:  Somebody who?

00:51:25,922 --> 00:51:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  people theorize or suspect to be the...

00:51:28,802 --> 00:51:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  the main guy or the main person that is in charge of some of the sub-discriminal group as well.

00:51:34,946 --> 00:51:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  That's the going rumor that he's still very much alive. The interesting thing about him is that he learned his craft in Los Angeles.

00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:51:41,922 --> 00:51:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  people thinking that scene in the lower cartel isn't a Mexican thing.

00:51:46,178 --> 00:51:49,918
SPEAKER_0:  He apparently learned a lot of his craft from...

00:51:50,242 --> 00:51:52,117
SPEAKER_0:  people in the United States.

00:51:52,117 --> 00:51:55,867
SPEAKER_1:  And that's the craft of leadership, the craft of business, the craft of witchcraft.

00:51:55,867 --> 00:52:03,390
SPEAKER_0:  The craft of getting a product from Colombia, putting it through Mexico. And the logistics. The logistics part of it.

00:52:05,794 --> 00:52:09,022
SPEAKER_1:  And he somehow is...

00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:12,935
SPEAKER_1:  Operating in the shadows, so he's not a known and

00:52:12,935 --> 00:52:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  I don't have a clear number of this, but he was interviewed by a magazine called Proceso in Mexico.

00:52:18,722 --> 00:52:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  and some pictures were taken of him.

00:52:20,866 --> 00:52:25,214
SPEAKER_0:  This was over 10 years ago, probably, and that's the last time anybody's ever seen a picture of them.

00:52:25,666 --> 00:52:27,742
SPEAKER_1:  What's it like to be a journalist in that?

00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, can a journalist have a conversation with him?

00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  and live. Nonetheless, he asks to have that conversation. I think he...

00:52:35,362 --> 00:52:36,094
SPEAKER_0:  He reached out.

00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  to this journalist to talk about it.

00:52:38,786 --> 00:52:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  There's a...

00:52:40,738 --> 00:52:45,022
SPEAKER_0:  There's a media wing to the work that we do, a sister page called Demo Lair.

00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  and it's run by some pretty good people.

00:52:50,338 --> 00:52:57,406
SPEAKER_0:  The way we met is that I was basically training them how to work in hostile environments. And they were like, oh, we're going to go report on cartel activity in Mexico.

00:52:58,498 --> 00:52:59,550
SPEAKER_0:  And I was like...

00:53:00,034 --> 00:53:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  You know, that is.

00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  A year and a half ago, a reporter went to the president's daily briefing.

00:53:08,034 --> 00:53:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  press conference that he has. They call them La Mayoneras.

00:53:11,682 --> 00:53:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  President Manuel Lopez Obrador.

00:53:14,978 --> 00:53:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  and told him to his face, like, I have threats on my life, they're trying to kill me.

00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  And it happened.

00:53:23,106 --> 00:53:23,966
SPEAKER_0:  There's been a slew of-

00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:28,670
SPEAKER_0:  assassinations and murders of members of the press all over Mexico. It's not an easy job.

00:53:28,898 --> 00:53:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  Uh-huh.

00:53:30,338 --> 00:53:30,910
SPEAKER_0:  Either.

00:53:31,298 --> 00:53:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  They say too much.

00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  or they say things that favor one side or the other, which is another aspect of it that is interesting. I don't-

00:53:39,042 --> 00:53:42,846
SPEAKER_0:  I don't consider myself a reporter. I don't report on the news in Mexico. I have.

00:53:43,106 --> 00:53:44,574
SPEAKER_0:  friends that do that very well.

00:53:45,282 --> 00:53:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  commentate on some of it only.

00:53:47,298 --> 00:53:53,278
SPEAKER_0:  But you see a lot of these cartel reporters go down there, talk to a specific side and basically...

00:53:53,762 --> 00:53:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  speak one side of the story and that is not something that the other side wants.

00:53:58,402 --> 00:53:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  you know, if you're...

00:54:00,226 --> 00:54:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  If you go down there and speak to one side, you're saying what they want people to know or hear. In a way, you're spreading some of their cartel propaganda.

00:54:08,258 --> 00:54:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  And that's how some people.

00:54:10,498 --> 00:54:11,454
SPEAKER_0:  you know, get shot.

00:54:12,162 --> 00:54:13,214
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think it's possible?

00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:17,470
SPEAKER_1:  to go in there and have a conversation.

00:54:18,274 --> 00:54:19,358
SPEAKER_1:  with a cartel leader.

00:54:20,194 --> 00:54:21,822
SPEAKER_1:  Or somebody like me.

00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:23,422
SPEAKER_1:  for something like champagne.

00:54:23,842 --> 00:54:27,390
SPEAKER_0:  This is what I will say after that whole Sean Penn thing.

00:54:27,906 --> 00:54:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  I think a lot of people would reconsider a meeting with anybody of any level that has any variety here in the United States. They wouldn't trust anybody to get that close.

00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:54:37,954 --> 00:54:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  There are people out there that will talk to reporters and help people that are working on a

00:54:41,442 --> 00:54:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  on a laboratory somewhere in a hillside somewhere down south in the Sierra.

00:54:46,754 --> 00:54:56,478
SPEAKER_0:  low-level people that get authorization to speak to reporters and stuff like that, but they don't say anything that isn't being taught or shown in various different ways or outlets out there for them.

00:54:56,962 --> 00:55:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, some of these guys have Instagram accounts, you know, some of these guys said blog about it, you know, but not the leaders, Tik Tok, no, not the leaders.

00:55:03,778 --> 00:55:04,190
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

00:55:04,514 --> 00:55:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  after what happened to Ojapa Guzman. I think that opportunity, that win that was closed for some of the leadership down there.

00:55:13,538 --> 00:55:14,078
SPEAKER_1:  I think.

00:55:14,306 --> 00:55:17,182
SPEAKER_1:  I disagree. I think they're just more sensitive.

00:55:18,306 --> 00:55:21,246
SPEAKER_1:  realizing that there has to be a deep trust.

00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:23,070
SPEAKER_1:  It's not just anybody.

00:55:23,298 --> 00:55:26,046
SPEAKER_1:  and not any high profile. I've gotten a chance to speak.

00:55:26,434 --> 00:55:29,438
SPEAKER_1:  to some very high profile leaders that don't speak to journalists.

00:55:30,082 --> 00:55:32,542
SPEAKER_1:  and they understand the value of trust.

00:55:33,666 --> 00:55:36,734
SPEAKER_0:  if they have something to say, which I don't think they do.

00:55:36,962 --> 00:55:37,374
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:39,614
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think they at least unless

00:55:40,162 --> 00:55:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  at some point in the future, which is something I suspect might be coming.

00:55:44,898 --> 00:55:46,750
SPEAKER_0:  that there is some sort of.

00:55:47,298 --> 00:55:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  armed intervention and or external attack on some of these criminal groups.

00:55:53,218 --> 00:55:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  that really puts the pressure on them.

00:55:55,874 --> 00:55:57,214
SPEAKER_1:  You don't think there's a...

00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:59,070
SPEAKER_1:  human aspect to this.

00:55:59,458 --> 00:56:00,958
SPEAKER_1:  of a human being wanting.

00:56:01,442 --> 00:56:02,718
SPEAKER_1:  their story to be known.

00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:03,966
SPEAKER_1:  versus

00:56:04,418 --> 00:56:07,838
SPEAKER_1:  versus this is different than the propaganda machine of.

00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:09,694
SPEAKER_1:  I have something to say, I have-

00:56:10,274 --> 00:56:14,142
SPEAKER_1:  some message to put out there to play the game of politics and power.

00:56:14,594 --> 00:56:18,878
SPEAKER_1:  and money and all that kind of stuff. Isn't there also a human being underneath all that armor?

00:56:20,674 --> 00:56:23,038
SPEAKER_1:  for the sake of perhaps ego.

00:56:23,298 --> 00:56:25,319
SPEAKER_1:  legacy wants to be a

00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:27,742
SPEAKER_0:  I think in a way they already do that.

00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  There's corridos, which are basically Mexican folk songs that get sung about some of them. So in a way...

00:56:35,234 --> 00:56:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  some of these singers.

00:56:37,442 --> 00:56:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  are reporting on some of their lives. And it's like a, it's a great honor to have a corrido made about you. Somebody made a corrido about me based on my interviews. I didn't pay for it, so it's a real one.

00:56:48,578 --> 00:56:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:56:49,026 --> 00:56:52,478
SPEAKER_1:  It feels cool. So creating a myth, the legend of the man.

00:56:53,442 --> 00:56:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's about...

00:56:55,522 --> 00:56:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  I think a way you can.

00:56:56,898 --> 00:56:58,878
SPEAKER_0:  you can find somebody like that is.

00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:03,358
SPEAKER_0:  somebody that wants to get their story specifically clear and straight.

00:57:04,002 --> 00:57:04,798
SPEAKER_0:  You know

00:57:06,306 --> 00:57:07,454
SPEAKER_0:  coming from that culture.

00:57:07,714 --> 00:57:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:57:08,706 --> 00:57:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  getting to work for the government down there and then not being not working for the government down there.

00:57:13,602 --> 00:57:18,974
SPEAKER_0:  and being on the outside, being critical of not only the government that is in place now, but also the government that I actually work with.

00:57:19,682 --> 00:57:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  I can tell you that there's villains all over the place down there. Everybody's a villain.

00:57:24,354 --> 00:57:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  at all levels in some way, shape, or form. And some of these people.

00:57:28,802 --> 00:57:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  I think in a way including El Chapo.

00:57:30,754 --> 00:57:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  I think that some of that meeting was about.

00:57:33,538 --> 00:57:37,470
SPEAKER_0:  film rights and stories and being able to get his story out there.

00:57:38,114 --> 00:57:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  I think. I'm not too sure, because I wasn't there. But I suspect that some of that was going on.

00:57:44,226 --> 00:57:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  If you can...

00:57:45,602 --> 00:57:48,126
SPEAKER_0:  bring an honest voice down there they can trust.

00:57:48,738 --> 00:57:49,726
SPEAKER_0:  put that out there.

00:57:50,306 --> 00:57:51,070
SPEAKER_0:  I mean...

00:57:52,066 --> 00:57:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  I think you could try.

00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:56,286
SPEAKER_1:  I'm interested in that kind of thing. Yeah, yeah.

00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:58,942
SPEAKER_1:  because ultimately in some of those places.

00:57:59,586 --> 00:57:59,998
SPEAKER_1:  Like.

00:58:00,994 --> 00:58:03,070
SPEAKER_1:  inside a cartel at the very top.

00:58:03,586 --> 00:58:06,494
SPEAKER_1:  is when you can really look at the raw.

00:58:07,106 --> 00:58:09,086
SPEAKER_1:  aspects of human nature in a way you can.

00:58:09,442 --> 00:58:11,038
SPEAKER_1:  can't necessarily elsewhere.

00:58:11,234 --> 00:58:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  there's a youth coming into power down there.

00:58:13,954 --> 00:58:20,286
SPEAKER_0:  When I say youth, I mean some of the old guard is going out and some of the new guard is coming in.

00:58:20,866 --> 00:58:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  El Chapo Guzman's sons, who are now...

00:58:24,162 --> 00:58:31,070
SPEAKER_0:  in their own right, kind of gaining legendary status. There was an attempted arrest on his son that led to...

00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  the famous Culiacanazo incident.

00:58:34,498 --> 00:58:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  which we are now learning more about because some of the guacamaya leagues are kind of

00:58:39,554 --> 00:58:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  speaking more about what happened that day.

00:58:42,402 --> 00:58:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  Basically a federal operation.

00:58:46,114 --> 00:58:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  to arrest Del Chapo Guzman's son.

00:58:50,754 --> 00:58:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  turn into a siege.

00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:55,550
SPEAKER_0:  to try and get them free.

00:58:55,778 --> 00:59:00,702
SPEAKER_0:  They called in the cavalry, basically the whole of the Sinaloa cartel showed up to try and rescue them.

00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  Interesting thing about that is in reading some of the documents and also just seeing some of the videos and stuff like that came out of that incident.

00:59:08,866 --> 00:59:11,902
SPEAKER_0:  The cartels were the ones evacuating the citizenship from the area.

00:59:13,122 --> 00:59:17,246
SPEAKER_0:  They were the ones going restaurant to restaurant. They want to exit the city go through here.

00:59:17,858 --> 00:59:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  Take your families, get down, but you have to leave because the Army's coming here and gonna fight us.

00:59:23,522 --> 00:59:24,647
SPEAKER_0:  So there's like a

00:59:24,647 --> 00:59:29,694
SPEAKER_1:  A deep morality too to all of that. Underneath the violence, there's a humanity. You mean it's their home?

00:59:30,274 --> 00:59:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  It is their home and they were fighting for their.

00:59:33,058 --> 00:59:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  and they were fighting for leadership from their home.

00:59:36,226 --> 00:59:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:59:36,962 --> 00:59:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  There is a morality, there is a humanity there, and again.

00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know if people want to paint them all with the villainy aspects, you know.

00:59:44,738 --> 00:59:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, everybody's a villain in somebody else's story, you know, if you kind of look at it that way.

00:59:51,074 --> 00:59:57,534
SPEAKER_1:  People should check out your Patreon, you should check out your Field Notes. You're a really good writer, your Instagram too. You write about...

00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:00,510
SPEAKER_1:  You have a quote in your field notes about villains.

01:00:01,826 --> 01:00:03,806
SPEAKER_1:  I once worked for a villain.

01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:05,694
SPEAKER_1:  a savior to some.

01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:10,174
SPEAKER_1:  and the biblical demon of old to others, a true product of his environment.

01:00:11,138 --> 01:00:13,022
SPEAKER_1:  He was the best and the worst of us.

01:00:13,538 --> 01:00:15,966
SPEAKER_1:  We're all potential villains in someone else's story.

01:00:16,354 --> 01:00:17,470
SPEAKER_1:  He would say to us,

01:00:17,858 --> 01:00:20,606
SPEAKER_1:  as we would head out into the unknowns.

01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:22,910
SPEAKER_1:  that the night had waiting for us.

01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:27,678
SPEAKER_1:  It was during one of these nights that I looked around me and saw horns and pitchforks among

01:00:28,066 --> 01:00:29,406
SPEAKER_1:  My people unrealized.

01:00:30,114 --> 01:00:31,198
SPEAKER_1:  what he meant.

01:00:32,194 --> 01:00:35,422
SPEAKER_1:  We were no knights of the round table, whatever we were.

01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:40,510
SPEAKER_1:  were needed. In the end, I guess that justified most of what was about to happen.

01:00:41,058 --> 01:00:43,614
SPEAKER_1:  I do think out job but do you think people like him are.

01:00:44,034 --> 01:00:44,926
SPEAKER_0:  good or evil.

01:00:45,762 --> 01:00:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  I think there's no one without the other. I think there's a cost to...

01:00:50,402 --> 01:00:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  There's a cost to...

01:00:52,194 --> 01:00:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  their goodness that they do.

01:00:53,666 --> 01:01:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the roads they built, the hospitals, the career paths that they paid for. There are doctors in Mexico that their careers were paid for by some of these groups.

01:01:03,586 --> 01:01:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  and they do a lot of

01:01:05,282 --> 01:01:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  amazing good for the community. I remember

01:01:08,034 --> 01:01:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  There was a...

01:01:10,594 --> 01:01:11,166
SPEAKER_0:  surgeon.

01:01:12,194 --> 01:01:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  reconstructing cleft palates.

01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  In one of my travels that I did out there, I spent some time actually going out there after I deteriorated my 15.6 skill set.

01:01:21,058 --> 01:01:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  out of the job to train people and.

01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:25,246
SPEAKER_0:  that's the type of stuff that I show people.

01:01:25,826 --> 01:01:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  And uh...

01:01:27,074 --> 01:01:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  They are...

01:01:28,354 --> 01:01:34,238
SPEAKER_0:  They told me, I told them, you're doing God's work? This stuff is legit, this is God's work?

01:01:35,170 --> 01:01:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  building smiles for people. I was like, yeah.

01:01:38,018 --> 01:01:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  And then can I talk to you?

01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  He said, you know, my career path was paid for by...

01:01:44,642 --> 01:01:45,022
SPEAKER_0:  cartel.

01:01:45,282 --> 01:01:50,494
SPEAKER_0:  a group of cartel members, they paid for my career path because they wanted somebody on hand that could fix their teeth.

01:01:52,034 --> 01:01:55,838
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think some aspects of that is just sort of manipulative control?

01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,462
SPEAKER_1:  or is some of it also just.

01:01:58,818 --> 01:02:04,094
SPEAKER_1:  Again, I care for the population, for fellow human beings that are one of your own.

01:02:04,354 --> 01:02:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  I think both.

01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I think there's, again.

01:02:07,618 --> 01:02:14,686
SPEAKER_0:  It's hard to just make them saints or devils. Some of the good they do in some of their communities.

01:02:15,202 --> 01:02:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  and don't ask anything for in return, you know?

01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:27,710
SPEAKER_0:  And even if they don't ask it for anything in return where the military shows up, they are immediately met with rocks and roadblocks and everybody's

01:02:28,546 --> 01:02:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  main weapon down there since most Mexicans can't buy or own firearms.

01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  The main weapon down there is silence and their eyes to report.

01:02:37,634 --> 01:02:39,518
SPEAKER_0:  to the people that they consider.

01:02:40,066 --> 01:02:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  the good guys in their environment.

01:02:42,498 --> 01:02:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  That's a hard question, you know.

01:02:47,298 --> 01:02:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  I think there's a bit of both, and both the government and the criminal groups that are operating down there.

01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:55,870
SPEAKER_1:  Silence is their main weapon.

01:02:57,570 --> 01:02:59,390
SPEAKER_1:  So El Chapo is currently in prison.

01:03:01,058 --> 01:03:02,302
SPEAKER_1:  Is he worth talking to?

01:03:03,234 --> 01:03:06,334
SPEAKER_1:  I'd say yes. Is there things that to you are?

01:03:06,562 --> 01:03:08,894
SPEAKER_1:  Interesting about him that is still not understood.

01:03:09,602 --> 01:03:13,054
SPEAKER_1:  Is he a window into something that you don't understand about that world still?

01:03:13,282 --> 01:03:15,157
SPEAKER_1:  or curious about in that world. I think

01:03:15,157 --> 01:03:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  I think he's a window into the family dynamics of that world. I want to say family dynamics. Mexico has a big thing about compadres.

01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:27,390
SPEAKER_0:  hermanos. We have people that we call family that are not necessarily our family.

01:03:28,066 --> 01:03:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:03:29,154 --> 01:03:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  He is somebody that witnessed the...

01:03:33,314 --> 01:03:35,614
SPEAKER_0:  the construction of what is now.

01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:40,318
SPEAKER_0:  scene of the law cartel. Like he was in it way back when he started off as a

01:03:41,314 --> 01:03:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  as a farmer and then went into trafficking. He's from a town called Bandirahuata, which is basically, you know, that's the Wakanda of cartels, basically. That's where a lot of that originates.

01:03:51,842 --> 01:03:52,254
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  the

01:03:54,082 --> 01:03:57,598
SPEAKER_0:  the things that he saw as far as how some of these things got built.

01:03:57,826 --> 01:03:59,294
SPEAKER_0:  I think would be an interesting.

01:03:59,522 --> 01:04:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  topic of conversation with somebody like him.

01:04:01,986 --> 01:04:07,326
SPEAKER_1:  So that story is a story of evolving family dynamics. So part of the story of the cartel is...

01:04:07,842 --> 01:04:09,182
SPEAKER_1:  individual humans.

01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  marrying other families, getting named padrino, basically godfathers to other people's kids.

01:04:15,970 --> 01:04:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:04:17,154 --> 01:04:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  forming family and blood ties and

01:04:19,394 --> 01:04:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  influence ties to people not only in Mexico but in the United States.

01:04:23,554 --> 01:04:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  It's seeing how that.

01:04:25,186 --> 01:04:29,438
SPEAKER_0:  dynamic and family dynamic is still there, you know, so he's gone.

01:04:29,858 --> 01:04:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  He's in prison, but he is.

01:04:32,738 --> 01:04:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  He's probably on his way to be our next.

01:04:35,266 --> 01:04:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  clandestine saint?

01:04:36,898 --> 01:04:39,646
SPEAKER_0:  You go to the chapel of Malverde.

01:04:40,578 --> 01:04:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  Melberto is basically a Mexican Robin Hood folk saint down there, who is a saint of traffickers.

01:04:47,426 --> 01:04:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  and at his shrine.

01:04:50,018 --> 01:04:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  you have small little chapel.

01:04:52,162 --> 01:04:53,214
SPEAKER_0:  shrine right next to it.

01:04:53,954 --> 01:05:00,734
SPEAKER_0:  So he's on his way to sainthood in Mexico, not recognized by the Catholic Church, but that doesn't matter in Mexico anymore.

01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  speaking to somebody like him.

01:05:04,226 --> 01:05:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  Cool.

01:05:05,634 --> 01:05:08,926
SPEAKER_0:  You can consider him somebody that lost, you know, he's arrested.

01:05:09,634 --> 01:05:10,750
SPEAKER_0:  But his family's okay.

01:05:11,586 --> 01:05:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  His legacy is out there. He's probably gonna be the next folk saint when he passes away.

01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:18,622
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think he feels like?

01:05:19,138 --> 01:05:20,254
SPEAKER_1:  the new wave.

01:05:20,706 --> 01:05:23,678
SPEAKER_1:  of what the cartel has become is betrayed and left behind.

01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:24,574
SPEAKER_1:  or

01:05:25,314 --> 01:05:25,854
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:05:26,114 --> 01:05:28,542
SPEAKER_1:  because it seems like the way the cartel operated...

01:05:28,866 --> 01:05:30,302
SPEAKER_1:  has changed over the decades.

01:05:30,434 --> 01:05:30,750
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:05:31,938 --> 01:05:32,798
SPEAKER_0:  Well, number one.

01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  their power and influence is bigger.

01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  you know, the.

01:05:36,834 --> 01:05:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  There are Sinaloa cartel operations in Colombia straight to the source of it.

01:05:43,042 --> 01:05:45,726
SPEAKER_0:  and then they are clear.

01:05:45,954 --> 01:05:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  They have a clear presence in places like Chicago and Los Angeles. They're in the United States. Oh.

01:05:52,258 --> 01:05:55,550
SPEAKER_0:  thought process that a lot of Americans have. We don't want that.

01:05:55,842 --> 01:05:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  We don't want them to get here or build a wall and all this.

01:06:00,034 --> 01:06:02,558
SPEAKER_1:  So they're deeply integrated into legitimate businesses.

01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, they've been having kids and families up here for a long time. Some of these people have American passports that work not only directly for them, but have blood ties down there. Big boys imagine that they've been having kids and parents as theirs, right?

01:06:14,082 --> 01:06:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  dragnets and arrests of some of these criminal organizations states. The New Generation Cartel had one two three years ago where

01:06:21,986 --> 01:06:23,902
SPEAKER_0:  The Guest Operation on the Con, I think it was called.

01:06:24,482 --> 01:06:25,534
SPEAKER_0:  They're worth it over 80.

01:06:25,826 --> 01:06:35,870
SPEAKER_0:  of their operatives. This is a new cartel that is very militaristic and growing in Mexico and they had 80 arrests in the United States of members of them operating here.

01:06:36,898 --> 01:06:37,918
SPEAKER_1:  That's how you could.

01:06:38,306 --> 01:06:40,990
SPEAKER_1:  be a legitimate operator inside the United States.

01:06:42,018 --> 01:06:43,230
SPEAKER_1:  that's hard to detect.

01:06:43,778 --> 01:06:46,974
SPEAKER_1:  Makes you wonder how many in the US government.

01:06:48,802 --> 01:06:49,886
SPEAKER_1:  the politicians here.

01:06:50,594 --> 01:06:52,414
SPEAKER_1:  because it is the role.

01:06:52,674 --> 01:06:56,062
SPEAKER_1:  of the United States in the drug war financially in terms of power.

01:06:56,706 --> 01:06:57,694
SPEAKER_1:  is very big.

01:06:58,178 --> 01:07:00,803
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. Surely there's politicians that have a-

01:07:00,803 --> 01:07:02,974
SPEAKER_0:  finger into this immigration is part of it.

01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  illegal immigration.

01:07:04,994 --> 01:07:12,894
SPEAKER_0:  as part of it and the influence that has as a bargaining chip and a political chip. We saw this with the first caravan coming up and how it was politicized.

01:07:13,986 --> 01:07:17,758
SPEAKER_0:  the money, Fast and Furious and guns being basically...

01:07:18,402 --> 01:07:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  let walk down into Mexico.

01:07:20,706 --> 01:07:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  People that don't know basically.

01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  the ATF had this operation where they were.

01:07:24,514 --> 01:07:26,878
SPEAKER_0:  looking at straw purchasers or firearms.

01:07:27,106 --> 01:07:32,350
SPEAKER_0:  basically people buying up a specific type of firearms that were on a shopping list that the cartels wanted to buy.

01:07:33,282 --> 01:07:35,262
SPEAKER_0:  including 50 cows.

01:07:35,554 --> 01:07:37,854
SPEAKER_0:  FN57 pistols which are

01:07:38,146 --> 01:07:41,182
SPEAKER_0:  small pistols with a high velocity round that will go through a bulletproof vest.

01:07:42,018 --> 01:07:42,494
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:07:43,682 --> 01:07:45,246
SPEAKER_0:  AR-15s of all kinds.

01:07:45,506 --> 01:07:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  that could quickly be modified into full auto down in Mexico.

01:07:49,538 --> 01:07:53,406
SPEAKER_0:  with drilling a few holes and making a few things to them.

01:07:54,242 --> 01:07:57,278
SPEAKER_0:  So these people were buying all these, the ATF was watching them.

01:07:57,634 --> 01:07:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  and allowing them to walk.

01:07:59,394 --> 01:08:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  those firearms into Mexico under the guise of trying to track them somehow.

01:08:04,194 --> 01:08:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  which doesn't make a lot of sense for most people to kind of look at that operation. The only people found, the only reason people found out about it was...

01:08:11,522 --> 01:08:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  because of the murder of a few federal agents, of the US federal agents that were killed with those guns.

01:08:16,642 --> 01:08:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  One of my friends was shot with one of those pistols outside of his house.

01:08:20,674 --> 01:08:23,678
SPEAKER_0:  and they shot him and they shot his wife.

01:08:24,162 --> 01:08:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  both of them were killed.

01:08:26,082 --> 01:08:28,702
SPEAKER_0:  daughter was in the backseat, lost part of her arm.

01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:30,622
SPEAKER_0:  When that happened.

01:08:31,074 --> 01:08:33,950
SPEAKER_0:  The guns were unique. There was like, oh, we didn't ever fight.

01:08:34,242 --> 01:08:36,926
SPEAKER_0:  The matapolicias is what they call them. They're the cop killers.

01:08:37,954 --> 01:08:38,942
SPEAKER_0:  I haven't seen those before.

01:08:39,842 --> 01:08:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  So they were unique and interesting and

01:08:42,466 --> 01:08:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  later on in life I was watching CNN.

01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  and seeing the hearings going on, I was like, oh!

01:08:47,778 --> 01:08:48,638
SPEAKER_0:  That's where they came from.

01:08:49,794 --> 01:08:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  Two federal agents changed a lot. It was politicized. There was a whole scandal up here.

01:08:56,322 --> 01:08:59,230
SPEAKER_0:  But in Mexico, how many people died with those firearms?

01:08:59,682 --> 01:09:01,886
SPEAKER_0:  you know, being let down, being let go down there.

01:09:02,594 --> 01:09:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  and also what type of sentiment you think the local populace has of the United States after all those guns were basically handed over to some of these groups.

01:09:11,394 --> 01:09:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  of gun trafficking as another.

01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  giant part of the equation and part of the problem down there as far as as far as the amount of munitions weapons and

01:09:21,858 --> 01:09:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  Now we were also getting.

01:09:23,906 --> 01:09:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  Tradecraft.

01:09:24,962 --> 01:09:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  material from conflict zones outside of Mexico.

01:09:28,098 --> 01:09:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  Weaponized drones.

01:09:30,658 --> 01:09:35,454
SPEAKER_0:  The first time we saw some of those weaponized drones was in Syria.

01:09:36,386 --> 01:09:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  And like a few weeks later, you know, grenades were being dropped on the roofs of some...

01:09:42,754 --> 01:09:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  public officials building.

01:09:45,666 --> 01:09:48,446
SPEAKER_0:  Are you using drones? That's been going on for a while.

01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  There's a place in Michoacan that has some pretty interesting videos. And the interesting part of them is because the federal police down there are actually working hand in hand.

01:09:57,698 --> 01:09:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  with a United

01:09:59,138 --> 01:10:05,982
SPEAKER_0:  Carteles Unidos group, which is basically the local cartels to try and fight off the new generation cartel moving into Michoacan.

01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:11,646
SPEAKER_0:  So even the federal forces are fighting with the cartels to try and keep this larger cartel out.

01:10:12,034 --> 01:10:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  and there's videos of these civilian drones basically dropping.

01:10:15,906 --> 01:10:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  Explosives.

01:10:17,794 --> 01:10:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  They found some explosive testing ranges out there that are basically replicating stuff that you would see the IRA use during the troubles out there.

01:10:26,626 --> 01:10:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  from homemade mortars.

01:10:28,578 --> 01:10:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  Um,

01:10:29,378 --> 01:10:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  You know, IEDs have been used in Mexico with that.

01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  not that much, but they're making like a presence again. We don't have a lot of ordinance around like Iraq, but we do have a big mining industry down there.

01:10:41,026 --> 01:10:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  So mining explosives of all kinds are pretty easy to get.

01:10:45,154 --> 01:10:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:10:46,146 --> 01:10:52,926
SPEAKER_0:  You start seeing that and also, I mean, there's some exotic weaponry coming in from the south now and from the ocean.

01:10:53,890 --> 01:11:00,510
SPEAKER_0:  Some of it is probably US military equipment sold to various South American governments that are now...

01:11:01,442 --> 01:11:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  not as stable as they were and they're kind of making their way into black markets.

01:11:05,858 --> 01:11:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  a lot of those 50 cowl and.

01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:11,614
SPEAKER_0:  vehicle mounted technical type machine guns and some of the

01:11:11,842 --> 01:11:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  RPGs and...

01:11:13,954 --> 01:11:21,022
SPEAKER_0:  Man pads or remote control guided missiles that you that have been found in cartel hands are probably come making their way up from down south

01:11:21,122 --> 01:11:21,662
SPEAKER_1:  to get

01:11:21,922 --> 01:11:29,182
SPEAKER_1:  these like multi-million dollar systems like the high-mar system in the Ukraine, you like super sophisticated advanced technology or not.

01:11:29,762 --> 01:11:31,550
SPEAKER_1:  So like this is like military grade.

01:11:31,874 --> 01:11:34,499
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not sure what the application would be exactly.

01:11:34,499 --> 01:11:42,709
SPEAKER_0:  Some of the sophisticated stuff I see in our man pads, which is basically remote guided missiles. I've seen some of those found out there.

01:11:42,709 --> 01:11:43,774
SPEAKER_1:  application exactly.

01:11:45,442 --> 01:11:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  display of power.

01:11:46,754 --> 01:11:49,278
SPEAKER_0:  there are no flight zones over parts of Mexico.

01:11:50,178 --> 01:11:50,750
SPEAKER_0:  for this reason.

01:11:51,362 --> 01:11:52,734
SPEAKER_0:  the New Jersey Cartel.

01:11:53,506 --> 01:11:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  down a helicopter.

01:11:56,514 --> 01:11:59,902
SPEAKER_0:  there's been incidents of military helicopters falling from the sky and it

01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:03,102
SPEAKER_0:  They said that it was mechanical issues.

01:12:03,938 --> 01:12:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  But again, I'm not gonna do conspiracy theories out there, but there's a lot of videos on TikTok of the...

01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  Sinaloa cartel forces at parties.

01:12:15,138 --> 01:12:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  carrying around rocket launchers on their backs.

01:12:19,906 --> 01:12:24,190
SPEAKER_1:  So there's an increased probability of mechanical failures over those areas.

01:12:24,546 --> 01:12:25,671
SPEAKER_1:  When you're flying a...

01:12:25,671 --> 01:12:30,558
SPEAKER_0:  helicopter. Yeah, there's no flight zones over some parts of Mexico. Okay.

01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  Another thing you're seeing now is night vision, night vision equipment that is clearly military grade.

01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  from the US.

01:12:38,530 --> 01:12:48,222
SPEAKER_0:  that was probably abandoned in some war field out there, maybe Afghanistan or somewhere like that. And it's being found in safe houses and in the hands of cartel forces.

01:12:48,706 --> 01:12:50,078
SPEAKER_0:  You want to talk about a scary.

01:12:50,402 --> 01:12:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  opponent.

01:12:51,746 --> 01:12:53,182
SPEAKER_0:  Somebody wearing night vision.

01:12:54,146 --> 01:12:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  with a suppressed firearm.

01:12:56,034 --> 01:12:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  those types of capabilities are now.

01:12:58,146 --> 01:12:58,718
SPEAKER_0:  out there.

01:12:59,554 --> 01:13:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  Also.

01:13:00,546 --> 01:13:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  There's this tendency to think in every now and then you'll see these cartel videos with these guys carrying around these 50 cows and they show

01:13:06,658 --> 01:13:07,774
SPEAKER_0:  Stand there like, eh.

01:13:08,034 --> 01:13:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  the boasting about their rifles and everybody laughed at them because

01:13:12,130 --> 01:13:15,838
SPEAKER_0:  50 cal or anything like that without an optic on it.

01:13:16,162 --> 01:13:17,854
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it's like you're gonna shoot.

01:13:18,114 --> 01:13:20,542
SPEAKER_0:  you're praying shoot basically see if you can hit anything with it.

01:13:21,378 --> 01:13:27,998
SPEAKER_0:  But now there's a few of my sources of seen, you know, sophisticated laser-guided

01:13:28,386 --> 01:13:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  range finders and sighting systems on some of these that are being found out there.

01:13:33,026 --> 01:13:35,651
SPEAKER_1:  How much damage can fatigue carry? What's the application?

01:13:35,651 --> 01:13:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  They started getting them specifically with the proliferation of armored vehicles in Mexico. Mexico has a giant industry in armored vehicles as far as-

01:13:43,650 --> 01:13:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  So there's a race in terms of.

01:13:45,378 --> 01:13:47,102
SPEAKER_1:  uh... armory protecting

01:13:47,586 --> 01:13:48,958
SPEAKER_1:  especially high value.

01:13:49,474 --> 01:13:50,142
SPEAKER_1:  targets.

01:13:50,722 --> 01:13:51,486
SPEAKER_1:  And then...

01:13:52,034 --> 01:13:54,462
SPEAKER_1:  weapons they can deal with those armored.

01:13:54,818 --> 01:13:56,702
SPEAKER_1:  the protected high value targets.

01:13:56,802 --> 01:13:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  There was an attempted assassination.

01:13:59,938 --> 01:14:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  of a state prosecutor somewhere.

01:14:01,954 --> 01:14:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  I think central Mexico, I forget exactly where, but she was riding around up armored.

01:14:06,978 --> 01:14:07,326
SPEAKER_0:  cheap.

01:14:08,514 --> 01:14:10,750
SPEAKER_0:  Cherokee, I think it was and

01:14:11,010 --> 01:14:12,606
SPEAKER_0:  their main means of.

01:14:12,898 --> 01:14:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  of firepower was 50 cal and that car.

01:14:15,874 --> 01:14:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  was left in pieces.

01:14:18,274 --> 01:14:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  he survived and I think the armored vehicle company that soldered that vehicle has it in this playroom.

01:14:24,962 --> 01:14:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  uh... then before my time probably two three years before i was actually active

01:14:29,826 --> 01:14:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  They tried to kill the head of public security in the state of Baja.

01:14:33,826 --> 01:14:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  And with him, it was a grenade launcher, 40 millimeter grenade launcher.

01:14:37,986 --> 01:14:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  it skipped off the armored vehicle and landed in the...

01:14:42,562 --> 01:14:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  car behind it.

01:14:43,746 --> 01:14:47,422
SPEAKER_0:  made the back explode. One of the guys that I used to work with was actually in that car.

01:14:47,714 --> 01:14:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  survived it.

01:14:48,994 --> 01:14:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:14:50,018 --> 01:14:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  but you started to see, oh, they're using our vehicles now. Let's get.

01:14:54,210 --> 01:14:57,246
SPEAKER_0:  50 caliber now to try and defeat that armor.

01:14:58,722 --> 01:15:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  So yeah, there's always this...

01:15:02,338 --> 01:15:05,310
SPEAKER_0:  This race of technology basically down there. Armored vehicles.

01:15:05,986 --> 01:15:09,982
SPEAKER_0:  You know, how do you take on a normal vehicle? Well, there's a few ways. 50 cows, you know?

01:15:10,242 --> 01:15:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  if you can mount them in the right way and shoot at a car like that or...

01:15:14,114 --> 01:15:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  a bunch of kids with balloons and acrylic paint.

01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  on the front windshield and blind the vehicle so it doesn't, so they can't drive it anymore.

01:15:21,218 --> 01:15:22,014
SPEAKER_0:  is another way.

01:15:22,594 --> 01:15:23,102
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:15:23,362 --> 01:15:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  towline across a road.

01:15:24,994 --> 01:15:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  painted like the...

01:15:26,114 --> 01:15:28,030
SPEAKER_0:  painted black so you can't see it.

01:15:29,794 --> 01:15:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  the thing in half. Again, I'm not saying any secrets. These are things that people have seen out there.

01:15:35,938 --> 01:15:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  shoot at the radiator. Some of these radiators are not even the more sophisticated vehicles out there. Don't have sufficient armoring around the radiator or the battery housing of some of these vehicles.

01:15:48,130 --> 01:15:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  There was a case of a guy I think his nickname was El Pelavacas or something like that. I wouldn't see in a law.

01:15:53,346 --> 01:15:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  I love a cartel guy.

01:15:54,946 --> 01:15:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  He had a normal vehicle, he was riding around and he got ambushed.

01:15:58,946 --> 01:16:02,046
SPEAKER_0:  shot at his car he was like I have armor you can't shoot me

01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:06,814
SPEAKER_0:  and somebody went up to his car and just put the barrel right in the locking mechanism.

01:16:08,514 --> 01:16:09,822
SPEAKER_0:  and that kind of, you know.

01:16:10,114 --> 01:16:10,654
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:16:12,194 --> 01:16:16,030
SPEAKER_0:  It's an interesting place as far as people getting certain types of guns.

01:16:17,026 --> 01:16:22,654
SPEAKER_0:  armor is prolific down there. I mean, everybody down there, the cartel members, you'll see them wearing plate armor.

01:16:23,010 --> 01:16:25,182
SPEAKER_0:  So that's an issue. Is that like-

01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  you can shoot somebody square in the chest and it'll go down.

01:16:28,066 --> 01:16:30,206
SPEAKER_1:  Are they afraid to kill Americans?

01:16:30,914 --> 01:16:32,766
SPEAKER_1:  So I know I was traveling in Ukraine.

01:16:33,282 --> 01:16:34,398
SPEAKER_1:  are on the front.

01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:38,142
SPEAKER_1:  So like a lot of the journalists would travel in like armored vehicles.

01:16:39,202 --> 01:16:42,462
SPEAKER_1:  And at first I was like, it seems like this would attract attention. Yeah.

01:16:42,690 --> 01:16:48,414
SPEAKER_1:  like it seems like they would want to hit those targets. But then then I realized over time as I learned.

01:16:49,346 --> 01:16:51,614
SPEAKER_1:  There's a fear of killing Americans.

01:16:51,874 --> 01:16:53,749
SPEAKER_1:  there could be a drastic escalation of.

01:16:53,749 --> 01:16:57,246
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it's not worth it. It's kicking a beehive.

01:16:58,402 --> 01:17:03,934
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, there is a tendency to shy away or stay away from that.

01:17:04,162 --> 01:17:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  They don't want the heat or the attention outside of that.

01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:08,222
SPEAKER_0:  everyone's game.

01:17:08,482 --> 01:17:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  everyone's game, but also there's been many cases of Americans being killed.

01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  down there. I mean, we saw the Mormon massacre that happened down there and all of them were

01:17:18,018 --> 01:17:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  American.

01:17:19,042 --> 01:17:22,558
SPEAKER_0:  Mexican, they had both nationalities and blonde kids.

01:17:23,490 --> 01:17:23,806
SPEAKER_0:  Wait.

01:17:24,898 --> 01:17:27,710
SPEAKER_0:  being massacred in the middle of a desert.

01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  uh

01:17:28,578 --> 01:17:30,622
SPEAKER_0:  and the car is basically catching fire.

01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  this happen.

01:17:32,162 --> 01:17:34,558
SPEAKER_0:  and you know, the America, Americans are.

01:17:34,978 --> 01:17:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  sent the FBI down there to kind of review some of what happened down there.

01:17:39,586 --> 01:17:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that was.

01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  when Trump started talking about.

01:17:44,802 --> 01:17:48,382
SPEAKER_0:  reviving this whole notion of cartels being labeled as a terrorist organization.

01:17:48,898 --> 01:17:50,462
SPEAKER_0:  Probably more for other political.

01:17:51,138 --> 01:17:56,126
SPEAKER_0:  pressure point he was using to try and get Mexico to reinforce its southern border, which was posted here.

01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  Hasn't.

01:17:58,850 --> 01:18:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  but there's escalation.

01:18:00,642 --> 01:18:03,902
SPEAKER_0:  you know, this already happened and nothing happened. So,

01:18:04,322 --> 01:18:05,982
SPEAKER_0:  we can probably get away with it, you know.

01:18:06,594 --> 01:18:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  And again, there's a newer generation moving forward now.

01:18:09,442 --> 01:18:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  people coming into power.

01:18:11,138 --> 01:18:13,763
SPEAKER_1:  more brutal, more technically savvy okay

01:18:13,763 --> 01:18:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  have the experience of their parents.

01:18:15,682 --> 01:18:19,326
SPEAKER_0:  and the people behind them and what they've done and what got away with and now...

01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:22,590
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, more savvy about information warfare.

01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  Their main recruiting tool is TikTok.

01:18:26,306 --> 01:18:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  You go to tech talk and you'll see a bunch of these kids at an archipod dancing around and.

01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:37,310
SPEAKER_0:  Some of these are videos by cartel members filming other cartel members in cartel control territory and that's a window into that life for.

01:18:38,882 --> 01:18:39,934
SPEAKER_0:  Who's on TikTok now?

01:18:40,258 --> 01:18:40,638
SPEAKER_0:  kids.

01:18:41,442 --> 01:18:43,934
SPEAKER_1:  And the enticing aspect of that is the money.

01:18:44,642 --> 01:18:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  The fun.

01:18:46,178 --> 01:18:47,326
SPEAKER_1:  The High Roller Life.

01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:48,254
SPEAKER_0:  and the

01:18:48,514 --> 01:18:50,142
SPEAKER_0:  the possibility of making it.

01:18:50,466 --> 01:18:51,134
SPEAKER_0:  to a level.

01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  You know? Yeah.

01:18:52,674 --> 01:18:54,846
SPEAKER_1:  of fame of respect.

01:18:55,842 --> 01:18:56,350
SPEAKER_1:  power.

01:18:58,242 --> 01:18:58,718
SPEAKER_0:  money.

01:18:59,138 --> 01:18:59,902
SPEAKER_0:  here in the US.

01:19:00,514 --> 01:19:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  somebody might, you know, I want to mansion.

01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:07,006
SPEAKER_0:  I want to like that that's their mindset. I want to live, you know, like that rapper

01:19:07,970 --> 01:19:09,854
SPEAKER_0:  down there, I mean, if you can buy.

01:19:10,210 --> 01:19:12,894
SPEAKER_0:  a house for your mom, you know, or pay off.

01:19:13,186 --> 01:19:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  some debts that you might have or a car.

01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:17,598
SPEAKER_0:  That's enough to kill for.

01:19:19,554 --> 01:19:23,998
SPEAKER_1:  So you also, one of the many things you did is security try to protect.

01:19:24,578 --> 01:19:27,582
SPEAKER_1:  in this war try to protect people, high value people.

01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:31,326
SPEAKER_1:  How do you do you and others? How is it possible to protect?

01:19:31,842 --> 01:19:34,302
SPEAKER_1:  a high value target like a celebrity.

01:19:34,626 --> 01:19:36,501
SPEAKER_1:  or an important politician in the situation.

01:19:36,501 --> 01:19:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  So I was tasked.

01:19:38,914 --> 01:19:42,174
SPEAKER_0:  to protect the governor of Baja and his family.

01:19:43,042 --> 01:19:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  I was basically replacing a whole contingency of people that were already there.

01:19:47,010 --> 01:19:48,414
SPEAKER_0:  that turned out to be corrupted.

01:19:49,058 --> 01:19:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  That wasn't my-

01:19:50,434 --> 01:19:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  I was operational, I was working.

01:19:52,930 --> 01:19:54,718
SPEAKER_0:  with other people doing the counter.

01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  narcotic stuff and uh...

01:19:56,898 --> 01:20:00,606
SPEAKER_0:  the director of the institution that I was in basically called me and said they

01:20:01,570 --> 01:20:04,734
SPEAKER_0:  you're going to go and replace these people. What happened to them?

01:20:04,962 --> 01:20:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  Well...

01:20:06,754 --> 01:20:09,374
SPEAKER_1:  I see you were known as a person that could be kind of trusted.

01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  I was tasked for that, so I think they considered that.

01:20:14,594 --> 01:20:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  I specifically worked for...

01:20:17,410 --> 01:20:18,654
SPEAKER_0:  governor name

01:20:18,914 --> 01:20:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  Jose Guadalupe Osuna Mia, who's probably one of the best governors we have had in the state.

01:20:23,714 --> 01:20:24,094
SPEAKER_0: ...

01:20:24,322 --> 01:20:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  People wanna...

01:20:25,474 --> 01:20:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  see if I'm trustworthy or not, they can ask him directly. And I still speak to some members of his family, and we're still friends in that way.

01:20:33,282 --> 01:20:34,462
SPEAKER_1:  is protecting people like

01:20:35,138 --> 01:20:36,158
SPEAKER_1:  technically difficult.

01:20:36,450 --> 01:20:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  It is, from my experience in that time and place, he was basically spearheading.

01:20:42,914 --> 01:20:48,126
SPEAKER_0:  you know, counter the drug war in Baja when he was in power. So he had threats from all over.

01:20:48,354 --> 01:20:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  Not only him, but his family.

01:20:50,146 --> 01:20:54,462
SPEAKER_0:  The first thing I realized working that job in Mexico was that we had.

01:20:55,266 --> 01:21:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  We had people coming in to do specialized training of that regard, Israelis, you know, teaching us how they would do things in Israel.

01:21:02,978 --> 01:21:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  that didn't make a lot of sense for us in Mexico.

01:21:06,018 --> 01:21:16,446
SPEAKER_0:  We had people that had some Secret Service experience kind of showing us how they would do like celebrity bodyguarding or bodyguarding somebody maybe in California of that nature.

01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:18,174
SPEAKER_0:  didn't make sense for us.

01:21:18,722 --> 01:21:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  Then we got to experience some cross-training with some NSW, Naval Special Warfare people.

01:21:24,738 --> 01:21:27,902
SPEAKER_0:  who are coming off protection details in Afghanistan.

01:21:28,514 --> 01:21:29,438
SPEAKER_0:  and Iraq.

01:21:29,730 --> 01:21:31,326
SPEAKER_1:  Is there some useful crossover there?

01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  we were struggling with the acceptance that we were basically doing protection details in a war zone.

01:21:38,050 --> 01:21:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  So the approach...

01:21:40,066 --> 01:21:44,190
SPEAKER_1:  that had to be taken in Mexico was similar to the approach she would take in Afghanistan.

01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  during a war.

01:21:45,698 --> 01:21:50,718
SPEAKER_0:  some of the overt militaristic type approaches to security that we had to adopt from.

01:21:51,426 --> 01:21:56,542
SPEAKER_0:  We didn't move him in a single armored vehicle. We had two of them that looked exactly alike.

01:21:56,834 --> 01:21:58,686
SPEAKER_0:  So when we would move around, we would.

01:21:59,234 --> 01:22:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  switch one card through the other every now and then we would arrive to an event.

01:22:03,394 --> 01:22:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  they would open the door and it would be one of us. And they were like, hey, where's the governor? He's in the back one. So they would move to that. So we had to do stuff like that.

01:22:10,722 --> 01:22:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  And again, this is a young me who didn't have any specialized training. I was fucking evolves.

01:22:15,106 --> 01:22:23,326
SPEAKER_0:  I was on YouTube learning some of these things, going online, learning about armor vehicles, learning about architectural armor.

01:22:23,490 --> 01:22:31,678
SPEAKER_1:  I think you just described a large percentage of the Ukrainian military, how they operate, which is on YouTube, trying to figure out how to use some of this technology.

01:22:32,002 --> 01:22:39,230
SPEAKER_1:  uh... that's actually incredibly effective you know i do quite a lot of stuff where i'm totally not expert totally uneducated and so on

01:22:39,458 --> 01:22:41,182
SPEAKER_1:  It's kind of surprising how quickly you can...

01:22:41,506 --> 01:22:44,510
SPEAKER_1:  get caught up, as we were talking offline, you take a course.

01:22:44,802 --> 01:22:47,390
SPEAKER_1:  If you talk to an expert, if you learn from an expert, you can like...

01:22:47,810 --> 01:22:48,935
SPEAKER_1:  catch up really quickly.

01:22:48,935 --> 01:22:53,470
SPEAKER_0:  For me, it was all of a sudden I have this director calling me in and I'm-

01:22:54,242 --> 01:23:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  wearing vans and jeans, t-shirt, and all of a sudden I had 80-some people that I had to move around.

01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  I was in charge of securing planes, which I...

01:23:06,082 --> 01:23:08,894
SPEAKER_0:  What do I know about that? Airport hangers?

01:23:09,474 --> 01:23:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  armored vehicle maintenance and purchasing.

01:23:13,986 --> 01:23:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  figuring out how to set up a counter-assault group for a protection detail, and I was like, where am I going to learn all this?

01:23:21,218 --> 01:23:23,678
SPEAKER_1:  We able to quickly figure some of these things out.

01:23:24,194 --> 01:23:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  on the fly basically, you know, as I was going, I remember having this experience.

01:23:29,506 --> 01:23:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  being in the...

01:23:30,850 --> 01:23:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  our security office on my laptop figuring out how to set up a

01:23:35,106 --> 01:23:37,470
SPEAKER_0:  counter surveillance aside to our

01:23:37,730 --> 01:23:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  protection detail, basically how to.

01:23:39,714 --> 01:23:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  have people looking for people that might be looking for us, you know, type thing.

01:23:43,874 --> 01:23:46,110
SPEAKER_0:  and then going to...

01:23:47,106 --> 01:23:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  San Diego to Coronado.

01:23:49,826 --> 01:23:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  and training with.

01:23:51,522 --> 01:23:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  some people from.

01:23:53,282 --> 01:23:58,110
SPEAKER_0:  former SEAL guys and NCIS people who did that job in war zones.

01:23:58,914 --> 01:24:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  and seeing them.

01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  critique some of the solutions that we came up with on the fly and being like, oh,

01:24:05,282 --> 01:24:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  We never saw that before. Yeah, we're doing it down there. So getting that compliment.

01:24:11,074 --> 01:24:15,230
SPEAKER_0:  and also getting their feedback, like we probably do this or do that.

01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  It was a learning process on the fly that was pretty...

01:24:19,074 --> 01:24:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  I mean seat of your pants level.

01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:22,398
SPEAKER_1:  Is it possible for the family?

01:24:23,042 --> 01:24:25,182
SPEAKER_1:  and for the high value person to

01:24:25,826 --> 01:24:27,701
SPEAKER_1:  to have a sense of normalcy, to have a normal life.

01:24:27,701 --> 01:24:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I tried. I was already starting off on the wrong foot basically because trust had been violated.

01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:36,478
SPEAKER_0:  by the people that I was replacing. So I had to gain that back.

01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:38,078
SPEAKER_0:  then

01:24:38,306 --> 01:24:44,542
SPEAKER_0:  young kids in that family that wanted to go out and stuff like that in the most violent city on the planet.

01:24:45,506 --> 01:24:49,758
SPEAKER_0:  So I had to do my homework and figure out places where they were safe to go to.

01:24:50,786 --> 01:24:53,790
SPEAKER_0:  make friends with certain club owners and

01:24:54,402 --> 01:24:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  figure out ways to put security in some of these places and.

01:24:57,794 --> 01:25:03,902
SPEAKER_0:  having to create this bubble of normalcy around some of these people was pretty difficult.

01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:08,670
SPEAKER_0:  there's no way that that is a normal for anybody and

01:25:09,762 --> 01:25:10,238
SPEAKER_0:  at all.

01:25:11,202 --> 01:25:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  God bless them. I know it wasn't easy, and I know they'd affected their lives, and they lost on...

01:25:17,922 --> 01:25:22,270
SPEAKER_0:  big part of their youth being under that security supervision and bubble.

01:25:23,266 --> 01:25:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  does.

01:25:24,162 --> 01:25:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  probably does a lot for somebody specifically growing up like that.

01:25:28,322 --> 01:25:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

01:25:29,186 --> 01:25:31,902
SPEAKER_0:  You lose opportunities of...

01:25:32,898 --> 01:25:36,926
SPEAKER_0:  things that we take for granted, you know, just going out, just not telling anybody and going to the store.

01:25:37,346 --> 01:25:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

01:25:38,274 --> 01:25:41,598
SPEAKER_0:  because you want to get some snacks or something like that. That's not available to some of these people.

01:25:42,466 --> 01:25:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  I have to be honest.

01:25:43,362 --> 01:25:44,318
SPEAKER_1:  when I was in Ukraine.

01:25:44,578 --> 01:25:46,334
SPEAKER_1:  That was a really big benefit. It's

01:25:46,626 --> 01:25:53,886
SPEAKER_1:  No, I couldn't hang out. I couldn't eat when I'm stressed. I would fast and not eat much. So I got lost weight. So it's great. Eat For The Diet.

01:25:54,242 --> 01:26:00,561
SPEAKER_0:  That's a good diet to be in. Basically, to be under protective custody. That's a good idea for a good diet.

01:26:00,561 --> 01:26:05,182
SPEAKER_1:  and just life allowed me to focus, get a lot of reading done, focus on the important things in life.

01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:06,302
SPEAKER_1:  Heh.

01:26:06,690 --> 01:26:09,950
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I joke of course, but there's some.

01:26:11,714 --> 01:26:13,246
SPEAKER_1:  There's some complexity to this.

01:26:13,730 --> 01:26:15,294
SPEAKER_1:  in terms of normalcy of the family.

01:26:16,098 --> 01:26:17,854
SPEAKER_1:  but also just how to operate.

01:26:18,274 --> 01:26:19,710
SPEAKER_1:  Like have a mental clarity of-

01:26:19,970 --> 01:26:21,438
SPEAKER_1:  and a lack of fear.

01:26:22,082 --> 01:26:26,398
SPEAKER_1:  just basically be good at your job, whatever that job is. as a politician, as a leader.

01:26:26,754 --> 01:26:28,190
SPEAKER_1:  uh... even as a soldier

01:26:28,354 --> 01:26:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  Somebody...

01:26:29,282 --> 01:26:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  then again I think this is a little bit older.

01:26:31,746 --> 01:26:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  said this to me or said something like this to a group of us.

01:26:35,170 --> 01:26:36,926
SPEAKER_0:  that there's nothing wrong with being paranoid.

01:26:37,218 --> 01:26:40,446
SPEAKER_0:  It's about educating your paranoia and knowing what to be afraid of.

01:26:41,410 --> 01:26:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  If you're afraid of everything, you're basically overwhelmed.

01:26:44,706 --> 01:26:50,142
SPEAKER_0:  But if you start educating yourself as far as specifically what to prioritize as far as what to worry about.

01:26:50,978 --> 01:26:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  in a war zone, working, protecting somebody. You're not looking at everybody's faces, you're just looking at their hands, because that's what's going to kill you.

01:26:59,362 --> 01:26:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

01:27:00,098 --> 01:27:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  That's an example of focalizing.

01:27:02,082 --> 01:27:03,934
SPEAKER_0:  you know, what you're paranoid and what you're afraid of.

01:27:04,546 --> 01:27:05,950
SPEAKER_1:  So looking at the hands that's.

01:27:06,178 --> 01:27:08,286
SPEAKER_1:  specific to a particular situation but

01:27:08,706 --> 01:27:09,758
SPEAKER_1:  I was just figuring out.

01:27:10,018 --> 01:27:12,446
SPEAKER_1:  which situations to avoid and which.

01:27:12,706 --> 01:27:15,678
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. It's okay. I mean, that's like ultimately one of the biggest.

01:27:16,098 --> 01:27:17,150
SPEAKER_1:  things you could do. meet

01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  route analysis.

01:27:19,682 --> 01:27:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  You have to get to the airport and you send off two cars to analyze two routes. And then on the fly you just change.

01:27:27,522 --> 01:27:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  trajectory.

01:27:29,026 --> 01:27:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  create randomness.

01:27:31,138 --> 01:27:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  unpredictability and have that as a security feature.

01:27:35,746 --> 01:27:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:27:36,834 --> 01:27:40,894
SPEAKER_0:  having a convoy of four vehicles separated into.

01:27:41,154 --> 01:27:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  two convoys and show up in different parts.

01:27:44,802 --> 01:27:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  Again, make it hard for people to guess where you're going to be.

01:27:47,970 --> 01:27:52,638
SPEAKER_0:  putting out false information as far as where it's going to be, who's going to be, and that type of stuff.

01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:56,318
SPEAKER_1:  It's kind of amazing how many assassination attempts Hitler avoided.

01:27:56,866 --> 01:28:01,630
SPEAKER_1:  just by having a pretty strict schedule and being a little bit off in terms of timing.

01:28:02,018 --> 01:28:03,678
SPEAKER_1:  just like showing up 15 minutes late.

01:28:04,098 --> 01:28:05,790
SPEAKER_1:  or to a slightly different location.

01:28:06,018 --> 01:28:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  We're going through training specifically around this type of stuff.

01:28:10,530 --> 01:28:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  and operational training basically.

01:28:13,314 --> 01:28:14,558
SPEAKER_0:  showing us how to ambush people.

01:28:15,330 --> 01:28:15,646
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:28:16,034 --> 01:28:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  when I started making a group for myself as far as counter-ambush, you know, this cat teams that they call them up here in the US, basically a group of...

01:28:24,226 --> 01:28:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  a group to respond to a high violent ambush.

01:28:27,554 --> 01:28:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  First off, the first rule if you find yourself in an ambush.

01:28:30,882 --> 01:28:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  it wasn't a successful ambush because if you find yourself in it, you're alive. Yes.

01:28:35,938 --> 01:28:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  But if you want to create an amazing counter ambush team, you have to, you know.

01:28:40,738 --> 01:28:42,078
SPEAKER_0:  You have to make them ambushers.

01:28:42,434 --> 01:28:43,614
SPEAKER_0:  and with ambushing you.

01:28:44,386 --> 01:28:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  figure out where all the...

01:28:46,178 --> 01:28:53,790
SPEAKER_0:  opportunities of not only successfully doing what you need to do are in your favor, but also to escape with your life.

01:28:54,754 --> 01:29:00,830
SPEAKER_0:  We're not going to be received by virgins in heaven. That's not the type of mentality that we had down there. But-

01:29:01,762 --> 01:29:07,358
SPEAKER_0:  we start learning about some of these things and also seeing cartel forces apply some of these ambush tactics too.

01:29:07,778 --> 01:29:09,653
SPEAKER_0:  the military or the federal forces.

01:29:09,653 --> 01:29:13,877
SPEAKER_1:  an ambush or what are we talking about? So that's a surprise attack with an asymmetry power

01:29:13,877 --> 01:29:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  or kind of thing.

01:29:14,882 --> 01:29:15,326
SPEAKER_0:  There's a.

01:29:15,554 --> 01:29:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  contingency somewhere moving towards a place that you control and own.

01:29:19,810 --> 01:29:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  where you have the advantages, where...

01:29:21,890 --> 01:29:30,366
SPEAKER_0:  They can't see you, but you can see them. Or they can't predict you, but you can predict where they're gonna pass. Go through places where they forcibly have to pass.

01:29:31,106 --> 01:29:32,798
SPEAKER_0:  places where they're predictable.

01:29:33,122 --> 01:29:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  places where you can.

01:29:34,818 --> 01:29:40,443
SPEAKER_0:  not only predict, but also have a plan for yourself to escape and exit that place. So how do you transform?

01:29:40,443 --> 01:29:41,193
SPEAKER_1:  Conor Ambush.

01:29:41,193 --> 01:29:42,494
SPEAKER_0:  You turn into a...

01:29:42,914 --> 01:29:45,987
SPEAKER_0:  like a perfect ambusher. That's how you train for counter-ambusher.

01:29:45,987 --> 01:29:49,342
SPEAKER_1:  trying to make sure you have more information about other people.

01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:51,765
SPEAKER_1:  you have the element of surprise of

01:29:51,765 --> 01:29:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  of those things. And Musashi would say, you know your enemy, know his sword. You know, basically that.

01:29:56,930 --> 01:29:58,046
SPEAKER_0:  you know, simplified.

01:29:58,274 --> 01:30:00,542
SPEAKER_1:  There's a lot of enemies around you.

01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:03,230
SPEAKER_1:  Mexico there's a lot of uncertainty right?

01:30:03,938 --> 01:30:05,813
SPEAKER_1:  I guess that's what route analysis is.

01:30:05,813 --> 01:30:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, you prepare for the probable.

01:30:08,706 --> 01:30:11,102
SPEAKER_0:  And if the impossible happens, you're halfway out of it.

01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:12,382
SPEAKER_0:  Hopefully.

01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  And if you find yourself in an ambush, it wasn't a successful one.

01:30:16,450 --> 01:30:21,630
SPEAKER_0:  as far as our training and the mindset, my experience with it.

01:30:22,466 --> 01:30:23,102
SPEAKER_0:  You've...

01:30:23,458 --> 01:30:24,478
SPEAKER_0:  The Adversarial.

01:30:24,706 --> 01:30:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  thinking part of it has always been a very powerful one, I think one that a lot of people ignore.

01:30:30,274 --> 01:30:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  leave to the wayside.

01:30:32,226 --> 01:30:35,294
SPEAKER_0:  Specifically in all conflicts out there, there's a tendency for...

01:30:35,874 --> 01:30:41,150
SPEAKER_0:  a military force or a conventional force of any kind to be trained in a way where they dehumanize the enemy.

01:30:42,242 --> 01:30:48,766
SPEAKER_0:  And when that happens, you become blind to the enemy's story. It's his capability, his story, his ability.

01:30:49,474 --> 01:30:49,918
SPEAKER_0:  uh

01:30:50,306 --> 01:30:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  if you treat the other side like an inhuman monster.

01:30:54,434 --> 01:30:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  it's hard to take notes, you know?

01:30:56,610 --> 01:30:57,735
SPEAKER_0:  So there's a part of this.

01:30:57,735 --> 01:30:58,238
SPEAKER_1:  is.

01:30:58,594 --> 01:31:00,478
SPEAKER_1:  a radical empathy for it.

01:31:01,154 --> 01:31:02,279
SPEAKER_1:  for the quote unquote enemy.

01:31:02,279 --> 01:31:09,694
SPEAKER_0:  At least for me personally, I wasn't one of the guys that would grab them and beat the shit out of them and put them in the back of a van. Tie them up and gag them.

01:31:10,274 --> 01:31:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  So you're able to see them as humans.

01:31:12,290 --> 01:31:18,878
SPEAKER_0:  I learned that from my mother, you know, she said, nobody's against you there for themselves. There isn't a transition toiality, no plan, no

01:31:19,394 --> 01:31:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  you will make friends of enemies.

01:31:21,922 --> 01:31:26,046
SPEAKER_0:  She said that when I graduated and I've carried that with me throughout my whole career.

01:31:26,562 --> 01:31:29,086
SPEAKER_1:  But isn't there then a pain of killing another human?

01:31:29,538 --> 01:31:30,110
SPEAKER_1:  As always.

01:31:30,786 --> 01:31:32,062
SPEAKER_1:  but there isn't.

01:31:32,514 --> 01:31:32,990
SPEAKER_1:  again.

01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:36,625
SPEAKER_1:  I apologize to go back to Ukraine as my only experience of this kind of hor-

01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:38,875
SPEAKER_0:  It is a powerful experience.

01:31:38,875 --> 01:31:40,958
SPEAKER_1:  There's a dehumanization that happens.

01:31:41,698 --> 01:31:43,454
SPEAKER_1:  I suppose this is common in war.

01:31:44,002 --> 01:31:45,950
SPEAKER_1:  There's something like a video game aspect.

01:31:46,370 --> 01:31:47,806
SPEAKER_1:  or people are almost having fun.

01:31:48,354 --> 01:31:49,150
SPEAKER_1:  There's a humor.

01:31:49,858 --> 01:31:52,638
SPEAKER_1:  And I think underneath that, the prerequisite.

01:31:53,026 --> 01:31:57,918
SPEAKER_1:  is to see the enemy in the same way you see the enemy when you play Call of Duty. You don't really think...

01:31:58,498 --> 01:32:00,830
SPEAKER_1:  You're thinking of them as NPCs, the bad guys.

01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:02,750
SPEAKER_1:  The Russians are called orcs.

01:32:03,682 --> 01:32:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  in Ukraine.

01:32:04,930 --> 01:32:06,055
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, there's all kinds of other names.

01:32:06,055 --> 01:32:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  For us it was Mugrosos.

01:32:08,418 --> 01:32:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  malandros mugrosos like dirty people.

01:32:11,074 --> 01:32:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  There's always something.

01:32:12,226 --> 01:32:14,046
SPEAKER_1:  over time. Those are just words.

01:32:14,434 --> 01:32:15,998
SPEAKER_1:  But over time it gathers.

01:32:16,514 --> 01:32:18,078
SPEAKER_1:  a kind of, um...

01:32:18,690 --> 01:32:21,598
SPEAKER_1:  like a meaning to it that's more than just the words.

01:32:21,858 --> 01:32:22,398
SPEAKER_1:  works.

01:32:22,818 --> 01:32:23,966
SPEAKER_1:  They're less than human.

01:32:24,546 --> 01:32:25,918
SPEAKER_1:  They're dirty, they're...

01:32:26,466 --> 01:32:29,790
SPEAKER_1:  too dumb to understand the evil they're doing or whatever the

01:32:29,954 --> 01:32:31,070
SPEAKER_0:  It's useful.TEXT biomarquable

01:32:31,458 --> 01:32:34,782
SPEAKER_1:  It's part of the program. Like that's what I've talked to soldiers.

01:32:35,298 --> 01:32:35,614
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:32:36,418 --> 01:32:37,278
SPEAKER_1:  Some of them.

01:32:37,570 --> 01:32:39,774
SPEAKER_1:  do have stories of momentarily.

01:32:40,354 --> 01:32:42,590
SPEAKER_1:  remembering that there's a human on the other side.

01:32:43,426 --> 01:32:45,086
SPEAKER_1:  I talked to one woman.

01:32:46,530 --> 01:32:48,318
SPEAKER_1:  who's this really badass soldier.

01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:52,734
SPEAKER_1:  She saw this really brave soldier on the other side.

01:32:53,474 --> 01:32:54,526
SPEAKER_1:  do something that's...

01:32:55,394 --> 01:32:55,742
SPEAKER_1:  Buzz.

01:32:56,258 --> 01:32:57,310
SPEAKER_1:  almost stupid.

01:32:57,954 --> 01:32:59,006
SPEAKER_1:  how brave it was.

01:32:59,746 --> 01:33:00,190
SPEAKER_1:  And then.

01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:02,590
SPEAKER_1:  she was trying to shoot him and she missed.

01:33:03,458 --> 01:33:05,982
SPEAKER_1:  and she said she could sleep the night after.

01:33:06,914 --> 01:33:07,678
SPEAKER_1:  Thinking.

01:33:09,090 --> 01:33:10,846
SPEAKER_1:  Why did she miss? Why did she miss?

01:33:11,522 --> 01:33:12,350
SPEAKER_1:  And then she thought.

01:33:12,802 --> 01:33:14,462
SPEAKER_1:  She missed because...

01:33:14,722 --> 01:33:15,646
SPEAKER_1:  He was a hero.

01:33:16,194 --> 01:33:21,566
SPEAKER_1:  And she had this brief realization that there was a hero on the other side. The other side is heroes. Yeah.

01:33:21,826 --> 01:33:26,590
SPEAKER_1:  And then, but then that quickly disappeared. Yeah. This moment as a human being.

01:33:27,106 --> 01:33:30,302
SPEAKER_1:  that rises to defend his nation, to defend his people.

01:33:30,626 --> 01:33:32,501
SPEAKER_1:  and he could be heroic on the other side.

01:33:32,501 --> 01:33:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  There are things that we're trained to depress or

01:33:36,066 --> 01:33:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  Concealer Hide.

01:33:37,314 --> 01:33:40,222
SPEAKER_0:  and kill in us when you're trained for something like that.

01:33:40,706 --> 01:33:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  Or when you're in conflict zone like that and you hear the narrative constantly being blared out that the other side is an orc.

01:33:46,530 --> 01:33:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  or.

01:33:47,266 --> 01:33:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  you know, whatever word you want to use.

01:33:50,082 --> 01:33:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  But, you know.

01:33:51,266 --> 01:33:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  We live in a day and age when you can see Americans going off to Japan and shaking hands with some of their former enemies. Some of us have seen that.

01:34:00,418 --> 01:34:01,758
SPEAKER_0:  and how things change.

01:34:02,306 --> 01:34:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  I think years from now, a lot of the stuff that we are taking right now is of the utmost importance won't matter anymore.

01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:12,094
SPEAKER_1:  The question is how many years? That's the question I asked.

01:34:12,386 --> 01:34:13,470
SPEAKER_1:  of a lot of people.

01:34:14,306 --> 01:34:15,486
SPEAKER_1:  in that part of the world.

01:34:16,674 --> 01:34:18,526
SPEAKER_1:  and a lot of them currently.

01:34:19,010 --> 01:34:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  They're also self aware about it. They're like.

01:34:21,410 --> 01:34:26,046
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not sure I trust my current feelings. But the current feelings are generational.

01:34:26,690 --> 01:34:29,822
SPEAKER_1:  Like for decades, I will not just hate.

01:34:30,466 --> 01:34:32,775
SPEAKER_1:  the leadership of Russia.

01:34:32,775 --> 01:34:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  people.

01:34:33,858 --> 01:34:41,733
SPEAKER_0:  I can't understand that on my side of my life experience because you know our war has been an internal war you know amongst our people our monster houses.

01:34:41,733 --> 01:34:43,038
SPEAKER_1:  That is the propaganda.

01:34:43,362 --> 01:34:48,926
SPEAKER_1:  There's also a deep grain of truth that there is a oneness to the people of that region. Yeah.

01:34:49,922 --> 01:34:54,046
SPEAKER_1:  people will get very offended at that idea because right now it's a very strong

01:34:54,466 --> 01:34:55,806
SPEAKER_1:  Nationalist Borders.

01:34:56,290 --> 01:34:57,886
SPEAKER_1:  but there is a cultural history.

01:34:58,786 --> 01:34:59,102
SPEAKER_1:  that.

01:34:59,362 --> 01:35:04,510
SPEAKER_1:  connects people. I mean, in some deep sense, we're all connected. Welcome from Western Africa.

01:35:04,866 --> 01:35:07,102
SPEAKER_1:  and then all came from fish before then, depending on.

01:35:07,458 --> 01:35:08,382
SPEAKER_1:  Here, uh...

01:35:08,898 --> 01:35:09,598
SPEAKER_1:  I believe you.

01:35:09,890 --> 01:35:12,222
SPEAKER_1:  of history of life on Earth.

01:35:12,674 --> 01:35:13,278
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:35:14,178 --> 01:35:16,158
SPEAKER_1:  but there is a oneness to us.

01:35:16,674 --> 01:35:17,799
SPEAKER_1:  Often you forget that.

01:35:17,799 --> 01:35:19,998
SPEAKER_0:  in conflict. I had an experience.

01:35:20,290 --> 01:35:20,862
SPEAKER_0:  working.

01:35:21,826 --> 01:35:23,934
SPEAKER_0:  there was a friend of mine who took the other path.

01:35:25,314 --> 01:35:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  Ah.

01:35:26,210 --> 01:35:28,734
SPEAKER_0:  and went to work for some of these criminal groups.

01:35:29,762 --> 01:35:31,678
SPEAKER_0:  I was operational and I was...

01:35:32,898 --> 01:35:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  we saw a bunch of people in a gas station.

01:35:35,426 --> 01:35:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  part.

01:35:37,378 --> 01:35:44,286
SPEAKER_0:  Back then, the main modus operandi that they had was that they would impersonate or dress up as federal police.

01:35:45,282 --> 01:35:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  And that's how they would move around the city.

01:35:49,698 --> 01:35:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  We saw these suburbans in a...

01:35:51,842 --> 01:35:52,926
SPEAKER_0:  and a gas station.

01:35:53,794 --> 01:35:58,974
SPEAKER_0:  and some of the guys were carrying our AK-47s. That's not a standard issue firearm.

01:35:59,970 --> 01:36:00,510
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:36:01,634 --> 01:36:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we...

01:36:02,914 --> 01:36:05,182
SPEAKER_0:  I saw that and I got off on foot.

01:36:05,442 --> 01:36:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  and walk by.

01:36:07,330 --> 01:36:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  to try and get her.

01:36:09,090 --> 01:36:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  you know, better sense of what was going on. I took everything off.

01:36:13,026 --> 01:36:14,398
SPEAKER_0:  wearing jeans and a t-shirt.

01:36:15,394 --> 01:36:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  And I got a whistle from one of the guys.

01:36:17,986 --> 01:36:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  that was there and my name was called.

01:36:22,338 --> 01:36:24,222

01:36:46,722 --> 01:36:51,166
SPEAKER_0:  When I say kid, I mean, he was my age. Now to my eyes, he's always going to be younger now.

SPEAKER_0:  in my ear.

01:38:28,482 --> 01:38:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  I know what you do for a living. It's not a safe place for you to be.

01:38:32,642 --> 01:38:33,630
SPEAKER_0:  and I walk off.

01:38:37,634 --> 01:38:39,742

SPEAKER_0:  then it was.

01:38:58,338 --> 01:38:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  It was over.

01:39:00,610 --> 01:39:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  So he didn't survive that.

01:39:03,138 --> 01:39:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  I will walk through.

01:39:04,674 --> 01:39:05,406
SPEAKER_0:  the bodies.

01:39:05,698 --> 01:39:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:39:06,338 --> 01:39:08,222
SPEAKER_0:  the cars that were left, you know, there was.

01:39:09,186 --> 01:39:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  bodies all over the place, people left there.

01:39:12,642 --> 01:39:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  It was a mess.

01:39:16,162 --> 01:39:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  spent like an hour looking for him

01:39:21,122 --> 01:39:22,846
SPEAKER_0:  The only way I could recognize him was his hair.

01:39:25,410 --> 01:39:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:39:26,242 --> 01:39:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  I stayed with his body.

01:39:28,866 --> 01:39:29,406
SPEAKER_0:  All night.

01:39:29,666 --> 01:39:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  There's a...

01:39:31,426 --> 01:39:32,350
SPEAKER_0:  There's a bridge.

01:39:33,122 --> 01:39:36,414
SPEAKER_0:  in Tijuana that goes over the river in a place called La Mesa.

01:39:37,442 --> 01:39:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  and that's where the forensic offices were.

01:39:40,482 --> 01:39:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  His body was taken there and I stayed with his body until it was released.

01:39:44,834 --> 01:39:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  I told his family about it.

01:39:48,642 --> 01:39:49,214
SPEAKER_0:  Because I knew them.

01:39:50,178 --> 01:39:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  that aspect of, you know, us versus them or they're the enemy. Do you like that?

01:39:55,522 --> 01:39:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  Hello, my mom.

01:39:57,506 --> 01:40:03,070
SPEAKER_0:  told me those words. Nobody's against you, they're just for themselves. So don't make the mistake of dehumanizing anybody.

01:40:03,938 --> 01:40:05,063
SPEAKER_0:  and those roles could have been.

01:40:05,063 --> 01:40:05,813
SPEAKER_1:  easily.

01:40:05,813 --> 01:40:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  Burst.

01:40:07,362 --> 01:40:08,574
SPEAKER_0:  I could have been shot in the face there.

01:40:08,994 --> 01:40:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  that aspect that conflict brings where they're saying.

01:40:11,746 --> 01:40:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  bad guys, good guys, you know?

01:40:13,634 --> 01:40:15,006
SPEAKER_0:  uh, heroes.

01:40:15,554 --> 01:40:17,182
SPEAKER_0:  villains, you know, how you

01:40:18,626 --> 01:40:22,014
SPEAKER_0:  There's an innocence to that that it goes away

01:40:22,402 --> 01:40:23,550
SPEAKER_0:  Is your mom still with us?

01:40:24,386 --> 01:40:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  almost three weeks before I decided to quit.

01:40:27,586 --> 01:40:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  She passed away.

01:40:29,218 --> 01:40:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  Did that have a role to play?

01:40:30,690 --> 01:40:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  Major one.

01:40:32,578 --> 01:40:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  after I got done on the protection detail with the governor.

01:40:37,602 --> 01:40:40,606
SPEAKER_0:  Like everything down there again the whole cycle

01:40:41,378 --> 01:40:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  He got his turn, so when he went away...

01:40:44,098 --> 01:40:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:40:45,058 --> 01:40:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  No politics change.

01:40:46,434 --> 01:40:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:40:47,554 --> 01:40:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  down there basically if you're a.

01:40:49,634 --> 01:40:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  can go to the editorial candidate.

01:40:52,386 --> 01:40:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  You have either a friend, a friend of a friend or a family member be the head bodyguard guy.

01:40:58,978 --> 01:41:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  The guy that won the elections had his...

01:41:01,378 --> 01:41:08,798
SPEAKER_0:  bodyguard guy already there. So all of us were sent back to whatever we came from. So I went back to work on the streets.

01:41:09,026 --> 01:41:09,406
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

01:41:10,210 --> 01:41:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  I was back on the operations group. I was working with the sub director directly with him, basically back on the ground doing.

01:41:18,626 --> 01:41:20,542
SPEAKER_0:  stuff that I was doing before that job.

01:41:21,026 --> 01:41:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  We were moving away from the successes that had been had by people like Liza Ola when they were in charge of that whole process to people that I used to work with.

01:41:31,714 --> 01:41:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  some of the only successes in that counter.

01:41:34,146 --> 01:41:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  push against cartels in Mexico.

01:41:37,122 --> 01:41:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  and you can kind of like, it's documented, you can read about it out there, a bunch of people wrote papers on it.

01:41:42,274 --> 01:41:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  Some of the only successes were had by Liza Ola in the places where he had leadership. He not only...

01:41:47,330 --> 01:41:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  pacified Tijuana.

01:41:50,338 --> 01:41:54,270
SPEAKER_0:  He also did the same in Juarez. He was sent to be the police chief in Juarez.

01:41:55,682 --> 01:41:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  but politics change and heroes become villains.

01:41:58,786 --> 01:42:02,686
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of people started calling him a villain because of his...

01:42:03,106 --> 01:42:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  on orthodox approach and human rights violations and all this type of stuff kind of come.

01:42:07,746 --> 01:42:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  the forefront.

01:42:09,506 --> 01:42:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  and people forgot.

01:42:10,594 --> 01:42:15,326
SPEAKER_0:  People forgot what it took to get Tijuana off the most dangerous city list on the planet.

01:42:16,450 --> 01:42:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

01:42:18,370 --> 01:42:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  People were vilified.

01:42:19,650 --> 01:42:20,606
SPEAKER_0:  people like him

01:42:20,834 --> 01:42:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:42:21,506 --> 01:42:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  and the police force that I was a part of started getting.

01:42:25,026 --> 01:42:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  compromised.

01:42:26,690 --> 01:42:30,942
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of the things that were put forth to try and keep us honest. There was a program.

01:42:31,554 --> 01:42:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  They have these centers.

01:42:32,834 --> 01:42:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  the C3s.

01:42:35,010 --> 01:42:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  Basically, you would go there every year. You would get your-

01:42:38,754 --> 01:42:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  financials checked, you would get a physical, psychological evaluation, you would get a polygraph exam done on you, all of the works. The jump into the

01:42:46,594 --> 01:42:48,638
SPEAKER_0:  See if you were somebody doing something wrong.

01:42:49,538 --> 01:42:51,230
SPEAKER_0:  And all of that was.

01:42:51,490 --> 01:42:52,734
SPEAKER_0:  canceled because...

01:42:53,666 --> 01:42:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  It violated.

01:42:54,850 --> 01:43:03,358
SPEAKER_0:  human rights if you get fired from a job because of a failed polygraph exam because that was not an actual admissible way of firing somebody.

01:43:04,226 --> 01:43:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  So all of a sudden you had people that were known cartel.

01:43:07,426 --> 01:43:08,350
SPEAKER_0:  compromise people.

01:43:09,218 --> 01:43:11,774
SPEAKER_0:  that were fired five, six years ago.

01:43:12,130 --> 01:43:14,078
SPEAKER_0:  showing back up to work.

01:43:15,362 --> 01:43:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  with their back paid and everything.

01:43:18,274 --> 01:43:19,678
SPEAKER_0:  So this is...

01:43:20,034 --> 01:43:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  So this started happening and.

01:43:22,274 --> 01:43:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  it quickly realized that it was.

01:43:24,802 --> 01:43:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  gonna be hard to stay there.

01:43:27,170 --> 01:43:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:43:28,834 --> 01:43:31,806
SPEAKER_0:  I was driving home from work.

01:43:32,290 --> 01:43:33,918
SPEAKER_0:  and I got a call from my brother.

01:43:35,330 --> 01:43:36,414
SPEAKER_0:  That, uh...

01:43:37,506 --> 01:43:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  my mom had been going through some health.

01:43:39,842 --> 01:43:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  issues.

01:43:42,114 --> 01:43:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  that had turned into psychiatric issues.

01:43:46,242 --> 01:43:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  We were basically taking turns trying to...

01:43:49,186 --> 01:43:54,686
SPEAKER_0:  take care of her, you know, locking the doors so she wouldn't wander off and stuff like that so not only was I dealing

01:43:55,298 --> 01:44:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  with the job on the street, but I was dealing with that. And also I had a

01:44:01,442 --> 01:44:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  a two year old.

01:44:02,914 --> 01:44:04,606
SPEAKER_0:  and a marriage that was...

01:44:05,890 --> 01:44:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  difficult.

01:44:06,946 --> 01:44:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  the Ted time.

01:44:08,770 --> 01:44:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  I was trying to figure all these things out. Made more difficult by your job?

01:44:14,050 --> 01:44:20,830
SPEAKER_0:  It's not a financially secure job, you know, and the pressures that it has and the odd hours and all that made it really hard.

01:44:23,554 --> 01:44:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  And then all of a sudden my brother calls me and tells me that let's go to the hospital my mom.

01:44:29,090 --> 01:44:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  Something happened to my mom?

01:44:32,162 --> 01:44:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  It wasn't my turn to watch her, so...

01:44:35,810 --> 01:44:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  I felt pretty shitty about that.

01:44:38,242 --> 01:44:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  I got to the hospital and...

01:44:42,562 --> 01:44:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  The doctors came out and told us that she was gone.

01:44:46,146 --> 01:44:46,750
SPEAKER_0:  It was a...

01:44:47,490 --> 01:44:47,998
SPEAKER_0:  of

01:44:48,354 --> 01:44:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  massive heart attack.

01:44:49,858 --> 01:44:51,646
SPEAKER_0:  She had a pacemaker by then.

01:44:52,642 --> 01:44:53,502
SPEAKER_0:  So she was gone?

01:44:54,946 --> 01:44:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  She was in her 60s.

01:44:57,026 --> 01:45:02,814
SPEAKER_0:  So we kind of expected something, but that was like.

01:45:04,994 --> 01:45:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  hard for me.

01:45:06,178 --> 01:45:07,134
SPEAKER_0:  She was my...

01:45:08,002 --> 01:45:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  center.

01:45:08,930 --> 01:45:13,055
SPEAKER_0:  She was going to be the one that I would ask for advice as far as work, you know, if I should leave or not.

01:45:13,055 --> 01:45:14,555
SPEAKER_1:  The ground was removed from under the ground.

01:45:14,555 --> 01:45:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  There was nobody there was yeah, there's nothing underneath me

01:45:17,826 --> 01:45:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  I get three days off work.

01:45:20,386 --> 01:45:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  That's what they gave me.

01:45:23,874 --> 01:45:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  And, uh...

01:45:26,722 --> 01:45:28,958
SPEAKER_0:  I'm trying to grieve as I go back to work.

01:45:30,978 --> 01:45:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  Dark shit crosses my mind as I'm going through that process of trying to figure things out.

01:45:36,418 --> 01:45:37,543
SPEAKER_0:  I like dark shake like so.

01:45:37,543 --> 01:45:40,638
SPEAKER_1:  Suicide, right, Darkshit? Yeah. Very low for you.

01:45:40,770 --> 01:45:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  Very, very hard. Yeah.

01:45:43,618 --> 01:45:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  I wasn't allowed to grieve, basically.

01:45:45,762 --> 01:45:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  and I wasn't allowed to read for a few years.

01:45:48,930 --> 01:45:49,726
SPEAKER_0:  for different reasons.

01:45:51,074 --> 01:45:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  I went back to work.

01:45:52,322 --> 01:45:56,447
SPEAKER_1:  You weren't allowing other people, also you yourself, were not allowing yourself to agree with.

01:45:56,447 --> 01:46:00,254
SPEAKER_0:  There was other people with me that didn't allow me to grieve.

01:46:01,122 --> 01:46:01,502
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

01:46:02,338 --> 01:46:06,654
SPEAKER_0:  I went to work, got called into the office, and I was basically told that I was going to be reassigned.

01:46:07,970 --> 01:46:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  after what I just went through.

01:46:11,202 --> 01:46:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  the reassignment was going to be something that.

01:46:14,018 --> 01:46:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  Ice.

01:46:14,882 --> 01:46:16,030
SPEAKER_0:  saw as.

01:46:17,314 --> 01:46:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  unacceptable.

01:46:19,362 --> 01:46:20,414
SPEAKER_0:  It was, uh...

01:46:21,474 --> 01:46:23,422
SPEAKER_0:  people in charge at that point were.

01:46:23,650 --> 01:46:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  obviously.

01:46:24,642 --> 01:46:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  corrupted.

01:46:26,306 --> 01:46:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  And what I got from their conversation was that they wanted us to work for a specific side.

01:46:33,314 --> 01:46:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:46:34,594 --> 01:46:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  I knew that that was the time to go.

01:46:37,858 --> 01:46:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  I...

01:46:39,522 --> 01:46:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  asked for a license.

01:46:41,250 --> 01:46:42,846
SPEAKER_0:  Basically licenses.

01:46:43,202 --> 01:46:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  unpaid absence from work, basically a leave of absence.

01:46:46,114 --> 01:46:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's what you call it up here.

01:46:47,810 --> 01:46:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  which by law is allowed.

01:46:50,690 --> 01:46:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  and I was denied.

01:46:52,674 --> 01:46:53,214
SPEAKER_0:  for no reason.

01:46:54,722 --> 01:46:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  So...

01:46:56,994 --> 01:46:58,558
SPEAKER_0:  I'm invested in this job, you know.

01:46:58,914 --> 01:47:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  I have a...

01:47:01,762 --> 01:47:06,398
SPEAKER_0:  I have a good salary and I have a category in there. So you...

01:47:06,690 --> 01:47:08,062
SPEAKER_0:  by the level of...

01:47:08,418 --> 01:47:10,686
SPEAKER_0:  time you spend in there you get a category. So I was at.

01:47:11,074 --> 01:47:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  pretty high category agent.

01:47:15,202 --> 01:47:25,982
SPEAKER_0:  all this training and again, training that would be useless in the private sector or in the public sector in Mexico. I couldn't change from one corporation to another. I couldn't go to work for another police institution.

01:47:28,162 --> 01:47:30,206
SPEAKER_0:  I took a deep breath and uh...

01:47:31,618 --> 01:47:32,190
SPEAKER_0:  I resign.

01:47:33,122 --> 01:47:35,550
SPEAKER_0:  I went to the office, I said I need to resign.

01:47:35,778 --> 01:47:36,734
SPEAKER_0:  They say what?

01:47:37,154 --> 01:47:40,542
SPEAKER_0:  I need to resign. Some of the people in the office that knew me from a long time were like, What?

01:47:40,770 --> 01:47:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  wrong with you? I thought I was having a mental breakdown.

01:47:46,562 --> 01:47:50,558
SPEAKER_0:  Ended all over the, all the paperwork, took a big trash bag, put all my stuff in there.

01:47:51,362 --> 01:47:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  plate armor.

01:47:52,482 --> 01:47:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  to your gas grenades.

01:47:54,434 --> 01:47:55,454
SPEAKER_0:  Gasmaska.

01:47:56,194 --> 01:48:04,798
SPEAKER_0:  Satellite radio, MP5 magazines, an MP5, a submachine gun, Glock magazines, all of it, helmets.

01:48:06,050 --> 01:48:08,766
SPEAKER_0:  and I put her in the armory.

01:48:10,018 --> 01:48:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  And I...

01:48:12,386 --> 01:48:12,894
SPEAKER_0:  left.

01:48:14,274 --> 01:48:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  I made some phone calls.

01:48:16,162 --> 01:48:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:48:17,794 --> 01:48:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  I was married to a...

01:48:19,330 --> 01:48:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  an American.

01:48:20,258 --> 01:48:21,438
SPEAKER_0:  and my daughter's American.

01:48:22,658 --> 01:48:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  I never envisioned myself coming to the United States, do that process for myself. So I was invested in that job. I thought I was gonna...

01:48:30,754 --> 01:48:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  die or retire from that.

01:48:33,954 --> 01:48:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

01:48:36,514 --> 01:48:40,734
SPEAKER_0:  It quickly became like an issue because everybody was wondering why I left the job so abruptly.

01:48:41,474 --> 01:48:41,886
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:48:42,914 --> 01:48:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  There were some threats made.

01:48:44,482 --> 01:48:45,182
SPEAKER_0:  when I left.

01:48:46,178 --> 01:48:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  by people inside the office.

01:48:48,706 --> 01:48:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  Probably, you know, it's anonymous shit.

01:48:50,978 --> 01:48:55,358
SPEAKER_1:  So there's significant pressure not to leave. It's hard to leave this kind of job. Yeah.

01:48:55,586 --> 01:48:57,566
SPEAKER_1:  The system makes it difficult to leave.

01:48:57,858 --> 01:48:59,006
SPEAKER_1:  the individuals.

01:48:59,554 --> 01:49:01,438
SPEAKER_1:  to the degree they might be corrupted.

01:49:01,762 --> 01:49:03,806
SPEAKER_1:  Really don't want you to leave. There's no support.

01:49:04,034 --> 01:49:05,909
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, there's no support. There's probably the output.

01:49:05,909 --> 01:49:06,686
SPEAKER_1:  of support.

01:49:06,786 --> 01:49:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:49:07,650 --> 01:49:11,518
SPEAKER_1:  almost like implied or explicit or implicit threats.

01:49:13,154 --> 01:49:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  Luckily, I had developed some friendships in the United States with some of the people that I used to work with.

01:49:19,874 --> 01:49:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  and cross-drain with and...

01:49:21,826 --> 01:49:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  some friendships that I developed with people that I would...

01:49:25,730 --> 01:49:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  Just talk to and make friends with, stateside.

01:49:29,122 --> 01:49:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  One of them was a...

01:49:30,338 --> 01:49:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  is a Navy SEAL reservist whose name is Dan Stanchfield.

01:49:34,530 --> 01:49:35,902
SPEAKER_0:  and his wife, Kelly.

01:49:36,546 --> 01:49:37,310
SPEAKER_0:  they

01:49:37,922 --> 01:49:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  open the doors of their house to me and.

01:49:41,378 --> 01:49:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  my kid and my wife at that time.

01:49:44,802 --> 01:49:47,582
SPEAKER_0:  as I seek to basically...

01:49:47,842 --> 01:49:49,470
SPEAKER_0:  Look for the American dream.

01:49:49,986 --> 01:49:50,366
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:49:50,882 --> 01:49:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  I crossed the border.

01:49:53,858 --> 01:49:54,462
SPEAKER_0:  with my kid.

01:49:55,074 --> 01:49:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  And uh...

01:49:56,258 --> 01:49:58,014
SPEAKER_0:  Nobody knew anything, you know, I hadn't.

01:49:58,754 --> 01:50:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  They didn't tell anybody, just my wife.

01:50:02,818 --> 01:50:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  And I was off.

01:50:04,354 --> 01:50:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:50:06,050 --> 01:50:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  When I came to the States, I...

01:50:07,874 --> 01:50:10,846
SPEAKER_0:  already kind of dabbled in the whole training field and showing.

01:50:11,618 --> 01:50:13,022
SPEAKER_0:  some of my experience to people.

01:50:13,538 --> 01:50:14,206
SPEAKER_0:  So ahead.

01:50:15,202 --> 01:50:17,118
SPEAKER_0:  at least a seed of that out there.

01:50:17,474 --> 01:50:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  people knew me for that.

01:50:19,010 --> 01:50:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:50:20,418 --> 01:50:22,110
SPEAKER_0:  But all of a sudden I was...

01:50:23,746 --> 01:50:26,174
SPEAKER_0:  in the middle of an avocado orchard.

01:50:27,170 --> 01:50:27,646
SPEAKER_0:  Uh-huh.

01:50:28,066 --> 01:50:29,502
SPEAKER_0:  in the

01:50:29,730 --> 01:50:31,070
SPEAKER_0:  middle of California.

01:50:32,258 --> 01:50:33,182
SPEAKER_0:  and everything's quiet.

01:50:33,858 --> 01:50:34,398
SPEAKER_0:  and.

01:50:35,586 --> 01:50:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  There's no more radios going off all of the night. There's no more three cell phones on the counter. There's no guns. There's no rifles. There's no...

01:50:45,026 --> 01:50:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  80 people calling to

01:50:47,330 --> 01:50:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  to calling to see what's going on. There's nothing, it's just quiet.

01:50:52,834 --> 01:50:58,718
SPEAKER_0:  And it's during the time when Trump got elected, so the immigration process that usually would take.

01:51:00,290 --> 01:51:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  and those things go in for me.

01:51:02,082 --> 01:51:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  and migration process it would take.

01:51:04,930 --> 01:51:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  at the most of the year took two years.

01:51:07,714 --> 01:51:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  So I was.

01:51:09,922 --> 01:51:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  It was not her.

01:51:11,010 --> 01:51:12,414
SPEAKER_0:  It's not an easy process.

01:51:12,770 --> 01:51:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  to not only come to the US, but...

01:51:16,098 --> 01:51:18,110
SPEAKER_0:  you know, come to the US with a...

01:51:18,626 --> 01:51:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  with that pressure.

01:51:19,778 --> 01:51:22,846
SPEAKER_0:  of underlying pressure as far as being an immigrant at that time here.

01:51:23,586 --> 01:51:26,302
SPEAKER_1:  and then your own personal psychological, the PTSD.

01:51:26,594 --> 01:51:27,550
SPEAKER_1:  of going.

01:51:27,906 --> 01:51:30,110
SPEAKER_1:  from a war zone to a...

01:51:30,530 --> 01:51:31,582
SPEAKER_0:  avocado orchard.

01:51:32,930 --> 01:51:34,558
SPEAKER_0:  The word PTSD.

01:51:34,786 --> 01:51:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  and TBI and all of these things. I did not, I didn't know any of them.

01:51:40,162 --> 01:51:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  Ah.

01:51:41,570 --> 01:51:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  It was through people that I got to meet.

01:51:44,418 --> 01:51:48,446
SPEAKER_0:  in the training field that were Marines.

01:51:49,474 --> 01:51:56,350
SPEAKER_0:  seals, maraschalk guys, those types of people that started giving words to some of the things that I felt.

01:51:56,674 --> 01:51:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  which I didn't really know.

01:51:59,138 --> 01:52:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  we would treat post-traumatic stress with alcohol and vacation time.

01:52:04,962 --> 01:52:05,886
SPEAKER_0:  The bottle of mezcal.

01:52:06,754 --> 01:52:08,190
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, when you see the bottom of it.

01:52:09,314 --> 01:52:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  The troubles are gone. X issue

01:52:11,106 --> 01:52:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  immediately.

01:52:12,706 --> 01:52:14,334
SPEAKER_0:  I was an alcoholic.

01:52:14,722 --> 01:52:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  as well as all the other stuff I was.

01:52:18,050 --> 01:52:20,542
SPEAKER_0:  I was drinking myself to sleep every third night.

01:52:22,530 --> 01:52:25,598
SPEAKER_0:  My marriage obviously was failing.

01:52:26,882 --> 01:52:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  It wasn't easy for her, you know, she...

01:52:30,338 --> 01:52:33,438
SPEAKER_0:  She was brave and she did what she could and I...

01:52:33,698 --> 01:52:35,134
SPEAKER_0:  totally respect and understand her.

01:52:35,458 --> 01:52:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  process with it but.

01:52:38,786 --> 01:52:39,902
SPEAKER_0:  when it's quiet.

01:52:40,418 --> 01:52:41,246
SPEAKER_0:  That's when it hits ya.

01:52:42,018 --> 01:52:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  That's what I think that's what a lot of people experience when they come back from a conflict zone.

01:52:46,274 --> 01:52:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the uh...

01:52:48,578 --> 01:52:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  everything that was life and death.

01:52:50,626 --> 01:52:56,126
SPEAKER_0:  Everything that mattered, all the noise, all the chaos, all the people that are around you that would die for you, kill for you.

01:52:56,546 --> 01:52:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  you would kill for them.

01:52:58,210 --> 01:52:59,550
SPEAKER_0:  I'll leave.

01:53:00,034 --> 01:53:06,846
SPEAKER_0:  millions of dollars worth of equipment and stuff like that you're responsible for now are all gone and it's just you walking into a

01:53:07,106 --> 01:53:08,254
SPEAKER_0:  Circle K and buying.

01:53:08,738 --> 01:53:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  weekends at Foster's to

01:53:10,946 --> 01:53:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  drink yourself to sleep.

01:53:12,738 --> 01:53:15,614
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, you write on your Patreon brilliantly.

01:53:17,026 --> 01:53:18,878
SPEAKER_1:  about PTSD.

01:53:19,554 --> 01:53:22,078
SPEAKER_1:  about the cost of things you've done and seen.

01:53:23,106 --> 01:53:24,446
SPEAKER_1:  quote, when it's over.

01:53:25,122 --> 01:53:29,822
SPEAKER_1:  And we are far from that chaos and noise of death being close and life being real.

01:53:31,266 --> 01:53:36,958
SPEAKER_1:  That is when some of us remember in the quiet nights in a field in Tennessee looking at fireflies.

01:53:37,346 --> 01:53:38,398
SPEAKER_1:  Walking through a fair.

01:53:39,138 --> 01:53:40,446
SPEAKER_1:  Holding hands with a lover.

01:53:41,122 --> 01:53:41,854
SPEAKER_1:  asking.

01:53:42,114 --> 01:53:43,070
SPEAKER_1:  You what's wrong?

01:53:44,194 --> 01:53:45,694
SPEAKER_1:  at your kid's birthday party.

01:53:46,306 --> 01:53:48,670
SPEAKER_1:  Leave early to avoid the ending of a celebration.

01:53:49,474 --> 01:53:51,550
SPEAKER_1:  That is what the quiet means to some of us.

01:53:52,642 --> 01:53:54,494
SPEAKER_1:  So that's speaking to that silence, the quiet.

01:53:55,170 --> 01:53:58,398
SPEAKER_1:  How do you live with and thrive with?

01:53:58,914 --> 01:54:01,662
SPEAKER_1:  this newly learned term of PTSD.

01:54:01,922 --> 01:54:07,262
SPEAKER_0:  If anything, I would recommend people that have any of these issues to go to places where other people have.

01:54:07,970 --> 01:54:09,214
SPEAKER_0:  their issues so you can.

01:54:09,890 --> 01:54:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  It's not a competition, but you get to see the scope of problems in the world and you sometimes feel kind of lucky as far as your own.

01:54:17,666 --> 01:54:22,654
SPEAKER_1:  Like it humbles you. Yeah. And makes you appreciate all the different kinds of struggles that people go through.

01:54:22,754 --> 01:54:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I mean, I went through some horrible shit, but...

01:54:25,250 --> 01:54:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  some people that went through other more or less yet or...

01:54:28,450 --> 01:54:28,958
SPEAKER_0:  stuff that I.

01:54:29,186 --> 01:54:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think I could have survived.

01:54:31,490 --> 01:54:33,022
SPEAKER_0:  when I went through that process of.

01:54:33,538 --> 01:54:39,614
SPEAKER_0:  figuring things out, you know, the first thing that glaringly pointed out or stuck out to me was my inability to...

01:54:41,730 --> 01:54:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  Process things.

01:54:43,330 --> 01:54:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  Like there was a big pause button there.

01:54:45,570 --> 01:54:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  A giant one. Everything was on pause.

01:54:48,354 --> 01:54:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  My...

01:54:49,314 --> 01:54:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  breathing.

01:54:50,274 --> 01:54:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  Not only my mom, but my brother.

01:54:53,474 --> 01:54:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  So I had a pause button on me, so it was like 13 basically.

01:54:57,698 --> 01:54:59,902
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, then I got to bury...

01:55:00,706 --> 01:55:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  Many of my friends.

01:55:03,106 --> 01:55:04,830
SPEAKER_0:  inform their wives or...

01:55:05,090 --> 01:55:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  girlfriends of what happened.

01:55:07,842 --> 01:55:10,526
SPEAKER_0:  And that all, again, was paused because I...

01:55:11,042 --> 01:55:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  wasn't uh...

01:55:12,482 --> 01:55:13,790
SPEAKER_0:  allowed to process.

01:55:14,626 --> 01:55:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  I spent years without going on vacation because I was a workaholic.

01:55:20,162 --> 01:55:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  And uh...

01:55:22,114 --> 01:55:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  I found that the core of my issue is, uh...

01:55:24,994 --> 01:55:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  alcohol.

01:55:26,594 --> 01:55:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  a giant pause button in the form of alcohol. basically.

01:55:30,050 --> 01:55:31,358
SPEAKER_0:  I'll drink my problems away.

01:55:32,354 --> 01:55:33,214
SPEAKER_0:  Specifically, I would.

01:55:33,698 --> 01:55:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  It's like if you have a mess in your house, you just put a big tarp over it, you know, to cover it up and alcohol was that for me.

01:55:40,738 --> 01:55:41,822
SPEAKER_0:  and it fasted.

01:55:42,050 --> 01:55:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  more and more as I

01:55:44,930 --> 01:55:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  not only went through the process of learning about PCSD, but refusing to let that go.

01:55:51,362 --> 01:55:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  You know, like going through therapy and seeing what other people's problems were.

01:55:56,130 --> 01:55:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  I don't wanna...

01:55:57,378 --> 01:56:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  You know, this is the only thing I have. I'm not, you know, I'm not.

01:56:00,418 --> 01:56:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  hurting anybody with it, you know.

01:56:02,370 --> 01:56:05,022
SPEAKER_0:  Why, why am I, why do I need to get rid of that?

01:56:06,082 --> 01:56:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  By this point I was traveling across the country and training people and showing some of the experiences that I had to other people speaking

01:56:13,922 --> 01:56:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  being on podcasts and having conversations like the one I'm having with you.

01:56:17,730 --> 01:56:19,646
SPEAKER_1:  So speaking to the skills that you've developed.

01:56:20,290 --> 01:56:25,182
SPEAKER_0:  and in a way basically reliving and reopening a bunch of shit for myself every time I do it.

01:56:26,082 --> 01:56:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:56:27,394 --> 01:56:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  So I was getting triggered and the way I would manage that was I would drink at the end of the night after a weekend class somewhere when I talk about the fireflies and...

01:56:38,946 --> 01:56:40,126
SPEAKER_0:  a field in Tennessee.

01:56:41,570 --> 01:56:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  It was a moment where I was forcing myself to try and be sober.

01:56:44,834 --> 01:56:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  and we did this medical class out and uh

01:56:47,778 --> 01:56:50,494
SPEAKER_0:  Out in the hills in Tennessee, this beautiful green place.

01:56:50,818 --> 01:56:52,446
SPEAKER_0:  beautiful family there.

01:56:53,346 --> 01:56:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  that hosted us.

01:56:55,138 --> 01:56:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  And it's the first time I ever saw a firefly. So I was like.

01:56:58,338 --> 01:57:00,510
SPEAKER_0:  I thought I was having a hallucinogenic experience.

01:57:00,770 --> 01:57:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  When I say why is the dust glowing?

01:57:04,706 --> 01:57:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  what I thought.

01:57:06,210 --> 01:57:07,070
SPEAKER_0:  a friend of mine.

01:57:08,130 --> 01:57:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  is a veteran.

01:57:10,530 --> 01:57:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  Ran off to the woods and grabbed one.

01:57:13,122 --> 01:57:16,830
SPEAKER_0:  brought it to me and showed it to me. It's like, holy shit, what is that? That's a Firefly.

01:57:17,762 --> 01:57:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  Wow.

01:57:18,530 --> 01:57:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  How do they glow? I don't know.

01:57:20,354 --> 01:57:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  and he's crushing it in his hand and says, gone.

01:57:23,554 --> 01:57:24,062
SPEAKER_0:  And I.

01:57:24,834 --> 01:57:26,878
SPEAKER_0:  you know, brought me back immediately to...

01:57:27,106 --> 01:57:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  Holy shit, you know?

01:57:28,386 --> 01:57:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, it kind of like.

01:57:29,794 --> 01:57:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  I was off somewhere and I was back.

01:57:32,674 --> 01:57:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  And I had to go drink.

01:57:34,914 --> 01:57:40,638
SPEAKER_0:  I went through that process of going off at getting on, going off getting off at my marriage.

01:57:42,466 --> 01:57:43,038
SPEAKER_0:  separate.

01:57:44,482 --> 01:57:45,278
SPEAKER_0:  And that was all.

01:57:46,402 --> 01:57:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  another end of the world.

01:57:47,810 --> 01:57:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  aspect to everything, you know.

01:57:51,042 --> 01:57:56,190
SPEAKER_0:  I lost my mother, I lost the job, and then the marriage failed.

01:57:57,090 --> 01:57:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  and it was on me.

01:57:59,650 --> 01:58:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  I...

01:58:02,242 --> 01:58:05,150
SPEAKER_0:  basically went somewhere and

01:58:05,730 --> 01:58:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  did a stock of everything that was going on.

01:58:11,298 --> 01:58:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  And...

01:58:12,674 --> 01:58:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  and made a decision to.

01:58:14,306 --> 01:58:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  Stop drinking.

01:58:16,546 --> 01:58:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:58:18,562 --> 01:58:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  had some bad relationships after.

01:58:21,122 --> 01:58:24,222
SPEAKER_0:  and I just came to a place where I need to stop drinking.

01:58:24,546 --> 01:58:26,238
SPEAKER_1:  You've gotten to a point so low.

01:58:27,170 --> 01:58:29,598
SPEAKER_1:  Was this a decision you arrived at by yourself?

01:58:30,274 --> 01:58:31,646
SPEAKER_1:  Was there some inspiration?

01:58:32,354 --> 01:58:34,142
SPEAKER_1:  Or was it just the point is so low?

01:58:34,562 --> 01:58:35,710
SPEAKER_1:  Lots so much.

01:58:36,002 --> 01:58:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  It was the start of COVID?

01:58:37,666 --> 01:58:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:58:38,818 --> 01:58:41,726
SPEAKER_0:  This is recent. This is probably too... I'm gonna...

01:58:41,954 --> 01:58:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  I'm gonna have two years over in December.

01:58:45,570 --> 01:58:49,246
SPEAKER_1:  So when you talk to Rogan the first time, you're still struggling with this demon..

01:58:49,538 --> 01:58:53,150
SPEAKER_0:  I was in and out of the car, basically, is what I would say. I was in and out of-

01:58:53,698 --> 01:58:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  and then.

01:58:54,946 --> 01:58:55,998
SPEAKER_0:  trying to get rid of it.

01:58:57,026 --> 01:59:01,182
SPEAKER_1:  That must be a super stressful experience talking to Joe Rogan the first time you drank that night.

01:59:02,242 --> 01:59:02,686
SPEAKER_1:  You remember?

01:59:03,234 --> 01:59:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  The second time I was there, I went somewhere.

01:59:06,210 --> 01:59:07,326
SPEAKER_0:  Godshitface.

01:59:08,226 --> 01:59:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  It was.

01:59:09,474 --> 01:59:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  It was stressful not.

01:59:10,850 --> 01:59:12,926
SPEAKER_0:  not for any other reason than...

01:59:13,186 --> 01:59:16,350
SPEAKER_0:  I felt the responsibility to the people that couldn't speak about it.

01:59:17,378 --> 01:59:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  So that's suppression.

01:59:20,002 --> 01:59:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  It was the start of COVID and things got started getting shut down and slowed down.

01:59:26,466 --> 01:59:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  My dad got really sick and almost died.

01:59:31,842 --> 01:59:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  We had to set up like some Jason Bourne level shit at my brother's place.

01:59:37,250 --> 01:59:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  He was in Mexico, you know, so we had to.

01:59:39,970 --> 01:59:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  bribe a guy to get us an oxygen tank and I had to.

01:59:44,802 --> 01:59:48,702
SPEAKER_0:  Jimmy Riga of respirator.

01:59:48,962 --> 01:59:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  It was some shit.

01:59:52,642 --> 01:59:53,950
SPEAKER_0:  but my dad was like...

01:59:55,586 --> 01:59:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  Thanks for watching!

01:59:56,226 --> 01:59:59,230
SPEAKER_0:  He survived it, you know, everybody, the doctor would like, say goodbye.

02:00:00,034 --> 02:00:03,409
SPEAKER_0:  And my dad was like, yeah, say goodbye to him. and you're gonna keep pouring each one of them over?

02:00:03,409 --> 02:00:03,966
SPEAKER_1:  what's up

02:00:05,378 --> 02:00:06,503
SPEAKER_1:  I guess he does.

02:00:06,503 --> 02:00:11,902
SPEAKER_0:  as a gangster, I got it. Tough guy. He did some gangster shit that day.

02:00:13,826 --> 02:00:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  But on my end, I was being isolated basically as COVID is everybody's slowing down, no more classes, no more excuses to go out there and drink and no more socializing, so.

02:00:23,746 --> 02:00:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  Social drinking turned into alone drinking more and more and more.

02:00:29,602 --> 02:00:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  I bought a bottle of gin.

02:00:33,122 --> 02:00:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  because I was down in Mexico taking care of my dad.

02:00:37,218 --> 02:00:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  and they closed down beer production in Mexico.

02:00:40,930 --> 02:00:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:00:42,082 --> 02:00:42,814
SPEAKER_0:  beer went away.

02:00:43,554 --> 02:00:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  And beer was a way I kind of managed it, you know? It's not Howard alcohol, it's just beer, so, you know?

02:00:50,274 --> 02:00:53,726
SPEAKER_0:  But that went away, so it was just hard alcohol. That was what was available down there.

02:00:54,690 --> 02:00:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  IAR.

02:00:56,290 --> 02:01:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  One night alone at the house, my dad's house, I...

02:01:01,858 --> 02:01:04,126
SPEAKER_0:  I drank a bottle of gin, a whole bottle of gin.

02:01:05,826 --> 02:01:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  I almost died.

02:01:08,130 --> 02:01:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  And after that...

02:01:09,474 --> 02:01:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

02:01:11,490 --> 02:01:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  Some people started noticing that.

02:01:13,794 --> 02:01:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  that I was.

02:01:14,754 --> 02:01:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  isolating more and more and...

02:01:16,898 --> 02:01:18,174
SPEAKER_0:  It was kind of eating away at me.

02:01:21,410 --> 02:01:24,094
SPEAKER_0:  I was in a relationship at that point when I...

02:01:24,930 --> 02:01:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  I started seeing everything just kind of fall apart around me.

02:01:28,514 --> 02:01:29,310
SPEAKER_0:  And.

02:01:30,722 --> 02:01:31,806
SPEAKER_0:  I...

02:01:32,130 --> 02:01:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  I-

02:01:33,154 --> 02:01:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  drank half of a glass of uh

02:01:35,746 --> 02:01:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  Wine.

02:01:37,538 --> 02:01:38,782
SPEAKER_0:  And it made me sick.

02:01:39,234 --> 02:01:41,246
SPEAKER_0:  to my internally in my mind.

02:01:42,370 --> 02:01:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  and my kid.

02:01:44,834 --> 02:01:45,790
SPEAKER_0:  said, uh...

02:01:46,146 --> 02:01:49,950
SPEAKER_0:  to me and I don't know, nobody coached her, nobody said anything to her.

02:01:50,594 --> 02:01:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  It's a pretty intuitive kit.

02:01:53,090 --> 02:01:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  So I don't drink anymore of that.

02:01:55,746 --> 02:01:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  out of nowhere.

02:01:56,962 --> 02:01:57,726
SPEAKER_0:  in the middle of the night.

02:01:59,458 --> 02:02:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  Ah...

02:02:00,642 --> 02:02:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  And it stopped.

02:02:02,914 --> 02:02:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  I stopped that night, I remember.

02:02:06,114 --> 02:02:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  waking up at three in the morning and taking a cooler that I had and just dumping all the beers in it and

02:02:12,930 --> 02:02:15,678
SPEAKER_0:  chucking them in the garbage and with a knife.

02:02:16,098 --> 02:02:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  poking each of them to not.

02:02:17,922 --> 02:02:19,678
SPEAKER_0:  you know, be tempted to go pack for them.

02:02:20,610 --> 02:02:26,430
SPEAKER_0:  And then the second day I went around and started finding the hides that I had because I had some, you know.

02:02:26,850 --> 02:02:27,742
SPEAKER_0:  hides.

02:02:28,770 --> 02:02:29,630
SPEAKER_0:  And uh...

02:02:31,554 --> 02:02:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  And then I went somewhere and locked myself in for...

02:02:36,578 --> 02:02:37,150
SPEAKER_0:  Two weeks?

02:02:38,914 --> 02:02:39,518
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:02:40,162 --> 02:02:41,150
SPEAKER_0:  I had to.

02:02:43,042 --> 02:02:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  the withdrawals.

02:02:44,226 --> 02:02:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:02:45,666 --> 02:02:46,206
SPEAKER_0:  queers.

02:02:46,466 --> 02:02:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  nightmares that I've ever had in my life or...

02:02:49,826 --> 02:02:50,718
SPEAKER_0:  to three weeks.

02:02:51,458 --> 02:02:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  I went somewhere.

02:02:52,674 --> 02:02:53,150
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

02:02:53,570 --> 02:02:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  I want to keep them private, but I went somewhere where...

02:02:58,050 --> 02:02:59,358
SPEAKER_0:  They offered a place for me.

02:02:59,746 --> 02:03:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  And uh...

02:03:01,474 --> 02:03:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  When I ask them about it, it's a community.

02:03:04,322 --> 02:03:06,014
SPEAKER_0:  I gave them some money for their school.

02:03:06,626 --> 02:03:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  as a donation.

02:03:08,706 --> 02:03:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  few thousand dollars.

02:03:10,946 --> 02:03:15,006
SPEAKER_0:  I said, yeah, sure, come. You can go through this process here. Cool as fuck people.

02:03:15,906 --> 02:03:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  The first thing they did when I got there is they stood me up in front of everybody to thank me for the donation.

02:03:21,442 --> 02:03:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  and then told everybody that I was an alcoholic and if anybody saw me drinking, I was to be kicked out of there immediately.

02:03:30,818 --> 02:03:31,678
SPEAKER_0:  And uh...

02:03:31,906 --> 02:03:33,214
SPEAKER_0:  I just felt horrible.

02:03:34,626 --> 02:03:35,134
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:03:35,874 --> 02:03:36,478
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:03:37,634 --> 02:03:39,102
SPEAKER_0:  That's what that was where I started.

02:03:39,426 --> 02:03:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  Is that temptation still there?

02:03:43,170 --> 02:03:44,318
SPEAKER_0:  There was a moment.

02:03:44,610 --> 02:03:46,014
SPEAKER_0:  when it was.

02:03:47,074 --> 02:03:48,446
SPEAKER_0:  uh, and...

02:03:49,282 --> 02:03:50,782
SPEAKER_0:  uh... some uh...

02:03:51,202 --> 02:03:51,998
SPEAKER_0:  therapy circle.

02:03:52,930 --> 02:03:53,470
SPEAKER_0:  There's a...

02:03:53,698 --> 02:03:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  There's a rodeo clown friend of mine who...

02:03:56,706 --> 02:03:57,438
SPEAKER_0:  his bodies.

02:03:58,274 --> 02:04:01,342
SPEAKER_0:  the spine is basically fused together you know type of guy

02:04:02,370 --> 02:04:02,686
SPEAKER_0:  uh

02:04:03,138 --> 02:04:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  We've been friends and enemies.

02:04:05,538 --> 02:04:08,926
SPEAKER_0:  and friends again during the art therapy.

02:04:09,186 --> 02:04:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  circle sessions.

02:04:10,978 --> 02:04:13,118
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, so like there's an intimacy there? Yeah.

02:04:13,410 --> 02:04:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  He didn't know anything about me.

02:04:16,226 --> 02:04:19,998
SPEAKER_0:  One time when we were telling our story, he stood up and told his story.

02:04:20,642 --> 02:04:24,670
SPEAKER_0:  and then he heard mine and then he was pissed off at me and didn't want to talk to me for a while.

02:04:25,538 --> 02:04:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  And then later he told me that it was because he saw what I did with my experience and how much of a difference that is.

02:04:32,226 --> 02:04:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  perceived that I was making with it.

02:04:34,722 --> 02:04:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  and he felt jealous that he...

02:04:36,898 --> 02:04:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  can do the same with his experience because he was just a broken.

02:04:40,706 --> 02:04:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  X-Ray Video Cloud.

02:04:42,402 --> 02:04:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  He told me.

02:04:43,938 --> 02:04:48,030
SPEAKER_0:  when I was going through the process like, okay, you're an internet celebrity person, you know?

02:04:48,354 --> 02:04:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  You're known

02:04:51,938 --> 02:04:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  Are you worried about people finding out that you're recovering drunk?

02:04:56,290 --> 02:05:01,822
SPEAKER_0:  And I said, yeah, it's fucking scary as shit if people find out that I am going through this process. It's scary.

02:05:02,146 --> 02:05:02,974
SPEAKER_0:  the critique.

02:05:03,874 --> 02:05:09,822
SPEAKER_0:  I already get a lot of shit for being an ex-police officer in Mexico and all the negativity that comes from that.

02:05:12,578 --> 02:05:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  And he said, don't be.

02:05:14,946 --> 02:05:17,950
SPEAKER_0:  You know that you can't pickpocket a naked man. So just get naked.

02:05:18,658 --> 02:05:19,390
SPEAKER_0:  What does that mean?

02:05:20,034 --> 02:05:20,670
SPEAKER_0:  Write about it.

02:05:21,218 --> 02:05:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  post it online.

02:05:22,722 --> 02:05:25,822
SPEAKER_0:  You never know somebody somebody out there might get inspired to do their own.

02:05:26,082 --> 02:05:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  kind of process.

02:05:28,578 --> 02:05:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  So I started posting about it.

02:05:31,170 --> 02:05:35,294
SPEAKER_0:  cowardly in a way because I wanted to make other people keep me on the path, you know?

02:05:36,098 --> 02:05:37,342
SPEAKER_0:  but in other ways, you know?

02:05:37,666 --> 02:05:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:05:39,266 --> 02:05:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  desperation, you know, I don't want to drink anymore. I don't want to go back to that.

02:05:44,322 --> 02:05:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  bath which I know leads directly to a bad death.

02:05:47,778 --> 02:05:50,782
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not afraid of death. I just want a good one. I don't want a bad one.

02:05:51,074 --> 02:05:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  I think that was going to lead me to a bad death.

02:05:56,130 --> 02:05:58,974
SPEAKER_0:  as I'm writing about it and sharing it online, you know, through my.

02:05:59,202 --> 02:06:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  uh... fever dreams post and...

02:06:02,210 --> 02:06:04,798
SPEAKER_0:  just being humorous about it online.

02:06:05,762 --> 02:06:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  Getting a lot of hate on one side, you know?

02:06:08,034 --> 02:06:13,982
SPEAKER_0:  Having a few people and companies that I work with kind of step back and seeing this guy has some issues too.

02:06:14,242 --> 02:06:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  having other people kind of make fun of or make light of that.

02:06:18,242 --> 02:06:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  weakness portrayed.

02:06:19,970 --> 02:06:21,118
SPEAKER_1:  us getting hate.

02:06:21,666 --> 02:06:22,782
SPEAKER_1:  getting criticism.

02:06:23,074 --> 02:06:24,190
SPEAKER_1:  because here you are.

02:06:24,706 --> 02:06:30,206
SPEAKER_1:  A condo narcotics police officer. There's now as a drinking problem. So is that like supposed to be?

02:06:30,754 --> 02:06:31,966
SPEAKER_1:  What, like flaws?

02:06:32,066 --> 02:06:33,534
SPEAKER_0:  Revealed weakness.

02:06:33,826 --> 02:06:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  or a perception of alpha in the US, I guess that some people have.

02:06:39,618 --> 02:06:40,743
SPEAKER_0:  You were supposed to be strong.

02:06:40,743 --> 02:06:41,493
SPEAKER_1:  And here you are.

02:06:41,493 --> 02:06:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I'm not Jocko Willnick, I'm not David Goggins, you know. I wake up at 10 in the morning sometimes and I'll have cornflakes with my 8-year-old.

02:06:50,338 --> 02:06:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

02:06:51,906 --> 02:06:52,798
SPEAKER_0:  I like days off.

02:06:53,122 --> 02:07:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  I used to wake up at 3.30 in the morning every day to review what happened during the night and then go off for a jog and then...

02:07:01,826 --> 02:07:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  gym and just be ready to be able to murder somebody with my hands if I had to. But that is, I couldn't maintain that during the whole process of getting out of it. Now

02:07:11,106 --> 02:07:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  Beeping alcohol.

02:07:13,026 --> 02:07:17,182
SPEAKER_0:  Remember just being honest with it and just seeing the two sides of it, you know

02:07:18,018 --> 02:07:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  Joe told me.

02:07:19,298 --> 02:07:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  never read the comment section, which is beautiful.

02:07:25,122 --> 02:07:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  That's a beautiful piece of advice.

02:07:27,138 --> 02:07:28,286
SPEAKER_0:  but...

02:07:29,890 --> 02:07:33,918
SPEAKER_0:  They get to you sometimes when you talk about some of these things openly.

02:07:34,498 --> 02:07:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  and some of the comments were positive and I've been...

02:07:38,530 --> 02:07:42,494
SPEAKER_0:  seeing people comment, sending me messages, and meeting people on the road that are.

02:07:43,106 --> 02:07:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  Five months in.

02:07:45,250 --> 02:07:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  Ah.

02:07:45,890 --> 02:07:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  10 months.

02:07:47,202 --> 02:07:49,214
SPEAKER_0:  Some people that have been on that.

02:07:50,114 --> 02:07:52,734
SPEAKER_0:  wagon for way longer than I have.

02:07:53,634 --> 02:07:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  And uh...

02:07:56,866 --> 02:07:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  There's

02:07:58,146 --> 02:08:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  It's cool when you meet people that are superhuman or...

02:08:03,074 --> 02:08:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  perform.

02:08:04,098 --> 02:08:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  And I've...

02:08:05,282 --> 02:08:08,926
SPEAKER_0:  take an extreme ownership of things and are just amazing people that are.

02:08:09,250 --> 02:08:10,750
SPEAKER_0:  you know, thriving out there.

02:08:11,874 --> 02:08:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  inspirational. I see some of these people and I'm like holy shit I need to figure out how to get to some semblance of that.

02:08:18,626 --> 02:08:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  But I'm not that.

02:08:20,738 --> 02:08:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  I've been through the wringer.

02:08:22,082 --> 02:08:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  I fucked up a shit ton of times, you know, my nose is a...

02:08:25,314 --> 02:08:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  Example of that.

02:08:27,458 --> 02:08:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  few missing teeth.

02:08:29,026 --> 02:08:31,294
SPEAKER_0:  But in a way, I think all of that is...

02:08:32,002 --> 02:08:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  part of the process that not a lot of people want to talk about.

02:08:35,746 --> 02:08:42,910
SPEAKER_0:  independently of the experience I got down there and some of the things that I show and talk about and some of the advocacy I do related to.

02:08:43,202 --> 02:08:44,222
SPEAKER_0:  women like her.

02:08:45,058 --> 02:08:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  that are trying to look for a better life and trying to find their missing kids.

02:08:50,658 --> 02:08:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  training people to not get into those situations.

02:08:54,178 --> 02:08:59,134
SPEAKER_0:  but also showcasing the fact that people that go through some of these processes have.

02:08:59,906 --> 02:09:01,022
SPEAKER_0:  A journey to go through.

02:09:01,250 --> 02:09:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  You know, uh...

02:09:02,946 --> 02:09:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  I just came into your studio with a duffel bag.

02:09:05,506 --> 02:09:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  straight from the airport and I'm going to leave early tomorrow morning.

02:09:09,346 --> 02:09:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  somewhere else.

02:09:10,946 --> 02:09:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  I've been on the road for...

02:09:13,730 --> 02:09:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  Almost.

02:09:14,946 --> 02:09:16,510
SPEAKER_0:  I think five years non-stop.

02:09:17,410 --> 02:09:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  I go back to a specific place every week to see my kid for two, three days, and then I'm back out.

02:09:24,578 --> 02:09:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  You know, some people are like, are you running? Like, are you worried? Is this afraid about something? Oh

02:09:29,858 --> 02:09:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  But I am, you know, on this weird.

02:09:32,834 --> 02:09:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  path I guess, trying to look for something that I think of.

02:09:37,282 --> 02:09:42,919
SPEAKER_0:  been missing as far as my afterlife of a sort, you know, coming out of that.

02:09:42,919 --> 02:09:45,726
SPEAKER_1:  Are you looking for some kind of deep understanding of?

02:09:46,146 --> 02:09:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  humanity, like from the specific experiences you had to get some deeper understanding.

02:09:52,418 --> 02:09:54,014
SPEAKER_1:  What the hell we're all doing here

02:09:54,946 --> 02:09:56,254
SPEAKER_0:  I meet people every weekend.

02:09:56,546 --> 02:10:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  with different stories. People come to some of my classes, I show them how to weaponize the environment, how to arm themselves.

02:10:03,810 --> 02:10:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  how to not get abducted.

02:10:05,922 --> 02:10:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  I meet people that have gone through those experiences and are basically trying to work through some of their own issues by going through the training like that.

02:10:14,530 --> 02:10:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  I get to meet people that are, you know, people that I've only seen online, you know, or seen in videos, I remember.

02:10:21,602 --> 02:10:24,062
SPEAKER_0:  meeting Royce Gracie in Harbor City.

02:10:24,354 --> 02:10:25,278
SPEAKER_0:  I heard of that guy.

02:10:25,730 --> 02:10:31,070
SPEAKER_0:  He's a pretty interesting character. I remember seeing him in a bootleg VHS video. I told him about it.

02:10:31,490 --> 02:10:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  We're doing a class out at a.

02:10:34,498 --> 02:10:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  Emerson knives. It's a knife company, but Mr. Emerson also has like a jujitsu gym there where Roy straightens out of. That's his space.

02:10:45,218 --> 02:10:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:10:45,986 --> 02:10:46,430
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

02:10:46,690 --> 02:10:51,070
SPEAKER_0:  They're teaching how to defend against somebody trying to stab you and I'm showing them.

02:10:51,426 --> 02:11:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  all the ways you can get around that and fabricate and improvise and smuggle things, basically the adversarial side of that. That's what I'm known for.

02:11:01,986 --> 02:11:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  the psychology and kind of the ways that people do that.

02:11:06,242 --> 02:11:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  I remember him seeing some of the stuff that I was doing and just being like...

02:11:10,722 --> 02:11:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  Where are you from? Mexico.

02:11:12,258 --> 02:11:14,718
SPEAKER_0:  Makes sense, you know, somebody from Brazil.

02:11:14,946 --> 02:11:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  tipping the hat to somebody from Mexico as far as.

02:11:18,914 --> 02:11:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  with him seeing the violence and

02:11:21,442 --> 02:11:22,142
SPEAKER_0:  some of the art.

02:11:22,498 --> 02:11:23,678
SPEAKER_0:  mentality behind it.

02:11:24,354 --> 02:11:26,974
SPEAKER_1:  So for people who don't know, hoist Gracie.

02:11:27,202 --> 02:11:32,894
SPEAKER_1:  as the legendary martial artists that probably introduced Brazilian Jiu Jitsu to the American audience to the world.

02:11:33,154 --> 02:11:35,774
SPEAKER_1:  the process of UFC and showing the effectiveness of it.

02:11:36,258 --> 02:11:37,086
SPEAKER_1:  And, uh...

02:11:38,018 --> 02:11:41,406
SPEAKER_1:  in practice that a little skinny guy can defeat a big

02:11:41,698 --> 02:11:42,878
SPEAKER_1:  Aggressive guy so

02:11:43,042 --> 02:11:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  An Anaconda.

02:11:44,226 --> 02:11:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  It's a small anaconda walking into that ring.

02:11:48,258 --> 02:11:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  with his family behind him. Wearing pajamas. Wearing pajamas and everything. What is this guy wearing pajamas for?

02:11:53,410 --> 02:11:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  and then he would strangle people with those pajamas.

02:11:56,354 --> 02:11:58,110
SPEAKER_0:  I remember seeing that and just having it.

02:11:58,690 --> 02:11:59,102
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

02:11:59,490 --> 02:12:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  probably what a generation before had with Bruce Lee, I guess.

02:12:03,874 --> 02:12:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  our my generation was.

02:12:05,602 --> 02:12:07,326
SPEAKER_0:  Royce walking into that uh...

02:12:08,258 --> 02:12:11,678
SPEAKER_0:  walking into that octagon and changing paradigms.

02:12:12,610 --> 02:12:14,206
SPEAKER_0:  seeing him in that gym.

02:12:14,434 --> 02:12:14,782
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:12:15,938 --> 02:12:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  It's also, I have a gun owner and shooter, which is...

02:12:19,330 --> 02:12:22,846
SPEAKER_0:  interesting, you know, having seeing somebody like him who is.

02:12:23,714 --> 02:12:30,366
SPEAKER_0:  Well-versed with his hands also be a man that has gone into the realm of being well-versed with weaponry.

02:12:31,202 --> 02:12:33,022
SPEAKER_0:  which is an aspect of.

02:12:33,378 --> 02:12:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  martial arts and the martial way of thinking that, you know, some people kind of...

02:12:39,618 --> 02:12:44,739
SPEAKER_0:  The purist will stick with one side of it, but he's obviously a warrior in a lot of ways.

02:12:44,739 --> 02:12:47,774
SPEAKER_1:  So just as a small tangent, so you're somebody that.

02:12:48,546 --> 02:12:50,526
SPEAKER_1:  You don't just look at unarmed combat.

02:12:50,818 --> 02:12:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  you look at the full spectrum of the chaos of combat that's outside of

02:12:55,042 --> 02:12:57,566
SPEAKER_1:  the realm of Jujitsu and even just mixed martial arts.

02:12:57,922 --> 02:12:58,622
SPEAKER_1:  unarmed.

02:12:58,946 --> 02:13:01,150
SPEAKER_1:  armed with knives and beyond.

02:13:01,474 --> 02:13:05,599
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, was his mind open to the fuller spectrum of violence?

02:13:05,599 --> 02:13:11,006
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I mean, he was in the middle of this class that we were doing where people were basically focusing on both.

02:13:11,970 --> 02:13:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  Ernest Emerson who's a

02:13:13,794 --> 02:13:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  famous for his knives. He has a knife company.

02:13:16,642 --> 02:13:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  It's a nice renaissance.

02:13:18,786 --> 02:13:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  Not only that, but he's also a very...

02:13:20,482 --> 02:13:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  avid martial artist. He trained with a lot of Filipino martial arts related to knives and stuff like that.

02:13:26,178 --> 02:13:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  but a different mindset, you know?

02:13:28,226 --> 02:13:31,422
SPEAKER_0:  a defensive mindset to train people how to defend against that.

02:13:32,098 --> 02:13:33,534
SPEAKER_0:  And you have Royce who's a...

02:13:33,794 --> 02:13:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  He's from Brazil.

02:13:34,850 --> 02:13:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  I mean he has some street in him.

02:13:36,354 --> 02:13:40,798
SPEAKER_0:  That's something that, you know, those guys, they have streets, as we say in Mexico.

02:13:41,506 --> 02:13:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:13:42,562 --> 02:13:50,846
SPEAKER_0:  seeing the ways he stepped in there and provided some encouragement to the people there as far as how people sometimes focus on the...

02:13:52,098 --> 02:13:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  this is a system and this is a way but there's other ways out there that might negate or defeat the ways that you are concentrating on you know

02:14:00,002 --> 02:14:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:14:00,610 --> 02:14:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  kinda get out of that bubble. My whole-

02:14:02,946 --> 02:14:06,270
SPEAKER_0:  kind of speciality or what I focus on is mindset and.

02:14:06,658 --> 02:14:09,918
SPEAKER_0:  figuring out the software that some of these people gain and gather from.

02:14:11,330 --> 02:14:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  If I need to arm myself, you know, the easiest thing to manufacture in most places is a pointed object.

02:14:17,346 --> 02:14:24,990
SPEAKER_0:  I can take that crystal big pen that you're writing on that notepad with and using the friction from the carpet I can turn it into a hypodermic needle.

02:14:25,666 --> 02:14:30,677
SPEAKER_0:  that you can then poke into somebody's neck. What's the process of doing that? I can do it right now if you want.

02:14:30,677 --> 02:14:32,927
SPEAKER_1:  Can you use your words for the listener?

02:14:32,927 --> 02:14:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  also because I'm terrified. No, basically you can take the friction, the heat and friction created from this carpet. Yes, you can grab that pen.

02:14:41,954 --> 02:14:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  In and of itself, it will pierce flesh, but it will slow itself down because it has a few angles on the tip. Oh, you want to wear down the angles. So if you take that tip off and you grab it and grind it on an angle on the carpet, the heat will actually turn it into a hypodermic needle if you know what you're doing.

02:14:59,106 --> 02:15:01,731
SPEAKER_1:  hypodermic meaning like it smoothens the entry.

02:15:01,731 --> 02:15:04,702
SPEAKER_0:  It'll make a point and an angle that will guide it.

02:15:04,930 --> 02:15:06,078
SPEAKER_0:  way into your flash.

02:15:06,306 --> 02:15:09,310
SPEAKER_0:  So you can actually go through a torso with that if you know what you're doing.

02:15:10,370 --> 02:15:13,150
SPEAKER_1:  As a small tangent, you also gave me a present.

02:15:14,530 --> 02:15:19,678
SPEAKER_1:  Could be one of the most epic presents I've ever received. You give it to Rogan.

02:15:20,098 --> 02:15:21,973
SPEAKER_1:  Can you explain what I'm holding in my hands?

02:15:21,973 --> 02:15:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  There's a guy online.

02:15:23,522 --> 02:15:24,926
SPEAKER_0:  Coffin Tramp is a...

02:15:25,250 --> 02:15:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  moniker. It is

02:15:27,362 --> 02:15:27,902
SPEAKER_0:  A

02:15:29,346 --> 02:15:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  G10 rod. G10 is a very strong material basically capable of a lot of people make actually G10 knives which are basically non-magnetic non-ferrous objects that can...

02:15:40,194 --> 02:15:41,662
SPEAKER_0:  be utilized as a stabbing.

02:15:42,594 --> 02:15:50,238
SPEAKER_0:  The core of it isn't an actual pencil core, it's a G10 core and it's encased in a

02:15:50,818 --> 02:15:51,230
SPEAKER_0:  Oak.

02:15:51,522 --> 02:15:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  heart oak.

02:15:52,802 --> 02:15:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  So that is capable again of stabbing through a torso. Now the guy that made that uh...

02:15:58,434 --> 02:16:04,286
SPEAKER_0:  It's an artisan, you know, it makes that, it looks like a pencil. Concealed in the nature of the object itself.

02:16:05,058 --> 02:16:07,006
SPEAKER_0:  But that small object is capable of.

02:16:07,394 --> 02:16:08,958
SPEAKER_0:  being introduced into...

02:16:09,314 --> 02:16:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  A chest cavity.

02:16:11,170 --> 02:16:11,774
SPEAKER_0:  Um,

02:16:12,162 --> 02:16:14,590
SPEAKER_0:  you know, all it takes is about the.

02:16:14,946 --> 02:16:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  half of your thumb or the length of your thumb to stab into your chest cavity and now your

02:16:19,458 --> 02:16:24,862
SPEAKER_0:  pericardium is pierced and it's being filled with blood or your whole heart is pierced then you have...

02:16:25,314 --> 02:16:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  minutes to live if you're at a standing heart rate.

02:16:28,962 --> 02:16:30,014
SPEAKER_1:  for this is uh...

02:16:30,306 --> 02:16:33,022
SPEAKER_1:  This has the effectiveness of a knife, essentially.

02:16:33,154 --> 02:16:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  It has an effectiveness of a shank or an ice pick. It's not gonna cut, but it's gonna make a hole where it's not the duchin B.

02:16:41,378 --> 02:16:44,003
SPEAKER_1:  Here the pen is literally mightier than the sword.

02:16:44,003 --> 02:16:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, well, it's...

02:16:46,914 --> 02:16:48,039
SPEAKER_0:  this is real

02:16:48,039 --> 02:16:48,702
SPEAKER_1:  epic.

02:16:49,410 --> 02:16:50,142
SPEAKER_1:  from like a...

02:16:50,722 --> 02:16:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  perspective of an academic.

02:16:53,506 --> 02:16:56,574
SPEAKER_1:  This is a symbol of both intelligence.

02:16:56,994 --> 02:16:58,119
SPEAKER_1:  and violence. ———————....

02:16:58,119 --> 02:17:04,350
SPEAKER_0:  it. And also the current state of affairs where people need to arm themselves with things that are concealed as far as their purpose.

02:17:04,642 --> 02:17:06,398
SPEAKER_0:  in a place where in a country.

02:17:06,754 --> 02:17:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  or in a society.

02:17:08,354 --> 02:17:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  that limits their ability to arm themselves.

02:17:11,330 --> 02:17:12,478
SPEAKER_0:  So you're going to...

02:17:12,770 --> 02:17:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  safe place.

02:17:13,826 --> 02:17:19,006
SPEAKER_0:  You're going to a place where no weapons allowed, which means a target rich environment if you're a predator.

02:17:19,778 --> 02:17:20,190
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:17:20,866 --> 02:17:21,854
SPEAKER_0:  That's a sign of...

02:17:22,434 --> 02:17:22,974
SPEAKER_0:  Rebellion.

02:17:23,362 --> 02:17:25,150
SPEAKER_1:  Let this be a signal.

02:17:26,146 --> 02:17:31,102
SPEAKER_1:  Everyone should be terrified when you're around me. Because even a pencil can murder you.

02:17:31,522 --> 02:17:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  I intend to use this. And nobody owns life, but anybody that can hold a frying pan owns death, is a quote that I heard once, which is a beautiful one.

02:17:39,490 --> 02:17:41,918
SPEAKER_1:  I'm looking at you. If anyone betrays me, this is the way to go.

02:17:42,978 --> 02:17:43,614
SPEAKER_1:  Can you?

02:17:43,906 --> 02:17:48,190
SPEAKER_1:  given all you've experienced and all the different ways you think about martial arts and violence.

02:17:50,050 --> 02:17:53,118
SPEAKER_1:  in Mexico, in the world, speaking of hoists.

02:17:54,530 --> 02:17:59,262
SPEAKER_1:  What is your approach to conflict like a street fight?

02:17:59,682 --> 02:18:03,902
SPEAKER_1:  What advice would you give people in the full spectrum of what a street?

02:18:04,226 --> 02:18:06,014
SPEAKER_1:  Altercation might entail.

02:18:06,754 --> 02:18:08,190
SPEAKER_1:  What is the best way to approach it?

02:18:08,642 --> 02:18:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  I think before you get there, you have to prepare. You know, this is one of the first things I tell people is if you don't have a basic TCCC,

02:18:17,378 --> 02:18:18,878
SPEAKER_0:  training class behind you. We should.

02:18:19,138 --> 02:18:20,094
SPEAKER_0:  reanalyzer.

02:18:20,450 --> 02:18:22,206
SPEAKER_0:  your life and your ability to prepare.

02:18:22,786 --> 02:18:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  TCCC.

02:18:24,002 --> 02:18:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  Basically how to stop somebody from bleeding out or dying from a stab wound, gunshot wound or any of those types of wounds or an amputated leg during an IED scenario. Something you would see in a Boston Marathon type event or a...

02:18:36,482 --> 02:18:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  Vegas shooting event.

02:18:37,858 --> 02:18:39,710
SPEAKER_0:  where people are getting shot, stabbed, cut.

02:18:39,842 --> 02:18:42,398
SPEAKER_1:  So understand how to help people, how to help yourself.

02:18:43,266 --> 02:18:43,806
SPEAKER_1:  post.

02:18:43,906 --> 02:18:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  You're no good to you. You don't want to be a, you don't want to be a detriment to the situation. You want to be an asset.

02:18:49,666 --> 02:18:52,926
SPEAKER_0:  So build yourself up as an asset in a situation like that.

02:18:53,442 --> 02:18:56,030
SPEAKER_0:  because you might be doing that on yourself or on somebody else.

02:18:56,130 --> 02:18:57,758
SPEAKER_1:  and also it helps you understand.

02:18:58,306 --> 02:19:01,854
SPEAKER_1:  What situations are going to result in a lot of?

02:19:02,658 --> 02:19:04,478
SPEAKER_1:  in a difficult situation to deal with.

02:19:04,898 --> 02:19:08,574
SPEAKER_0:  afterwards. Yeah, it also teaches you what to stab and what to shoot.

02:19:09,378 --> 02:19:13,662
SPEAKER_0:  if you're thinking about it in a full and on all the dimensions of it, you know.

02:19:14,018 --> 02:19:15,230
SPEAKER_0:  You know, there's...

02:19:15,490 --> 02:19:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  all knowledge can be weaponized. And I think that's the approach I'll take.

02:19:20,354 --> 02:19:27,761
SPEAKER_0:  people should kind of figure out for themselves when they start getting ready or if they want to take the responsibility of their own safety in their hands.

02:19:27,761 --> 02:19:31,742
SPEAKER_1:  So in a self-defense situation, there's a lot of questions here, but what does one stab?

02:19:33,442 --> 02:19:39,934
SPEAKER_0:  There's the carotid arteries, which are used commonly in jujitsu as something to choke because they feed a computer.

02:19:40,578 --> 02:19:41,406
SPEAKER_0:  So there's a lot of...

02:19:41,858 --> 02:19:43,358
SPEAKER_1:  blood flowing through that.

02:19:43,778 --> 02:19:44,903
SPEAKER_1:  required for the success.

02:19:44,903 --> 02:19:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  operations on computer.

02:19:48,066 --> 02:19:51,271
SPEAKER_0:  guarding the outside world from your carotid arteries.

02:19:51,271 --> 02:19:53,438
SPEAKER_1:  Really weird design, by the way. I like how this design is...

02:19:53,794 --> 02:19:54,919
SPEAKER_0:  Not a smart one.

02:19:54,919 --> 02:19:59,102
SPEAKER_1:  It doesn't even make sense because with mammals they bite each other's neck like why can't you have more?

02:19:59,906 --> 02:20:07,166
SPEAKER_1:  Protection because this is the only like us humans don't use their mouth to kill each other But most mammals most partners do you?

02:20:07,490 --> 02:20:08,615
SPEAKER_1:  It's like why the hell don't we-

02:20:08,615 --> 02:20:16,702
SPEAKER_0:  protect this. We do have a defensive mechanism and you see it sometimes when people are ambushed and people try to open up each other's necks from behind.

02:20:17,442 --> 02:20:19,262
SPEAKER_0:  if you push somebody's neck forward.

02:20:19,778 --> 02:20:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  the carotids will actually...

02:20:21,794 --> 02:20:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  lower themselves and be encased in more flesh and muscle.

02:20:24,994 --> 02:20:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  if you pull ahead back.

02:20:26,946 --> 02:20:27,838
SPEAKER_0:  Not so much.

02:20:28,258 --> 02:20:31,806
SPEAKER_0:  So that's a way that at least I think the evolutionary we've.

02:20:32,226 --> 02:20:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  have a defensive mechanism for that.

02:20:34,498 --> 02:20:36,734
SPEAKER_0:  There's a few videos out there of people's

02:20:37,282 --> 02:20:43,614
SPEAKER_0:  getting their neck sewn back shut after somebody pushed their head forward to try and slice their necks and they survived.

02:20:44,066 --> 02:20:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:20:45,538 --> 02:20:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  This is a viable target. The heart is another one.

02:20:49,410 --> 02:20:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  Interesting about the thing about the heart and people get alarmed when I talk about this and show it in classes

02:20:55,906 --> 02:21:02,590
SPEAKER_0:  Again, a lot of the classes I do are for orientation and for people to recognize that behavior. So a lot of-

02:21:03,106 --> 02:21:05,598
SPEAKER_0:  law enforcement comes to some of these classes.

02:21:06,050 --> 02:21:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  That's horrible.

02:21:07,490 --> 02:21:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  That's how somebody will kill somebody. Yeah, this is how people that know their thing, their shit will try and approach somebody and stab you to death. This is how they would do it.

02:21:15,906 --> 02:21:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  uh... there's a tendency to

02:21:17,986 --> 02:21:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  view what we see in John Wick or view what we see in...

02:21:21,346 --> 02:21:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  this martial arts community where they're slicing and dicing people.

02:21:25,410 --> 02:21:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  different myriad of ways.

02:21:27,618 --> 02:21:29,886
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of that is based on dueling-based cultures.

02:21:30,402 --> 02:21:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  like the Filipino martial arts or some of the Italian martial arts out there.

02:21:35,010 --> 02:21:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  somebody's facing off with somebody else with a similar weapon.

02:21:37,986 --> 02:21:41,150
SPEAKER_0:  where both of us are agreeing to basically get into a stabbing competition.

02:21:42,722 --> 02:21:50,590
SPEAKER_0:  That would make sense in that scenario, in that context, but I've never seen a lot of people actually get into these one-on-one knife altercations.

02:21:51,106 --> 02:21:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  what we see now in a modern context when it talks about weaponry.

02:21:55,138 --> 02:21:57,342
SPEAKER_0:  is an ambush-counter-ambush based.

02:21:57,634 --> 02:22:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  scenario where somebody pulls out a knife during a grappling situation on the street or when somebody turns a striking exchange of punches into pulling out a knife.

02:22:08,930 --> 02:22:10,238
SPEAKER_0:  cheap gas station knife or...

02:22:11,042 --> 02:22:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  a pen or a pen.

02:22:13,058 --> 02:22:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  a rock from the ground or a handgun.

02:22:16,098 --> 02:22:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  most modern combatants.

02:22:17,858 --> 02:22:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  when it comes to weaponry should be kind of based on the whole aspect of ambush and counter ambush. There's a lot of people showing valuable type of material and coursework on this out there.

02:22:27,298 --> 02:22:27,742
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:22:28,386 --> 02:22:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  My whole approach and my specific kind of realm is in the aspect of how people go from the process of learning some of these things from experiential stuff. People that grew up in rural places grow up on pig farms.

02:22:40,610 --> 02:22:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  that actually get the experiences of processing a pig, for example.

02:22:44,034 --> 02:22:45,150
SPEAKER_0:  or processing an animal.

02:22:45,506 --> 02:22:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  those people will have more skills as hunters.

02:22:49,058 --> 02:22:52,510
SPEAKER_0:  Those people will have more skills with a knife if they pick it up as a weapon then.

02:22:53,634 --> 02:22:58,558
SPEAKER_0:  most of the martial artists that I've seen approach some of these classes where I go and have a

02:22:58,818 --> 02:23:02,334
SPEAKER_0:  a simulated torso in the form of a pig hanging in a room somewhere.

02:23:03,010 --> 02:23:04,670
SPEAKER_1:  Some of that has to do with just the.

02:23:06,210 --> 02:23:15,585
SPEAKER_1:  the familiarity and the comfort of just like the biology of a living organism. Like that you, if you cut off certain things, if you cut a certain thing, like it's just a meat vehicle.

02:23:15,585 --> 02:23:18,654
SPEAKER_0:  The same thing, the medical training should come first.

02:23:19,170 --> 02:23:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  or if you don't have that, be a hunter, or go to a butchery class. That will teach you more about how to use a knife.

02:23:26,850 --> 02:23:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  on somebody else than anything, you know, that'll give you the experience of flash.

02:23:31,234 --> 02:23:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  Most people, you know, I do this.

02:23:33,666 --> 02:23:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  example every now and then where I

02:23:35,458 --> 02:23:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  have people bring in.

02:23:37,378 --> 02:23:45,182
SPEAKER_0:  a tactical knife and they'll bring in a butter knife. And I asked them which will go through a torso. We have a pig there, so it simulates a torso pretty closely.

02:23:46,050 --> 02:23:48,382
SPEAKER_0:  Most people will say, nah, that butter knife is not going to go through.

02:23:48,706 --> 02:23:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  And it does, you know, it does go through. It's thin enough, strong enough, sturdy enough that it'll go through.

02:23:54,786 --> 02:23:55,198
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:23:55,810 --> 02:23:56,542
SPEAKER_0:  Kitchen knife.

02:23:57,538 --> 02:23:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  cheap one.

02:23:58,754 --> 02:24:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  cost 89 cents at a Walmart and an expensive $400 one.

02:24:03,906 --> 02:24:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

02:24:05,314 --> 02:24:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  The cheap one will outperform the expensive one. The tip will snap off during some of it.

02:24:10,658 --> 02:24:12,702
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I have to say that just as a small.

02:24:13,314 --> 02:24:15,486
SPEAKER_1:  tangent I went to farm

02:24:17,282 --> 02:24:18,270
SPEAKER_1:  And...

02:24:18,946 --> 02:24:21,438
SPEAKER_1:  seeing the butchering of meat and so on.

02:24:21,986 --> 02:24:25,182
SPEAKER_1:  in the processing of meat and pigs and cows.

02:24:26,626 --> 02:24:28,126
SPEAKER_1:  Whoo, that's uncomfortable.

02:24:29,218 --> 02:24:30,462
SPEAKER_1:  but I think it also.

02:24:30,818 --> 02:24:35,326
SPEAKER_1:  It's honest and raw and like that's something that probably everyone should experience regularly.

02:24:35,970 --> 02:24:36,382
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

02:24:37,442 --> 02:24:41,086
SPEAKER_1:  Is it, it's also humbling to remind you. When I.

02:24:42,786 --> 02:24:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  I had a dog Homer, he's a Newfoundland.

02:24:45,506 --> 02:24:46,942
SPEAKER_1:  I was very close with him.

02:24:47,682 --> 02:24:48,286
SPEAKER_1:  Oh

02:24:48,514 --> 02:24:49,278
SPEAKER_1:  lost them.

02:24:49,890 --> 02:24:51,070
SPEAKER_1:  And I just remember...

02:24:51,458 --> 02:24:52,254
SPEAKER_1:  that carry the music.

02:24:52,514 --> 02:24:53,790
SPEAKER_1:  200 something pounds.

02:24:54,050 --> 02:24:56,702
SPEAKER_1:  I had to carry him, I had to put him to sleep and...

02:24:57,730 --> 02:24:58,302
SPEAKER_1:  one of the

02:24:58,690 --> 02:25:00,126
SPEAKER_1:  biggest realizations is like...

02:25:00,450 --> 02:25:01,566
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, this is just the...

02:25:02,274 --> 02:25:03,838
SPEAKER_1:  This is just a biological thing.

02:25:04,546 --> 02:25:08,030
SPEAKER_1:  It's just, and to realize that this is just meat.

02:25:08,834 --> 02:25:10,750
SPEAKER_1:  This is not, and you can cut it.

02:25:11,458 --> 02:25:17,182
SPEAKER_1:  and then if you bleed, all of a sudden the life can disappear from you. It's all gone. It's like, holy shit.

02:25:17,410 --> 02:25:20,414
SPEAKER_1:  There's this meat vehicle that some people have referred to as Lex.

02:25:21,282 --> 02:25:23,390
SPEAKER_1:  I'm just a few stabbings away from...

02:25:23,938 --> 02:25:27,523
SPEAKER_1:  Like leaving. Yeah, from leaving, goodbye. Goodbye, just saw the logistics.

02:25:27,523 --> 02:25:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  It used to be that we had to hang around, you know, people would come back from battle and we would hear things next to the campfire.

02:25:34,946 --> 02:25:42,238
SPEAKER_0:  far as, oh, he stabbed somebody here and this happens. But now we live in an age where you can, you know, when I do a class, this is a stab to the heart.

02:25:42,818 --> 02:25:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  And here's like five videos of it happening live, you know, on live leaks or whatever.

02:25:48,194 --> 02:25:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  and we can deconstruct that, not only that, but...

02:25:51,234 --> 02:25:55,166
SPEAKER_0:  what weapon was used. Oh, it was a gas station folder. It was a-

02:25:55,554 --> 02:25:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  pioneer woman knife from Walmart with flowers on the handle.

02:25:59,170 --> 02:25:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  Whatever it was.

02:26:00,482 --> 02:26:03,678
SPEAKER_0:  and people start realizing that it doesn't take a lot.

02:26:05,218 --> 02:26:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  that it doesn't take a lot of training because a lot of these people are not.

02:26:08,258 --> 02:26:08,830
SPEAKER_0:  high level.

02:26:09,250 --> 02:26:10,206
SPEAKER_0:  Assassin's Train.

02:26:10,466 --> 02:26:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  by ninjas in the hills or anything like that. So it's important, low elétrons, a cool, the Subscribe button, to jump right into a live did you belive?

02:26:13,346 --> 02:26:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  grew up or learned by seeing that behaviour in others.

02:26:18,658 --> 02:26:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  And when they start coming to the realization that it's pretty easy to do that and they start figuring out like, how do you counteract that? Well, number one, learn the behavior yourself so you can recognize it. The whole aspect of being a good listener is to check out combine4u loudspeakers, some amazing

02:26:28,578 --> 02:26:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  good counter-ambush team is to be the best ambusher in the planet.

02:26:33,218 --> 02:26:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  So again, the whole aspect of Musashi saying, know your enemy know his sword.

02:26:37,410 --> 02:26:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  Now you've...

02:26:38,178 --> 02:26:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  figure that out as far as learning that behavior.

02:26:41,122 --> 02:26:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  when you start seeing how some of these stabbings occur.

02:26:45,122 --> 02:26:52,766
SPEAKER_0:  The first thing you notice is that one of the hands is always kind of out of the picture or there's a lack of symmetry in the people that are about to do something horrible.

02:26:53,826 --> 02:26:58,014
SPEAKER_0:  So when you see lack of symmetry in the environment, you're thinking about somebody with their hands going backwards.

02:26:58,466 --> 02:27:04,318
SPEAKER_0:  There's a crowd of people and two or one individual is looking counter.

02:27:04,930 --> 02:27:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  where everybody else is looking.

02:27:07,778 --> 02:27:10,494
SPEAKER_0:  or there's a hyper aware individual in the crowd.

02:27:11,170 --> 02:27:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  The hyper aware are always usually out there.

02:27:14,754 --> 02:27:15,646
SPEAKER_0:  Fuck somebody over.

02:27:16,162 --> 02:27:17,342
SPEAKER_0:  or are they're trying to keep?

02:27:17,634 --> 02:27:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  those predators from fucking somebody else over.

02:27:19,874 --> 02:27:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:27:22,050 --> 02:27:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  unless you step back and you put yourself in the process of learning how they learn.

02:27:26,466 --> 02:27:27,486
SPEAKER_0:  and you become.

02:27:27,906 --> 02:27:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  that.

02:27:28,706 --> 02:27:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  potential nightmare person. It's hard to recognize that in a crowd. Feels like.

02:27:33,602 --> 02:27:34,686
SPEAKER_1:  One of the...

02:27:35,330 --> 02:27:37,374
SPEAKER_1:  significant ways to win or

02:27:37,634 --> 02:27:39,678
SPEAKER_1:  as a street fighter is avoided by.

02:27:39,938 --> 02:27:40,734
SPEAKER_1:  Sort of sending.

02:27:41,026 --> 02:27:42,270
SPEAKER_1:  pacifist signals.

02:27:42,498 --> 02:27:45,886
SPEAKER_1:  In every way, meaning avoiding the situation whenever there's like.

02:27:46,690 --> 02:27:48,062
SPEAKER_1:  like a hypervigilant.

02:27:48,418 --> 02:27:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  people you just kind of

02:27:50,434 --> 02:27:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  Avoid signaling the year.

02:27:52,482 --> 02:27:55,006
SPEAKER_1:  one of the players of interest. Yeah.

02:27:55,266 --> 02:27:56,670
SPEAKER_1:  If we're talking about counter ambush.

02:27:56,898 --> 02:27:57,566
SPEAKER_1:  At which point?

02:27:58,210 --> 02:28:00,638
SPEAKER_1:  Do you do that versus shift to the?

02:28:02,338 --> 02:28:02,878
SPEAKER_1:  progression.

02:28:02,978 --> 02:28:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  I think violence should be always an option, you know?

02:28:05,826 --> 02:28:09,214
SPEAKER_0:  Everybody should have that option and you need to be good at that option.

02:28:10,370 --> 02:28:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  I think I heard Jordan Peterson talk about the fact that everybody needs to be dangerous, but keep that shit under control.

02:28:15,682 --> 02:28:16,350
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

02:28:16,642 --> 02:28:18,910
SPEAKER_1:  I think he was referring to a different context, but...

02:28:19,010 --> 02:28:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  I know. I'm referring to the ability of... The little physical conflict as well. There's two cases that I saw of people utilizing social engineering to a beautiful degree to de-escalate shit.

02:28:32,098 --> 02:28:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  Right. One guy.

02:28:33,506 --> 02:28:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  Somewhere first off if you're in a place where people are grabbing your wife's ass or something like that like what are you doing there? You know there's a load of things that are...

02:28:41,506 --> 02:28:47,902
SPEAKER_0:  wrong with everything that you're doing in your life to be in that environment. But let's say you're in an inescapable situation.

02:28:48,770 --> 02:28:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  Where was this guy?

02:28:50,114 --> 02:28:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  who was in a...

02:28:51,682 --> 02:28:52,638
SPEAKER_0:  Compromised position.

02:28:53,122 --> 02:28:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  Somebody wanted to fight him

02:28:54,658 --> 02:28:55,102
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:28:55,426 --> 02:28:56,382
SPEAKER_0:  legit kick his ass.

02:28:57,186 --> 02:28:59,134
SPEAKER_0:  And he said, okay.

02:28:59,362 --> 02:29:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  Let's go, but I just, I need to warn you that I have hep C.

02:29:02,946 --> 02:29:03,870
SPEAKER_0:  before we go outside.

02:29:05,186 --> 02:29:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  And that.

02:29:05,986 --> 02:29:06,654
SPEAKER_0:  masterful.

02:29:06,914 --> 02:29:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  I was getting my phone out to f-

02:29:09,090 --> 02:29:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  filmed this, you know, maybe. And even I was just lowered my phone to give him a slow clap. That was a beautiful move.

02:29:16,546 --> 02:29:17,022
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:29:17,794 --> 02:29:20,638
SPEAKER_0:  And then there was this other man, there was a...

02:29:21,346 --> 02:29:30,910
SPEAKER_0:  There was a riot somewhere in Ensenada, the municipality of Ensenada in Baja. They were protesting some of the people that pick those fields down there.

02:29:31,298 --> 02:29:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  part of a tribe called Los Tricis.

02:29:33,922 --> 02:29:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  very hardy, hardworking people, but...

02:29:36,578 --> 02:29:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  nefarious people too. They're pretty good at their thing.

02:29:42,146 --> 02:29:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  There was a riot line. They couldn't break.

02:29:45,378 --> 02:29:51,230
SPEAKER_0:  And this old man walks in the middle of the riot line and yells, grenade! And throws an avocado in the middle of all the cops.

02:29:51,554 --> 02:29:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  Mm-hmm.

02:29:52,130 --> 02:29:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  And I'll go.

02:29:54,274 --> 02:29:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  that rye line with an avocado.

02:29:56,482 --> 02:29:57,118
SPEAKER_0:  your

02:29:57,762 --> 02:29:59,646
SPEAKER_1:  That could have gone wrong in so many ways.

02:29:59,874 --> 02:30:00,574
SPEAKER_0:  hugs.

02:30:00,866 --> 02:30:03,678
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know. To me, there's small lessons there.

02:30:03,906 --> 02:30:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  there is a case to be made about social engineering.

02:30:06,946 --> 02:30:08,350
SPEAKER_0:  about learning about behavior.

02:30:08,674 --> 02:30:09,886
SPEAKER_0:  about learning how to lie.

02:30:10,114 --> 02:30:14,334
SPEAKER_0:  and how to kind of move your way or navigate your way around situations like that.

02:30:14,850 --> 02:30:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  Small things like bartering.

02:30:16,578 --> 02:30:23,902
SPEAKER_0:  Knowing how to bribe people in conflict zones is the thing that I show when I talk about or train people to work in hostile environments.

02:30:24,674 --> 02:30:25,534
SPEAKER_0:  escalation.

02:30:25,794 --> 02:30:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

02:30:26,658 --> 02:30:35,262
SPEAKER_0:  specifically kind of figuring out what is a value in the environment, what things you shouldn't be doing in an environment that might be considered disrespectful or

02:30:35,778 --> 02:30:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  out of place, you know, people have a tendency that didn't grow up in places that are violent to make.

02:30:41,570 --> 02:30:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  Continuous eye contact with somebody that might be an issue

02:30:45,890 --> 02:30:51,646
SPEAKER_0:  or smiling when there's nothing to smile about. I think, you know, there's a picture I saw somewhere of Russians.

02:30:52,354 --> 02:30:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  taking a portrait and there's Americans there and Americans are smiling with the Russians aren't?

02:30:57,026 --> 02:30:59,486
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. Because what are they're just about?

02:30:59,746 --> 02:31:06,366
SPEAKER_1:  And of course it's not as simple as smile or not smile this subtlety to it like you said I can't think this is super interesting one because um

02:31:07,298 --> 02:31:08,958
SPEAKER_1:  I found in my own life.

02:31:09,570 --> 02:31:11,614
SPEAKER_1:  Like not making eye contact is...

02:31:12,386 --> 02:31:16,350
SPEAKER_1:  Other people will be joking, but it's a really powerful way to de-escalate.

02:31:16,578 --> 02:31:22,302
SPEAKER_1:  And there's such a fascinating thing though, cause you could talk about drunk fights that are just.

02:31:22,946 --> 02:31:24,926
SPEAKER_1:  uh... they're harmless

02:31:25,474 --> 02:31:29,694
SPEAKER_1:  But I feel like the same dynamic applies to the most violent conflict including wars.

02:31:29,922 --> 02:31:31,390
SPEAKER_1:  I feel like ego.

02:31:31,938 --> 02:31:32,958
SPEAKER_1:  is part of this.

02:31:33,282 --> 02:31:36,574
SPEAKER_1:  So to me the question of conflict whether it's a street fight or anything else.

02:31:37,474 --> 02:31:38,782
SPEAKER_1:  is the calculus of

02:31:39,010 --> 02:31:39,550
SPEAKER_1:  Are you?

02:31:40,098 --> 02:31:41,342
SPEAKER_1:  willing to.

02:31:42,050 --> 02:31:42,750
SPEAKER_1:  Take an owl.

02:31:43,938 --> 02:31:47,902
SPEAKER_1:  uh... in terms of psychology somebody grabs your way sassy mentioned

02:31:49,986 --> 02:31:52,382
SPEAKER_1:  Boy, if you let that happen, you go home.

02:31:52,674 --> 02:31:54,046
SPEAKER_1:  You're gonna have to pay the price.

02:31:54,658 --> 02:31:58,206
SPEAKER_1:  of you were the person who didn't define you, like in your relationship.

02:31:58,498 --> 02:32:00,958
SPEAKER_1:  You didn't defend your wife's honor. Why would you do that when your wife is impacted by兩ďegoscarele, just when your life was替 Oracle to take you to the gains?

02:32:01,730 --> 02:32:04,638
SPEAKER_1:  You're going to psychologically pay that price yourself?

02:32:04,994 --> 02:32:05,566
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:32:06,466 --> 02:32:09,091
SPEAKER_1:  Depending on your wife, she might secretly also-

02:32:09,091 --> 02:32:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  lose a little bit of respect for you.

02:32:11,682 --> 02:32:12,126
SPEAKER_1:  Now...

02:32:12,514 --> 02:32:15,486
SPEAKER_1:  How do you play that calculus? Cause now we see the war in Ukraine.

02:32:16,738 --> 02:32:21,598
SPEAKER_1:  I would say there is elements of similar posturing in the United States.

02:32:21,858 --> 02:32:22,366
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:32:22,722 --> 02:32:23,582
SPEAKER_1:  in Europe.

02:32:24,034 --> 02:32:27,409
SPEAKER_1:  in Ukraine, Russia, China, leadership.

02:32:27,409 --> 02:32:28,159
SPEAKER_0:  at a

02:32:28,159 --> 02:32:29,790
SPEAKER_1:  back at a geopolitics.

02:32:30,050 --> 02:32:32,350
SPEAKER_1:  It's still somebody grabs somebody's ass.

02:32:33,122 --> 02:32:34,247
SPEAKER_1:  and you're not backing me.

02:32:34,247 --> 02:32:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  So to take those losses and basically just posture, you know, lower your head and

02:32:38,882 --> 02:32:41,438
SPEAKER_0:  live to fight another day type situation.

02:32:41,762 --> 02:32:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  The thing with modern violence is, you know.

02:32:44,706 --> 02:32:45,950
SPEAKER_0:  the access to weaponry.

02:32:46,274 --> 02:32:47,966
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I mean, again.

02:32:48,194 --> 02:32:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  Nobody owns life but anybody who can hold a frying pan can own death. I've seen people.

02:32:52,546 --> 02:32:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:32:53,250 --> 02:32:57,342
SPEAKER_0:  you know, get double leg takedown somebody on the ground. It's a different thing doing in the mats.

02:32:57,954 --> 02:32:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  versus concrete.

02:32:59,042 --> 02:33:00,702
SPEAKER_0:  That's a good way to kill somebody, you know?

02:33:00,962 --> 02:33:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  the most

02:33:02,434 --> 02:33:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  The most prolific impact weapon on the planet is...

02:33:05,186 --> 02:33:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  the planet itself.

02:33:06,466 --> 02:33:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  You can see various videos of people online where they fall and they hit their head or somebody hits their head.

02:33:11,490 --> 02:33:12,254
SPEAKER_0:  and they go into.

02:33:12,898 --> 02:33:14,942
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the stretched out fit basically.

02:33:15,490 --> 02:33:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  And that might not kill you then, but it'll kill you that night.

02:33:19,042 --> 02:33:22,878
SPEAKER_0:  or the second night if you don't get checked out. People bleed out internally, get an edema.

02:33:23,650 --> 02:33:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  Again, the whole aspect of me showing how some of these things.

02:33:27,010 --> 02:33:32,030
SPEAKER_0:  not only some of these methodologies and somehow people prepare for violence and how people

02:33:32,514 --> 02:33:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  experience violence, how they make their weapons, how the people fight in the streets and stuff like that.

02:33:37,218 --> 02:33:40,638
SPEAKER_0:  it's to recognize that behavior from the inception.

02:33:41,250 --> 02:33:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  There's a video I show where there's a bunch of street kids in Rio de Janeiro. I think it's during the Olympics where they're snatching.

02:33:48,258 --> 02:33:49,822
SPEAKER_0:  chains and cell phones from people.

02:33:50,818 --> 02:33:53,182
SPEAKER_0:  And it's a fun video, you know, see it.

02:33:53,890 --> 02:33:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  The first thing you learn about it is how they...

02:33:56,866 --> 02:33:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  Target people.

02:33:58,690 --> 02:34:01,086
SPEAKER_0:  Now who are they going after? There's a bunch of people there.

02:34:01,474 --> 02:34:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  Why are they going after that specific person?

02:34:04,354 --> 02:34:11,838
SPEAKER_0:  and you start learning about profiling and how they identify victim mentality, or the perfect victim, lack of awareness.

02:34:12,610 --> 02:34:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  they keep on a straight line, avoidance, avoidance of eye contact if they're doing something of areas wrong.

02:34:19,682 --> 02:34:24,478
SPEAKER_0:  and how they pick who they're gonna go after, the small people, the women.

02:34:24,706 --> 02:34:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  even some of the men.

02:34:27,170 --> 02:34:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  and they separate the men that they're perfect victims versus the men that are just gonna turn around and punch them in the face, you know? What are they looking for?

02:34:34,434 --> 02:34:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  Well, first off, you notice that the men that are in that environment...

02:34:39,106 --> 02:34:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  that look at them and are aware of their presence, the hyper aware, are the ones that are not a good target.

02:34:45,026 --> 02:34:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  So that's the first lesson there. So it's probably a good idea not only to be hyper aware.

02:34:49,570 --> 02:34:51,262
SPEAKER_0:  but to recognize that hyper wave is another.

02:34:52,162 --> 02:34:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  if I want to separate myself from the victim crowd.

02:34:55,074 --> 02:35:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  Another thing you notice is these are kids going after some grown adults, and some of these grown adult men are with women.

02:35:02,178 --> 02:35:02,814
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:35:03,202 --> 02:35:04,830
SPEAKER_0:  you see them kind of.

02:35:05,154 --> 02:35:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  getting outside of the grasp of the kids that are trying to rip their chains off their neck or their cell phones.

02:35:11,842 --> 02:35:13,822
SPEAKER_0:  and they have no consideration for the women around them.

02:35:14,466 --> 02:35:18,974
SPEAKER_0:  You see other men that are with women and you see them grab the women and put them behind them and ba-

02:35:19,874 --> 02:35:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  And immediately they'll say, this is the wrong one. Let me move on to the next one.

02:35:24,418 --> 02:35:30,462
SPEAKER_0:  So that small little lesson in those videos will show you first how these kids are.

02:35:30,722 --> 02:35:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  growing up.

02:35:32,066 --> 02:35:35,870
SPEAKER_0:  to profile and target who the perfect victims are. That's a school for them.

02:35:37,058 --> 02:35:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  And that is an adversarial school. We should look at that school and-

02:35:41,666 --> 02:35:42,791
SPEAKER_0:  apply to ourselves.

02:35:42,791 --> 02:35:44,766
SPEAKER_1:  In general, you think conflict...

02:35:45,122 --> 02:35:48,094
SPEAKER_1:  Ultimately, the people that are doing conflict are looking forward.

02:35:48,450 --> 02:35:49,118
SPEAKER_1:  weakness.

02:35:49,922 --> 02:35:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, they're looking for opportunity.

02:35:52,034 --> 02:35:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  opportunistic. That's the predators. That's what they do. They look for an opportunity, you know.

02:35:57,186 --> 02:36:00,990
SPEAKER_0:  from jumping down from a tree and getting the slowest gazelle to...

02:36:01,698 --> 02:36:06,398
SPEAKER_0:  Looking for the opportune moment to pounce on something that's probably big, but the risk is worth it

02:36:06,722 --> 02:36:09,054
SPEAKER_1:  I feel like there's several motivations.

02:36:09,314 --> 02:36:11,038
SPEAKER_1:  But isn't there also...

02:36:12,066 --> 02:36:12,734
SPEAKER_1:  Her

02:36:13,026 --> 02:36:15,262
SPEAKER_1:  power hierarchy motivation as well.

02:36:15,554 --> 02:36:19,102
SPEAKER_1:  Like you, there's something about the big guy that tempts you to...

02:36:19,362 --> 02:36:22,942
SPEAKER_1:  send a message, especially with gangs, aren't they constantly?

02:36:23,266 --> 02:36:25,127
SPEAKER_1:  sort of trying to signal

02:36:25,127 --> 02:36:36,094
SPEAKER_0:  the third day alpha. Yeah, I mean, there's a different situation. You could be facing a sociopathic predator who is looking for something in you that you're the resource that they're looking after.

02:36:36,802 --> 02:36:37,470
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe it's a woman.

02:36:38,626 --> 02:36:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  It could be a group of people that don't like the fact that you have a specific nationality or your passport is stamped in a specific way or that you prayed to whatever God.

02:36:49,026 --> 02:36:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  All these factor in.

02:36:51,330 --> 02:36:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  But in the end, they all do the same thing.

02:36:54,402 --> 02:36:56,030
SPEAKER_0:  They look for an advantageous position.

02:36:56,674 --> 02:37:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  If I were to target you, I would put you in between that wall and me. So you have two avenues of exits.

02:37:05,250 --> 02:37:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  and I will step on one of your feet.

02:37:07,394 --> 02:37:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  to keep that avenue closed. So you have to go this way. So this is where my knife is going to be.

02:37:11,682 --> 02:37:13,022
SPEAKER_0:  you see that behavior mirrored.

02:37:14,114 --> 02:37:15,038
SPEAKER_0:  everywhere in the world.

02:37:15,458 --> 02:37:17,758
SPEAKER_0:  First off, you look for advantages.

02:37:18,274 --> 02:37:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  if it's something that's unavoidable, like you're in between me and my ability to go home.

02:37:22,370 --> 02:37:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  Are you in between me and my ability to feed my family?

02:37:25,666 --> 02:37:30,910
SPEAKER_0:  or you're in between me and my ability to posture to the people that are behind me, the young guys that I'm in charge.

02:37:31,906 --> 02:37:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  I will do everything in my power.

02:37:34,530 --> 02:37:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  and you.

02:37:35,458 --> 02:37:35,806
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

02:37:38,146 --> 02:37:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  motivations are.

02:37:40,002 --> 02:37:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  not my realm.

02:37:42,178 --> 02:37:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  the ways they do it are, you know, basically the advantage.

02:37:46,914 --> 02:37:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  part of it.

02:37:47,586 --> 02:37:49,598
SPEAKER_1:  So desperation is...

02:37:50,370 --> 02:37:51,454
SPEAKER_0:  is dangerous.

02:37:52,098 --> 02:37:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  a dangerous school. When it's a dangerous school, I mean, the most dangerous people usually come from those.

02:37:57,634 --> 02:37:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  desperate environments.

02:37:59,330 --> 02:38:01,886
SPEAKER_0:  You can have people in Coronado.

02:38:02,466 --> 02:38:13,758
SPEAKER_0:  holding onto logs in the ocean and go through this millions of dollars worth of training and just be professional killers for the government and just be these incredible human beings.

02:38:14,946 --> 02:38:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  and then there's a kid that will walk up to one of them when he's off, you know?

02:38:18,850 --> 02:38:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  and put an ice pick right into his chest when he's least expecting it.

02:38:22,818 --> 02:38:28,926
SPEAKER_0:  And that doesn't mean that one is superior than the other. It just means that there's more than one way to become that.

02:38:30,178 --> 02:38:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  Teenagers terrify me.

02:38:32,194 --> 02:38:34,814
SPEAKER_1:  It feels like the intensity of desperation.

02:38:36,770 --> 02:38:38,910
SPEAKER_1:  like the capacity of a teenager.

02:38:39,842 --> 02:38:41,534
SPEAKER_1:  Like 16, 17.

02:38:42,082 --> 02:38:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  to be desperate and also not have the

02:38:45,378 --> 02:38:48,062
SPEAKER_1:  matured understanding of ethics of the world.

02:38:48,514 --> 02:38:50,942
SPEAKER_1:  Like they have this intensity of feeling.

02:38:51,938 --> 02:38:53,895
SPEAKER_1:  That I was unlike anything else

02:38:53,895 --> 02:39:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  They don't have a volume knob to that. So it's like a garden hose without a nozzle on it, so you can regulate it. They haven't developed that.

02:39:00,354 --> 02:39:02,526
SPEAKER_0:  They haven't learned that maybe from somebody else or.

02:39:03,170 --> 02:39:09,374
SPEAKER_0:  It used to be warrior cultures. You would be a prentice under somebody or you would learn some of these things from other people. You wouldn't believe it

02:39:09,634 --> 02:39:11,774
SPEAKER_0:  Some modern gangs have a little bit of that.

02:39:12,802 --> 02:39:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  But if you're not, and you're just this kid that's been playing Call of Duty all of his life, or has been witnessing violence in media, then there's no...

02:39:22,978 --> 02:39:23,678
SPEAKER_0:  sense of...

02:39:24,738 --> 02:39:29,406
SPEAKER_0:  Probably a bad idea to go off and do this because all of these repercussions. I could see how that could be a-

02:39:29,794 --> 02:39:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  danger to society.

02:39:32,002 --> 02:39:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  some of the volume knobs, some of the...

02:39:34,978 --> 02:39:38,750
SPEAKER_0:  countermeasures the people exploding on somebody else with a

02:39:39,650 --> 02:39:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  with a weapon, you know, that you see videos constantly online. I remember seeing this one of these two.

02:39:46,626 --> 02:39:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  teenage girls somewhere in the US and one of them just

02:39:49,922 --> 02:39:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  There's a.

02:39:51,010 --> 02:39:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  Fight.

02:39:51,554 --> 02:39:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  There's a hair pulling competition and all of a sudden one of them takes out a knife.

02:39:55,906 --> 02:39:56,702
SPEAKER_0:  And it just happens.

02:39:56,994 --> 02:39:57,438
SPEAKER_0:  like that.

02:39:57,890 --> 02:39:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:39:59,298 --> 02:40:01,022
SPEAKER_0:  It's just pure and restrained.

02:40:01,954 --> 02:40:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  downward stabbing.

02:40:03,522 --> 02:40:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  out.

02:40:04,706 --> 02:40:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  You're like, wait.

02:40:05,922 --> 02:40:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  Where did that come from?

02:40:07,970 --> 02:40:09,022
SPEAKER_0:  Well, uh...

02:40:09,250 --> 02:40:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  She's from an environment where...

02:40:11,746 --> 02:40:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  She saw that as an option.

02:40:13,922 --> 02:40:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  She didn't see the repercussions of it, and she found herself in a place where she thought that was the only viable option.

02:40:20,578 --> 02:40:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  pulling out a weapon.

02:40:22,498 --> 02:40:25,150
SPEAKER_0:  I think that's the dangerous part of it.

02:40:25,986 --> 02:40:27,038
SPEAKER_1:  how do you prepare?

02:40:27,618 --> 02:40:31,198
SPEAKER_1:  to win those kinds of situations, to escape those kinds of situations.

02:40:32,354 --> 02:40:33,662
SPEAKER_1:  Like you said, this is training.

02:40:34,146 --> 02:40:36,021
SPEAKER_1:  It's exposing your mind.

02:40:36,021 --> 02:40:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  I always tell people, like, if you don't have a combative bass, you don't have a bass.

02:40:40,034 --> 02:40:41,886
SPEAKER_0:  boxing, jiu jitsu.

02:40:42,434 --> 02:40:44,309
SPEAKER_1:  And that gives you what, like an awareness of your body?

02:40:44,309 --> 02:40:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  It gives you an awareness of your body, it gives you a spatial awareness. If you can't see the points with your peripheral vision.

02:40:52,674 --> 02:40:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  if you can't see the points of somebody's feet in your peripheral vision.

02:40:56,226 --> 02:40:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  They are in range.

02:40:57,794 --> 02:40:59,614
SPEAKER_0:  to stab you in the heart if they wanted to.

02:41:00,642 --> 02:41:05,150
SPEAKER_0:  And that's something you learn from boxing that you learn from jujitsu. You learn from a bunch of combat arts where you're-

02:41:05,442 --> 02:41:07,550
SPEAKER_0:  you learn about distance and angling people.

02:41:08,546 --> 02:41:12,862
SPEAKER_0:  that comes from this experience that you have. Again, a lot of these things were just...

02:41:13,378 --> 02:41:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  a horse play when we're growing up in some cultures or.

02:41:17,506 --> 02:41:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  rough and tumble with your brothers and shit like that. But some of us are growing up in single kid homes now and we don't get that, we were missing that. And if you don't have it, then you find it in the...

02:41:27,714 --> 02:41:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  You find it in a jiu-jitsu gym, you find it in a boxing gym, you find it in a Thai boxing gym, you find it in places where they specialize in...

02:41:36,194 --> 02:41:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  focusing on certain aspects of this whole combative whole.

02:41:40,546 --> 02:41:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  used to be before UFC.

02:41:43,778 --> 02:41:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  Kung Fu man, you know, Kung Fu guy, that's just street lethal shit. You can't use it in the sporting con. He can't show you this because it'll kill you.

02:41:52,546 --> 02:41:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  Now we pretty much know that most of that was.

02:41:55,202 --> 02:42:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  You know, Flights of Fancy or BS. You know, it pains me too, man. I wanted to learn some of the D-Mock, single punching and killing technique. You know, I remember those books, but that's just not- I'm still on the lookout for that. Maybe somewhere, I don't know.

02:42:07,170 --> 02:42:11,006
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe if you put a pen in your hand, that might turn into that.

02:42:11,330 --> 02:42:13,374
SPEAKER_0:  That's the only way, right?

02:42:14,242 --> 02:42:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of these myths are kind of like faded away. Now you see people that have different combative bases.

02:42:20,098 --> 02:42:22,206
SPEAKER_0:  combining them all and becoming a fighter now.

02:42:23,458 --> 02:42:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  That's a UFC fight, two people fighting each other is one thing.

02:42:27,714 --> 02:42:30,206
SPEAKER_0:  you being in the middle of the Portland riots.

02:42:30,818 --> 02:42:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  and a bunch of.

02:42:32,258 --> 02:42:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  state troopers throwing gas at rioters and then rioters themselves fighting each other.

02:42:37,058 --> 02:42:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  and you finding yourself in the middle of that, that's a completely different thing.

02:42:40,962 --> 02:42:42,174
SPEAKER_0:  And if you think you're gonna...

02:42:42,402 --> 02:42:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  you know, go on the ground and get in a guard with a guy swinging around a piece of a shovel handle, right?

02:42:50,850 --> 02:42:51,838
SPEAKER_0:  your guess is going on.

02:42:52,130 --> 02:42:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  because you got a...

02:42:53,666 --> 02:42:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  stop there and your car was you know

02:42:56,290 --> 02:42:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  windows are broken and your family's in the backseat.

02:42:59,234 --> 02:43:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  You know, that is a different situation.

02:43:02,018 --> 02:43:02,494
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:43:03,458 --> 02:43:04,638
SPEAKER_0:  gonna get medical.

02:43:04,994 --> 02:43:05,406
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:43:06,210 --> 02:43:08,926
SPEAKER_0:  learning about weaponry.

02:43:09,250 --> 02:43:10,526
SPEAKER_0:  I personally...

02:43:11,106 --> 02:43:12,318
SPEAKER_0:  don't really like.

02:43:12,578 --> 02:43:13,310
SPEAKER_0:  fighting on the ground.

02:43:14,146 --> 02:43:21,271
SPEAKER_0:  But that's why I forced myself to go to train with different people out there, you know, on the ground. Jiu-Jitsu, catch wrestling. på placing fly

02:43:21,271 --> 02:43:21,918
SPEAKER_1:  the bottom.

02:43:22,178 --> 02:43:23,518
SPEAKER_1:  Neither, you don't like either.

02:43:23,650 --> 02:43:29,278
SPEAKER_0:  I personally, I like being in a car and running everybody over. That would be great, you know, if I could or driving really far away.

02:43:29,698 --> 02:43:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  or uh...

02:43:31,170 --> 02:43:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  I had this experience and...

02:43:33,346 --> 02:43:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  Utah.

02:43:34,146 --> 02:43:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  Some friends of mine

02:43:36,386 --> 02:43:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  a military...

02:43:38,178 --> 02:43:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  some of your best shooters, some of the best shooters in the US, you know, coming from the Marine Corps.

02:43:44,514 --> 02:43:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  were showing me how they, you know.

02:43:46,978 --> 02:43:48,510
SPEAKER_0:  would shoot something from really far away.

02:43:49,538 --> 02:43:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  And I was like...

02:43:51,618 --> 02:43:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  You don't even have to be in the same vicinity.

02:43:55,106 --> 02:43:58,974
SPEAKER_0:  the scope of violence and how far you can be from it or how close you can be from it.

02:43:59,298 --> 02:44:03,294
SPEAKER_1:  Just wait till we get to see what we can do in the cyber attack world.

02:44:03,778 --> 02:44:07,326
SPEAKER_1:  who can destroy your whole wellbeing, your whole life, your...

02:44:07,522 --> 02:44:09,397
SPEAKER_0:  Identity. That's another aspect.

02:44:09,397 --> 02:44:11,038
SPEAKER_1:  of it too.

02:44:11,522 --> 02:44:12,638
SPEAKER_1:  And then...

02:44:13,026 --> 02:44:15,486
SPEAKER_1:  figure out where you live in terms of ambush.

02:44:15,906 --> 02:44:18,846
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. Everything about you such that.

02:44:19,586 --> 02:44:20,958
SPEAKER_1:  Parting use easy.

02:44:21,186 --> 02:44:25,278
SPEAKER_0:  I have a class where we specifically work on social engineering and kind of.

02:44:26,242 --> 02:44:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  how you can go about something at a micro level.

02:44:30,946 --> 02:44:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  I do a class with a guy named Matt Fiddler who does a

02:44:35,074 --> 02:44:39,678
SPEAKER_0:  Basically, he's one of the premier experts on how to get into and

02:44:39,970 --> 02:44:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  Bypass locks.

02:44:41,218 --> 02:44:41,662
SPEAKER_0:  basically.

02:44:42,722 --> 02:44:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  He'll show you how to open up every single bypass, every single commercial lock available in the United States.

02:44:48,994 --> 02:44:50,238
SPEAKER_0:  Like, he'll spread it out and-

02:44:50,754 --> 02:44:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  and open up everything. And that's it.

02:44:53,282 --> 02:44:53,598
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

02:44:54,210 --> 02:44:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  And my part in his class is I talk about how you can.

02:44:58,050 --> 02:45:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  some of that off in a public space and not get caught or how you would employ some of these things in a context where it's useful for law enforcement, for the military, stuff like that.

02:45:08,386 --> 02:45:09,246
SPEAKER_0:  And uh...

02:45:09,730 --> 02:45:13,758
SPEAKER_0:  So we have this exercise in a public space where there's a bunch of padlocks in the environment.

02:45:14,818 --> 02:45:16,350
SPEAKER_0:  and we paint them pink.

02:45:16,770 --> 02:45:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  So people know it's.

02:45:18,882 --> 02:45:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  our bad locks and we're not breaking into anybody else's bad locks if we get approached and asked about it.

02:45:24,162 --> 02:45:25,214
SPEAKER_0:  But I asked the students like.

02:45:25,698 --> 02:45:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  So you have to gather all these padlocks.

02:45:28,514 --> 02:45:30,014
SPEAKER_0:  of this public space, you know?

02:45:30,434 --> 02:45:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  So how would you do it? A lot of them are trying to pick them.

02:45:32,866 --> 02:45:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  They're very suspiciously picking them and stuff like that, that you get caught.

02:45:37,506 --> 02:45:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  It's the whole situation.

02:45:39,426 --> 02:45:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  But the smart ones...

02:45:40,610 --> 02:45:44,926
SPEAKER_0:  we'll basically develop a social media campaign related to the bad blocks, right?

02:45:45,218 --> 02:45:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  Um

02:45:46,210 --> 02:45:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  a beautiful example of this. This actually happened here in Texas.

02:45:51,042 --> 02:45:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  I did a class out in Dallas.

02:45:53,442 --> 02:45:55,166
SPEAKER_0:  We put the padlocks over this public mall.

02:45:56,034 --> 02:46:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  And the students basically came up with a breast cancer awareness campaign online that they

02:46:02,338 --> 02:46:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  They made Faker.

02:46:04,226 --> 02:46:07,902
SPEAKER_0:  They made flyers for it. They did the social media page on a campaign.

02:46:08,642 --> 02:46:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  They did this email chain. So when they went there, people were expecting them.

02:46:13,058 --> 02:46:19,294
SPEAKER_0:  So they normalized the behavior through social media and they were walking around with bowl cutters in the middle of them all, cutting these things off.

02:46:20,482 --> 02:46:25,694
SPEAKER_0:  That's a beautiful solution to a complex problem of that nature.

02:46:26,498 --> 02:46:31,646
SPEAKER_0:  the weaponizing part of it. Anything can be, all knowledge can be weaponized.

02:46:32,290 --> 02:46:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  If you focus on getting in a street fight with somebody with your fist or a knife, you're missing out on the whole complexity of violence and the way that it's now being utilized.

02:46:41,378 --> 02:46:42,503
SPEAKER_0:  So in terms of breaking out.

02:46:42,503 --> 02:46:43,198
SPEAKER_1:  locks.

02:46:45,090 --> 02:46:47,358
SPEAKER_1:  and in restraints and captivity.

02:46:47,970 --> 02:46:51,646
SPEAKER_1:  Let's talk about a dark topic that you're one of the world experts in.

02:46:51,970 --> 02:46:55,518
SPEAKER_1:  kidnapping you see these courses on conor kidnapping and terrorism

02:46:56,386 --> 02:47:07,070
SPEAKER_1:  I read an estimate that criminal gangs get $500 million a year in ransom payments from kidnapping. Just at a high level, what is kidnapping, who does it, and why?

02:47:07,426 --> 02:47:08,030
SPEAKER_1:  What are some?

02:47:08,354 --> 02:47:09,694
SPEAKER_1:  Insights that can help.

02:47:10,690 --> 02:47:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  us understand what is this problem in the world.

02:47:13,634 --> 02:47:16,190
SPEAKER_0:  It happens in different ways in different parts of the world. I mean...

02:47:16,706 --> 02:47:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  I just sent off a group of people that trained some of the Ukrainians and some of the stuff that they were showing them with some of the counter.

02:47:25,090 --> 02:47:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  custody stuff that I show on the most.

02:47:26,690 --> 02:47:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  for the mind name Vince went out there.

02:47:29,122 --> 02:47:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  was showing them some of the aspects of how to utilize things like Kevlar cordage and how to infuse it in their uniform. So if they get...

02:47:36,610 --> 02:47:38,014
SPEAKER_0:  zip tie to cut them open.

02:47:38,498 --> 02:47:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  war setting so it's

02:47:40,226 --> 02:47:42,910
SPEAKER_0:  talks about being captive in a war zone.

02:47:43,714 --> 02:47:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  but the information or the methodology actually comes from Mexico.

02:47:47,394 --> 02:47:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  that methodology as far as how I learned it.

02:47:49,634 --> 02:47:50,759
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of how to escape from it.

02:47:50,759 --> 02:47:51,509
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

02:47:51,509 --> 02:47:53,150
SPEAKER_0:  So in Mexico you have

02:47:53,762 --> 02:48:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  abductions happening where cartels who hold control over a specific place or zone.

02:48:00,706 --> 02:48:10,846
SPEAKER_0:  are having a hard time with financial situations as far as maybe they're not making enough money to pay everybody off so they let them freelance basically.

02:48:11,394 --> 02:48:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  a lot of ways some of these criminal groups freelance or some of these groups actually professionalize in.

02:48:16,162 --> 02:48:20,862
SPEAKER_0:  to abduct businessmen, abduct the sons of businessmen or people that have money to...

02:48:21,602 --> 02:48:22,814
SPEAKER_0:  Ask for ransoms for them.

02:48:23,458 --> 02:48:23,966
SPEAKER_0:  basically.

02:48:24,770 --> 02:48:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

02:48:26,178 --> 02:48:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  They've taken.

02:48:27,714 --> 02:48:36,990
SPEAKER_0:  you know, captivity and abduction to like an art form in places like Mexico. And it has a history all over the world, but specifically my experience with it, with it was going to.

02:48:37,922 --> 02:48:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  Cartel safe houses is it

02:48:39,618 --> 02:48:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  turn into holding places. You would see homemade prison cells and stuff like that, and people being held in captivity for months, if not years.

02:48:49,250 --> 02:48:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  as they were milking their family for everything they own.

02:48:51,938 --> 02:48:55,838
SPEAKER_1:  So it turns out into a business, they're not actually even interested in hurting the people.

02:48:56,610 --> 02:48:58,686
SPEAKER_1:  physically, they're interested in hurting them.

02:48:59,746 --> 02:49:00,670
SPEAKER_1:  financially.

02:49:00,802 --> 02:49:06,686
SPEAKER_0:  financially and also this if they get hurt they're hurt for a purpose which is to make their family pay up faster or more

02:49:07,394 --> 02:49:18,302
SPEAKER_0:  Some of the abduction groups that I've seen out there, professional ones in Mexico, basically make it a living to target people that have abduction insurance or that work for companies that have good abduction insurance.

02:49:18,722 --> 02:49:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  It's almost like an ATM for them, you know? It's like, ah, here we go again, huh?

02:49:22,242 --> 02:49:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  So there's some of that going on.

02:49:24,162 --> 02:49:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  Some not so much.

02:49:25,634 --> 02:49:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  Some abductions are express

02:49:27,650 --> 02:49:31,678
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I'll grab you with a gunpoint, take you to an ATM.

02:49:32,226 --> 02:49:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  You empty it out and then you're on your way. That's an express kidnapping. That might not be worth you doing any.

02:49:37,282 --> 02:49:39,774
SPEAKER_0:  thing insane, you know, just go with emotions.

02:49:40,674 --> 02:49:42,494
SPEAKER_0:  But some people do get picked up.

02:49:42,882 --> 02:49:43,710
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. Uh-huh.

02:49:44,450 --> 02:49:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  I have trained people with prior experiences of abductions in Mexico and here in the United States, people that have spent some time in captivity with loved ones here, like ex-boyfriends or boyfriends that tie them up and beat the shit out of them.

02:49:59,074 --> 02:50:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  And the restraints that you utilize are zip ties and handcuffs sometimes, or duct tape, or their own clothing, things of this nature.

02:50:06,786 --> 02:50:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  basically what somebody's looking for when they...

02:50:08,994 --> 02:50:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  tie anybody up is to convince you that they are in control.

02:50:12,610 --> 02:50:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  that they are God and that any hope of you releasing those restraints or getting out of that situation is hopeless.

02:50:19,042 --> 02:50:21,950
SPEAKER_0:  from a cartel group picking you up in the middle of a...

02:50:22,274 --> 02:50:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  dirt road somewhere and...

02:50:23,682 --> 02:50:24,670
SPEAKER_0:  Cancun too.

02:50:25,314 --> 02:50:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  Ex-boyfriend showing up at your house and tying you up till you agree to get back with him

02:50:30,466 --> 02:50:31,166
SPEAKER_0:  It's the same thing.

02:50:32,002 --> 02:50:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:50:33,058 --> 02:50:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  and some of the restraints that are being utilized come from different places. I mean, I remember...

02:50:37,794 --> 02:50:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  An instructor I had way back when told me.

02:50:40,898 --> 02:50:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  that the proliferation of zip ties as a restraint in criminal abductions came up after the movie heat came out.

02:50:47,298 --> 02:50:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  because everybody wanted to be Robert De Niro zip-tying people in the bank robbery at the end of the movie.

02:50:52,930 --> 02:50:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  Criminals saw that and...

02:50:54,594 --> 02:50:55,719
SPEAKER_0:  it became a good thing.

02:50:55,719 --> 02:50:57,886
SPEAKER_1:  AS

02:50:58,338 --> 02:51:03,399
SPEAKER_1:  Is it possible to systematically learn how to escape restraints like handcuffs, rope, zip ties?

02:51:03,399 --> 02:51:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  The best at it are not the military. They're not seer program people. They are criminals. I learned how to get out handcuffs from a 15 year old who was in charge of meth sales.

02:51:13,346 --> 02:51:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  in La Avenida Revolucion in Tijuana. Is there a system to it?

02:51:16,610 --> 02:51:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's not specifically a system. It's usually what happens is they'll buy a set of handcuffs and they will mess around with them in a playing feature.

02:51:25,282 --> 02:51:25,694
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:51:26,562 --> 02:51:32,190
SPEAKER_0:  One thing I do in a class is first off, I'm honest about the fact that some, all the restraints are temporary.

02:51:32,738 --> 02:51:33,438
SPEAKER_0:  even marriage.

02:51:34,338 --> 02:51:37,502
SPEAKER_1:  This is like, wait, can we just pause on the deep philosophical?

02:51:38,210 --> 02:51:40,958
SPEAKER_1:  You're like the immortal Musashi with that statements all.

02:51:41,218 --> 02:51:48,767
SPEAKER_0:  All restraints are temporary, even marriage. I'll just, I just like adding that one in there for last because this is a dark subject.

02:51:48,767 --> 02:51:49,517
SPEAKER_1:  Every cage can-

02:51:49,517 --> 02:51:50,078
SPEAKER_0:

02:51:50,370 --> 02:51:54,046
SPEAKER_0:  All restraints are temporary. You either free yourself from the restraints.

02:51:54,594 --> 02:51:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  somebody else takes them off or you're dying, your body rots away around.

02:51:58,274 --> 02:52:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  You know, those are the options.

02:52:00,770 --> 02:52:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  And I like that first option myself.

02:52:03,010 --> 02:52:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  The second option is pretty cool if you can convince somebody to do that for you.

02:52:06,274 --> 02:52:08,222
SPEAKER_0:  But that first option is an interesting one.

02:52:09,026 --> 02:52:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  you have to deconstruct restraints. Not all restraints are made the same. You can train to get out of handcuffs here in the US and focus on a pair of Smith & Wesson handcuffs, which are kind of the most common brand of handcuffs here.

02:52:21,090 --> 02:52:29,406
SPEAKER_0:  But if you find yourself in detention somewhere in Russia, the handcuffs out there are completely different. You know, the key way is different, the mechanism is different, but some of the same.

02:52:30,018 --> 02:52:32,643
SPEAKER_0:  ways of bypassing those mechanisms are.

02:52:32,643 --> 02:52:35,102
SPEAKER_1:  So in Russia, what kind are they using in Russia?

02:52:35,426 --> 02:52:37,502
SPEAKER_1:  I'm gonna travel in there, I need this information.

02:52:37,698 --> 02:52:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  I'll send you a specific model and details on how to get out of those. But basically... Just asking for a friend. I'm sorry.

02:52:43,266 --> 02:52:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  So what I do is I take.

02:52:45,346 --> 02:52:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  I take a pair of Smith and Wesson handcuffs, I put them in the middle of three people in a class, I spread them out.

02:52:51,746 --> 02:53:00,958
SPEAKER_0:  and I have them place them on each other in a just playing manner. I have Hank, I have Hank of Keith there and I have a pair of bowl cutters there in case somebody gets stuck, does something stupid.

02:53:01,602 --> 02:53:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  So they play with each other as far as putting them on randomly. I show them how to put them on appropriately.

02:53:06,658 --> 02:53:09,022
SPEAKER_0:  and then I show them a handcuff key.

02:53:09,346 --> 02:53:11,326
SPEAKER_0:  and a handcuff key will open up handcuffs.

02:53:12,034 --> 02:53:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  Interestingly enough.

02:53:13,538 --> 02:53:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  But the thing about a handcuff key is it's not made to be used by the person that is in those handcuffs.

02:53:19,650 --> 02:53:20,926
SPEAKER_0:  So that's the first lesson there.

02:53:21,666 --> 02:53:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  If you have a handcuff key, handcuff keys are the most used tool to open up handcuffs in custody situations.

02:53:28,834 --> 02:53:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  you know, both.

02:53:30,434 --> 02:53:32,126
SPEAKER_0:  criminals escaped from the police to...

02:53:32,514 --> 02:53:33,662
SPEAKER_0:  people escaping from criminals.

02:53:34,498 --> 02:53:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  Just the standard.

02:53:35,490 --> 02:53:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  hidden handcuff key.

02:53:36,834 --> 02:53:44,062
SPEAKER_0:  So I show them how to modify the handcuff key so it's more optimal to use on yourself with just basic garbage that you can find. Piece of wire.

02:53:44,354 --> 02:53:46,206
SPEAKER_0:  a zip tie piece, basically how to.

02:53:46,434 --> 02:53:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  put a leverage arm on the handcuff key.

02:53:48,962 --> 02:53:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  So you can actually spin it in the keyway behind your back or in front of you.

02:53:53,218 --> 02:53:55,070
SPEAKER_1:  I'm trying to think, I don't think I've ever been in handcuffs.

02:53:55,458 --> 02:53:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  Appropriate way to handcuff somebody is palms out.

02:53:59,074 --> 02:53:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  How much?

02:53:59,618 --> 02:54:00,743
SPEAKER_1:  The restriction is

02:54:00,743 --> 02:54:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of there's a lot if it's a hinge handcuff there's a lot of restriction with no change. Can you reach back? You could try and reach back or you can basically put yourself in a not compromised position and

02:54:13,634 --> 02:54:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  feed the most of your palm meat into the handcuff way. So when they shedded on you.

02:54:18,722 --> 02:54:20,862
SPEAKER_0:  you have more space to work with.

02:54:21,250 --> 02:54:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  so you can spin your hand. we call it a passive resistance.

02:54:25,122 --> 02:54:25,470
SPEAKER_0:

02:54:25,730 --> 02:54:29,054
SPEAKER_0:  Again, you go through a process with them where you deconstruct how people are.

02:54:29,634 --> 02:54:30,334
SPEAKER_0:  handcuffed.

02:54:30,882 --> 02:54:36,830
SPEAKER_0:  handcuff keys and how to modify handcuff key to be able to use on yourself and these all of these things they're Constructing as we go.

02:54:37,474 --> 02:54:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  So they basically, hey, what's a grinding surface? Well, there's concrete outside. So they grind an angle on the key so you can get.

02:54:44,386 --> 02:54:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  a key not to go straight into the keyway, but you can get it.

02:54:48,066 --> 02:54:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  into the key we had an angle for example.

02:54:50,018 --> 02:54:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  something.

02:54:50,978 --> 02:54:52,670
SPEAKER_0:  It's something that is out there as far as a method.

02:54:53,602 --> 02:55:02,750
SPEAKER_0:  You can't spin a key behind your back because it's small. It's designed to be used by somebody else opening those handcuffs on you. So you put an arm on it so you can leverage our arms so you can spin it behind your back.

02:55:04,802 --> 02:55:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  you learn how to...

02:55:06,690 --> 02:55:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  Put yourself in not a compromised position. If somebody asks you for your hands that they could be cuffed, you don't do this.

02:55:14,274 --> 02:55:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  You know, you do that or you put yourself in a cable grip.

02:55:17,186 --> 02:55:23,166
SPEAKER_0:  behind your back, which is a pretty strong grip and it's hard to spread those hands apart. That's the thing that people go into.

02:55:23,426 --> 02:55:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  automatically when they're in fear.

02:55:25,730 --> 02:55:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  So all these things are advantageous for you.

02:55:28,354 --> 02:55:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  and you learn.

02:55:30,306 --> 02:55:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  and not only people get restrained.

02:55:32,418 --> 02:55:36,254
SPEAKER_0:  but you see videos of them because I show a bunch of abduction that's actually happening live.

02:55:38,306 --> 02:55:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  Again, the best thing is avoidance, but specifically when you work around restraints is...

02:55:42,978 --> 02:55:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  Number one, learn how some of these restraints work.

02:55:45,794 --> 02:55:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  Number two is learning how some of the ready-made tools to get out of the restraints look like.

02:55:52,098 --> 02:55:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  function.

02:55:53,570 --> 02:55:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  And number three, which is the advanced level, is learn how to construct all these things yourself.

02:55:57,986 --> 02:55:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  which is I think that is the.

02:55:59,874 --> 02:56:00,702
SPEAKER_0:  That is the best.

02:56:00,994 --> 02:56:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  thing you can show somebody.

02:56:02,914 --> 02:56:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  handcuffs I just use a standard pair of handcuffs and then we deconstruct other very specialized handcuffs that might be out there.

02:56:09,218 --> 02:56:11,070
SPEAKER_0:  and you show them if you're gonna travel somewhere.

02:56:11,426 --> 02:56:14,238
SPEAKER_0:  Learn what restraints are commonly available in the environment.

02:56:15,010 --> 02:56:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  Somebody going to North Sub-Saharan Africa.

02:56:18,178 --> 02:56:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  carrying a plastic handcuff key.

02:56:19,938 --> 02:56:20,446
SPEAKER_0:  is

02:56:21,154 --> 02:56:26,110
SPEAKER_0:  that's going to be useless out there because there's not going to be standard handcuffs out there that would be...

02:56:27,138 --> 02:56:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  open with that type of key. Out there you're probably going to be tied up with a chain and a padlock of some sort, maybe a 40 millimeter Chinese padlock with a plastic core that you can open with.

02:56:37,378 --> 02:56:40,478
SPEAKER_0:  a lighter if you can burn the core, melt the core open or...

02:56:40,706 --> 02:56:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  If you can leverage that open, that's a pretty easy thing to open. Or a bobby pin you can reach all the way in the back and open the latch.

02:56:47,202 --> 02:56:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  What about a rope?

02:56:48,738 --> 02:56:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhh...

02:56:50,114 --> 02:56:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it is common. This is one of my favorite things for rope.

02:56:54,018 --> 02:56:54,622
SPEAKER_0:  Something I-

02:56:55,010 --> 02:56:56,350
SPEAKER_0:  usually carry and...

02:56:56,770 --> 02:56:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  some places.

02:56:58,402 --> 02:56:59,742
SPEAKER_0:  another gift for you if you want.

02:57:00,802 --> 02:57:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  the ceramic razor blade.

02:57:02,690 --> 02:57:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  Is it capable of cutting?

02:57:06,594 --> 02:57:07,006
SPEAKER_0:  Nice.

02:57:07,330 --> 02:57:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  Alright, small.

02:57:08,674 --> 02:57:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  You can put it behind a label. I've seen some students put the Levi's label on there and just...

02:57:13,890 --> 02:57:15,038
SPEAKER_0:  So we pack on.

02:57:15,426 --> 02:57:15,998
SPEAKER_0:  Um,

02:57:16,578 --> 02:57:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  It is non-magnetic, non-ferrous, so in and out of...

02:57:20,386 --> 02:57:20,734
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

02:57:20,962 --> 02:57:24,446
SPEAKER_0:  that type of situation. You can get in and it's something you can have with you.

02:57:24,898 --> 02:57:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  everywhere.

02:57:26,242 --> 02:57:32,510
SPEAKER_0:  This is a pretty fancy one, or you can just grab a simple razor blade. Actually learning how to use or leverage a razor blade.

02:57:32,994 --> 02:57:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  between your palms.

02:57:34,466 --> 02:57:34,974
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:57:35,778 --> 02:57:39,153
SPEAKER_0:  know how to go up and down with it to be able to cut yourself.

02:57:39,153 --> 02:57:41,403
SPEAKER_1:  So that's just practice to do that well.

02:57:41,403 --> 02:57:48,958
SPEAKER_0:  It's practice and it's also exposure to just this is a possibility. This is how you could hide it. Again, the whole smuggling aspect comes from a criminal.

02:57:49,314 --> 02:57:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  a criminal mindset type setting.

02:57:51,842 --> 02:57:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  So how things are hidden, where they're hidden.

02:57:54,626 --> 02:57:58,238
SPEAKER_0:  And when I talk about concealing objects of this nature, it usually comes from...

02:57:59,170 --> 02:57:59,646
SPEAKER_0:  smuggling.

02:57:59,970 --> 02:58:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the fact that I have something in a notebook comes from heroin smuggling.

02:58:04,386 --> 02:58:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  If you're not looking at the school of criminality, you're missing out on a big...

02:58:08,994 --> 02:58:09,630
SPEAKER_0:  part of the uh...

02:58:10,050 --> 02:58:10,558
SPEAKER_0:  equation.

02:58:12,098 --> 02:58:14,174
SPEAKER_1:  So for people who want to learn.

02:58:14,658 --> 02:58:18,718
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, this D. Do you teach courses on this? Do you know what's the right? What's the rec?

02:58:19,138 --> 02:58:22,513
SPEAKER_1:  How do you get in touch with you or learn from you? Do you have stuff online or is it all online?

02:58:22,513 --> 02:58:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  So I have some stuff on my patreon specifically I have a patreon where I share a lot of the

02:58:28,578 --> 02:58:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  Online material, basically a bunch of, this is my notebook, I have a bunch of stuff that I just met somebody in Philadelphia that showed me a pretty unique way of...

02:58:38,466 --> 02:58:42,526
SPEAKER_0:  utilizing a box cutter as a weapon. So I wrote some of that down.

02:58:43,042 --> 02:58:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  I filmed some of it.

02:58:44,578 --> 02:58:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:58:45,314 --> 02:58:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  And it's not for any other reason. I'm not trying to create dangerous people out there. It's like, hey, look at this. This is something that's out there.

02:58:51,618 --> 02:58:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:58:52,354 --> 02:58:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  So a lot of that information, some of those notes and stuff like that, I keep on my Patreon.

02:58:56,482 --> 02:58:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  I used to share it openly on Facebook and Instagram, but that...

02:59:00,066 --> 02:59:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  That has not, uh...

02:59:01,442 --> 02:59:01,758
SPEAKER_0:  been.

02:59:02,082 --> 02:59:03,038
SPEAKER_0:  possible anymore.

02:59:03,650 --> 02:59:08,638
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I'm a member of your Patreon and I recommend people sign up. It's really great because you also have philosophy.

02:59:09,218 --> 02:59:10,878
SPEAKER_1:  You're the...

02:59:11,650 --> 02:59:12,702
SPEAKER_1:  You're the, uh...

02:59:12,962 --> 02:59:14,718
SPEAKER_1:  the Mexican Miyamoto Musashi.

02:59:15,394 --> 02:59:18,769
SPEAKER_1:  It's not just these skills, it's also the philosophy around it.

02:59:18,769 --> 02:59:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  Like I got that book of five rings before I went into training. Like I took that with me through training.

02:59:24,674 --> 02:59:32,062
SPEAKER_0:  the whole aspect of, you know, go to places frightening to the common brand of men, you know, be put in jail and extricate yourself with your own wisdom.

02:59:32,642 --> 02:59:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  I think he was speaking about experiencing experience, you know, the whole warrior's journey, the hero's journey of going out there and actually risking.

02:59:40,418 --> 02:59:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:59:41,090 --> 02:59:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  I think that's a pretty...

02:59:43,010 --> 02:59:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  big basis and aspect of what the work I do and showing some of these things.

02:59:47,426 --> 02:59:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  There's a tendency to people say, hey, I'm afraid to go to Mexico.

02:59:50,786 --> 02:59:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  What do I need to know? Like, well, if you're afraid to go to Mexico, go to Mexico.

02:59:55,106 --> 03:00:00,958
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I was in Detroit. I was pretty afraid when I was in Detroit, in some parts of Detroit and the South Side of Chicago.

03:00:01,538 --> 03:00:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  Um, but, uh,

03:00:03,682 --> 03:00:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  I don't want to be dictated.

03:00:04,898 --> 03:00:13,566
SPEAKER_0:  where I can go and where I can't go because of safety. I want to take responsibility for that myself and figure out ways of being more capable and an asset to the people around me and myself.

03:00:14,786 --> 03:00:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  And that comes through experience.

03:00:16,546 --> 03:00:16,926
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:00:17,378 --> 03:00:23,966
SPEAKER_0:  and people don't want to risk getting a shoulder injury, rolling a jujitsu, or don't want to risk getting a bloody nose in boxing, but that is the way.

03:00:24,930 --> 03:00:26,174
SPEAKER_1:  Well, there's some aspects.

03:00:26,594 --> 03:00:27,742
SPEAKER_1:  to fitting in.

03:00:28,130 --> 03:00:29,054
SPEAKER_1:  You quote.

03:00:29,602 --> 03:00:31,198
SPEAKER_1:  Katori Hanzo on imitation.

03:00:31,810 --> 03:00:39,390
SPEAKER_1:  The most important thing you should keep in mind when you go on a shinobi mission is to imitate well the language of the target province.

03:00:39,714 --> 03:00:41,278
SPEAKER_1:  and the ways of the local people.

03:00:41,698 --> 03:00:43,166
SPEAKER_1:  This includes their appearances.

03:00:43,426 --> 03:00:44,766
SPEAKER_1:  the way of wearing clothes.

03:00:45,090 --> 03:00:46,398
SPEAKER_1:  The way of shaving their head.

03:00:46,914 --> 03:00:48,766
SPEAKER_1:  way of making up their hair.

03:00:49,154 --> 03:00:54,110
SPEAKER_1:  the way of making up a sword or short sword, and the way of refinement and luxury.

03:00:54,338 --> 03:00:55,710
SPEAKER_1:  So how do you fit into some of those?

03:00:55,938 --> 03:00:56,414
SPEAKER_1:  places.

03:00:57,474 --> 03:01:04,798
SPEAKER_1:  You know Mexico, but a person like me that doesn't know anything about Mexico and Sam interviewing somebody in a leadership position in a drug cartel.

03:01:05,890 --> 03:01:07,015
SPEAKER_1:  How quickly do you?

03:01:07,015 --> 03:01:07,902
SPEAKER_0:  learn how to fit in.

03:01:08,226 --> 03:01:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's not about fitting in, it's about coming up with a narrative for yourself. What that book is talking about, that's a quote from the book called A Shoninki.

03:01:15,970 --> 03:01:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  which is like a...

03:01:16,994 --> 03:01:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  an actual legit ninja manual from the 1500s or something like that.

03:01:22,690 --> 03:01:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  and they're not talking about blending in.

03:01:25,922 --> 03:01:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  They're talking about creating a narrative or a lie through your appearance and your behavior and your knowledge base. That's what they're talking about.

03:01:33,346 --> 03:01:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  I would say first.

03:01:34,562 --> 03:01:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  If you're going to go to a place like that, first off, learn what is common there.

03:01:38,466 --> 03:01:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  What type of common restraints might be placed on you? What criminal groups work out there? What type of guns they have?

03:01:44,770 --> 03:01:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  not only what type of guns they have, but go to the gun range in Vegas and learn how to fire some of these firearms yourself so you know how to load them in case you run into a bad situation.

03:01:52,610 --> 03:01:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  how they tie the sword, how they wear their sword swords.

03:01:56,642 --> 03:01:58,078
SPEAKER_0:  could equate to how, you know.

03:01:58,754 --> 03:02:06,037
SPEAKER_0:  if you run into some issues. Also, it will give you a good idea how many rounds those hold so you can run at the right moment. I like how you f-

03:02:06,037 --> 03:02:12,177
SPEAKER_1:  focusing on the tools of violence. But there's also the social engineering de-escalation, right?

03:02:12,177 --> 03:02:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  So if you are in an environment like that and you are carrying around a camera

03:02:16,930 --> 03:02:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  that might be an issue.

03:02:18,050 --> 03:02:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  Or the opposite and not be an issue. Well, if you're asked like.

03:02:21,506 --> 03:02:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  Who are you with? Am I with a news organization or am I with a Christian aid group here?

03:02:27,234 --> 03:02:30,334
SPEAKER_0:  And if you are with a Christian aid group, it's probably a good idea to learn some of the Bible.

03:02:30,914 --> 03:02:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  if you want a quick way of having a.

03:02:33,506 --> 03:02:44,387
SPEAKER_0:  somebody out there try and stop talking to you. You're gonna start talking about Jesus in the middle of a little cartel territory when they approach you and take out the Bible. That'll quickly deescalate...

03:02:44,387 --> 03:02:49,278
SPEAKER_1:  prefer to do is I find somebody from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal and beat them up in front of the...

03:02:49,698 --> 03:02:52,323
SPEAKER_1:  just to send a signal to journalists and I too don't.

03:02:52,323 --> 03:02:55,294
SPEAKER_0:  like journalists. That could be a way, but...

03:02:55,746 --> 03:03:02,878
SPEAKER_0:  to send a message. I think a lot of us miss the fact that we are capable of taking control of our own narrative and what we communicate to people around us.

03:03:03,202 --> 03:03:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  I can show up here drinking a Monster Energy drink.

03:03:06,754 --> 03:03:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  dumping it on the ground, scratching you know what, then just sit down and just be a rude motherfucker. That's not who I am, but I can do that.

03:03:14,274 --> 03:03:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  and you will believe me if I am good at it.

03:03:17,058 --> 03:03:24,254
SPEAKER_0:  Some of us miss the, some of us don't know this aspect because it's something we consider predatory or something that is wrong or negative or bad.

03:03:25,026 --> 03:03:27,230
SPEAKER_0:  And some of these aspects are actually, you know.

03:03:27,458 --> 03:03:28,894
SPEAKER_0:  They're pretty useful.

03:03:29,410 --> 03:03:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  I learned most of my tradecraft and skill craft from panhandlers and

03:03:33,506 --> 03:03:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  street performers.

03:03:35,234 --> 03:03:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  when I had.

03:03:36,290 --> 03:03:39,902
SPEAKER_0:  some training related to social engineering. Those were the people that I learned from.

03:03:40,578 --> 03:03:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  I remember.

03:03:42,338 --> 03:03:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  we were doing surveillance and there was a guy there that showed us how to do surveillance, you know, on the street.

03:03:47,394 --> 03:03:47,934
SPEAKER_0:  And he said.

03:03:48,162 --> 03:03:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  if you can find a way for somebody to smell you before they see you.

03:03:52,674 --> 03:03:53,662
SPEAKER_0:  you'll become invisible.

03:03:54,466 --> 03:03:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  And I was like, that's bullshit.

03:03:56,802 --> 03:04:01,662
SPEAKER_0:  If you can find a way of somebody smelling you before they see you become invisible, I didn't understand what that meant.

03:04:03,106 --> 03:04:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  So we went on a three day bender, didn't take a shower, smelled like shit.

03:04:07,330 --> 03:04:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  No deodorant.

03:04:08,354 --> 03:04:10,878
SPEAKER_0:  You know, you smell like a homeless person, you look like a homeless person.

03:04:11,170 --> 03:04:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  and you approach somebody asking for the time and they smell you before they see you.

03:04:15,042 --> 03:04:18,174
SPEAKER_0:  and you are not there. You're not a human. You don't exist.

03:04:19,362 --> 03:04:21,987
SPEAKER_0:  So that was a pretty valuable lesson that I got there. Yeah, this is a good one.

03:04:21,987 --> 03:04:23,838
SPEAKER_1:  So that's interesting, but like...

03:04:24,098 --> 03:04:25,278
SPEAKER_1:  I have this belief.

03:04:25,922 --> 03:04:29,086
SPEAKER_1:  It has to do with the way I operate in this world, I suppose.

03:04:30,434 --> 03:04:35,070
SPEAKER_1:  If you come off as a person legitimately, I guess you could fake it, but I think it's...

03:04:35,490 --> 03:04:36,606
SPEAKER_1:  It just feels like...

03:04:36,834 --> 03:04:38,782
SPEAKER_1:  you can be extremely good.

03:04:40,130 --> 03:04:41,918
SPEAKER_1:  possibly the best in the world.

03:04:43,106 --> 03:04:45,662
SPEAKER_1:  if you practice it your whole life at being you.

03:04:45,954 --> 03:04:48,254
SPEAKER_1:  You being authentic, being.

03:04:48,482 --> 03:04:50,366
SPEAKER_1:  It's showing like you have nothing to hide.

03:04:51,202 --> 03:04:51,614
SPEAKER_1:  and

03:04:51,746 --> 03:04:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  a true believer.

03:04:52,930 --> 03:04:54,055
SPEAKER_0:  is what I true.

03:04:54,055 --> 03:04:57,086
SPEAKER_1:  So like yes, you can come up with a fake narrative, but then

03:04:57,346 --> 03:05:00,190
SPEAKER_1:  What I mean is like live that narrative your whole life then.

03:05:00,610 --> 03:05:01,735
SPEAKER_1:  We'll be...

03:05:01,735 --> 03:05:02,485
SPEAKER_0:  like, I understand.

03:05:02,485 --> 03:05:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I understand. And then never falter from that.

03:05:05,890 --> 03:05:09,265
SPEAKER_1:  Like you are this person. That's what I'm trying to have nothing.

03:05:09,265 --> 03:05:19,006
SPEAKER_0:  to hide. I consider that a true believer and yeah that is a unique person when you meet them and they are out there. There are people that will fucking walk into places.

03:05:19,234 --> 03:05:21,694
SPEAKER_0:  This is why I am I don't give a fuck

03:05:22,050 --> 03:05:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  This is who I am. If you don't trust me, well, shoot me. Fuck it.

03:05:25,410 --> 03:05:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  This is my honesty and if you don't trust me, well look at all these people that I've interacted with in the past and you can ask them about it or you can see my effects on other people.

03:05:33,858 --> 03:05:36,423
SPEAKER_0:  That's going to be my presentation card. That's the way you said it.

03:05:36,423 --> 03:05:38,686
SPEAKER_1:  it now is using words in its blunt.

03:05:39,042 --> 03:05:40,734
SPEAKER_1:  Usually if somebody's blunt like that.

03:05:41,026 --> 03:05:43,038
SPEAKER_1:  Like I'm a no bullshit person that means they're not.

03:05:43,362 --> 03:05:44,487
SPEAKER_1:  That means there are fellowships.

03:05:44,487 --> 03:05:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  actually. But you do that through, I mean I'm saying I'm verbalizing your behavior, you know, just walking somewhere.

03:05:50,914 --> 03:05:53,502
SPEAKER_0:  Let's say you're going to interview.

03:05:53,858 --> 03:05:55,454
SPEAKER_0:  somebody very dangerous down there.

03:05:56,130 --> 03:05:58,046
SPEAKER_0:  and you walk into a room without worry.

03:05:59,810 --> 03:06:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  That is.

03:06:01,410 --> 03:06:05,822
SPEAKER_0:  That is a presentation to you. I know that's a pretty interesting introduction.

03:06:06,786 --> 03:06:09,054
SPEAKER_0:  You're not a threat because...

03:06:09,538 --> 03:06:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  You don't consider yourself a threat and you're walking in there with the confidence that you don't consider yourself a threat.

03:06:14,914 --> 03:06:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  which is an interesting way of going about it.

03:06:17,442 --> 03:06:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  my life experiences has been different.

03:06:19,938 --> 03:06:25,150
SPEAKER_0:  I was in program that way from an early age and it's hard for me to go into that line.

03:06:26,050 --> 03:06:35,870
SPEAKER_0:  Although more and more as I get older and as I learn more about the world and I've failed a few more times, I can understand or more cognizant of the fact that...

03:06:37,346 --> 03:06:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  You don't really have to try that much if you believe.

03:06:41,474 --> 03:06:46,014
SPEAKER_0:  in yourself and who you are. If you know yourself, I think that is...

03:06:46,402 --> 03:06:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  at the core of it. If you know yourself enough.

03:06:49,474 --> 03:06:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  to be able to kind of communicate that to people around you.

03:06:53,954 --> 03:06:57,854
SPEAKER_1:  and you're not hiding from yourself or from the world your flaws.

03:06:58,562 --> 03:07:00,670
SPEAKER_1:  That was the other thing you spoke to.

03:07:01,218 --> 03:07:03,294
SPEAKER_1:  that is probably inspiring to others is.

03:07:03,554 --> 03:07:06,750
SPEAKER_1:  being honest about your flaws, about your weaknesses as a human being.

03:07:06,850 --> 03:07:10,846
SPEAKER_0:  You can't pick pocket or naked man. Yeah, that's right. That's really brilliant. If you can.

03:07:11,522 --> 03:07:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  if you know how to be naked. And again, I'm not there. I think I'm working towards that.

03:07:16,514 --> 03:07:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  Just bye.

03:07:18,082 --> 03:07:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  Hopefully going through shit and uh...

03:07:20,578 --> 03:07:22,110
SPEAKER_0:  showing people not telling them.

03:07:22,370 --> 03:07:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  is a show me don't tell me is another.

03:07:24,290 --> 03:07:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  valuable lesson that I got long ago.

03:07:27,106 --> 03:07:27,550
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:07:28,418 --> 03:07:37,566
SPEAKER_0:  I travel across the country and I not only get to show people what I know how to do, but I give examples of it through things that I do out there.

03:07:39,010 --> 03:07:47,934
SPEAKER_0:  I say this a lot, you know, when I travel out there, I'm never alone. You know, there's couches out there waiting for me. You know, there's homes that I can go and stay at.

03:07:48,674 --> 03:07:50,750
SPEAKER_0:  friends that I have out there that I have never even met.

03:07:51,778 --> 03:07:59,774
SPEAKER_0:  But that's been about me not only wearing some of those mistakes and past failures on my sleeve, but also turning them into lessons for people.

03:08:00,706 --> 03:08:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  and...

03:08:01,730 --> 03:08:04,286
SPEAKER_0:  just telling people the fact that I know how to do all this.

03:08:04,834 --> 03:08:07,070
SPEAKER_0:  weird stuff, you know, and I show people how to do it. weird stuff, you know, and I show people how to do it.

03:08:07,970 --> 03:08:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  But here's a bunch of weird memes that are very humorous about my culture and about

03:08:12,418 --> 03:08:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  being it through going through therapy and.

03:08:15,554 --> 03:08:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  This is me doing something goofy and this is me being an idiot in front of all you guys as well. You know, this is me being the fool. I think that is another aspect of it.

03:08:23,906 --> 03:08:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  I love that as part of that journey you made enemies with the rodeo clown and made up with them afterwards.

03:08:28,386 --> 03:08:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, we're still, let's hope.

03:08:30,562 --> 03:08:35,437
SPEAKER_0:  We're in a very toxic relationship. You know, he knows who he is. He's probably out there listening. He's a lovin'

03:08:35,437 --> 03:08:35,870
SPEAKER_1:  hate.

03:08:35,970 --> 03:08:40,318
SPEAKER_0:  We, we, we, we stopped talking to each other for months and then, you know, just send up.

03:08:40,738 --> 03:08:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  message of some sort and just you know we're back at it.

03:08:43,522 --> 03:08:44,606
SPEAKER_1:  You know, back, yeah.

03:08:45,090 --> 03:08:48,062
SPEAKER_1:  Love expressed through anger. I love it. Therapeutic.

03:08:48,706 --> 03:08:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  You have both very interesting career paths. If we can just.

03:08:52,546 --> 03:08:54,878
SPEAKER_1:  jump back to a really interesting topic that

03:08:55,202 --> 03:08:56,446
SPEAKER_1:  I wanted to mention.

03:08:56,866 --> 03:08:58,078
SPEAKER_1:  on narco-ecultism.

03:08:58,850 --> 03:09:00,446
SPEAKER_1:  What are narco cults?

03:09:01,058 --> 03:09:06,334
SPEAKER_1:  What's the relationship between you kind of mentioned religion a little bit. Yeah. What's the relationship between.

03:09:07,266 --> 03:09:08,391
SPEAKER_1:  religious culture.

03:09:08,391 --> 03:09:11,710
SPEAKER_0:  drug culture. First off, Mexico is one of the most Catholic countries on the planet.

03:09:12,194 --> 03:09:14,558
SPEAKER_0:  if not the most Catholic country on the planet.

03:09:15,074 --> 03:09:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  Not only that, it is a country that has.

03:09:18,018 --> 03:09:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  a root in spirituality.

03:09:20,674 --> 03:09:23,166
SPEAKER_0:  through its ethnic culture.

03:09:23,970 --> 03:09:24,478
SPEAKER_0:  that.

03:09:25,762 --> 03:09:30,878
SPEAKER_0:  other parts of the world got most of that taken away and or suppressed or killed or...

03:09:31,266 --> 03:09:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  taken away.

03:09:32,610 --> 03:09:33,022
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:09:33,762 --> 03:09:36,990
SPEAKER_0:  when the Spanish came to Mexico, they were...

03:09:37,570 --> 03:09:38,686
SPEAKER_0:  a product of a...

03:09:38,946 --> 03:09:39,774
SPEAKER_0:  recently.

03:09:40,162 --> 03:09:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  liberated.

03:09:41,794 --> 03:09:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  group of people. They just got done being invaded by the Moors, basically.

03:09:46,562 --> 03:09:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  and they brought with them the image of La Virgen de Guadalupe.

03:09:50,690 --> 03:09:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  the version of Guadalupe.

03:09:52,674 --> 03:09:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  Anon Cortez's vision of that or version of that was a lady holding a crystal scepter.

03:09:58,114 --> 03:09:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  Baby Jesus.

03:09:59,298 --> 03:10:01,086
SPEAKER_0:  and standing on a crescent moon.

03:10:01,762 --> 03:10:03,486
SPEAKER_0:  That's what he brought with him.

03:10:03,938 --> 03:10:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  to the Americas.

03:10:05,698 --> 03:10:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  And uh...

03:10:06,946 --> 03:10:08,222
SPEAKER_0:  when the conquest happened.

03:10:08,450 --> 03:10:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of people say that Spanish came and conquests the Aztec Empire.

03:10:13,954 --> 03:10:17,886
SPEAKER_0:  The enemies of the Aztec allied themselves with the Spanish and they took them down.

03:10:18,210 --> 03:10:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  That's what happened. And then the rest was.

03:10:20,482 --> 03:10:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  famine and sickness.

03:10:23,298 --> 03:10:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  That's what killed most of them.

03:10:25,378 --> 03:10:31,166
SPEAKER_0:  they realized that it was gonna be hard to suppress some of the spiritual practices in Mexico. So they decided to...

03:10:31,554 --> 03:10:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  mill them with Catholic iconography.

03:10:34,754 --> 03:10:37,566
SPEAKER_0:  So you see this cult to...

03:10:37,922 --> 03:10:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  one I'd seen which is like a

03:10:39,874 --> 03:10:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  fertility variant of...

03:10:42,434 --> 03:10:44,254
SPEAKER_0:  a mother goddess in the athletic culture.

03:10:44,674 --> 03:10:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  and they turn her into La Virgen de Guadalupe, which is the icon that a lot of Mexicans venerate as the-

03:10:50,434 --> 03:10:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  La Virgen the Virgin.

03:10:52,546 --> 03:10:52,990
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:10:53,634 --> 03:10:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  but in her she conceals.

03:10:56,194 --> 03:10:57,790
SPEAKER_0:  cultural elements from the past.

03:10:58,050 --> 03:11:04,350
SPEAKER_0:  She has a black sash across her stomach, which means she's pregnant. Common in the Aztec culture and the Mejica culture.

03:11:05,250 --> 03:11:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  She's standing on a chair that has eagle wings.

03:11:08,194 --> 03:11:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  that is a war god.

03:11:09,762 --> 03:11:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  That's the symbol of the war god down there.

03:11:12,130 --> 03:11:13,822
SPEAKER_0:  She has stars on her, which is a...

03:11:14,242 --> 03:11:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  There's a veil of certain stars that are related to some of the spiritual practices from before.

03:11:20,994 --> 03:11:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  Basically, they hid these things in that setting. That's how you skip forward.

03:11:27,426 --> 03:11:28,542
SPEAKER_0:  you know, hundreds of years.

03:11:29,474 --> 03:11:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  and you start seeing things like...

03:11:32,642 --> 03:11:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  Malverde

03:11:33,570 --> 03:11:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  who was a bandit that lived in Zinaloa way back in the day.

03:11:36,962 --> 03:11:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  he would rob rich farmers that would go through the...

03:11:40,450 --> 03:11:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  the countryside.

03:11:42,178 --> 03:11:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  One time he was almost caught and he was shot and injured.

03:11:45,090 --> 03:11:48,446
SPEAKER_0:  and he was wanted by the government. So he told one of his friends to

03:11:49,890 --> 03:11:52,446
SPEAKER_0:  tell them where he was and to give them money.

03:11:52,738 --> 03:11:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  the reward money to the townspeople.

03:11:55,234 --> 03:11:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  So we did that.

03:11:56,962 --> 03:12:02,686
SPEAKER_0:  He was hung from a tree and the order was not to bury him, just to let his body rot.

03:12:03,458 --> 03:12:06,494
SPEAKER_0:  His body rotted away until it fell onto the ground bones.

03:12:07,458 --> 03:12:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  and each of the townspeople would go over and put a rock on top of his.

03:12:11,874 --> 03:12:14,110
SPEAKER_0:  until it became a pile of rocks.

03:12:14,818 --> 03:12:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  And then he started granting miracles.

03:12:18,018 --> 03:12:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  So again, this whole aspect of these criminals become insates.

03:12:22,690 --> 03:12:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  and also the middle finger from the...

03:12:25,890 --> 03:12:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  downward local populace to the.

03:12:28,098 --> 03:12:33,534
SPEAKER_0:  the church in a way because he's not a recognized saint, but he has an altar and people venerate the church in a way because he's not a recognized saint, but he has an altar and people venerate

03:12:34,754 --> 03:12:36,094
SPEAKER_0:  then you have...

03:12:36,866 --> 03:12:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  cartels that have a spiritual practice or spirituality behind what they do, which is part of their culture, but is also like a tool.

03:12:44,162 --> 03:12:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  They used to.

03:12:46,594 --> 03:12:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  ingratiate themselves with the local population or the population around them. icons of power and sometimes of

03:12:56,130 --> 03:12:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  I'm almost a symbol of rebellion.

03:12:58,658 --> 03:13:04,894
SPEAKER_0:  You see El Chapo's son, when he was arrested, had a Santo Niño de Tocha on his chest.

03:13:05,442 --> 03:13:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  which is a.

03:13:06,850 --> 03:13:08,286
SPEAKER_0:  It's a holy kid of a daughter.

03:13:09,282 --> 03:13:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  Spanish legend.

03:13:10,562 --> 03:13:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  During the Morris conquest, they said that a statue of that saint would go around and feed some of the hungry. That was the legend.

03:13:19,458 --> 03:13:22,526
SPEAKER_0:  and he's a saint of the persecuted. So.

03:13:23,074 --> 03:13:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  The fact that when he was arrested, you see him wearing that and then he was liberated is a-

03:13:29,634 --> 03:13:30,974
SPEAKER_0:  miracle in and of itself.

03:13:32,226 --> 03:13:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  So it's proof.

03:13:33,218 --> 03:13:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  that that works.

03:13:34,690 --> 03:13:40,158
SPEAKER_0:  you see that was, you can find one of those scapularios anywhere in Mexico that was the most

03:13:40,418 --> 03:13:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  At least the sold one.

03:13:42,274 --> 03:13:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:13:43,650 --> 03:13:48,446
SPEAKER_0:  So you see them utilizing some of these aspects in their own.

03:13:48,674 --> 03:13:53,246
SPEAKER_0:  belief system as similar as iconography for some of the things they do.

03:13:54,082 --> 03:13:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  then you go into some of the other aspects of it that are out there like Santa Muerte.

03:13:58,114 --> 03:13:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  which is actually a faith that I grew up in.

03:14:01,378 --> 03:14:03,678
SPEAKER_0:  Mexico has a weird relationship to death.

03:14:04,930 --> 03:14:11,166
SPEAKER_0:  We have parties at the cemetery on Day of the Dead, and I just went through one recently. This is November the 2nd.

03:14:12,066 --> 03:14:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:14:12,770 --> 03:14:14,814
SPEAKER_0:  So we celebrate our dead.

03:14:15,106 --> 03:14:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  and we celebrate death in a way that I don't think a lot of cultures out there do.

03:14:19,266 --> 03:14:22,942
SPEAKER_0:  So it's a joyful occasion. It is a celebration, yeah. My eight year old.

03:14:23,266 --> 03:14:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  put two beers on an altar, one for my mom, one for my brother.

03:14:27,074 --> 03:14:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  She bought a Snickers bar for my mom and a bag of pops for my...

03:14:32,610 --> 03:14:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  brother.

03:14:33,762 --> 03:14:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  flower petals and marigolds and pictures of them on an altar. This is amazing. What kind of beer?

03:14:39,106 --> 03:14:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  Tecate. Tecate Roja for my mother because she was hardcore and Tecate Light for my brother. You know, he was more of an endurance drinker.

03:14:47,874 --> 03:14:48,446
SPEAKER_0:  Um,

03:14:49,090 --> 03:14:50,110
SPEAKER_0:  And it's also for me.

03:14:50,722 --> 03:14:53,214
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, the relationship to death down there is different

03:14:53,570 --> 03:14:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  So there's an icon in Mexico. It's actually one of the

03:14:56,994 --> 03:14:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  fastest rolling.

03:14:59,042 --> 03:15:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  alternative spiritual practices in Mexico.

03:15:02,850 --> 03:15:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  And not only in Mexico, but here in the US, I've been to Santa Marta temples across the country.

03:15:08,418 --> 03:15:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  I found one in Connecticut out of all places.

03:15:12,226 --> 03:15:14,558
SPEAKER_0:  how I grew up with it or I saw it is...

03:15:15,138 --> 03:15:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  My family was on Guadalupe Anas.

03:15:18,210 --> 03:15:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  We were Catholic and we venerated the Virgin of Guadalupe specifically.

03:15:23,362 --> 03:15:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  the icon of the region of Guadalupe.

03:15:25,954 --> 03:15:31,902
SPEAKER_0:  But every now and then there are winks and nods to a skeletal saint in family practices.

03:15:32,194 --> 03:15:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  even when I went to work.

03:15:34,914 --> 03:15:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  The older guys that I was working with would tell me like, okay, we gotta go ask a...

03:15:41,282 --> 03:15:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  Ask for protection.

03:15:43,266 --> 03:15:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  So they would drive me over to the church and I thought I was going to the cathedral and then we made our

03:15:48,546 --> 03:15:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  left turn and it wasn't the cathedral, it was the

03:15:51,618 --> 03:15:53,470
SPEAKER_0:  market next to the Cathedral in Tijuana.

03:15:53,698 --> 03:15:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  and.

03:15:54,722 --> 03:15:56,606
SPEAKER_0:  In the little corner, there was a big...

03:15:57,090 --> 03:15:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  uh

03:15:58,210 --> 03:16:00,030
SPEAKER_0:  Santa Marta Reaper refugee.

03:16:00,386 --> 03:16:00,958
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:16:01,890 --> 03:16:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  And then I knew why I had to bring a bottle of tequila. It's like, why am I bringing a bottle of tequila to the church?

03:16:07,554 --> 03:16:08,222
SPEAKER_0:  It was for her.

03:16:08,770 --> 03:16:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  Death, la muerte.

03:16:10,722 --> 03:16:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  It was partly hazing.

03:16:13,250 --> 03:16:13,982
SPEAKER_0:  And also...

03:16:14,690 --> 03:16:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  they did believe that they were basically imbued with.

03:16:20,354 --> 03:16:22,974
SPEAKER_0:  the being agents of death in a way.

03:16:23,298 --> 03:16:27,550
SPEAKER_0:  So it was like a cultural thing as well, something that they wore on them as.

03:16:28,514 --> 03:16:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  not only protection but also like a samurai would wear.

03:16:32,578 --> 03:16:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  this death iconography on them or how...

03:16:35,970 --> 03:16:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  the Maori would do haka dances.

03:16:39,586 --> 03:16:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  you know, to some of these guys and their kind of warrior culture that they were growing up with or trying to view on us the young guys.

03:16:47,522 --> 03:16:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  They would take us there and they would envieu us with iconography of Santa Marta to be like a psychological thing.

03:16:53,634 --> 03:16:56,638
SPEAKER_1:  So that gives you strength and meaning in the face of struggle.

03:16:57,218 --> 03:16:59,614
SPEAKER_1:  Like in the face of difficulties in life?

03:16:59,906 --> 03:17:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  I think closeness to death and having a relationship to death in the form of a symbolic representation of it like something where there were an icon like that.

03:17:09,762 --> 03:17:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  makes it not as scary, I guess. Or not only that, but it's also something that the other side.

03:17:16,546 --> 03:17:17,246
SPEAKER_0:  the enemy.

03:17:17,762 --> 03:17:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  the cartels groups, they would venerate it as well.

03:17:21,090 --> 03:17:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  So when they would see it on you, it was almost debilitating.

03:17:24,162 --> 03:17:28,798
SPEAKER_0:  them. They were like, oh, are you guys cops? Are you guys? Why are you wearing that?

03:17:29,794 --> 03:17:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  So there was an aspect of that to it.

03:17:32,098 --> 03:17:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

03:17:33,218 --> 03:17:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  I'm a mental moody.

03:17:34,562 --> 03:17:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  Morty type thing where you remember death, you know type thing

03:17:38,402 --> 03:17:42,046
SPEAKER_1:  There's some aspect in which you don't want to mess with a person who meditates on death.

03:17:42,690 --> 03:17:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  There was some of that, yeah.

03:17:45,570 --> 03:17:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  There was a saying, I think they probably took it from a movie or something like that, but I don't know where they got it.

03:17:51,202 --> 03:17:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

03:17:51,938 --> 03:17:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  May I earn your need and be your wrath.

03:17:57,986 --> 03:17:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  That's a good line. I would say that.

03:17:59,938 --> 03:18:00,638
SPEAKER_0:  the statue.

03:18:00,930 --> 03:18:01,758
SPEAKER_0:  of the Santa.

03:18:04,866 --> 03:18:11,486
SPEAKER_0:  Another thing people, it's not a cartel specific saint though. It's like everybody, like at all levels, from the lady that sells tortillas.

03:18:12,258 --> 03:18:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  to the arm.

03:18:14,082 --> 03:18:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  to the cops, to the military. There's some people in the military that have been raided. There's a very specific symbol of how this is like a weird.

03:18:21,954 --> 03:18:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  relationship specifically in Santa Marta and Mexico.

03:18:25,602 --> 03:18:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  There's a shrine.

03:18:27,074 --> 03:18:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  outside of Tijuana.

03:18:28,450 --> 03:18:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  right across the.

03:18:30,690 --> 03:18:33,630
SPEAKER_0:  La Presa, it's like a water reservoir right outside Tijuana.

03:18:34,498 --> 03:18:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  and there was a big Santa Muerte altar there.

03:18:38,050 --> 03:18:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  like on the roadside.

03:18:40,194 --> 03:18:43,582
SPEAKER_0:  and my former boss, Leiza Ola, ordered that thing destroyed.

03:18:44,450 --> 03:18:46,654
SPEAKER_0:  So he ordered a truck to destroy it.

03:18:47,202 --> 03:18:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  It was a famous thing.

03:18:49,122 --> 03:18:50,494
SPEAKER_0:  and it was rebuilt the next night.

03:18:51,074 --> 03:18:56,542
SPEAKER_0:  And I know for a fact that some of the people that rebuilt that were some of the same guys that were destroying it.

03:18:57,538 --> 03:19:03,326
SPEAKER_1:  Oh man, that's pretty symbolic. So it's just, it's not something that can be killed. It's a part of the-

03:19:03,906 --> 03:19:05,054
SPEAKER_1:  The Spirit of the People.

03:19:05,314 --> 03:19:06,974
SPEAKER_0:  It keeps getting destroyed by...

03:19:07,234 --> 03:19:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  ultra-Christian groups or Catholic groups and it keeps getting rebuilt.

03:19:12,450 --> 03:19:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  personally for me as a

03:19:15,586 --> 03:19:15,934
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

03:19:16,386 --> 03:19:17,694
SPEAKER_0:  I don't believe that there's a...

03:19:18,402 --> 03:19:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  a Reaper skeleton in the sky protecting me.

03:19:22,242 --> 03:19:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  But I do believe in the...

03:19:24,546 --> 03:19:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  aspect of an ending.

03:19:25,954 --> 03:19:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  you know, and how it's important to, you know, the ending is important in all things and death should be present in life and if it's not then you're delusional about

03:19:33,858 --> 03:19:34,270
SPEAKER_0:  Thanks.

03:19:35,170 --> 03:19:37,470
SPEAKER_1:  So do you have some mechanism to meditate on death?

03:19:39,234 --> 03:19:42,494
SPEAKER_0:  and having my daughter who's eight.

03:19:43,362 --> 03:19:43,838
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

03:19:44,098 --> 03:19:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  Beware as a...

03:19:45,826 --> 03:19:46,750
SPEAKER_0:  benevolent.

03:19:47,042 --> 03:19:47,390
SPEAKER_0:  playing.

03:19:48,034 --> 03:19:48,414
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

03:19:48,770 --> 03:19:52,894
SPEAKER_0:  She's a kid and she sees a skeleton that represents death and she just does.

03:19:55,074 --> 03:19:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  I think...

03:19:56,514 --> 03:19:58,878
SPEAKER_0:  in a way Mexicans have.

03:19:59,490 --> 03:20:01,086
SPEAKER_0:  take in some of those aspects.

03:20:01,314 --> 03:20:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  be it Day of the Dead.

03:20:03,074 --> 03:20:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  some of these practices related to some occultism aspects around.

03:20:07,650 --> 03:20:10,654
SPEAKER_0:  You know, St. Judas, you know, St. Kudas.

03:20:11,394 --> 03:20:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  St. Judas is the...

03:20:12,962 --> 03:20:14,590
SPEAKER_0:  the patron state of lost causes.

03:20:15,458 --> 03:20:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  And it's one of the most venerated saints in Mexico.

03:20:18,370 --> 03:20:22,302
SPEAKER_0:  Jesus probably the fourth or fifth you pray to which is pretty

03:20:22,722 --> 03:20:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  funny and ridiculous but...

03:20:24,642 --> 03:20:25,534
SPEAKER_0:  The reason why

03:20:26,210 --> 03:20:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  And this is something I heard from somebody that was actually...

03:20:29,506 --> 03:20:30,334
SPEAKER_0:  We found them.

03:20:30,914 --> 03:20:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  with a gun and on his gun he had a

03:20:33,826 --> 03:20:35,390
SPEAKER_0:  St. Judas effigy.

03:20:36,674 --> 03:20:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  And he said, oh, like, why San Judas? What is this that is sogening why

03:20:41,538 --> 03:20:43,838
SPEAKER_0:  And he's like, well, he's the last saint you pray to.

03:20:45,058 --> 03:20:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  What do you mean?

03:20:46,754 --> 03:20:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  Well, on the list of saints you pray to, he's the last one because when you pray to Judas, you might get the other Judas on the line.

03:20:53,218 --> 03:20:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  That's the last one you pray to. That's why he's like the lost cause of saints.

03:20:57,058 --> 03:20:58,110
SPEAKER_0:  I remember like

03:20:59,298 --> 03:21:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  even how we...

03:21:00,962 --> 03:21:06,527
SPEAKER_0:  try and bribe or maneuver our way, even in spirituality, in spiritual practices.

03:21:06,527 --> 03:21:07,166
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

03:21:07,586 --> 03:21:09,822
SPEAKER_1:  You know, such a fascinating culture.

03:21:10,210 --> 03:21:11,614
SPEAKER_1:  That's unlike anything else.

03:21:12,290 --> 03:21:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  And it's right next door.

03:21:14,978 --> 03:21:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  And it's here too, again.

03:21:16,514 --> 03:21:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  I found an alter in...

03:21:19,010 --> 03:21:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  Connecticut.

03:21:19,810 --> 03:21:22,078
SPEAKER_0:  which is pretty fascinating. There's one in Arizona.

03:21:22,946 --> 03:21:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  against one of the

03:21:24,386 --> 03:21:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  fastest-growing spiritual practices.

03:21:26,402 --> 03:21:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  and not only in the US, but like...

03:21:29,058 --> 03:21:29,854
SPEAKER_0:  across those.

03:21:30,914 --> 03:21:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  Somebody from Russia reached out. There's an altar out there and there's a group of people praying to Santa Marta. I've been posting and writing a lot about it recently just from my own experience and some of the stuff that I gathered for myself.

03:21:43,778 --> 03:21:44,478
SPEAKER_0:  All the way out there.

03:21:45,218 --> 03:21:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  Those people are fascinated by some of those aspects.

03:21:47,682 --> 03:21:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  So I gotta ask you about the dark turn of the-

03:21:49,922 --> 03:21:51,230
SPEAKER_1:  of that spirituality.

03:21:51,586 --> 03:21:54,558
SPEAKER_1:  Or maybe you will place this elsewhere, but who was Adolfo?

03:21:54,946 --> 03:21:55,646
SPEAKER_1:  Kastanza.

03:21:56,290 --> 03:21:56,958
SPEAKER_1:  Alpadrino.

03:21:57,314 --> 03:21:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  This is a guy that comes...

03:21:59,298 --> 03:22:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  up in a period I think he's...

03:22:02,370 --> 03:22:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  He's at that initial period of cartels. This is before my time and I've-

03:22:07,138 --> 03:22:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  I've talked to some of the people that were there for some of that. I mean, he killed a lot of people.

03:22:11,938 --> 03:22:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  He was exposed.

03:22:13,442 --> 03:22:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  and learned through his family ties about some of the Afro-Caribbean spiritualities that are now also exploding as far as influences across the world.

03:22:25,250 --> 03:22:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  and in the US.

03:22:26,242 --> 03:22:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  I'm going to talk about that. I mean, Santeria.

03:22:28,962 --> 03:22:30,462
SPEAKER_0:  Palo Mayombe.

03:22:30,786 --> 03:22:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  basically some old

03:22:32,802 --> 03:22:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  spiritual practices coming out of Africa.

03:22:35,586 --> 03:22:36,414
SPEAKER_0:  that uh...

03:22:37,378 --> 03:22:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  utilize things like Ngangas, which are basically spiritual vessels that have to be loaded with

03:22:44,610 --> 03:22:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  Human remains, in some cases.

03:22:49,186 --> 03:22:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  he was basically a spiritual practitioner that certain cartel groups would hire for them to

03:22:56,258 --> 03:22:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  Curse the other side.

03:22:58,114 --> 03:23:04,574
SPEAKER_0:  to enviw them with invisibility to be able to transport their drugs or protection spells and stuff like that.

03:23:04,930 --> 03:23:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  He was very successful at it apparently, or at least that is the experience of the people paying for some of these practices.

03:23:12,386 --> 03:23:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  as his spells and his work.

03:23:16,354 --> 03:23:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  getting bigger and bigger and more and more and complicated, the...

03:23:20,514 --> 03:23:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  ingredients he needed for these Ngangas or these spells, these cauldrons that he would fill with.

03:23:26,722 --> 03:23:29,438
SPEAKER_0:  certain elements grew in comp.

03:23:29,730 --> 03:23:30,206
SPEAKER_0:  complexity.

03:23:31,298 --> 03:23:35,390
SPEAKER_0:  until finally he said he needed the brain of a highly educated American of some sort.

03:23:36,322 --> 03:23:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  which led to his eventual downfall.

03:23:38,690 --> 03:23:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  He was basically...

03:23:40,226 --> 03:23:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  responsible for abducting and murdering a young American who was a university college student I think.

03:23:47,778 --> 03:23:48,958
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think he believed?

03:23:49,730 --> 03:23:50,462
SPEAKER_1:  Duh.

03:23:50,946 --> 03:23:54,366
SPEAKER_1:  So this guy's murdering people to create what? Magical potions?

03:23:55,010 --> 03:23:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  the vessels get vessels

03:23:57,986 --> 03:23:59,710
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I think he...

03:24:00,002 --> 03:24:04,127
SPEAKER_0:  truly believe that he was capable of doing what he was doing, I guess.

03:24:04,127 --> 03:24:05,246
SPEAKER_1:  there's a culture

03:24:05,858 --> 03:24:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  that spiritually inclined that.

03:24:07,970 --> 03:24:08,414
SPEAKER_1:  Hannah.

03:24:09,538 --> 03:24:10,910
SPEAKER_1:  was on the same wavelength.

03:24:11,266 --> 03:24:11,710
SPEAKER_1:  as him.

03:24:11,970 --> 03:24:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it jived.

03:24:13,570 --> 03:24:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, some of these spiritual practices, again, there's.

03:24:16,386 --> 03:24:20,511
SPEAKER_0:  There's a ritualistic cannibalism done by some of these cartel groups out there. Was he involved?

03:24:20,511 --> 03:24:22,011
SPEAKER_1:  in cat- in catablysm.

03:24:22,011 --> 03:24:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  He wasn't involved in cannibalism that I know of, but most of the things that he was kind of known for was basically

03:24:28,066 --> 03:24:31,166
SPEAKER_0:  requesting human body parts for some of the spell works he was doing.

03:24:31,810 --> 03:24:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  And then.

03:24:33,122 --> 03:24:40,030
SPEAKER_0:  going to such a level where he needed a specific brain or head of somebody that was educated and American.

03:24:40,354 --> 03:24:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  So that.

03:24:41,474 --> 03:24:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  again, led to his eventual downfall. His ranch was raided, they found.

03:24:46,050 --> 03:24:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  the body parts inside of these cauldrons that he was preparing.

03:24:49,154 --> 03:24:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  That's an interesting example of somebody. There's a.

03:24:51,810 --> 03:24:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  cartel head somewhere in central Mexico as well.

03:24:55,394 --> 03:24:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  El Mas Loco was his nickname.

03:24:57,890 --> 03:25:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  And he basically forced the citizenship around him to turn him into a saint.

03:25:03,906 --> 03:25:07,646
SPEAKER_0:  So he made a statue of himself. He was very big into, uh,

03:25:08,066 --> 03:25:11,422
SPEAKER_0:  Christianity, specifically kind of like the Crusader.

03:25:12,514 --> 03:25:14,142
SPEAKER_0:  you know, mentality and all of that.

03:25:14,658 --> 03:25:18,302
SPEAKER_0:  kind of envied himself and some of the people that were around him with that.

03:25:19,298 --> 03:25:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  and there's still alters to his death, to him after he died. He died two times. One time the government declared him that he was killing a shootout and turns out he wasn't dead.

03:25:29,410 --> 03:25:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  So that was his first miracle, you know.

03:25:32,578 --> 03:25:44,062
SPEAKER_0:  And then when he was really dead, some of his people and his loyal followers were gunpoint kind of still forced to go and get flowers and venerate these effigies and statues of him as a saint.

03:25:45,122 --> 03:25:48,254
SPEAKER_0:  It's a powerful weapon, spirituality in Mexico is a powerful weapon and

03:25:49,122 --> 03:25:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the church, Catholic Church in Mexico, was a pretty bad track record.

03:25:52,802 --> 03:25:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  but as far as that being used to control populace and stuff like that.

03:25:59,394 --> 03:25:59,870
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:26:00,098 --> 03:26:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  And I think...

03:26:01,698 --> 03:26:09,918
SPEAKER_0:  It's just another aspect that is being exploited in Mexico in some communities as far as the spirituality and the desperate need for people to believe in something.

03:26:11,010 --> 03:26:15,230
SPEAKER_0:  and how that leads for some people to go into some horrible predatory behavior around it.

03:26:15,906 --> 03:26:17,150
SPEAKER_1:  It was a fascinating...

03:26:17,666 --> 03:26:18,942
SPEAKER_1:  Dynamica play here.

03:26:19,266 --> 03:26:22,910
SPEAKER_1:  So it's not just the United States and Mexico, it's also China that you talk about.

03:26:23,874 --> 03:26:26,078
SPEAKER_1:  China is the primary source of fentanyl in the world.

03:26:26,754 --> 03:26:28,926
SPEAKER_1:  So fentanyl is an opioid.

03:26:29,410 --> 03:26:31,230
SPEAKER_1:  that leads to 70,000.

03:26:31,778 --> 03:26:32,830
SPEAKER_1:  plus or minus.

03:26:33,218 --> 03:26:35,262
SPEAKER_1:  overdose deaths in the US every year.

03:26:36,226 --> 03:26:37,694
SPEAKER_1:  So reading from Wikipedia.

03:26:38,178 --> 03:26:42,846
SPEAKER_1:  quote, compared with heroin, it is more potent, has higher profit margins.

03:26:43,650 --> 03:26:51,486
SPEAKER_1:  And because it is compact, has simpler logistics. It can be cut into or even replaced entirely Supply of heroin and other opiates.

03:26:51,810 --> 03:26:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think is important to understand about fentanyl as a drug?

03:26:54,978 --> 03:26:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  there was a prescription.

03:26:56,642 --> 03:26:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  op je epidemic in the United States.

03:26:59,458 --> 03:27:00,254
SPEAKER_0:  that kind of

03:27:01,058 --> 03:27:07,422
SPEAKER_0:  went down or stopped, well, still out there, but the epidemic-specific around it kind of

03:27:08,674 --> 03:27:09,214
SPEAKER_0:  computer it out.

03:27:09,794 --> 03:27:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  and there was also marijuana legalization.

03:27:13,250 --> 03:27:15,518
SPEAKER_0:  happening at kind of the same time period.

03:27:16,322 --> 03:27:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  which people talking about marijuana legalization thought it was gonna hit the cartels in their pockets and it was gonna be like a...

03:27:23,074 --> 03:27:25,150
SPEAKER_0:  a death blow to these criminal groups.

03:27:26,338 --> 03:27:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  Well now there's a illegal

03:27:29,186 --> 03:27:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  pot grows in the United States being run by cartels in federal lands.

03:27:33,506 --> 03:27:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  There's

03:27:34,594 --> 03:27:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  the legal pot grows that are in some way, shape or form.

03:27:38,274 --> 03:27:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  Influenced and or run or owned by some criminal groups and they're kind of utilizing that

03:27:43,234 --> 03:27:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  The marijuana fields in Mexico turned into...

03:27:46,786 --> 03:27:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  Poppyfield.

03:27:47,938 --> 03:27:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  once again.

03:27:49,826 --> 03:28:01,502
SPEAKER_0:  The problem is that some of these lands were leached of all the nutrients and they're not as good as something you would find somewhere in Afghanistan. So the yield and the quality of it wasn't as strong as it could be.

03:28:02,562 --> 03:28:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  So somebody thought about the bright idea of putting fentanyl into the mix.

03:28:07,650 --> 03:28:08,286
SPEAKER_0:  and...

03:28:08,802 --> 03:28:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  not only that, but also figuring out a get-

03:28:12,578 --> 03:28:13,822
SPEAKER_0:  fentanyl into Mexico.

03:28:14,658 --> 03:28:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  Mexico has a GI and pharmaceutical industry.

03:28:17,922 --> 03:28:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  that people kind of also don't kind of know or factor into this equation.

03:28:21,794 --> 03:28:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  which leads into...

03:28:25,442 --> 03:28:27,038
SPEAKER_0:  the free ability of...

03:28:27,650 --> 03:28:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  chemicals going in and out of the country and legal means of it happening.

03:28:32,546 --> 03:28:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  So not only the precursors to make it, but also the chemists and the industry to create it in Mexico as well.

03:28:40,194 --> 03:28:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  Some clandestine.

03:28:41,570 --> 03:28:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  factories of fentanyl have been found in Mexico.

03:28:44,930 --> 03:28:51,518
SPEAKER_0:  But realistically, it's not needed with the ways that the ports and the borders are down in Mexico.

03:28:52,418 --> 03:28:53,598
SPEAKER_0:  stay engaged and stay dried.

03:28:54,050 --> 03:29:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  started seeing an influx and a flood of fentanyl into Mexico specifically related to infusing it into a harrow.

03:29:01,282 --> 03:29:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  and not only using that to feed local drug markets, but send it up into the United States.

03:29:06,434 --> 03:29:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  which started off this process that we're kind of going through still.

03:29:09,954 --> 03:29:11,710
SPEAKER_1:  Are these like similar highs?

03:29:12,258 --> 03:29:14,238
SPEAKER_1:  And drug-wise, why do you infuse?

03:29:15,202 --> 03:29:18,577
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, probably you're not the right person to have this biochemical discussion.

03:29:18,577 --> 03:29:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know about the biochemical aspect of it, but like speaking to

03:29:22,754 --> 03:29:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  You guys that do Chiva down there, that's what we call heroin down there. That's like a nickname for it.

03:29:28,898 --> 03:29:30,654
SPEAKER_0:  having them describe.

03:29:30,882 --> 03:29:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  Some of the older stinkier darker heroin they used to get

03:29:34,722 --> 03:29:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  before this whole Fentanyl thing.

03:29:36,642 --> 03:29:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  and the highs I would get and how much they would have to take versus some of the stuff loaded with fentanyl.

03:29:42,018 --> 03:29:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  They have to.

03:29:43,490 --> 03:29:46,398
SPEAKER_1:  Also, there is more at higher potency. You

03:29:46,498 --> 03:29:49,022
SPEAKER_0:  There's a higher potency to it and also there's a, you know.

03:29:49,666 --> 03:29:51,966
SPEAKER_1:  more money to be made, easier to transport.

03:29:52,258 --> 03:29:52,574
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

03:29:52,802 --> 03:29:53,342
SPEAKER_1:  But then...

03:29:54,594 --> 03:29:56,510
SPEAKER_1:  Is this how China starts becoming?

03:29:56,898 --> 03:29:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  part of the picture.

03:29:58,114 --> 03:30:01,502
SPEAKER_0:  One aspect to it that people kind of miss is that, you know, there's no

03:30:01,954 --> 03:30:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  Chinese cartel.

03:30:03,234 --> 03:30:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  You know, there's no criminal.

03:30:05,474 --> 03:30:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  Chinese organization working unseen.

03:30:08,834 --> 03:30:11,710
SPEAKER_0:  getting around government oversight in China.

03:30:13,250 --> 03:30:15,125
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know of any such.

03:30:15,125 --> 03:30:20,375
SPEAKER_1:  Anything that could be labeled as a criminal organization is deeply integrated with the government.

03:30:20,375 --> 03:30:27,495
SPEAKER_0:  I've never heard of a giant criminal enterprise in China operating. We have to assume that...

03:30:27,495 --> 03:30:28,245
SPEAKER_1:  Independent added skips

03:30:28,245 --> 03:30:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  of the state.

03:30:29,570 --> 03:30:36,030
SPEAKER_0:  I would have to assume that some of these things are happening with the know-how and inaction of the government out there.

03:30:36,866 --> 03:30:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:30:37,922 --> 03:30:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  when COVID hit.

03:30:40,034 --> 03:30:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  there was a shortage of fentanyl.

03:30:42,722 --> 03:30:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  on the northern side of Mexico.

03:30:44,706 --> 03:30:48,030
SPEAKER_0:  specifically related to the Xenolawa cartel. These guys were actually-

03:30:48,450 --> 03:30:52,478
SPEAKER_0:  trafficking fentanyl from the US down to Mexico to infuse their product.

03:30:53,602 --> 03:30:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  but not the new generation cartel which operates out of the central part of Mexico.

03:30:58,658 --> 03:31:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  Kolyma area which have access to the seaside ports.

03:31:03,042 --> 03:31:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  So even during the shutdown, they were getting supplied.

03:31:06,306 --> 03:31:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  which means to me, at least, or for anybody observing it, that the supply chain was not cut.

03:31:12,546 --> 03:31:14,686
SPEAKER_0:  and whatever was coming out of China was...

03:31:16,098 --> 03:31:16,574
SPEAKER_0:  being let.

03:31:16,866 --> 03:31:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  out of China.

03:31:17,922 --> 03:31:22,014
SPEAKER_0:  by whatever official channels would be able to shut down or stop it.

03:31:22,210 --> 03:31:26,206
SPEAKER_1:  God, I would love to know the organizational structure, the governmental structure.

03:31:26,690 --> 03:31:27,390
SPEAKER_1:  of China.

03:31:29,442 --> 03:31:30,814
SPEAKER_1:  how they enable it.

03:31:32,098 --> 03:31:33,662
SPEAKER_1:  because I can't imagine.

03:31:34,594 --> 03:31:35,838
SPEAKER_1:  at the very top.

03:31:36,418 --> 03:31:39,793
SPEAKER_1:  there's like a portfolio of things we're doing one of them is

03:31:39,793 --> 03:31:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's more in action or just the know how that is happening, but just like hands off. Just let this

03:31:47,266 --> 03:31:48,222
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know.

03:31:48,386 --> 03:31:49,726
SPEAKER_1:  If I were to understand.

03:31:49,986 --> 03:31:52,126
SPEAKER_1:  how large bureaucracies work.

03:31:52,450 --> 03:31:53,630
SPEAKER_1:  It's looking the other way.

03:31:54,530 --> 03:31:55,166
SPEAKER_1:  You.

03:31:55,426 --> 03:31:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  are now seeing.

03:31:57,058 --> 03:32:03,870
SPEAKER_0:  pill presses brought to Mexico, industrial-level pill presses found in clandestine laboratories.

03:32:04,642 --> 03:32:05,918
SPEAKER_0:  where they're not only...

03:32:06,434 --> 03:32:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  Infusing.

03:32:07,458 --> 03:32:11,070
SPEAKER_0:  the yields that they're doing with fentanyl, but also making.

03:32:11,330 --> 03:32:12,574
SPEAKER_0:  fake pain medication.

03:32:13,058 --> 03:32:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  that is flooding.

03:32:14,114 --> 03:32:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  US markets everywhere, less far as.

03:32:17,122 --> 03:32:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  Is that pain medication or is that

03:32:19,906 --> 03:32:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  who knows? That's how you see a lot of people dying from ODs that are...

03:32:24,930 --> 03:32:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  supposedly taking pain pills and that's not what they're doing.

03:32:28,258 --> 03:32:30,334
SPEAKER_0:  So the evolution right now you're seeing is.

03:32:31,042 --> 03:32:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  making something.

03:32:33,186 --> 03:32:37,374
SPEAKER_0:  look legit as far as pain medication that it isn't. And yeah, I mean.

03:32:37,666 --> 03:32:38,270
SPEAKER_0:  Fentanyl is-

03:32:39,394 --> 03:32:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  everywhere they're infusing cocaine with it.

03:32:43,106 --> 03:32:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  been getting stories from the US of people buying it through Alibaba or just weird online sources and it coming in different packages and it just...

03:32:50,658 --> 03:32:52,990
SPEAKER_0:  infusing it into whatever is out there.

03:32:53,922 --> 03:32:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  It is killing off a whole generation of people.

03:32:57,858 --> 03:32:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  Um,

03:32:58,658 --> 03:33:00,030
SPEAKER_0:  and it comes from one place.

03:33:00,514 --> 03:33:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  or it's manufactured somewhere where it's being.

03:33:03,298 --> 03:33:07,838
SPEAKER_0:  manufactured with the precursors and the elements and know-how that comes from one place.

03:33:09,250 --> 03:33:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  Who ever done it in my China?

03:33:10,882 --> 03:33:11,454
SPEAKER_0:  about China.

03:33:11,618 --> 03:33:17,534
SPEAKER_1:  because Mexico seems to have what's the role of this is such a complicated and how do you start to talk about the drug war

03:33:17,826 --> 03:33:19,262
SPEAKER_1:  and more and more and more.

03:33:20,802 --> 03:33:21,534
SPEAKER_1:  China

03:33:22,306 --> 03:33:24,190
SPEAKER_1:  is the source of the drug.

03:33:26,210 --> 03:33:28,414
SPEAKER_1:  Is there a drug war going on with China?

03:33:28,706 --> 03:33:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  there's probably an economic war. While you talk about this and other sides of China.

03:33:33,666 --> 03:33:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  Most, and this is something that's come out recently, a few years back, I think, but basically.

03:33:39,298 --> 03:33:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  The ways you would move money back into Mexico after you have a load up here is that you would give it to a Chinese money broker.

03:33:46,338 --> 03:33:50,750
SPEAKER_0:  they would put into Chinese banking system and it immediately would just disappear from American eyes.

03:33:51,650 --> 03:33:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  and then another money broker in Mexico would receive it through a money transfer from China.

03:33:55,746 --> 03:33:58,174
SPEAKER_1:  So China's incredibly good at money laundering.

03:33:59,490 --> 03:34:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  That's another aspect to their, I mean, their banking system is invisible to the U.S.

03:34:03,554 --> 03:34:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  basically, which allows the monies to move from one point to another.

03:34:08,098 --> 03:34:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  So money brokers and people moving money for the groups down there are Chinese. So that's another aspect or element of China.

03:34:14,882 --> 03:34:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  as far as its presence.

03:34:18,242 --> 03:34:20,382
SPEAKER_1:  What's the role of intelligence in all of this?

03:34:20,930 --> 03:34:23,358
SPEAKER_1:  FBI, CIA, the Chinese.

03:34:23,810 --> 03:34:24,798
SPEAKER_1:  intelligence.

03:34:26,114 --> 03:34:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  agencies.

03:34:27,394 --> 03:34:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  Right now Mexico is going through a...

03:34:30,786 --> 03:34:34,558
SPEAKER_0:  a nationalistic resurgence and left this presidency.

03:34:35,586 --> 03:34:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  which is not friendly to US interest in a lot of ways.

03:34:39,810 --> 03:34:48,190
SPEAKER_0:  The US has had a pretty bad track record with its foreign policy in Mexico, with a lot of damage being done by the last president as far as his rhetoric.

03:34:48,450 --> 03:34:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

03:34:49,122 --> 03:34:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  Donald Trump.

03:34:50,210 --> 03:34:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  which has been weaponized and utilized by the by.

03:34:53,378 --> 03:34:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  left down in Mexico.

03:34:55,778 --> 03:34:58,750
SPEAKER_1:  So America is not seen positively.

03:34:59,010 --> 03:34:59,326
SPEAKER_0:  No.

03:34:59,586 --> 03:35:04,894
SPEAKER_0:  Every now and then I post something about Mexico, some horrible thing happening down there. I was like, why doesn't USN people down there like-

03:35:05,186 --> 03:35:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  aren't Mexicans looking for like US intervention? I don't know.

03:35:08,706 --> 03:35:13,854
SPEAKER_0:  That is beyond what anybody in Mexico would want. Specifically, you see that sentiment out there.

03:35:14,434 --> 03:35:20,254
SPEAKER_0:  They don't view the US as somebody that's going to come in and fix anything or somebody that's going to help or as a friend.

03:35:20,962 --> 03:35:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  with it when the Ukrainian conflict happened.

03:35:24,642 --> 03:35:27,038
SPEAKER_0:  Mexico basically is

03:35:27,490 --> 03:35:29,182
SPEAKER_0:  abstained from saying anything.

03:35:30,114 --> 03:35:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  which is a wink and a nod to Russia.

03:35:32,322 --> 03:35:40,190
SPEAKER_0:  It has openly been pro-Maduro and openly celebrated some of these regimes popping up.

03:35:40,514 --> 03:35:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  across Latin America.

03:35:42,882 --> 03:35:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  you know.

03:35:43,682 --> 03:35:44,254
SPEAKER_0:  which is.

03:35:44,994 --> 03:35:51,070
SPEAKER_0:  That is what people voted for. That is sentiment down there. They're going towards the left of the political spectrum because they've been...

03:35:51,554 --> 03:35:56,958
SPEAKER_0:  basically violated over and over again by all these different presidencies that have promise changed.

03:35:57,634 --> 03:36:02,494
SPEAKER_0:  brought corruption with them and they are our choices. So this is the best we have right now.

03:36:03,298 --> 03:36:03,710
SPEAKER_0:  Ah.

03:36:04,194 --> 03:36:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  And all of the enemies of the United States are taking full advantage of that. We recently had a general kind of...

03:36:10,786 --> 03:36:14,046
SPEAKER_0:  address the Senate committee hearing, I think. He was talking about the...

03:36:14,530 --> 03:36:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  prevalence of foreign intelligence services in Mexico.

03:36:18,562 --> 03:36:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  and why that is.

03:36:20,386 --> 03:36:22,654
SPEAKER_0:  Well, you know, it has Mexico as.

03:36:22,914 --> 03:36:25,950
SPEAKER_0:  a lot of the minable lithium on the planet underneath the.

03:36:26,242 --> 03:36:28,030
SPEAKER_0:  parts of it, specifically in the north.

03:36:29,058 --> 03:36:36,958
SPEAKER_0:  It is going through a process. They call it the Cuarta Transformacion. The fourth transformation is what the president of Mexico calls it.

03:36:38,210 --> 03:36:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  which is a

03:36:39,650 --> 03:36:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  In a way, it's basically we're here to stay type thing.

03:36:42,978 --> 03:36:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  You know, they just nationalized mining lithium.

03:36:46,562 --> 03:36:52,254
SPEAKER_0:  and taking control of that and using that as leverage. If the United States ever wants to go to Mexico, that's probably not going to be related to.

03:36:52,738 --> 03:36:56,350
SPEAKER_0:  cartel issues is going to probably relate to energy, I think.

03:36:57,122 --> 03:36:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  Thinking ahead, I guess.

03:36:58,594 --> 03:36:59,742
SPEAKER_1:  Or what about also?

03:37:00,130 --> 03:37:01,406
SPEAKER_1:  Just imagine a world.

03:37:02,626 --> 03:37:04,670
SPEAKER_1:  what India and China are doing.

03:37:05,058 --> 03:37:05,822
SPEAKER_1:  Phantom

03:37:06,530 --> 03:37:09,374
SPEAKER_1:  trade with Mexico or whatever transport.

03:37:10,274 --> 03:37:12,350
SPEAKER_1:  Imagine Chinese military.

03:37:12,802 --> 03:37:13,406
SPEAKER_1:  moves.

03:37:13,794 --> 03:37:17,214
SPEAKER_1:  makes an agreement, a NATO type of agreement with Mexico.

03:37:17,666 --> 03:37:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  That's pretty possible.

03:37:18,850 --> 03:37:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  Again, we're seeing militarized Mexico. That's another aspect of Mexico.

03:37:22,914 --> 03:37:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  Mexico that again I haven't seen talked about a lot here in the US.

03:37:26,914 --> 03:37:32,510
SPEAKER_0:  The main problem is that the current president had was he was going to make the federal police and the

03:37:32,738 --> 03:37:35,582
SPEAKER_0:  the security issues in Mexico.

03:37:36,162 --> 03:37:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  Civilian. He was gonna-

03:37:38,050 --> 03:37:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  do exactly the opposite as his main rival, Felipe Calderon, the guy that started off the drug war efficiently.

03:37:45,698 --> 03:37:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  And what does he do?

03:37:47,138 --> 03:37:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  He dissolves the civilian leadership of the federal police. Dissolves the federal police.

03:37:52,290 --> 03:37:55,134
SPEAKER_0:  creates the National Guard, which is a military unit.

03:37:55,746 --> 03:37:57,278
SPEAKER_0:  and he puts the military in charge of that.

03:37:58,402 --> 03:38:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  Now the military has a full monopoly over all.

03:38:01,602 --> 03:38:02,590
SPEAKER_0:  federal policing.

03:38:03,234 --> 03:38:07,902
SPEAKER_0:  When you cross into Mexico, you'll see them wearing these white camouflage uniforms. See the link above for the details on our channel.

03:38:08,834 --> 03:38:10,238
SPEAKER_0:  Those are National Guard.

03:38:10,466 --> 03:38:10,878
SPEAKER_0:  people.

03:38:11,202 --> 03:38:11,646
SPEAKER_0:  but they're.

03:38:12,706 --> 03:38:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  the military. So you're now seeing a militarized Mexico.

03:38:16,226 --> 03:38:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  with some of these leaks that happened during the Wacamaya leaks.

03:38:20,962 --> 03:38:27,678
SPEAKER_0:  You're now seeing that Mexico has been hosting members of the Haitian military, and they've been training them up.

03:38:27,938 --> 03:38:28,286
SPEAKER_0:  Doom.

03:38:28,514 --> 03:38:28,990
SPEAKER_0:  Go back.

03:38:29,794 --> 03:38:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  to police their country.

03:38:32,450 --> 03:38:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  That's not something that Mexico has been known for, hosting other nations and training them in such a way.

03:38:38,562 --> 03:38:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  It's an interesting maneuver. Mexico has been historically neutral about getting involved in foreign conflicts.

03:38:45,666 --> 03:38:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  about voting and resolutions as far as invading or not invading or doing all these things.

03:38:51,138 --> 03:38:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  Mexico has been historically kind of neutral when it comes to some of these things and now we're

03:38:55,490 --> 03:38:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  training foreign military forces to go and do that role somewhere else.

03:39:00,130 --> 03:39:06,974
SPEAKER_0:  We have the military building airports and building infrastructure in Mexico and a lot of their higher ups getting very

03:39:07,202 --> 03:39:09,022
SPEAKER_0:  you know, wealthy around it, you know?

03:39:09,826 --> 03:39:12,478
SPEAKER_0:  and they basically have a monopoly over.

03:39:13,730 --> 03:39:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  you know, who gets to have guns down there? You know, there's one gun store in all Mexico and it's run by the military.

03:39:19,362 --> 03:39:22,974
SPEAKER_0:  and the only way you can buy a gun there is if you can buy a plane ticket to fly there.

03:39:23,682 --> 03:39:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  and have enough money to sustain that right or that privilege.

03:39:27,874 --> 03:39:30,974
SPEAKER_0:  So you're seeing the military not being.

03:39:31,234 --> 03:39:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  in its traditional role of just being the security force. Now it's policing.

03:39:35,906 --> 03:39:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  it's involved in.

03:39:37,634 --> 03:39:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  It's getting involved in politics in a big way. It's legislation that has passed to keep it on the streets and the policing role for more years now.

03:39:48,354 --> 03:39:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  that should be looked at closer by anybody observing it from afar, the militarization of Mexico and where it's going.

03:39:54,882 --> 03:39:55,678
SPEAKER_1:  because of you.

03:39:56,098 --> 03:40:00,958
SPEAKER_1:  move towards a world where a world war three happens it feels like mexico

03:40:01,250 --> 03:40:02,366
SPEAKER_1:  will be the center.

03:40:03,202 --> 03:40:04,030
SPEAKER_1:  Because...

03:40:04,546 --> 03:40:06,526
SPEAKER_1:  A hot war would be fought on the ground.

03:40:07,490 --> 03:40:08,894
SPEAKER_1:  And so you have a very...

03:40:09,634 --> 03:40:11,806
SPEAKER_1:  Difficult parallel between Mexico and Ukraine.

03:40:12,354 --> 03:40:13,822
SPEAKER_1:  Both don't have nuclear weapons.

03:40:14,210 --> 03:40:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  both have relationships. So Ukraine has a relationship.

03:40:17,698 --> 03:40:20,638
SPEAKER_1:  or a pull towards the European Union and NATO.

03:40:21,346 --> 03:40:23,742
SPEAKER_1:  Mexico, at least currently, has a

03:40:24,002 --> 03:40:25,566
SPEAKER_1:  kind of slow pull towards.

03:40:25,954 --> 03:40:26,654
SPEAKER_1:  China.

03:40:27,202 --> 03:40:30,974
SPEAKER_1:  india potentially and russia you have this divide between

03:40:31,682 --> 03:40:32,990
SPEAKER_1:  power centers in the world.

03:40:33,666 --> 03:40:34,750
SPEAKER_1:  And in terms of.

03:40:35,330 --> 03:40:36,286
SPEAKER_1:  Just imagine.

03:40:37,474 --> 03:40:39,486
SPEAKER_1:  Hundreds of thousands of Mexican troops.

03:40:40,226 --> 03:40:42,942
SPEAKER_1:  hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops on the border.

03:40:43,906 --> 03:40:44,958
SPEAKER_1:  on the US border.

03:40:45,922 --> 03:40:48,382
SPEAKER_0:  on the Mexican side. And also the fact that

03:40:48,610 --> 03:40:53,630
SPEAKER_0:  that border doesn't mean anything to any sort of conflict that would happen regionally.

03:40:54,306 --> 03:40:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  because that

03:40:55,874 --> 03:40:59,614
SPEAKER_0:  It's very easy to cross border. Doesn't matter how many walls you put across it.

03:41:00,066 --> 03:41:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  people are already here.

03:41:01,346 --> 03:41:01,822
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

03:41:02,178 --> 03:41:05,406
SPEAKER_0:  This is not going to be a war fought off in some overseas place.

03:41:05,634 --> 03:41:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  Like you're not gonna...

03:41:07,042 --> 03:41:08,766
SPEAKER_0:  This is something if it happens.

03:41:09,026 --> 03:41:11,422
SPEAKER_0:  if destabilization is utilized in Mexico.

03:41:12,194 --> 03:41:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  to cause a conflict there and it turns into a Vietnam or a proxy war down there.

03:41:16,898 --> 03:41:17,438
SPEAKER_0:  of a sword.

03:41:17,986 --> 03:41:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  which I think...

03:41:19,746 --> 03:41:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  In a way, you're already kind of seeing some of that.

03:41:22,018 --> 03:41:25,214
SPEAKER_0:  through some of the conflicts going on down there. You have a

03:41:25,506 --> 03:41:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  a new generation cartel.

03:41:27,458 --> 03:41:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  that is being fed fentanyl from the Pacific side ports.

03:41:31,618 --> 03:41:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  And suspiciously, you want to think that maybe it's favored by a foreign government of some sort, in some way, shape, or form, who knows?

03:41:40,898 --> 03:41:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  And then you have a historically in control Sinaloa cartel that may or may not be favored by the US in some way, shape or form.

03:41:47,970 --> 03:41:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  You can imagine.

03:41:49,506 --> 03:41:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  a further conflict down there and people fostering it.

03:41:53,346 --> 03:41:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  and seeing the effects of.

03:41:55,010 --> 03:41:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  Basically...

03:41:56,450 --> 03:41:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  setting a fire on the feet of the United States.

03:41:59,298 --> 03:42:02,590
SPEAKER_0:  Its second largest consumer of US products is Mexico.

03:42:03,362 --> 03:42:03,902
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:42:04,354 --> 03:42:05,598
SPEAKER_0:  the massive

03:42:06,050 --> 03:42:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  wave of immigration that is going to be basically weaponized.

03:42:10,050 --> 03:42:14,942
SPEAKER_0:  You know you saw the collapse of the border security structure with the

03:42:15,490 --> 03:42:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  contingent of 3000.

03:42:17,314 --> 03:42:18,110
SPEAKER_0:  Honduran

03:42:18,754 --> 03:42:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  Guatemalan immigrants in that first wave of caravans coming to Tijuana. UPBEAT MUSIC.

03:42:24,642 --> 03:42:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  It was pretty bad.

03:42:26,242 --> 03:42:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

03:42:27,298 --> 03:42:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  It was pretty bad and it could have gotten worse.

03:42:30,306 --> 03:42:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  Now, what is going to happen when that wave is no longer 3,000, but a million people being displaced by violence or being...

03:42:40,066 --> 03:42:44,318
SPEAKER_0:  in fear of whatever conflict might originate down there. And just.

03:42:44,642 --> 03:42:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  that massive wave of migration and move.

03:42:49,666 --> 03:42:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  I think that's an interesting.

03:42:51,746 --> 03:42:55,486
SPEAKER_0:  thing that people should look at and, you know, how can you?

03:42:55,810 --> 03:42:59,102
SPEAKER_0:  effect change to try and stop some of these things to happen.

03:43:00,034 --> 03:43:03,838
SPEAKER_1:  Well, let me ask you at a philosophical, at a human level, what do you think about immigration?

03:43:04,610 --> 03:43:06,910
SPEAKER_1:  illegal and legal immigration.

03:43:07,618 --> 03:43:08,222
SPEAKER_1:  From

03:43:08,898 --> 03:43:11,358
SPEAKER_1:  the direction of Mexico to the United States.

03:43:11,746 --> 03:43:12,958
SPEAKER_1:  So we have an estimated.

03:43:13,314 --> 03:43:15,934
SPEAKER_1:  11 million illegal immigrants in the United States.

03:43:17,698 --> 03:43:18,686
SPEAKER_1:  And uh...

03:43:18,978 --> 03:43:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  estimated 45 million legal.

03:43:21,602 --> 03:43:22,727
SPEAKER_1:  immigrants in the US.

03:43:22,727 --> 03:43:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  a few things about that.

03:43:25,026 --> 03:43:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  When COVID hit, there was no shortages of produce.

03:43:28,674 --> 03:43:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  and in the supermarkets.

03:43:30,690 --> 03:43:31,422
SPEAKER_0:  Which means that...

03:43:32,738 --> 03:43:39,518
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, illegal immigration is pretty much the backbone of all produce and some of the farming industries out there, you know, most of it.

03:43:40,354 --> 03:43:41,726
SPEAKER_0:  So illegal immigration.

03:43:41,986 --> 03:43:42,910
SPEAKER_0:  and illegal.

03:43:43,458 --> 03:43:47,102
SPEAKER_0:  illegal workers in those fields are essential workers in a way.

03:43:47,938 --> 03:43:54,494
SPEAKER_0:  I think there's a weird relationship in the United States with some of these workers and how they're demonized and how they're called criminals. I think there's...

03:43:55,298 --> 03:44:01,342
SPEAKER_0:  There was a state out there that passed anti-illegal immigrant worker legislation.

03:44:01,986 --> 03:44:08,542
SPEAKER_0:  The farmers had to look elsewhere for people to show up to work in some of these fields, which basically caused...

03:44:08,962 --> 03:44:11,518
SPEAKER_0:  millions of dollars worth of losses for some of these.

03:44:11,778 --> 03:44:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  Farms.

03:44:13,026 --> 03:44:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:44:13,858 --> 03:44:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  Anywhere you go out there in the United States, you go into the kitchens and there's going to be paisanos there, you know.

03:44:18,818 --> 03:44:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  French high level French restaurants.

03:44:21,474 --> 03:44:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  You'll see people from Puebla there that...

03:44:23,714 --> 03:44:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  made their way illegally and might have legalized or regularized their way.

03:44:28,482 --> 03:44:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  into the country or.

03:44:30,146 --> 03:44:31,358
SPEAKER_0:  or in a sanctuary city.

03:44:32,066 --> 03:44:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  You go to the service industry hotels, you know, those are the people changing the blankets. Those are the people in the washrooms.

03:44:39,394 --> 03:44:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  You have them doing jobs that no American wants to do, realistically. And they're everywhere in this country. They are.

03:44:46,978 --> 03:44:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  the backbone of some of these industries that are essential in this country.

03:44:50,818 --> 03:44:53,758
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think there's a deep sense in which they are American?

03:44:54,402 --> 03:44:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  I think they're indispensable and anybody that says they aren't.

03:44:58,114 --> 03:44:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  is.

03:44:59,074 --> 03:44:59,710
SPEAKER_0:  Delusional.

03:45:00,418 --> 03:45:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  if you take every single legal worker out of the industry in the United States and send them back

03:45:05,762 --> 03:45:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  Like, there's a movie out there called like that, the Mexicanas a day without Mexicans.

03:45:10,658 --> 03:45:11,070
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

03:45:12,674 --> 03:45:13,662
SPEAKER_0:  everything would stop.

03:45:14,050 --> 03:45:19,582
SPEAKER_0:  So the relationship is there. People talk about the history of slavery in this country.

03:45:20,194 --> 03:45:21,630
SPEAKER_0:  like it's a thing that's in the past.

03:45:22,882 --> 03:45:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  There's endangered slaves in the country right now, people that are paying off their

03:45:28,802 --> 03:45:34,110
SPEAKER_0:  They're people smugglers because they brought them into this country and they haven't been able to pay that fine or that fee yet.

03:45:35,138 --> 03:45:38,494
SPEAKER_0:  and are basically being held hostage by that here in the United States.

03:45:38,786 --> 03:45:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  So they're slaves right now in the United States. People are talking about it's a historical context.

03:45:43,714 --> 03:45:46,215
SPEAKER_1:  What do we do about it? How are we supposed to think about it?

03:45:46,215 --> 03:45:56,542
SPEAKER_0:  We're going to have to rethink how we look at immigration, illegal or illegal or illegal immigration from Mexico and how we view Mexico as a foreign country.

03:45:57,602 --> 03:45:58,046
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:45:58,466 --> 03:46:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  Your relationship to Canada is one thing, your relationship to Mexico is another.

03:46:02,594 --> 03:46:03,070
SPEAKER_0:  Um,

03:46:03,618 --> 03:46:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  foreign policy towards Mexico has been.

03:46:07,170 --> 03:46:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  pretty nefarious as far as the United States in a lot of ways.

03:46:10,978 --> 03:46:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  You can go back.

03:46:12,482 --> 03:46:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  There was a student massacre during the Olympics.

03:46:15,778 --> 03:46:21,022
SPEAKER_0:  And the president in turn at that time was on the CIA payroll. And it was a counter.

03:46:21,474 --> 03:46:24,030
SPEAKER_0:  communist type maneuver that we're doing down there.

03:46:25,154 --> 03:46:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  that.

03:46:25,762 --> 03:46:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  There are some bloody hands on the US side of some of the things that have been happening in Mexico as far as destabilization and influencing.

03:46:33,730 --> 03:46:35,326
SPEAKER_0:  meddling in foreign policy out there.

03:46:36,162 --> 03:46:42,654
SPEAKER_0:  most of the guns that are used down there come from the US. And that's another interesting aspect and responsibility that people...

03:46:42,882 --> 03:46:44,254
SPEAKER_0:  shouldn't kind of think about up here.

03:46:44,674 --> 03:46:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  So there is.

03:46:45,794 --> 03:46:48,574
SPEAKER_1:  I'm the drug war side a machine that's.

03:46:48,866 --> 03:46:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  fueling the drug war.

03:46:50,338 --> 03:46:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, there's a giant drug habit up here, you know?

03:46:53,410 --> 03:46:59,390
SPEAKER_1:  but also a governmental intelligence and military support through the sale of weapons.

03:46:59,618 --> 03:47:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know about the sale of weapons, but you know.

03:47:02,242 --> 03:47:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  There's some birdie.

03:47:04,610 --> 03:47:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  We talk about poorest borders.

03:47:06,562 --> 03:47:10,494
SPEAKER_0:  coming up. There's porous borders also going down, you know.

03:47:10,882 --> 03:47:12,446
SPEAKER_0:  There's a flow of guns going down.

03:47:12,738 --> 03:47:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  and munitions.

03:47:14,498 --> 03:47:21,406
SPEAKER_0:  which again, they don't kill anybody by themselves. They get put in the hands of the desperate that are trying to feed a giant drug market.

03:47:21,698 --> 03:47:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  to the south, to the north. You know, Mexico has a saying.

03:47:25,346 --> 03:47:32,350
SPEAKER_0:  Mexico, Mexico far from God, but close to the United States.

03:47:32,674 --> 03:47:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  Right.

03:47:33,570 --> 03:47:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  Oh.

03:47:35,010 --> 03:47:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  And there's a...

03:47:36,514 --> 03:47:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  There's definitely a responsibility on both sides. This is no longer a Mexico problem, a US problem.

03:47:42,050 --> 03:47:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  This is a regional problem.

03:47:44,258 --> 03:47:48,638
SPEAKER_0:  And if we don't think of it as a regional problem with our brothers on the southern side of it.

03:47:49,250 --> 03:47:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  And with family, we're related in blood. There's like, we are, we are.

03:47:55,138 --> 03:47:56,990
SPEAKER_0:  Mexico and the United States are like this.

03:47:58,146 --> 03:48:00,542
SPEAKER_0:  but it's become popular in politics, they just throw a line.

03:48:01,538 --> 03:48:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  All right.

03:48:02,530 --> 03:48:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  And I think we need to get to a place where we can figure out how to make those connections and repair some of the damage done by just years and years of bad policy on both sides of the border.

03:48:13,314 --> 03:48:18,046
SPEAKER_1:  policy and rhetoric, the way we talk about it, the way we think about it, not just the actual policy, but 92 Bio

03:48:18,466 --> 03:48:20,926
SPEAKER_1:  seeing the humanity and the people that are here.

03:48:21,538 --> 03:48:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  It's an easy thing. They're coming to take our jobs is something you hear.

03:48:25,442 --> 03:48:27,582
SPEAKER_0:  There was a state out there that passed them.

03:48:28,258 --> 03:48:29,502
SPEAKER_0:  anti-

03:48:30,530 --> 03:48:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  anti-legislation as far as illegal workers on fields. And it led to

03:48:34,594 --> 03:48:42,238
SPEAKER_0:  massive losses, nobody wanted to show up for those jobs, basically. People would show up one day and they wouldn't come back and they were doing jobs that people just don't want to do.

03:48:43,586 --> 03:48:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  Are they taking that from the locals?

03:48:46,434 --> 03:48:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  Or are they filling an essential role?

03:48:48,386 --> 03:48:50,590
SPEAKER_0:  that we feel guilty about.

03:48:50,850 --> 03:48:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  and the rhetoric around it is more about guilt.

03:48:54,722 --> 03:48:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  than anything.

03:48:55,586 --> 03:48:55,966
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:48:56,994 --> 03:49:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  I am an immigrant myself. You know, I've gone through the experience of...

03:49:02,050 --> 03:49:03,678
SPEAKER_0:  doing it legally.

03:49:05,282 --> 03:49:10,494
SPEAKER_0:  I've seen people not do it legally and are in way better places than I am basically.

03:49:10,754 --> 03:49:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  by going around some of the system.

03:49:12,962 --> 03:49:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:49:13,666 --> 03:49:14,782
SPEAKER_0:  This is the Moonsault Deep.

03:49:15,298 --> 03:49:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  immigration system here in the US.

03:49:17,346 --> 03:49:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  there's something wrong, you know, it's kind of broken.

03:49:20,962 --> 03:49:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  Um,

03:49:22,114 --> 03:49:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  And people coming here illegally are not only...

03:49:25,794 --> 03:49:29,854
SPEAKER_0:  They're looking for a better life for themselves, a better life for people.

03:49:30,306 --> 03:49:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  this whole aspect of vilifying them and they're like, oh, this immigrant did this horrible thing, this immigrant did that horrible thing.

03:49:37,442 --> 03:49:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  and people saying, go back to your country.

03:49:41,506 --> 03:49:48,766
SPEAKER_0:  At the same time, they go to a hotel where all the service staff is from that part of the world and they're here irregularly.

03:49:49,122 --> 03:49:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  or they go to the Whole Foods and they get some produce there and it's...

03:49:54,050 --> 03:49:56,286
SPEAKER_0:  picked by some of the same people that are realifying.

03:49:56,962 --> 03:49:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  Again, we need to kind of like...

03:49:59,810 --> 03:50:02,435
SPEAKER_0:  think about that and analyze that for ourselves.

03:50:02,435 --> 03:50:08,958
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, the idea of go back to your country and finding the other and having a disdain and a hate towards the other.

03:50:09,218 --> 03:50:11,806
SPEAKER_1:  Ever since I had a recent conversation with Yay.

03:50:12,226 --> 03:50:14,846
SPEAKER_1:  formerly known as Kanye West, I got to.

03:50:15,266 --> 03:50:16,830
SPEAKER_1:  hear a few things from.

03:50:19,266 --> 03:50:22,238
SPEAKER_1:  let's say unfriendly messages from white nationalists.

03:50:23,042 --> 03:50:24,894
SPEAKER_1:  and I got to learn about this world.

03:50:25,378 --> 03:50:25,822
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

03:50:26,466 --> 03:50:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  I continue on the journey of learning.

03:50:28,482 --> 03:50:31,422
SPEAKER_1:  which is the idea that the United States, this country...

03:50:31,746 --> 03:50:35,230
SPEAKER_1:  should look a certain way, should have a certain skin color, should have a certain religion.

03:50:35,522 --> 03:50:37,630
SPEAKER_1:  and everything else is a pollution, is a poison.

03:50:38,114 --> 03:50:38,686
SPEAKER_1:  to this.

03:50:39,202 --> 03:50:40,830
SPEAKER_1:  I made it sound hateful right now.

03:50:41,282 --> 03:50:43,550
SPEAKER_1:  but they usually frame it in a positive way.

03:50:44,098 --> 03:50:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, like the purity.

03:50:45,506 --> 03:50:51,198
SPEAKER_1:  I'm sure Hitler also phrased everything in a positive way, especially in the 1930s about the purity of Germany.

03:50:51,458 --> 03:50:54,366
SPEAKER_1:  But the reality of the United States and one of the things that makes it

03:50:55,202 --> 03:50:58,398
SPEAKER_1:  At least the idea of the United States is the soup, the mix.

03:50:58,978 --> 03:51:01,470
SPEAKER_1:  unlike so many nations I've traveled to.

03:51:01,922 --> 03:51:05,310
SPEAKER_1:  The diversity, the good kind of diversity is what makes.

03:51:05,698 --> 03:51:06,622
SPEAKER_1:  country great.

03:51:07,202 --> 03:51:10,974
SPEAKER_1:  And there's so I think it needs to be based on the.

03:51:12,770 --> 03:51:18,078
SPEAKER_1:  accepting the different subgroups that make up the United States versus trying to purify it.

03:51:18,306 --> 03:51:20,926
SPEAKER_1:  Mexican immigrants is just another flavor.

03:51:21,282 --> 03:51:21,694
SPEAKER_1:  of

03:51:21,986 --> 03:51:24,734
SPEAKER_1:  saying this is the other, let's reject the other.

03:51:24,866 --> 03:51:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I saw that interview by the way that was.

03:51:28,162 --> 03:51:31,294
SPEAKER_0:  that you showed abasing restraint in that interview.

03:51:33,026 --> 03:51:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  My experience when I came up here, again, Trump was elected when I came up here. So it was a weird.

03:51:39,874 --> 03:51:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  time for me as far as being an American and the immigrant experience for myself.

03:51:44,610 --> 03:51:45,022
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:51:45,282 --> 03:51:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  by both being, you know.

03:51:47,170 --> 03:51:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  basically the ones that were, you know.

03:51:50,434 --> 03:51:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  talked about in that way.

03:51:52,226 --> 03:51:54,686
SPEAKER_0:  and also having a bunch of my friends who were very conservative and

03:51:55,266 --> 03:51:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  you know, wearing some of those MAGA hats around me and like, Hey at like.

03:51:59,778 --> 03:52:00,542
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I mean...

03:52:00,834 --> 03:52:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  You know, you know, I'm a guest here so I have to, you know, but uh...

03:52:06,498 --> 03:52:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  It's a balancing act is what I've been looking at it as.

03:52:09,986 --> 03:52:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  You know, on one side...

03:52:11,842 --> 03:52:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  There's the woke.

03:52:13,442 --> 03:52:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  side of it, which everything goes. And then the other side is like, let's hold on to some of these things that make us who we are.

03:52:19,554 --> 03:52:20,638
SPEAKER_0:  On my end, you know.

03:52:20,930 --> 03:52:23,422
SPEAKER_0:  I want to get to a place where I can smoke a joint.

03:52:23,650 --> 03:52:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  Conceal, carry, or firearm. Be at my gay best friend's wedding.

03:52:27,170 --> 03:52:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  And I want the government not to say anything about it. And I think there's parts in the United States here that kind of feel the same way.

03:52:33,602 --> 03:52:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  but there's extremes on both sides that are pulling you to one side or the other.

03:52:37,666 --> 03:52:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  And I've seen more of the United States than most Americans. I'm in a different state every weekend.

03:52:43,330 --> 03:52:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  So I get to go to TIFF.

03:52:46,018 --> 03:52:47,678
SPEAKER_0:  going to Tampa tomorrow.

03:52:49,026 --> 03:52:51,902
SPEAKER_0:  Then I'm going back to California, then I'm going to drop to Tennessee later.

03:52:52,578 --> 03:53:00,702
SPEAKER_0:  Kentucky, so I get to see all types of people and all types of mentalities and ways that people live and this country is more diverse than...

03:53:01,090 --> 03:53:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  most would think, you know, if you only see it through the lens of television or media.

03:53:05,730 --> 03:53:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  What I keep seeing out there that for me is like a...

03:53:10,082 --> 03:53:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  the reason I came here, I guess, and a lot of the reasons that I feel a vested interest in this country, not just because my kid's American.

03:53:19,810 --> 03:53:23,262
SPEAKER_0:  So I have a very, very big interest in this country doing well.

03:53:23,810 --> 03:53:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  But the thing I see is they're still...

03:53:26,402 --> 03:53:34,526
SPEAKER_0:  the opportunity and the ability to do something with yourself and opportunities out there for people like me that come here with nothing. I came here with.

03:53:35,906 --> 03:53:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  an experience base.

03:53:37,858 --> 03:53:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  A truck.

03:53:39,202 --> 03:53:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  And some demons and yeah, a bunch of demons in a bag.

03:53:42,818 --> 03:53:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:53:43,970 --> 03:53:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  I'm here with you talking right now about some of those experiences. Another immigrant.

03:53:48,610 --> 03:53:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  to another immigrant and both of us are reaching.

03:53:52,258 --> 03:53:58,686
SPEAKER_0:  people out there that might not have, might haven't heard a voice of people like us that come here.

03:53:59,074 --> 03:54:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  with our own.

03:54:00,898 --> 03:54:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  bag of demons, but...

03:54:02,850 --> 03:54:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  Where else in the world can two people like us have a conversation with an audience like us and not be shot outside of this because of the stuff we're saying?

03:54:11,618 --> 03:54:15,550
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, listen to with love and respect, not.

03:54:16,386 --> 03:54:17,534
SPEAKER_1:  Not derision.

03:54:18,242 --> 03:54:18,782
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:54:20,194 --> 03:54:23,646
SPEAKER_1:  Let me ask you for advice. What would you say to young folks?

03:54:25,698 --> 03:54:26,878
SPEAKER_1:  wherever they come from.

03:54:27,138 --> 03:54:29,886
SPEAKER_1:  So in high school and college, they're thinking of how to live.

03:54:30,882 --> 03:54:31,582
SPEAKER_1:  a life.

03:54:31,842 --> 03:54:34,046
SPEAKER_1:  have a career they can be proud of.

03:54:34,466 --> 03:54:39,486
SPEAKER_1:  And especially if they're struggling, especially if they're at a low point like you are when you came.

03:54:40,066 --> 03:54:40,382
SPEAKER_1:  here.

03:54:41,282 --> 03:54:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  ice.

03:54:41,954 --> 03:54:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  Travel is one of the biggest things in the world that I would ask people to kind of go out to.

03:54:47,170 --> 03:54:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  how other people live. Don't go there with your own preconceived notions or trying to make people act like you act. Go out there and travel and actually experience the world.

03:54:57,122 --> 03:54:58,718
SPEAKER_0:  It doesn't have to be another country.

03:54:59,298 --> 03:55:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  Going from Tennessee to Seattle, it's a pretty interesting change of scenery.

03:55:06,786 --> 03:55:09,598
SPEAKER_1:  Who's better at knife fighting? Just kidding, you don't have to answer that.

03:55:09,986 --> 03:55:11,111
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

03:55:11,111 --> 03:55:20,094
SPEAKER_0:  Tennessee. But the traveling is one and knowing how other people live is one aspect of it that I would tell people.

03:55:20,642 --> 03:55:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  It's risky, it's dangerous, but that is part of the journey is one of the things I would ask people, young people to kind of consider.

03:55:28,578 --> 03:55:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  Service is essential.

03:55:30,562 --> 03:55:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  and it should be at the basis of all of our lives.

03:55:33,410 --> 03:55:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  service. Start there. Start with service.

03:55:37,058 --> 03:55:42,110
SPEAKER_0:  In any industry, you're going to go start your own restaurant, you have to work in the kitchen for service.

03:55:42,338 --> 03:55:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  We're going to be a part, a productive member of this country. Service. And I'm not talking just about the military because the military, it's a process and it's a lifestyle and it's a thing for some people out there.

03:55:52,354 --> 03:55:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  It's not even a choice for other people if they want an education and I get that.

03:55:55,842 --> 03:55:59,358
SPEAKER_0:  Community service of any kind is an essential thing.

03:56:00,130 --> 03:56:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  the ability to go out there and interact with the people that you would normally not interact with the homeless population that there is in this country.

03:56:08,290 --> 03:56:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  of the older population that die in Mexico, our old die in our homes, you know, but here you send them off somewhere else to die.

03:56:17,826 --> 03:56:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  which is an interesting weird detachment that I've seen in the US as far as

03:56:21,794 --> 03:56:22,846
SPEAKER_0:  how the elders are.

03:56:23,138 --> 03:56:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  or cast aside.

03:56:24,834 --> 03:56:26,174
SPEAKER_0:  If I can...

03:56:26,434 --> 03:56:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  say anything to young people is to.

03:56:28,930 --> 03:56:37,630
SPEAKER_0:  start figuring out our lives of service and that's gonna expose you to a bunch of experiences to a bunch of people out there you might not regularly kind of meet and see and realities.

03:56:38,466 --> 03:56:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  Education.

03:56:40,098 --> 03:56:40,670
SPEAKER_0:  is

03:56:40,930 --> 03:56:41,598
SPEAKER_0:  out there.

03:56:42,626 --> 03:56:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  It is expensive, but I've sat through a bunch of really expensive classes that I've

03:56:47,778 --> 03:56:50,814
SPEAKER_0:  managed to see on YouTube and learned a lot from them.

03:56:51,842 --> 03:56:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  So education is out there, but it doesn't have to be as expensive as they make it. It's all about the individual and what he does with that education.

03:57:00,290 --> 03:57:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  The dream is free and the hustle is sold separately.

03:57:06,562 --> 03:57:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  but the ability to take information, process it, and use it.

03:57:11,682 --> 03:57:14,014
SPEAKER_0:  We're expecting everything to be safe.

03:57:14,338 --> 03:57:16,798
SPEAKER_0:  process and given to us in a platter.

03:57:17,282 --> 03:57:22,078
SPEAKER_0:  taking that and digesting it and thinking that's going to make us somebody that's going to be productive or valuable in society.

03:57:24,354 --> 03:57:25,150
SPEAKER_0:  What's up to us?

03:57:25,954 --> 03:57:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  The US talks a lot about freedoms, but doesn't talk a lot about responsibilities.

03:57:30,178 --> 03:57:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  I think that's a big part of it.

03:57:31,874 --> 03:57:36,990
SPEAKER_0:  you know, take responsibility for like, I came here without anything. And the first thing I thought was.

03:57:37,538 --> 03:57:39,422
SPEAKER_0:  I have a responsibility for the people that I've.

03:57:40,194 --> 03:57:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  work with and the people that are going through the same problems than I am, how can I figure out a way to help?

03:57:46,754 --> 03:57:50,238
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, the dark side of thinking a lot about freedom is...

03:57:50,466 --> 03:57:52,126
SPEAKER_1:  thinking too individualistically.

03:57:52,834 --> 03:57:56,286
SPEAKER_1:  meaning thinking about me, how to optimize my situation getting

03:57:56,546 --> 03:57:58,078
SPEAKER_1:  the deepest growth.

03:57:58,914 --> 03:58:05,950
SPEAKER_1:  you can do as an individual is by taking care of others, by helping others, by being of service, by being useful to your community locally.

03:58:06,210 --> 03:58:07,998
SPEAKER_1:  and then hopefully also a scale.

03:58:08,578 --> 03:58:10,078
SPEAKER_1:  And that's how you grow.

03:58:10,498 --> 03:58:13,123
SPEAKER_1:  And that's responsibility of like helping those around.

03:58:13,123 --> 03:58:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  There's an isolationist aspect to culture now.

03:58:16,674 --> 03:58:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  It's like we...

03:58:17,890 --> 03:58:23,902
SPEAKER_0:  we are separate, there's almost like a spiritual or cultural amputation in a way where...

03:58:24,706 --> 03:58:25,150
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

03:58:25,570 --> 03:58:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  When I was a kid, the house where all the bikes outside of it, that was where all the kids were hanging out.

03:58:32,450 --> 03:58:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  And now everybody's on their phone, you know, and they're separate houses, I.

03:58:35,650 --> 03:58:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  chatting on whatever.

03:58:37,570 --> 03:58:38,014
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:58:38,978 --> 03:58:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  There's a detachment to there. That's a weird aspect to it. And also the aspect of I need to be safe. I can't be offended.

03:58:47,234 --> 03:58:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  Don't hurt me, say spaces. This is my right, this is my, this is my right, this is my reality, you need to respect it.

03:58:53,954 --> 03:58:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  Respect is earned.

03:58:55,458 --> 03:58:57,214
SPEAKER_0:  and where I come from, respect to Zerun.

03:58:57,698 --> 03:58:58,078
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:58:58,818 --> 03:59:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  There's freedoms, but there's dangerous freedoms.

03:59:01,506 --> 03:59:05,182
SPEAKER_0:  Any freedom you have in Mexico is a dangerous freedom in a way.

03:59:05,762 --> 03:59:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  you know?

03:59:06,498 --> 03:59:08,574
SPEAKER_0:  You can drive home drunk in Mexico.

03:59:09,122 --> 03:59:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  You can.

03:59:10,050 --> 03:59:10,526
SPEAKER_0:  the few.

03:59:10,818 --> 03:59:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  bribe a cop on your way there and if you don't die or crash into somebody else.

03:59:14,466 --> 03:59:15,998
SPEAKER_0:  That's a dangerous aspect of freedom.

03:59:16,482 --> 03:59:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

03:59:17,090 --> 03:59:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  but there's a responsibility to all of it.

03:59:19,842 --> 03:59:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  It is a twisted responsibility in a twisted way to talk about it and describe it.

03:59:26,754 --> 03:59:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  the aspect of...

03:59:28,098 --> 03:59:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  people.

03:59:28,994 --> 03:59:32,094
SPEAKER_0:  screaming for freedom up here or their rights or their...

03:59:32,930 --> 03:59:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  privilege.

03:59:34,082 --> 03:59:35,454
SPEAKER_0:  without the responsibility.

03:59:35,810 --> 03:59:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

03:59:36,546 --> 03:59:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  What are you doing for your community?

03:59:38,690 --> 03:59:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  No.

03:59:39,522 --> 03:59:41,982
SPEAKER_0:  You're complaining about this, what are you doing about it?

03:59:42,242 --> 03:59:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

03:59:43,106 --> 03:59:48,350
SPEAKER_0:  Another thing I've noticed in traveling around, it's scary, is the whole people.

03:59:48,674 --> 03:59:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  people getting shouted down or cancelled because of what the expressors say.

03:59:54,626 --> 04:00:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  Some of the creepiest experiences I've had in the US has been through universities, or just seeing young people that have an opinion that is completely outside of reality.

04:00:03,778 --> 04:00:04,254
SPEAKER_0:  Um,

04:00:04,514 --> 04:00:08,222
SPEAKER_0:  people telling me how things are in Mexico, because they learned it through...

04:00:09,538 --> 04:00:10,238
SPEAKER_0:  college course.

04:00:10,530 --> 04:00:10,846
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

04:00:11,170 --> 04:00:11,614
SPEAKER_0:  and

04:00:12,258 --> 04:00:14,270
SPEAKER_0:  seeing sons of immigrants.

04:00:15,522 --> 04:00:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  criticizing me because of my opinion.

04:00:18,242 --> 04:00:20,670
SPEAKER_0:  of Mexico or what I have to say about it.

04:00:21,730 --> 04:00:30,046
SPEAKER_0:  And if you want to encounter the worst enemy of a Mexican, there's usually a second, third generation Mexican up here that shouts you down for what you're saying.

04:00:30,626 --> 04:00:33,758
SPEAKER_1:  I mean in general entitlement, all of those kinds of things.

04:00:34,274 --> 04:00:38,462
SPEAKER_1:  I, I, some of that comes with just being young in general, but yes, humility.

04:00:39,330 --> 04:00:43,294
SPEAKER_1:  Humility at a societal scale would benefit significantly.

04:00:43,682 --> 04:00:44,670
SPEAKER_1:  especially the young.

04:00:45,282 --> 04:00:48,350
SPEAKER_1:  I would say some of the service that you're speaking to.

04:00:48,738 --> 04:00:49,438
SPEAKER_1:  is

04:00:49,986 --> 04:00:51,326
SPEAKER_1:  comes with being humbled.

04:00:52,482 --> 04:00:54,110
SPEAKER_1:  And that is one of the-

04:00:54,882 --> 04:00:56,638
SPEAKER_1:  best things you can do as a young person.

04:00:56,866 --> 04:00:59,070
SPEAKER_1:  while maintaining the dream and the ambition.

04:00:59,330 --> 04:01:01,566
SPEAKER_1:  humble yourself to the reality of the world.

04:01:01,794 --> 04:01:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

04:01:02,978 --> 04:01:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  one small example, a micro example of this.

04:01:06,466 --> 04:01:07,006
SPEAKER_0:  My kid.

04:01:09,954 --> 04:01:11,102
SPEAKER_0:  There was a homeless guy.

04:01:11,330 --> 04:01:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

04:01:12,546 --> 04:01:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  She was out with some family members.

04:01:16,162 --> 04:01:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  It's Homeless Guy.

04:01:17,762 --> 04:01:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  showed up he was erratic, mentally disturbed.

04:01:21,826 --> 04:01:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  Create a scene.

04:01:23,010 --> 04:01:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  she was upset.

04:01:24,578 --> 04:01:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  There was a little bit of trauma there, so you're like, Oh, now all homeless people are bad.

04:01:29,730 --> 04:01:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  So...

04:01:30,466 --> 04:01:31,166
SPEAKER_0:  with her.

04:01:31,650 --> 04:01:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  She does art pieces sometimes for me and helps me make designs for the clothing brand that I have.

04:01:37,538 --> 04:01:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  and we take some of that money and we buy socks and underwear.

04:01:41,794 --> 04:01:47,102
SPEAKER_0:  And sometimes I have them in the car, sometimes I drive around and see somebody need something and I give it to her.

04:01:47,330 --> 04:01:50,494
SPEAKER_0:  and says, you helped me earn this money that's going to help these people.

04:01:51,010 --> 04:01:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  So you should just give them these.

04:01:52,802 --> 04:01:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  And she's like.

04:01:54,178 --> 04:01:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  Peace!

04:01:54,850 --> 04:01:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

04:01:56,514 --> 04:02:00,958
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm like, ah, thank you. She's like, cool. Surreal Da Duenda.

04:02:01,378 --> 04:02:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

04:02:02,434 --> 04:02:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  She used to roll up the window really quick, now she doesn't.

04:02:05,474 --> 04:02:07,006
SPEAKER_0:  They cease to be.

04:02:07,426 --> 04:02:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  Scary.

04:02:08,226 --> 04:02:10,046
SPEAKER_0:  Because now some of them have names.

04:02:10,498 --> 04:02:15,006
SPEAKER_0:  Now some of them know her name, you know, when they when she crosses by there. So she's.

04:02:15,234 --> 04:02:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  There's contact there.

04:02:16,770 --> 04:02:21,790
SPEAKER_0:  She's more connected than I am in some of these places now. She has friends in low places.

04:02:22,626 --> 04:02:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  and in high places. That comes later, I guess.

04:02:25,730 --> 04:02:28,958
SPEAKER_0:  but she is learning about service. She's learning about.

04:02:29,666 --> 04:02:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  Not everybody out there is an enemy or...

04:02:33,090 --> 04:02:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  Bad.

04:02:34,818 --> 04:02:35,550
SPEAKER_0:  Scary

04:02:36,418 --> 04:02:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  you learning about service?

04:02:38,466 --> 04:02:46,174
SPEAKER_0:  And she's basically learning that lesson that I got from my mom long ago. Nobody's against you, they're for themselves. Don't take anything personal.

04:02:46,914 --> 04:02:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  And if you're not doing something for other people while you're working, then you're not doing anything.

04:02:52,258 --> 04:02:55,486
SPEAKER_1:  So when you were young, you were pretty sure you were gonna die.

04:02:56,098 --> 04:02:59,294
SPEAKER_1:  your 30. What's your relationship with death today?

04:02:59,650 --> 04:03:02,110
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think about your mortality? Are you afraid of it?

04:03:02,530 --> 04:03:05,310
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not afraid of it. If anything, I'm afraid of the...

04:03:07,010 --> 04:03:07,742
SPEAKER_0:  meaningless.

04:03:08,738 --> 04:03:11,710
SPEAKER_0:  death or at least a meaningless

04:03:12,322 --> 04:03:12,798
SPEAKER_0:  walk.

04:03:13,090 --> 04:03:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  towards it.

04:03:14,498 --> 04:03:20,830
SPEAKER_0:  I'm afraid of losing use of my legs, I guess. I'm afraid of not being able to go out there and do things anymore. I'm afraid that I'm...

04:03:21,442 --> 04:03:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  not physically capable of doing the job that I used to do.

04:03:24,930 --> 04:03:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  So if anything, I'm afraid of stillness. You know, something I always quote a lot in my writing, stillness is death.

04:03:33,090 --> 04:03:35,742
SPEAKER_1:  So you always want to be challenging yourself moving.

04:03:36,322 --> 04:03:36,958
SPEAKER_1:  growing.

04:03:37,186 --> 04:03:41,310
SPEAKER_1:  Like you're traveling, so you get all these experiences and filling your life with all these experiences.

04:03:41,602 --> 04:03:42,558
SPEAKER_1:  And if it ends...

04:03:42,882 --> 04:03:43,774
SPEAKER_1:  When it ends.

04:03:44,034 --> 04:03:45,246
SPEAKER_1:  Are you ready for it? Yeah.

04:03:45,666 --> 04:03:48,766
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not afraid of the end. The ending is important in all things.

04:03:49,602 --> 04:03:52,990
SPEAKER_0:  First time I got a promotion, I got two silver coins handed to me.

04:03:53,922 --> 04:03:56,542
SPEAKER_0:  Here's a silver coin and this is another silver coin.

04:03:57,634 --> 04:03:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  I'll give you the other one when your job ends.

04:04:00,834 --> 04:04:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

04:04:02,018 --> 04:04:06,270
SPEAKER_0:  It depends on you if you wanted to have it over your eyes or in your pocket.

04:04:07,650 --> 04:04:15,326
SPEAKER_0:  And the lesson there is that this job you're getting, it's pretty cool and you're gonna be in charge of all these people and it's pretty important, but it's gonna end.

04:04:16,066 --> 04:04:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  So you always have to, the ending is important in all things.

04:04:18,946 --> 04:04:19,294
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

04:04:20,066 --> 04:04:25,630
SPEAKER_0:  If we don't keep that in mind, then if you think we're immortal and nothing's going to end, I think there's an atrophy, a spiritual atrophy in that.

04:04:27,266 --> 04:04:29,086
SPEAKER_1:  for the sake of spiritual flourishing.

04:04:29,730 --> 04:04:31,998
SPEAKER_1:  This conversation too must come to an end.

04:04:32,418 --> 04:04:35,550
SPEAKER_1:  So I think a beautiful way to end it. And I'm a huge fan of yours.

04:04:35,778 --> 04:04:36,478
SPEAKER_1:  Thank you for.

04:04:37,538 --> 04:04:39,582
SPEAKER_1:  Being a man with a life well lived.

04:04:39,810 --> 04:04:43,422
SPEAKER_1:  and for talking with me today is an honor man. This is an awesome conversation.

04:04:43,778 --> 04:04:44,606
SPEAKER_0:  Thank you for having me on.

04:04:45,730 --> 04:04:48,158

SPEAKER_1:  And now...

04:04:53,250 --> 04:04:57,150
SPEAKER_1:  Let me leave you with some words from Al Pacino's character in Scarface.

04:04:57,506 --> 04:04:58,430
SPEAKER_1:  Tony Montana.

04:04:59,586 --> 04:05:02,366
SPEAKER_1:  You don't have the guts to be what you want to be.

04:05:02,882 --> 04:05:05,918
SPEAKER_1:  You need people like me so you can point your fingers and say

04:05:06,306 --> 04:05:07,422
SPEAKER_1:  That's the bad guy.

04:05:09,154 --> 04:05:09,886
SPEAKER_1:  Thanks for listening.

04:05:10,242 --> 04:05:11,006
SPEAKER_1:  I hope to see you.

SPEAKER_1:  next time.
