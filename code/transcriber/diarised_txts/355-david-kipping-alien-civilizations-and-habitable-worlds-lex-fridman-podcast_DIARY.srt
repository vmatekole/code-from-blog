00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,510
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's actually not that hard to imagine we are the only civilization in the galaxy right now.

00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:05,150
SPEAKER_1:  living.

00:00:05,378 --> 00:00:07,166
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, that's this kernel extent.

00:00:07,618 --> 00:00:15,678
SPEAKER_1:  But there may be very many extinct civilizations. If each civilization has a typical lifetime comparable to, let's say AI is the demise of our own.

00:00:15,938 --> 00:00:21,630
SPEAKER_1:  That's only a few hundred years of technological development or maybe 10,000 years if you go back to the Neolithic Revolution.

00:00:22,274 --> 00:00:23,486
SPEAKER_1:  the dawn of agriculture.

00:00:23,874 --> 00:00:25,982
SPEAKER_1:  You know, hardly anything can cosmic time span.

00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:26,878
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,926
SPEAKER_1:  That's nothing, that's the blink of an eye.

00:00:29,314 --> 00:00:34,078
SPEAKER_1:  And so it's not surprising at all that we would happen not to co-exist with anyone else.

00:00:34,786 --> 00:00:37,054
SPEAKER_1:  That doesn't mean nobody else was ever here.

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:46,622
SPEAKER_1:  And if other civilizations come to that same conclusion and realization, maybe they scour the galaxy around them, but find any evidence for intelligence.

00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:47,742
SPEAKER_1:  Then

00:00:48,034 --> 00:00:50,558
SPEAKER_1:  They have two options, they can either give up on communication.

00:00:50,946 --> 00:00:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  and just say, well, it's never going to happen.

00:00:52,898 --> 00:00:54,814
SPEAKER_1:  We just may as well just, you know.

00:00:55,106 --> 00:00:57,118
SPEAKER_1:  worry about what's happening here on our own planet.

00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:00,766
SPEAKER_1:  Or they could attempt communication, but communication through time.

00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:04,391
SPEAKER_1:  The following is a conversation.

00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  with David Kipping.

00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  an astronomer and astrophysicist at Columbia University.

00:01:09,698 --> 00:01:11,838
SPEAKER_0:  Director of the Cool Worlds Lab.

00:01:12,162 --> 00:01:12,606
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:14,270
SPEAKER_0:  He's an amazing educator.

00:01:14,594 --> 00:01:15,006
SPEAKER_0:  about.

00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  the most fascinating scientific phenomena in our universe.

00:01:19,234 --> 00:01:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  I highly recommend you check out his videos on the Cool Worlds YouTube channel.

00:01:24,482 --> 00:01:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  David.

00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  quickly became one of my favorite human beings.

00:01:27,682 --> 00:01:28,670
SPEAKER_0:  I hope to talk to him.

00:01:29,026 --> 00:01:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  many more times in the future.

00:01:31,394 --> 00:01:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:01:33,474 --> 00:01:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  support it.

00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,446
SPEAKER_0:  Please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  And now, dear friends.

00:01:38,562 --> 00:01:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  Here's David.

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,190
SPEAKER_0:  Kipping.

00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:46,206
SPEAKER_0:  Your research at Columbia is in part focused on what you call cool worlds or

00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  worlds outside our solar system or temperature.

00:01:49,538 --> 00:01:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  It's sufficiently cool to allow for moons, rings, and life to form, and for us humans to observe it.

00:01:55,938 --> 00:01:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  Can you tell me?

00:01:57,122 --> 00:01:57,758
SPEAKER_0:  More about.

00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  this idea, this place of cool worlds.

00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:04,286
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, the history of discovering planets outside our solar system was

00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:06,686
SPEAKER_1:  really dominated by these hot planets.

00:02:06,946 --> 00:02:09,182
SPEAKER_1:  And that's just because of the fact they're easier to find.

00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:16,574
SPEAKER_1:  When the very first methods came online, these were primarily the Doppler spectroscopy method, looking for wobbling stars.

00:02:17,058 --> 00:02:23,262
SPEAKER_1:  and also the transit method. And these two both have a really strong bias towards finding these hot planets.

00:02:23,906 --> 00:02:24,318
SPEAKER_1:  Now.

00:02:25,122 --> 00:02:29,822
SPEAKER_1:  planets are interesting. The chemistry in the atmosphere is fascinating. It's very alien.

00:02:30,274 --> 00:02:34,430
SPEAKER_1:  An example of one that's particularly close to my heart is Trace 2B.

00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:37,982
SPEAKER_1:  whose atmosphere is so dark it's less reflective than coal.

00:02:38,338 --> 00:02:38,942
SPEAKER_1:  And so they have.

00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,254
SPEAKER_1:  really bizarre.

00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,630
SPEAKER_1:  Photometric properties.

00:02:42,146 --> 00:02:43,678
SPEAKER_1:  yet at the same time.

00:02:43,938 --> 00:02:45,950
SPEAKER_1:  They resemble nothing like our own home.

00:02:46,722 --> 00:02:47,486
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  It said there's two types of astrophysicists, the astrophysicists who care about how the universe works.

00:02:52,514 --> 00:02:54,366
SPEAKER_1:  They want to understand the mechanics of.

00:02:54,754 --> 00:03:00,286
SPEAKER_1:  the machinery of this universe, why did the big bang happen, why is the universe expanding, how are galaxies formed?

00:03:00,642 --> 00:03:02,942
SPEAKER_1:  And there's another type of astrophysicist which perhaps...

00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:03,710
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:03:04,738 --> 00:03:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  speaks to me a little bit more, it whispers into your ear, and that is why we hear.

00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:12,254
SPEAKER_1:  Are we alone? Are there others out there?

00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,382
SPEAKER_1:  And ultimately, along this journey, the hotplates aren't going to get us there.

00:03:16,706 --> 00:03:18,878
SPEAKER_1:  when we're looking for life in the universe.

00:03:19,234 --> 00:03:22,718
SPEAKER_1:  seems to make perfect sense that there should be planets like our own out there.

00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,550
SPEAKER_1:  maybe even moons like our own planet around gas giants that could be habitable.

00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:33,054
SPEAKER_1:  And so my research has been driven by trying to find these more miraculous globes that might

00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:34,398
SPEAKER_1:  resemble our own planet.

00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  So they're the ones that lurk more in the shadows in terms of how difficult it is to detect.

00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:46,334
SPEAKER_1:  They're much harder. They're harder for several reasons. The method we primarily use is the transit method. So this is really eclipses.

00:03:46,722 --> 00:03:49,918
SPEAKER_1:  As the planet passes in front of the star, it blocks out some starlight.

00:03:50,338 --> 00:03:56,446
SPEAKER_1:  The problem with that is that not all planets pass in front of their star. They have to be aligned correctly from your line of sight.

00:03:56,866 --> 00:04:00,222
SPEAKER_1:  And so the further away the planet is from the star, the cooler it is.

00:04:00,514 --> 00:04:03,934
SPEAKER_1:  the less likely it is that you're gonna get that geometric alignment.

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,510
SPEAKER_1:  So whereas a hot Jupiter, about 1% of hot Jupiters will transit in front of their star,

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:09,854
SPEAKER_1:  only about

00:04:10,146 --> 00:04:15,358
SPEAKER_1:  0.5%, maybe even a quarter of a percent of Earth-like planets will have the right geometry.

00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:16,318
SPEAKER_1:  to transit.

00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:18,846
SPEAKER_1:  And so that makes it much, much harder for us.

00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:22,238
SPEAKER_0:  What's the connection between temperature of the planet and geometric alignment?

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  Probability of geometric alignment. There's no-

00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:29,022
SPEAKER_1:  direct connection, but they're connected via an intermediate parameter, which is their separation from the star.

00:04:29,442 --> 00:04:32,222
SPEAKER_1:  So the planet will be cooler if it's further away from the star.

00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,342
SPEAKER_1:  Which in turn means that the probability of getting that alignment correct is going to be less.

00:04:37,698 --> 00:04:41,214
SPEAKER_1:  On top of that, they also transit their star less frequently.

00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,926
SPEAKER_1:  So if you go to the telescope and you want to discover a hot Jupiter.

00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:52,350
SPEAKER_1:  You could probably do it in a week or so, because the orbital periods are of order of one, two, three days. So you can actually get the full orbit two or three times over.

00:04:52,738 --> 00:04:54,430
SPEAKER_1:  whereas if you wanted to set an Earth-like planet.

00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,694
SPEAKER_1:  You have to observe that star for 3-4 years.

00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,422
SPEAKER_1:  And that's actually one of the problems with.

00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:01,182
SPEAKER_1:  Kepler. Kepler.

00:05:01,442 --> 00:05:03,934
SPEAKER_1:  was this very successful mission that NASA launched.

00:05:04,258 --> 00:05:04,702
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,942
SPEAKER_1:  I'm over a decade ago now, I think, and...

00:05:07,426 --> 00:05:12,222
SPEAKER_1:  It discovered thousands of planets. It's still the dominant source of exoplanets that we know about.

00:05:12,674 --> 00:05:15,998
SPEAKER_1:  But unfortunately, it didn't last as long as we would have liked it to.

00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:20,638
SPEAKER_1:  It died after about 4.35 years, I think it was. And so...

00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:23,870
SPEAKER_1:  for an Earth-like planet, that's just enough to catch four transits.

00:05:24,354 --> 00:05:26,110
SPEAKER_1:  and full transits was kind of seen as the minimum.

00:05:26,562 --> 00:05:31,678
SPEAKER_1:  But of course, the more transits you see, the easier it is to detect it because you build up signal to noise.

00:05:31,938 --> 00:05:34,878
SPEAKER_1:  If you see the same thing, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, the more ticks you get.

00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:36,254
SPEAKER_1:  the easier is to find it.

00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:38,622
SPEAKER_1:  And so it was really a shame that...

00:05:38,914 --> 00:05:43,518
SPEAKER_1:  Kepler was just at the limit of where we were expecting it to start to see Earth-like planets.

00:05:43,938 --> 00:05:45,950
SPEAKER_1:  And in fact, it really found zero.

00:05:46,466 --> 00:05:49,438
SPEAKER_1:  zero planets that are around stars like the Sun.

00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:51,934
SPEAKER_1:  orbits similar to the Earth around the Sun.

00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,662
SPEAKER_1:  and could potentially be.

00:05:53,922 --> 00:05:55,998
SPEAKER_1:  similar to our own planet in terms of its composition.

00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:00,126
SPEAKER_1:  And so it's a great shame, but that's why it gives astronomers.

00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:01,854
SPEAKER_1:  more to do in the future.

00:06:02,434 --> 00:06:03,358
SPEAKER_1:  Just to clarify.

00:06:03,586 --> 00:06:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  The transit method.

00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  is

00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  primary way of detecting these things.

00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,742
SPEAKER_0:  And what it is is, uh,

00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  when the object.

00:06:13,986 --> 00:06:15,806
SPEAKER_0:  passes, occludes.

00:06:16,258 --> 00:06:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  The source of light, just a tiny bit.

00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:19,230
SPEAKER_0:  a few pixels.

00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  And from that we can infer something about its mass and size and distance and geometry and all of that.

00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:25,534
SPEAKER_0:  That's like.

00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:26,878
SPEAKER_0:  trying to tell.

00:06:28,226 --> 00:06:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  What?

00:06:28,962 --> 00:06:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:06:30,786 --> 00:06:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  at a party, you can't see anything about a person, but you can just see by the way they occlude others.

00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  So this is the method.

00:06:38,114 --> 00:06:39,902
SPEAKER_0:  but this is super far away.

00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  How many pixels of information do we have?

00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  basically how high resolution is the signal that we.

00:06:46,914 --> 00:06:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  that we can get about these occlusions.

00:06:50,402 --> 00:06:54,750
SPEAKER_1:  You're right in your description. I think just to build upon that a little bit more, it might be almost like...

00:06:55,394 --> 00:06:58,014
SPEAKER_1:  your vision is completely blurry. Like you have an extreme.

00:06:58,434 --> 00:06:59,422
SPEAKER_1:  in a high prescription.

00:06:59,746 --> 00:07:00,446
SPEAKER_1:  and say you can't.

00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:02,878
SPEAKER_1:  resolve anything. Everything's just blurs.

00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:12,382
SPEAKER_1:  And but you can tell that something was there because it just got fainter for a short amount of time. Someone passed in front of a light. And so that light in your eyes would just dim for a short moment.

00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:15,742
SPEAKER_1:  Now the reason we have that problem with blown as a resolution.

00:07:16,194 --> 00:07:18,238
SPEAKER_1:  is just because the stars are so far away.

00:07:18,466 --> 00:07:23,774
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, these are the closest stars are four light years away, but most of the stars Kepa looked at with thousands of light years away.

00:07:24,514 --> 00:07:28,254
SPEAKER_1:  And so there's absolutely no chance that the telescope can physically resolve.

00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:29,662
SPEAKER_1:  the star?

00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:30,718
SPEAKER_1:  or even.

00:07:30,946 --> 00:07:37,214
SPEAKER_1:  the separation between the planet and the star is too small, especially for a telescope like Kepler, it's only a meter across.

00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,958
SPEAKER_1:  In principle, you can make those detections, but...

00:07:41,698 --> 00:07:46,494
SPEAKER_1:  you need a different kind of telescope. We call that direct imaging. And direct imaging is a very exciting.

00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,438
SPEAKER_1:  distinct way of detecting planets.

00:07:49,826 --> 00:07:51,806
SPEAKER_1:  But it, as you can imagine, is going to be.

00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:57,630
SPEAKER_1:  far easier to detect plants which are really far away from their star to do that, because that's going to make that separation really big.

00:07:57,858 --> 00:08:00,830
SPEAKER_1:  And then you also want the star to be really close to us, to the nearest stars.

00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:05,086
SPEAKER_1:  Not only that, but you would prefer that planet to be really hot.

00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:07,294
SPEAKER_1:  because the hotter it is, the brighter it is.

00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:11,518
SPEAKER_1:  And so that tends to bias direct imaging towards plants which are in the process of forming.

00:08:12,098 --> 00:08:14,846
SPEAKER_1:  So things which have just formed the planet still got all of its

00:08:15,234 --> 00:08:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  primordial heat embedded within it.

00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,742
SPEAKER_1:  and it's glowing, we can see those quite easily.

00:08:20,002 --> 00:08:26,590
SPEAKER_1:  But for the planets more like the Earth, of course, they've cooled down, and so we can't see that the light is pitiful compared to a newly formed planet.

00:08:26,978 --> 00:08:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  We would like to get there.

00:08:28,546 --> 00:08:30,430
SPEAKER_1:  with direct imaging. The dream is to have.

00:08:30,754 --> 00:08:35,326
SPEAKER_1:  the pale blue dot, an actual photograph of it, maybe even just a one pixel photograph of it.

00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:37,534
SPEAKER_1:  But for now, the entire solar system.

00:08:37,858 --> 00:08:40,990
SPEAKER_1:  is one pixel, certainly with the transit method most other telescopes.

00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:44,158
SPEAKER_1:  And so all you can do is see where that one pixel.

00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,814
SPEAKER_1:  which contains potentially dozens of planets.

00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:49,246
SPEAKER_1:  and the star, maybe even multiple stars.

00:08:49,602 --> 00:08:50,974
SPEAKER_1:  dims for a short amount of time.

00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,455
SPEAKER_1:  The dims just a little.

00:08:52,455 --> 00:08:53,205
SPEAKER_0:  bit and from that

00:08:53,205 --> 00:08:54,206
SPEAKER_1:  you can infer something.

00:08:54,786 --> 00:08:57,022
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean, it's like being a detective.

00:08:57,378 --> 00:09:01,566
SPEAKER_1:  and the scene, right? It's very, it's indirect clues of the existence of the planet.

00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  It's amazing that humans can do that.

00:09:03,394 --> 00:09:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  I was just looking out in these immense distances.

00:09:07,266 --> 00:09:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  and looking...

00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:13,150
SPEAKER_0:  You know, if there's alien civilizations out there, let's say one exactly like our own.

00:09:14,402 --> 00:09:14,846
SPEAKER_0:  or like.

00:09:15,938 --> 00:09:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  Would we even be able to see an Earth that passes?

00:09:19,138 --> 00:09:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  Mm-hmm.

00:09:19,778 --> 00:09:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  in the way of its sun and slightly dims. And that's the only sign we have.

00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  of that.

00:09:24,994 --> 00:09:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  of the alien.

00:09:26,242 --> 00:09:29,406
SPEAKER_0:  human-like civilization out there. Is it just a little bit of a dimming?

00:09:29,762 --> 00:09:30,110
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:09:30,562 --> 00:09:34,206
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, it depends on the type of star we're talking about. If it is a star, truly like the sun.

00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:39,934
SPEAKER_1:  The dip that causes is 84 parts per million. I mean, that's just, it's like the same as a.

00:09:40,354 --> 00:09:47,838
SPEAKER_1:  Um, it's like a firefly flying in front of like a giant floodlight at a stadium or something. That's the kind of the brightness contrast that you're trying to.

00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:51,166
SPEAKER_1:  compared to, so it's extremely difficult detection.

00:09:51,906 --> 00:09:52,350
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:09:52,770 --> 00:10:00,094
SPEAKER_1:  in the very, very best cases we can get down to that. But as I said, we don't really have any true earth analogs that have been in the exoplanet candidate yet.

00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,486
SPEAKER_1:  Unless you relax that definition, you say.

00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:07,966
SPEAKER_1:  It's not just doesn't have to be a star just like the sun. It could be a star that's smaller than the sun. It could be.

00:10:08,226 --> 00:10:10,974
SPEAKER_1:  these orange dwarfs or even the red dwarf stars.

00:10:11,202 --> 00:10:15,742
SPEAKER_1:  and the fact those stars are smaller means that for the same size planet passing in front of it

00:10:16,034 --> 00:10:17,374
SPEAKER_1:  More light is blocked out.

00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,454
SPEAKER_1:  So a very exciting system.

00:10:19,778 --> 00:10:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  For example, as Trappist 1.

00:10:21,506 --> 00:10:23,422
SPEAKER_1:  which has seven planets, which are.

00:10:23,842 --> 00:10:24,734
SPEAKER_1:  smaller than the Earth?

00:10:25,218 --> 00:10:25,790
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:32,126
SPEAKER_1:  those are quite easily detectable, not with a space-based telescope, even from the ground, that's just because the star is so much smaller.

00:10:32,578 --> 00:10:36,798
SPEAKER_1:  that the relative increase in or decrease in brightness is enhanced significantly.

00:10:37,122 --> 00:10:38,142
SPEAKER_1:  because that's smaller size.

00:10:38,402 --> 00:10:42,110
SPEAKER_1:  So TRAPP is one E. It's a planet which is in the right distance for liquid water.

00:10:42,754 --> 00:10:44,894
SPEAKER_1:  It has a slightly smaller size than the Earth.

00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:48,222
SPEAKER_1:  It's about 90% the size of the Earth, about 80% the mass.

00:10:48,706 --> 00:10:52,446
SPEAKER_1:  and it's one of the top targets right now for potentially having life.

00:10:53,058 --> 00:10:54,302
SPEAKER_1:  And yet...

00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:55,774
SPEAKER_1:  It raises.

00:10:56,002 --> 00:10:57,214
SPEAKER_1:  many questions about.

00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:02,430
SPEAKER_1:  What would that environment be like? This is a star which is 1 eighth the mass of the sun.

00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:03,934
SPEAKER_1:  It's um...

00:11:04,482 --> 00:11:06,750
SPEAKER_1:  Stars like that take a long time to...

00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,446
SPEAKER_1:  Come off that adolescence.

00:11:08,962 --> 00:11:14,782
SPEAKER_1:  When stars first form, like the sun, it takes them maybe 10, 100 million years to sort of settle in to that main sequence lifetime.

00:11:15,298 --> 00:11:17,054
SPEAKER_1:  But for stars like these lights.

00:11:17,282 --> 00:11:18,462
SPEAKER_1:  M-Dwarfs as we call them.

00:11:18,786 --> 00:11:20,926
SPEAKER_1:  They can take up to a billion years or more.

00:11:21,378 --> 00:11:21,918
SPEAKER_1:  to.

00:11:22,402 --> 00:11:23,006
SPEAKER_1:  Calm down.

00:11:23,586 --> 00:11:28,126
SPEAKER_1:  And during that period, they're producing huge amounts of X-rays, ultraviolet radiation.

00:11:28,866 --> 00:11:30,974
SPEAKER_1:  potentially rip off the entire atmosphere.

00:11:31,298 --> 00:11:33,822
SPEAKER_1:  it may desiccate the plants in the system.

00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,926
SPEAKER_1:  And so even if water arrived by comets or something.

00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,534
SPEAKER_1:  It may have lost all that water due to this prolonged period of high activity.

00:11:41,954 --> 00:11:42,942
SPEAKER_1:  So we have lots of...

00:11:43,362 --> 00:11:46,206
SPEAKER_1:  open-ended questions about these m-dwarf planets.

00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,062
SPEAKER_1:  but they are the most accessible.

00:11:48,418 --> 00:11:48,990
SPEAKER_1:  And so...

00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,254
SPEAKER_1:  In the near term, if we detect anything in terms of...

00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:53,662
SPEAKER_1:  by our signatures.

00:11:54,018 --> 00:11:56,382
SPEAKER_1:  it's going to be for one of these red dwarf stars.

00:11:56,706 --> 00:11:58,014
SPEAKER_1:  It's not going to be a true.

00:11:58,338 --> 00:12:00,926
SPEAKER_1:  Earth Twin, as we would recognise it as having a yellow star.

00:12:01,442 --> 00:12:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  Well, let me ask you, I mean, there's a million...

00:12:03,778 --> 00:12:06,398
SPEAKER_0:  Waste assets question I'm sure Alaska about.

00:12:06,754 --> 00:12:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  habitable worlds.

00:12:09,122 --> 00:12:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  Let's just go to our own solar system. What can we learn about?

00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:13,694
SPEAKER_0:  The planets and moons.

00:12:14,722 --> 00:12:16,350
SPEAKER_0:  in our solar system that.

00:12:17,858 --> 00:12:18,974
SPEAKER_0:  might contain life.

00:12:19,554 --> 00:12:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  whether it's Mars or some of them.

00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:22,526
SPEAKER_0:  Moons of Jupiter.

00:12:23,074 --> 00:12:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  and Saturn.

00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  What kind of characteristics? Because you said it might not need to be Earth-like. What kind of characteristics might be?

00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:30,974
SPEAKER_0:  we'd be looking for.

00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:32,702
SPEAKER_1:  when we look for life.

00:12:33,154 --> 00:12:35,038
SPEAKER_1:  It's hard to define even what life is.

00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:40,030
SPEAKER_1:  but we can maybe do a better job in defining the sorts of things that life does.

00:12:40,514 --> 00:12:45,182
SPEAKER_1:  And that provides some aspects to some avenue for looking for them.

00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:46,174
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:47,102
SPEAKER_1:  any

00:12:47,554 --> 00:12:51,486
SPEAKER_1:  Classically, conventionally, I think we thought the way to look for life was to look for oxygen.

00:12:52,194 --> 00:12:54,814
SPEAKER_1:  Oxygen is a byproduct of its synthesis on this planet.

00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:58,430
SPEAKER_1:  We didn't always have it. Certainly if you go back to the Icaean period.

00:12:58,818 --> 00:13:07,518
SPEAKER_1:  You have this period called the Great Oxidation Event where the Earth floats with oxygen for the first time and so that's to saturate the oceans and then the atmosphere.

00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:08,606
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:11,710
SPEAKER_1:  that oxygen if we detect it on another planet whether it be

00:13:12,098 --> 00:13:13,950
SPEAKER_1:  Mars, Venus or an exoplanet, whatever it is.

00:13:14,498 --> 00:13:14,846
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:13:15,106 --> 00:13:18,942
SPEAKER_1:  that was long thought to be evidence for something doing fetch synthesis.

00:13:19,202 --> 00:13:21,822
SPEAKER_1:  because if you took away all the plant life on the earth...

00:13:22,306 --> 00:13:26,270
SPEAKER_1:  The oxygen, one just hang around here, there's a highly reactive molecule.

00:13:26,562 --> 00:13:31,838
SPEAKER_1:  it would oxidize things and so within about a million years you would probably lose all the oxygen on planet Earth.

00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,502
SPEAKER_1:  So that was a...

00:13:33,762 --> 00:13:35,422
SPEAKER_1:  conventionally how we thought we could look for life.

00:13:35,906 --> 00:13:41,758
SPEAKER_1:  And then we start to realize that it's not so simple because A, there might be other things that life does apart from fetch synthesis.

00:13:42,178 --> 00:13:48,990
SPEAKER_1:  Certainly the vast majority of the Earth's history had no oxygen, and yet there was living things on it, so that doesn't seem like a complete test.

00:13:49,506 --> 00:13:50,814
SPEAKER_1:  And secondly,

00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:53,694
SPEAKER_1:  Could there be other things that produce oxygen besides from life?

00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,830
SPEAKER_1:  a growing concern has been.

00:13:57,282 --> 00:14:03,454
SPEAKER_1:  these false positives in biosignature work. And so one example of that would be phtholysis that happens in the atmosphere.

00:14:04,098 --> 00:14:05,150
SPEAKER_1:  when ultraviolet write.

00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,902
SPEAKER_1:  hits the upper atmosphere, can break up water vapour.

00:14:08,354 --> 00:14:10,878
SPEAKER_1:  the hydrogen spits off to the oxygen.

00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:16,478
SPEAKER_1:  The hydrogen is a much lighter atomic species and so it can actually escape certainly planets like the Earth's gravity

00:14:16,834 --> 00:14:19,198
SPEAKER_1:  That's why we don't have any hydrogen or very little helium.

00:14:19,874 --> 00:14:20,574
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

00:14:20,802 --> 00:14:28,638
SPEAKER_1:  that leaves you with the oxygen, which then oxidizes the surface. And so there could be a residual oxygen signature just due to this photolysis process.

00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:30,846
SPEAKER_1:  So we've been trying to generalize.

00:14:31,298 --> 00:14:32,414
SPEAKER_1:  And, um...

00:14:32,802 --> 00:14:36,350
SPEAKER_1:  Certainly in recent years there have been other suggestions of things we could look for in the solar system and beyond.

00:14:36,802 --> 00:14:38,430
SPEAKER_1:  nitrous oxide.

00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:41,150
SPEAKER_1:  Basically, laughing gas is a product of microbes.

00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:47,006
SPEAKER_1:  That's something that we're starting to get more interested in looking for. Methane gas in combination.

00:14:47,362 --> 00:14:50,078
SPEAKER_1:  with other gases can be an important biosignature.

00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:51,454
SPEAKER_1:  uh, phosphine.

00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:57,598
SPEAKER_1:  well and phosphine is particularly relevant to the solar system because there was a lot of interest for venus recently

00:14:58,082 --> 00:14:58,558
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,766
SPEAKER_1:  may have heard that there was a claim of.

00:15:01,154 --> 00:15:03,774
SPEAKER_1:  a biosignature in Venus's atmosphere.

00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,438
SPEAKER_1:  I think it was like two years ago now.

00:15:06,562 --> 00:15:08,574
SPEAKER_1:  And the judge and jury are still out on that.

00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:10,430
SPEAKER_1:  There was a...

00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:11,966
SPEAKER_1:  Very provocative.

00:15:12,258 --> 00:15:15,902
SPEAKER_1:  claim and signature of a phosphine-like spectral absorption.

00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:17,342
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:21,822
SPEAKER_1:  but it could have also have been some of the molecule in particular, sulfur dioxide.

00:15:22,498 --> 00:15:23,710
SPEAKER_1:  which is not a biosignature.

00:15:24,226 --> 00:15:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  So this is a detection of a gas in the atmosphere.

00:15:27,074 --> 00:15:27,742
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, Venus.

00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

00:15:29,634 --> 00:15:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  It might be controversial, so...

00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:33,630
SPEAKER_0:  dimensions so

00:15:33,986 --> 00:15:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  One, how to interpret that.

00:15:35,842 --> 00:15:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  Two, is this the right gas? And three, is this even the right detection? Is there an error in the detection?

00:15:41,602 --> 00:15:44,222
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean, how much do we believe the detection in the first place?

00:15:44,546 --> 00:15:45,790
SPEAKER_1:  If you do believe it.

00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,966
SPEAKER_1:  does that necessarily mean there's life there?

00:15:48,258 --> 00:15:53,214
SPEAKER_1:  And what gives, how can you have life in the Venus's atmosphere in the first place? Because that's-

00:15:53,666 --> 00:16:00,830
SPEAKER_1:  You know, been seen as like a hellhole place for imagining life. But I guess the counter to that has been that, okay, yes, the surface is.

00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:03,742
SPEAKER_1:  a horrendous place to imagine life thriving.

00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:06,206
SPEAKER_1:  But as you go up in altitude.

00:16:06,786 --> 00:16:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  The very dense atmosphere means that there is a cloud layer.

00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,390
SPEAKER_1:  where the temperature.

00:16:11,682 --> 00:16:14,462
SPEAKER_1:  and the pressure become actually fairly similar to the surface of the Earth.

00:16:14,818 --> 00:16:19,518
SPEAKER_1:  And so it may be there are microbes stirring around in the clouds which are producing phosphine.

00:16:20,002 --> 00:16:20,350
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:16:20,802 --> 00:16:22,142
SPEAKER_1:  At the moment, this is.

00:16:22,402 --> 00:16:23,870
SPEAKER_1:  Fascinating, it's got a lot of us.

00:16:24,898 --> 00:16:26,974
SPEAKER_1:  reinvigorated about the prospects of

00:16:27,234 --> 00:16:30,142
SPEAKER_1:  going back to Venus and doing another mission there. In fact, there's now...

00:16:30,402 --> 00:16:32,126
SPEAKER_1:  Two NASA missions, very task.

00:16:32,482 --> 00:16:36,510
SPEAKER_1:  and DaVinci, which are going to be going back and before 2030, the 2030s.

00:16:36,994 --> 00:16:37,566
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:16:37,858 --> 00:16:41,406
SPEAKER_1:  And then we have a European mission I think that's slated now and even a Chinese mission.

00:16:41,762 --> 00:16:45,406
SPEAKER_1:  might be coming along the way as well. So we might have multiple missions going to Venus, which has

00:16:45,794 --> 00:16:53,726
SPEAKER_1:  long been overlooked. I mean, apart from the Soviets, there really has been very little in the way of exploration of Venus. Certainly as compared to Mars.

00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:57,150
SPEAKER_1:  Mars has enjoyed most of the activity from NASA's.

00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,846
SPEAKER_1:  rovers and surveys.

00:16:59,266 --> 00:17:04,702
SPEAKER_1:  Mars is certainly fascinating. There's this signature of methane that has been seen there before.

00:17:05,218 --> 00:17:05,630
SPEAKER_1:  time.

00:17:06,082 --> 00:17:10,846
SPEAKER_1:  Again, there the discussion is whether that methane is a product of biology, which

00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,310
SPEAKER_1:  is possible, something that happens on the Earth.

00:17:13,538 --> 00:17:16,126
SPEAKER_1:  or whether it's some geological process that...

00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:17,150
SPEAKER_1:  We are.

00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:24,414
SPEAKER_1:  yet to fully understand could be, for example, a reservoir of methane that's trapped under the surface and is leaking out seasonally.

00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  So the nice thing about Venus is if there's...

00:17:27,362 --> 00:17:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  a giant living civilization there, it'll be.

00:17:30,626 --> 00:17:32,702
SPEAKER_0:  airborne so you can just fly through.

00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:35,742
SPEAKER_0:  and collect samples with Mars and.

00:17:36,194 --> 00:17:37,150
SPEAKER_0:  moons of

00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  Saturn and Jupiter you're gonna have to dig it

00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,518
SPEAKER_0:  dig under to find the civilizations, dead or living.

00:17:43,682 --> 00:17:49,950
SPEAKER_1:  Right. And so yeah, maybe it's easier than for Venus because certainly you can imagine just a balloon floating through the atmosphere.

00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:55,166
SPEAKER_1:  or a drone or something that would have the capability of just scooping up and sampling

00:17:55,618 --> 00:17:56,062
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:59,422
SPEAKER_1:  To dig into the surface of Mars is maybe...

00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:03,998
SPEAKER_1:  feasible-ish with, you know, especially with something like Starship that could

00:18:04,354 --> 00:18:09,790
SPEAKER_1:  launch a huge digger basically to the surface and you could just excavate away at the surface.

00:18:10,178 --> 00:18:11,774
SPEAKER_1:  but for something like Europa

00:18:12,162 --> 00:18:12,670
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:18:13,154 --> 00:18:14,302
SPEAKER_1:  We really are still.

00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,542
SPEAKER_1:  unclear about how thick the ice layer is.

00:18:16,898 --> 00:18:21,758
SPEAKER_1:  how you would melt through that huge thick layer to get to the ocean.

00:18:22,338 --> 00:18:25,086
SPEAKER_1:  and then potentially also discussions about contamination.

00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:30,366
SPEAKER_1:  The problem with looking for life in the solar system, which is different from looking for life with exoplanets.

00:18:30,722 --> 00:18:32,094
SPEAKER_1:  is that you always run the risk of.

00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,486
SPEAKER_1:  especially if you visit there, of introducing the life yourself.

00:18:36,194 --> 00:18:39,102
SPEAKER_1:  It's very difficult to completely exterminate.

00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:42,718
SPEAKER_1:  every single microbe and spore on the surface.

00:18:43,042 --> 00:18:45,758
SPEAKER_1:  of your rover or the surface of your lander.

00:18:46,178 --> 00:18:49,150
SPEAKER_1:  And so there's always a risk of introducing something. I mean...

00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:58,462
SPEAKER_1:  To some extent, there is continuous exchange of material between these planets naturally on top of that as well. And now we're sort of accelerating that process to some degree.

00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,478
SPEAKER_1:  And so if you.

00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:07,710
SPEAKER_1:  dig into Europa's surface, which probably is completely pristine, it's very unlikely there has been much exchange with the outside world.

00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,374
SPEAKER_1:  for its subsurface ocean.

00:19:10,114 --> 00:19:11,614
SPEAKER_1:  You are for the first time.

00:19:11,842 --> 00:19:13,022
SPEAKER_1:  potentially introducing.

00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,326
SPEAKER_1:  bacteria spores into that environment that

00:19:15,618 --> 00:19:19,390
SPEAKER_1:  may compete or may introduce spurious signatures for the life you're looking for.

00:19:19,778 --> 00:19:20,318
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:25,054
SPEAKER_1:  It's almost an ethical question as to how to proceed with.

00:19:25,282 --> 00:19:28,222
SPEAKER_1:  looking for life on those subsurface oceans.

00:19:28,482 --> 00:19:30,110
SPEAKER_1:  And I don't think one, we've really.

00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:33,054
SPEAKER_1:  have a good resolution for this. dialed up

00:19:33,218 --> 00:19:35,326
SPEAKER_0:  So you mean ethical in terms of concern.

00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  for the...

00:19:38,146 --> 00:19:42,663
SPEAKER_0:  like for preserving life elsewhere, not to murder it as opposed to scientific.

00:19:42,663 --> 00:19:49,566
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, we always worry about a space virus, right? Coming here or some kind of external source. And we would be the source of that.

00:19:49,858 --> 00:19:51,733
SPEAKER_1:  potential contamination or the other direction.

00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah

00:19:52,706 --> 00:19:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  I mean...

00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:54,174
SPEAKER_0:  They.

00:19:54,562 --> 00:19:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  that whatever survives in such harsh conditions.

00:19:58,626 --> 00:20:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  I'd be pretty good at.

00:20:00,994 --> 00:20:05,182
SPEAKER_0:  surviving in all conditions. It might be a little bit more resilient and robust, so I might actually.

00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  Take a ride on us.

00:20:07,234 --> 00:20:07,774
SPEAKER_0:  back home.

00:20:08,002 --> 00:20:09,150
SPEAKER_1:  Possibly, I mean...

00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:12,286
SPEAKER_1:  I'm sure that some people would be concerned about that. I think-

00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:20,158
SPEAKER_1:  We would hopefully have some containment procedures if we did sample return. Or you mean you don't even really need a sample return. These days you can-

00:20:20,738 --> 00:20:22,590
SPEAKER_1:  pretty much sounded like a little micro laboratory.

00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:27,198
SPEAKER_1:  to the planet to do all the experiments in situ and then just send them back to your planet.

00:20:27,522 --> 00:20:28,094
SPEAKER_1:  the data.

00:20:28,386 --> 00:20:35,806
SPEAKER_1:  And so I don't think this is necessary, especially for a case like that where you might have contamination concerns that you have to bring samples back.

00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:36,734
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:20:36,994 --> 00:20:45,773
SPEAKER_1:  Although probably if you brought back Europe and sushi, it would probably sell for quite a bit with the billionaires in New York City. Sushi. Yeah.

00:20:45,773 --> 00:20:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  I would love from an engineering perspective just to...

00:20:49,602 --> 00:20:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  see all the different candidates and designs for like the scooper for Venus and the scooper for

00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  Europa in

00:20:56,898 --> 00:20:57,726
SPEAKER_0:  and Mars.

00:20:58,114 --> 00:21:03,262
SPEAKER_0:  I haven't really looked deeply into how they actually, like the actual engineering of collecting the samples because

00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,534
SPEAKER_0:  That's the engineering of that.

00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  is probably essential for not either destroying life or

00:21:10,082 --> 00:21:13,278
SPEAKER_0:  or polluting it with our own microbes and so on.

00:21:13,602 --> 00:21:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  So that's an interesting engineering challenge. I usually for rovers and stuff focus on the robot on the

00:21:19,938 --> 00:21:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  sort of.

00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  mobility aspect of it on the robotics, the perception.

00:21:23,778 --> 00:21:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  and the movement and the planning and the control.

00:21:26,274 --> 00:21:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  There's probably the scooper is probably where the action is. Yeah. The microscopic.

00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  Sample Collection.

00:21:32,226 --> 00:21:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  So basically you have to first clean.

00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  your vehicle. Make sure it doesn't have any earth-like things on it.

00:21:38,818 --> 00:21:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  And then...

00:21:39,746 --> 00:21:46,110
SPEAKER_0:  You have to put it into some kind of thing that's perfectly sealed from the environment so if we bring it back or we analyze it it's not

00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:53,630
SPEAKER_0:  It's not going to bring anything else externally. Yeah, I don't know. It would be that be an interesting engineering design there.

00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,134
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean, Kirstie has been...

00:21:55,426 --> 00:21:55,934
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:21:56,258 --> 00:21:57,214
SPEAKER_1:  leaving these little.

00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,094
SPEAKER_1:  pods on the surface quite recently.

00:22:00,322 --> 00:22:01,886
SPEAKER_1:  Neat photos you can find online.

00:22:02,338 --> 00:22:04,798
SPEAKER_1:  and they kind of look like lightsaber hilts.

00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:06,622
SPEAKER_1: ...

00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:14,846
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, to me, I think I tweeted something like, you know, this weapon is your life. Like don't lose your curiosity because it's just dumping these little vials everywhere.

00:22:15,106 --> 00:22:18,750
SPEAKER_1:  And it's, yeah, it is scooping up these things and the intention is that in the future.

00:22:19,106 --> 00:22:22,174
SPEAKER_1:  there will be a sample return mission that will come and pick these up.

00:22:22,402 --> 00:22:23,038
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:22:23,938 --> 00:22:29,054
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, the engineering behind those things is so impressive. The thing that blows me away the most has been the landings.

00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:29,982
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:22:30,274 --> 00:22:36,222
SPEAKER_1:  Especially I'm trying to be a pilot at the moment. So that's the sort of, you know, watching landings has become like my pet hobby on YouTube at the moment.

00:22:36,578 --> 00:22:39,326
SPEAKER_1:  how not to do it, how to do it with different levels of.

00:22:39,618 --> 00:22:41,054
SPEAKER_1:  conditions and things.

00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,134
SPEAKER_1:  with the, you know, when you.

00:22:43,426 --> 00:22:47,518
SPEAKER_1:  Think about landing on Mars, just the light travel time effect means that there's no

00:22:48,098 --> 00:22:53,118
SPEAKER_1:  possibility of a human controlling that descent. And so you have to put all of your faith.

00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,070
SPEAKER_1:  and your trust in the.

00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:00,446
SPEAKER_1:  computer code or the AI or whatever it is that you've put on board that thing to make the correct descent.

00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,454
SPEAKER_1:  And so there's this famous.

00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:11,998
SPEAKER_1:  period called seven minutes of hell where you're basically waiting for that light travel time to come back to know whether your vehicle successfully landed on the surface of nought.

00:23:12,386 --> 00:23:13,662
SPEAKER_1:  And during that period...

00:23:13,954 --> 00:23:18,046
SPEAKER_1:  You know in your mind simultaneously that it is doing these multi-stages of

00:23:18,338 --> 00:23:18,718
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:23:18,978 --> 00:23:21,150
SPEAKER_1:  deploying its parachute, deploying the crane.

00:23:21,826 --> 00:23:25,950
SPEAKER_1:  activating its jets to come down and controlling its descent to the surface.

00:23:26,242 --> 00:23:29,438
SPEAKER_1:  And then the crane has to fly away so it doesn't accidentally hit the rover.

00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:35,006
SPEAKER_1:  And so there's a series of multi-stage points where any of them go wrong.

00:23:35,266 --> 00:23:37,374
SPEAKER_1:  You know, the whole mission could, could go awry.

00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,550
SPEAKER_1:  Um, and so the fact that

00:23:39,874 --> 00:23:40,318
SPEAKER_1:  We.

00:23:40,674 --> 00:23:42,846
SPEAKER_1:  are fairly consistently able to

00:23:43,362 --> 00:23:45,854
SPEAKER_1:  build these machines that can do this autonomously.

00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,326
SPEAKER_1:  is to me.

00:23:47,746 --> 00:23:50,750
SPEAKER_1:  one of the most impressive acts of engineering that NASA have achieved.

00:23:51,074 --> 00:23:59,070
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, the unfortunate fact about physics is the takeoff is easier than the landing. Yes, yes, and you mentioned Starship one of the.

00:23:59,554 --> 00:24:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  incredible engineering feats that you get to see as the reusable rockets that take off, they land and they land.

00:24:07,682 --> 00:24:19,646
SPEAKER_0:  using control and they do so perfectly. And sometimes when it's synchronous, it's just, it's beautiful to see. And then with Starship, you see the chopsticks that catch the ship. I mean, there's just so much incredible engineer, but you mentioned.

00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:24,094
SPEAKER_0:  Starships is somehow helpful here. So what's your hope with Starship?

00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  what kind of science might enable.

00:24:28,098 --> 00:24:28,606
SPEAKER_1:  Possibly

00:24:29,186 --> 00:24:38,622
SPEAKER_1:  There's two things. I mean, it's the launch cost itself, which is hopefully going to mean per kilogram. It's going to dramatically reduce the cost of it. It's the sort of the level, even if it's a factor of 10 higher than what Elon originally.

00:24:38,882 --> 00:24:41,982
SPEAKER_1:  I promise this is going to be a revolution for the Costa launch.

00:24:42,658 --> 00:24:44,670
SPEAKER_1:  That means you could do all sorts of things. You could launch.

00:24:44,962 --> 00:24:45,438
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:24:45,922 --> 00:24:47,998
SPEAKER_1:  large telescopes which could be...

00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:52,414
SPEAKER_1:  Basically like JWST, but you don't even have to fold them up. JWST had this whole...

00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,078
SPEAKER_1:  issue with its design that

00:24:54,466 --> 00:25:00,894
SPEAKER_1:  it's six and a half meters across. And so you have to, there's no fuselage, which is that large at the time. There is four wasn't large enough for that.

00:25:01,154 --> 00:25:04,158
SPEAKER_1:  And so they had to fold it up in this kind of complicated origami.

00:25:04,674 --> 00:25:07,038
SPEAKER_1:  And so a large part of the cost was.

00:25:07,586 --> 00:25:17,374
SPEAKER_1:  figuring out how to fold it up, testing that it unfolded correctly, repeated testing and you know, there was something like 130 fail points or something during this unfolding mechanism.

00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:20,094
SPEAKER_1:  And so all of us were holding our breath during that process.

00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:24,638
SPEAKER_1:  But if you have the ability to just launch arbitrarily large masses.

00:25:24,994 --> 00:25:27,262
SPEAKER_1:  at least comparatively compared to JVST.

00:25:27,522 --> 00:25:29,374
SPEAKER_1:  and very large mirrors into space.

00:25:29,602 --> 00:25:31,998
SPEAKER_1:  you can more or less repurpose ground-based mirrors.

00:25:32,354 --> 00:25:36,734
SPEAKER_1:  The Hubble Space Telescope mirror and the JVST mirrors are designed to be

00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:38,462
SPEAKER_1:  extremely lightweight.

00:25:39,234 --> 00:25:40,990
SPEAKER_1:  and that increased their cost significantly.

00:25:41,378 --> 00:25:45,726
SPEAKER_1:  Um, they have this kind of honeycomb design on the back to try and minimize the weight.

00:25:46,306 --> 00:25:46,910
SPEAKER_1:  If you...

00:25:47,266 --> 00:25:57,566
SPEAKER_1:  really care about weight because it's so cheap, then you could just literally grab many of the existing ground-based mirrors across task as across the world, four meter, five meter mirrors

00:25:57,826 --> 00:26:01,918
SPEAKER_1:  and just pretty much attach them to a chassis and have your own space-based telescope.

00:26:02,338 --> 00:26:07,070
SPEAKER_1:  I think the Breakthrough Foundation, for instance, is an entity that

00:26:07,682 --> 00:26:09,822
SPEAKER_1:  has been interested in doing this sort of thing.

00:26:10,178 --> 00:26:11,166
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

00:26:11,522 --> 00:26:18,590
SPEAKER_1:  That raises the prospects of having not just one WST that just, you know, WST is a fantastic resource but it's split between all of us.

00:26:18,914 --> 00:26:19,902
SPEAKER_1:  cosmologists.

00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:22,558
SPEAKER_1:  star formation, astronomers.

00:26:22,786 --> 00:26:32,190
SPEAKER_1:  those of us studying exoplanets, those of us wanting to study the ultra deep fields and the origin of the first galaxies, the expansionary of the universe, everyone has to share this resource.

00:26:32,706 --> 00:26:33,022
SPEAKER_1:  but

00:26:33,282 --> 00:26:35,806
SPEAKER_1:  we could potentially each have one.

00:26:36,226 --> 00:26:41,790
SPEAKER_1:  JDST each that is maybe just studying a handful of the brightest exoplanet stars.

00:26:42,114 --> 00:26:43,806
SPEAKER_1:  and measuring their atmospheres.

00:26:44,066 --> 00:26:45,822
SPEAKER_1:  This is important because if you.

00:26:46,242 --> 00:26:48,766
SPEAKER_1:  We talked about this planet Trappist-1e earlier.

00:26:49,634 --> 00:26:50,334
SPEAKER_1:  that planet.

00:26:50,786 --> 00:26:55,006
SPEAKER_1:  If JDBC started it and tried to look for biosignatures, by which I mean, Oxygen.

00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:57,726
SPEAKER_1:  nitrous oxide, methane.

00:26:58,178 --> 00:27:01,054
SPEAKER_1:  It would take it of order of 200.

00:27:01,282 --> 00:27:02,110
SPEAKER_1:  transits.

00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  to get even.

00:27:04,482 --> 00:27:07,422
SPEAKER_1:  very marginal, what we would call 2.5 sigma detection.

00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:10,398
SPEAKER_1:  of those, which basically nobody would believe with that.

00:27:10,882 --> 00:27:11,262
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:27:11,554 --> 00:27:16,958
SPEAKER_1:  A hundred transits, I mean, this thing transits once every six days. So you're talking about sort of four years of staring at the same star.

00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,814
SPEAKER_1:  with one telescope. The Bees am.

00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:26,206
SPEAKER_1:  breaks, but it'd be hard to schedule much else because you'll have to continuously catch each one of these transits to build up your signal to noise.

00:27:26,914 --> 00:27:34,974
SPEAKER_1:  And so, J2ST is never gonna do that. In principle, technically, J2ST could technically have the capability of just about detecting a biosignature.

00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:38,910
SPEAKER_1:  on an Earth-like planet around a non-sun-like star.

00:27:39,234 --> 00:27:42,526
SPEAKER_1:  But still, impressively, we have basically the technology to do that.

00:27:42,946 --> 00:27:46,046
SPEAKER_1:  but we simply cannot dedicate all of its time practically.

00:27:46,434 --> 00:27:51,326
SPEAKER_1:  that one resource. And so Starship opens up opportunities like that of mass producing.

00:27:51,714 --> 00:27:52,990
SPEAKER_1:  these kinds of telescopes.

00:27:53,282 --> 00:27:55,102
SPEAKER_1:  which will allow us to survey.

00:27:55,362 --> 00:27:58,782
SPEAKER_1:  life in the universe which of course is one of the grand goals of astronomy.

00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:01,662
SPEAKER_0:  I wonder if you can speak to the.

00:28:02,178 --> 00:28:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  the bureaucracy, the political battles, the scientific battles for time on the James Webb telescope.

00:28:09,122 --> 00:28:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  Listen, there must be a fascinating.

00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  process of scheduling that.

00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:18,366
SPEAKER_0:  All scientists are trying to collaborate and figure out what the most important problems are.

00:28:19,106 --> 00:28:20,670
SPEAKER_0:  and there's an interesting.

00:28:20,898 --> 00:28:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  network.

00:28:22,146 --> 00:28:25,521
SPEAKER_0:  of interfering scientific experiments probably somehow

00:28:25,521 --> 00:28:26,174
SPEAKER_1:  over.

00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:29,246
SPEAKER_1:  It's a really difficult process. I don't.

00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:33,662
SPEAKER_1:  envy the TAC that are going to have to make this decision. We call it the TAC, the Time Allocation Committee.

00:28:34,178 --> 00:28:35,262
SPEAKER_1:  that make this decision.

00:28:35,842 --> 00:28:43,902
SPEAKER_1:  Um, and I've served on these before and it's very difficult. I mean, typically for hubble, we were seeing at least 10, sometimes 20 times the number of

00:28:44,354 --> 00:28:47,742
SPEAKER_1:  Proposals for telescope time versus available telescope time.

00:28:48,354 --> 00:28:49,246
SPEAKER_1:  For GDustT,

00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,030
SPEAKER_1:  There has been one call already that has gone out.

00:28:52,322 --> 00:28:53,342
SPEAKER_1:  We call it cycle one.

00:28:53,634 --> 00:28:57,342
SPEAKER_1:  And that was oversubscribed by, I think something like six to one, seven to one.

00:28:57,826 --> 00:29:05,054
SPEAKER_1:  and the cycle two, which has just been announced fairly recently and the deadline is actually the end of this month, so my team.

00:29:05,346 --> 00:29:08,414
SPEAKER_1:  totally laser focused on writing our proposals right now.

00:29:08,866 --> 00:29:09,342
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:29:09,698 --> 00:29:13,886
SPEAKER_1:  That is expected to be much more competitive, probably more comparable to what Hub of Saw.

00:29:14,242 --> 00:29:14,846
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:16,775
SPEAKER_1:  It's hard. It's hard.

00:29:16,775 --> 00:29:18,275
SPEAKER_0:  than the second one you said already

00:29:18,275 --> 00:29:25,502
SPEAKER_1:  Because that's already more competitive than the first cycle. So I said the first cycle of James Webb was about six to one. Um, and this will probably be more like.

00:29:25,794 --> 00:29:27,669
SPEAKER_1:  20 to 1. I would expect.

00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:30,366
SPEAKER_0:  proposals by sadists and so on and it's not like...

00:29:30,882 --> 00:29:34,270
SPEAKER_0:  You can schedule at any time because if you're looking for transit times. Yeah.

00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:37,950
SPEAKER_1:  You have, you have a time critical element. Yes. Time critical element.

00:29:38,114 --> 00:29:47,358
SPEAKER_0:  And they're conflicting and non like not obvious ways because the frequency is different. The duration is different. Right. There's a cut. It's probably computational needs that are different.

00:29:47,778 --> 00:29:50,403
SPEAKER_0:  the type of sensors, the direction.

00:29:50,403 --> 00:29:51,262
SPEAKER_1:  pointing all that.

00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,798
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's hard and...

00:29:53,378 --> 00:29:55,934
SPEAKER_1:  There are certain programs like doing a deep field.

00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,302
SPEAKER_1:  study where you just more or less point the telescope.

00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:03,294
SPEAKER_1:  And that's pretty open. I mean, you're just accumulating photons. You can just point at that patch of the sky.

00:30:03,682 --> 00:30:15,710
SPEAKER_1:  whenever the telescope is not doing anything else and just get to your month, let's say a month of integration time is your goal over the lifetime of JVST. So that's maybe a little bit easier to schedule. It's harder, especially for us looking at cool worlds.

00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:17,950
SPEAKER_1:  Um, because as I said earlier, these

00:30:18,434 --> 00:30:20,702
SPEAKER_1:  plants transit very infrequently.

00:30:21,634 --> 00:30:25,438
SPEAKER_1:  So we have to wait if you're looking at the Earth transiting the Sun and alien watching us.

00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:29,182
SPEAKER_1:  they would only get one opportunity per year to do that observation.

00:30:29,602 --> 00:30:31,806
SPEAKER_1:  the transit lasts for about 12 hours.

00:30:32,162 --> 00:30:32,702
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:30:32,962 --> 00:30:33,790
SPEAKER_1:  And so if they don't...

00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:34,942
SPEAKER_1:  Get that time.

00:30:35,234 --> 00:30:37,342
SPEAKER_1:  It's hard. That's it.

00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:41,982
SPEAKER_1:  if it conflicted with another proposal that wants to use another time critical element.

00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  It's much easier for plants like these hot plants for these close-in plants.

00:30:47,202 --> 00:30:49,470
SPEAKER_1:  because they transit so frequently.

00:30:49,858 --> 00:30:52,894
SPEAKER_1:  there's maybe a hundred opportunities. And so then the tap can say.

00:30:53,122 --> 00:30:54,910
SPEAKER_1:  Okay they want 10 transits, there's 100.

00:30:55,138 --> 00:30:56,158
SPEAKER_1:  opportunities here.

00:30:56,418 --> 00:30:57,662
SPEAKER_1:  It's easier for us to give us time.

00:30:57,954 --> 00:30:58,814
SPEAKER_1:  to give them time.

00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:02,846
SPEAKER_1:  We're almost in the worst case scenario. We're proposing to look for X and means around to

00:31:03,202 --> 00:31:04,446
SPEAKER_1:  cool planets.

00:31:04,674 --> 00:31:06,110
SPEAKER_1:  And so we really only have.

00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,838
SPEAKER_1:  one bite of the cherry.

00:31:08,226 --> 00:31:08,894
SPEAKER_1:  for each one.

00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:13,726
SPEAKER_1:  And so our sales pitch has been that these are extremely precious events.

00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:14,590
SPEAKER_1:  End.

00:31:14,818 --> 00:31:16,542
SPEAKER_1:  more importantly, JWST.

00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:21,662
SPEAKER_1:  is the only telescope, the only machine humanity has ever constructed.

00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,870
SPEAKER_1:  which is capable of finding moons.

00:31:24,194 --> 00:31:25,886
SPEAKER_1:  akin to the Moon's night solar system.

00:31:26,242 --> 00:31:27,998
SPEAKER_1:  Capper can't do it, even Hubble can't do it.

00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,630
SPEAKER_1:  Genesys the first one.

00:31:30,114 --> 00:31:38,334
SPEAKER_1:  And so there is a new window to the universe because we know these moons exist. They're all over the place in the solar system. You have the moon, you have...

00:31:38,562 --> 00:31:45,342
SPEAKER_1:  Io, Callisto, Europa, Ganymede, Titan, lots of moons are fairly similar size, sort of 30% the size of the Earth.

00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:46,014
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:31:46,466 --> 00:31:48,958
SPEAKER_1:  This telescope is the first one that can find them.

00:31:49,442 --> 00:31:52,958
SPEAKER_1:  And so we're very excited about the profound implications of

00:31:53,698 --> 00:32:00,670
SPEAKER_1:  Ultimately solving this journey we're on in astronomy, which is to understand our uniqueness. We want to understand how common is the solar system. Are we?

00:32:01,058 --> 00:32:03,998
SPEAKER_1:  the way, are we the architecture that frequently

00:32:04,226 --> 00:32:05,790
SPEAKER_1:  emerges naturally.

00:32:06,082 --> 00:32:09,054
SPEAKER_1:  Or is there something special about what happened here?

00:32:09,378 --> 00:32:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  I think this is not the worst case, the best case. It's obvious. It's super rare. So you have to like, I would, so I'm, I love scheduling from a computer science perspective, that's my background.

00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:22,302
SPEAKER_0:  So algorithmically, to solve a schedule problem, I'll schedule the rarest things first.

00:32:22,882 --> 00:32:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  And obviously this is the, the JLST is the first thing that can actually detect a cool world.

00:32:28,482 --> 00:32:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  So this is a big new thing. You can show off that new thing. Happens rarely.

00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:33,543
SPEAKER_0:  Schedule it first. Schedule it first.

00:32:33,543 --> 00:32:35,793
SPEAKER_1:  You should be in the tack. This is perfect. You should be in the tack.

00:32:35,793 --> 00:32:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  I'll file my application after we're done with this. I, you know, this part of me is the OCD, part of me is the computational aspect. I love scheduling.

00:32:44,194 --> 00:32:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  a computing device because you have that kind of scheduling.

00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:49,086
SPEAKER_0:  on supercomputers, on...

00:32:49,794 --> 00:32:52,478
SPEAKER_0:  That scheduling problem is fascinating, how you prioritize.

00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:54,686
SPEAKER_0:  computational high-duty prioritized science.

00:32:54,978 --> 00:32:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  data collection.

00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  Sample collection all that kind of stuff. It's actually kind of

00:32:59,618 --> 00:33:00,958
SPEAKER_0:  kind of fascinating because data.

00:33:01,602 --> 00:33:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  in ways you expect and don't expect will unlock a lot of.

00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,238
SPEAKER_0:

00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,262
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:33:07,906 --> 00:33:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  some fascinating mysteries. And so collecting the data and doing so.

00:33:12,162 --> 00:33:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  in a way that maximizes the possibility of discovery is really interesting.

00:33:15,554 --> 00:33:16,679
SPEAKER_0:  like from a computational perspective.

00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:26,366
SPEAKER_1:  I agree. There's a real satisfaction in extracting the maximum science per unit time out of your telescope. That's the tax job.

00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,382
SPEAKER_1:  The, the tack are not.

00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:33,726
SPEAKER_1:  machines, they're not a piece of computer code. They will make their selections based off human judgment.

00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,230
SPEAKER_1:  and um

00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:41,214
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of the telescope is certainly within the field of exoplanets because it's different fields of astronomy but within the field of exoplanets.

00:33:41,698 --> 00:33:44,510
SPEAKER_1:  I think a good expectation is that most of the telescope time...

00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:45,918
SPEAKER_1:  that James was he have.

00:33:46,338 --> 00:33:48,734
SPEAKER_1:  will go towards atmospheric retrieval.

00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:53,406
SPEAKER_1:  which is sort of alluded to earlier, you know, like detecting molecules in the atmospheres.

00:33:53,762 --> 00:33:54,110
SPEAKER_1:  Not.

00:33:54,626 --> 00:34:00,542
SPEAKER_1:  biosignatures because as I said, it's really not designed to do that. It's pushing GDST probably too far to expect to do that.

00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,526
SPEAKER_1:  but it could detect, for example,

00:34:02,882 --> 00:34:07,038
SPEAKER_1:  a carbon dioxide rich atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1e. That's not a bias signature.

00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:12,830
SPEAKER_1:  But you could prove it's like a Venus in that case, or maybe like a Mars in that case. Both those have carbon dioxide rich atmospheres.

00:34:13,186 --> 00:34:13,566
SPEAKER_1:  doesn't.

00:34:14,306 --> 00:34:16,542
SPEAKER_1:  or disprove the existence of life. Either way...

00:34:16,866 --> 00:34:19,838
SPEAKER_1:  but it is our first characterization of the nature.

00:34:20,194 --> 00:34:23,774
SPEAKER_1:  of those atmospheres. Maybe we can even tell the pressure level of the temperature of those atmospheres.

00:34:24,226 --> 00:34:25,278
SPEAKER_1:  So that's very exciting.

00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:26,366
SPEAKER_1:  But um

00:34:27,202 --> 00:34:39,902
SPEAKER_1:  There's, we are competing with that. And that, I think that science is completely mind blowing and fantastic. We have a completely different objective, which is in our case, to try and look for the first evidence of these small moons around these planets.

00:34:40,226 --> 00:34:43,934
SPEAKER_1:  potentially even moons, which could be habitable, of course.

00:34:44,162 --> 00:34:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  very exciting goal.

00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:46,206
SPEAKER_1:  But...

00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:46,942
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:34:47,362 --> 00:34:49,150
SPEAKER_1:  Attack has to make a human judgement.

00:34:49,506 --> 00:34:51,870
SPEAKER_1:  essentially about which science are they most.

00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:53,214
SPEAKER_1:  excited by.

00:34:53,506 --> 00:34:55,806
SPEAKER_1:  which one has the highest promise of return.

00:34:56,162 --> 00:34:59,998
SPEAKER_1:  the most highest chance of return. And so that's hard because if you look at a

00:35:00,258 --> 00:35:01,694
SPEAKER_1:  a planetary atmosphere.

00:35:02,626 --> 00:35:05,054
SPEAKER_1:  Well, you know, most of the time the plant has an atmosphere already.

00:35:05,314 --> 00:35:10,878
SPEAKER_1:  And so there's almost a guaranteed success that you're going to learn something about the atmosphere by pointing to the UST at it

00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:12,190
SPEAKER_1:  Whereas...

00:35:12,642 --> 00:35:14,590
SPEAKER_1:  In that case, there's a harder sell.

00:35:14,978 --> 00:35:16,702
SPEAKER_1:  We are looking for something that we...

00:35:17,186 --> 00:35:19,198
SPEAKER_1:  do not know for sure exists yet or not.

00:35:19,778 --> 00:35:20,542
SPEAKER_1:  And so we are.

00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:25,246
SPEAKER_1:  pushing the telescope to do something which is inherently more risky.

00:35:25,794 --> 00:35:26,366
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, but...

00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  The existence is shown.

00:35:28,898 --> 00:35:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  already gives a deep.

00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  lesson.

00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:39,518
SPEAKER_0:  about what's out there in the universe. That means that other stars have similar types of variety as we have in our solar system.

00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  They have an eye or they have a...

00:35:41,954 --> 00:35:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  Europa and so on.

00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  which means like there's a lot of possibility.

00:35:46,658 --> 00:35:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  for icy planets, for water.

00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  for planets and moons. I mean, that's super exciting.

00:35:53,122 --> 00:35:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  because that means.

00:35:54,946 --> 00:35:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  everywhere through our galaxy and beyond.

00:35:58,658 --> 00:35:59,198
SPEAKER_0:  There is.

00:35:59,618 --> 00:36:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  Just.

00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  innumerable possibility for weird creatures.

00:36:03,714 --> 00:36:09,182
SPEAKER_1:  I agree. You don't have to convince me. I mean NASA has been on this quest.

00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,526
SPEAKER_1:  for a long time.

00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:12,254
SPEAKER_1:  and it's sometimes called Eater Earth.

00:36:12,642 --> 00:36:15,198
SPEAKER_1:  It's the frequency of Earth-like.

00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:16,830
SPEAKER_1:  Usually they say planets.

00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,718
SPEAKER_1:  in the universe. How common.

00:36:18,946 --> 00:36:19,422
SPEAKER_1:  Ah.

00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,566
SPEAKER_1:  similar to our Earth in terms of

00:36:21,826 --> 00:36:29,726
SPEAKER_1:  Ultimately, we'd like to know everything about these plants in terms of the amount of water they have, how much atmosphere they have, but for now it's kind of focused just on the size.

00:36:30,082 --> 00:36:34,398
SPEAKER_1:  and the distance from the star essentially. How often do you get similar conditions to that?

00:36:34,882 --> 00:36:37,630
SPEAKER_1:  That was Kepler's primary mission and it-

00:36:38,082 --> 00:36:42,334
SPEAKER_1:  really just kind of flirted with the answer, didn't quite get to a definitive answer.

00:36:42,914 --> 00:36:46,046
SPEAKER_1:  But I would say, look, if that's our primary goal.

00:36:46,562 --> 00:36:47,198
SPEAKER_1:  to look for.

00:36:47,522 --> 00:36:48,222
SPEAKER_1:  Earth-like.

00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,206
SPEAKER_1:  I would say worlds.

00:36:50,786 --> 00:36:52,638
SPEAKER_1:  then Moons has to be a part of that.

00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,686
SPEAKER_1:  because we know that.

00:36:55,042 --> 00:36:59,934
SPEAKER_1:  Earth-like from the capital day to the preliminary result is that Earth-like planets around sun-like stars is not

00:37:00,706 --> 00:37:03,998
SPEAKER_1:  inevitable outcome. It seems to be something like a one to 10% outcome.

00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:05,022
SPEAKER_1:  So it's not.

00:37:05,282 --> 00:37:07,358
SPEAKER_1:  particularly inevitable that happens.

00:37:07,618 --> 00:37:10,942
SPEAKER_1:  But we do often see about half of all Sunlight stars

00:37:11,266 --> 00:37:16,286
SPEAKER_1:  have either a mini Neptune, a Neptune or a Jupiter in the habitable zone of their stars.

00:37:16,546 --> 00:37:19,006
SPEAKER_1:  That's a very, very common occurrence that we see.

00:37:19,522 --> 00:37:22,558
SPEAKER_1:  yet we have no idea how often they have moons around them.

00:37:22,818 --> 00:37:24,094
SPEAKER_1:  which could also be habitable.

00:37:24,482 --> 00:37:25,086
SPEAKER_1:  And so...

00:37:25,314 --> 00:37:26,590
SPEAKER_1:  that may very well be.

00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,742
SPEAKER_1:  If even...

00:37:28,002 --> 00:37:29,054
SPEAKER_1:  One in five of them.

00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:30,046
SPEAKER_1:  has.

00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:33,086
SPEAKER_1:  an Earth-like moon or even a Mars-like moon around them.

00:37:33,442 --> 00:37:36,894
SPEAKER_1:  then there would be more habitable real estate in terms of exomoons.

00:37:37,346 --> 00:37:38,750
SPEAKER_1:  The next hope that's in the universe.

00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,030
SPEAKER_0:  Essentially...

00:37:40,514 --> 00:37:48,126
SPEAKER_0:  2X, 3X, 5X, maybe 10X, the number of habitable worlds out there in the universe. Our current estimate.

00:37:48,386 --> 00:37:53,726
SPEAKER_0:  Like the Drake equation. Absolutely. Yeah. This is a one way to increase the confidence.

00:37:54,562 --> 00:37:57,022
SPEAKER_0:  and increase the value of that parameter.

00:37:57,218 --> 00:37:59,326
SPEAKER_1:  And just know where to look. I mean, we-

00:37:59,554 --> 00:38:04,734
SPEAKER_1:  We would like to know where should we listen for techno signatures? Where should we be looking for biosignatures?

00:38:05,122 --> 00:38:05,534
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,710
SPEAKER_1:  And not only that, but what role does the-

00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:10,622
SPEAKER_1:  does the moon have in terms of its influence on the planet?

00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:16,478
SPEAKER_1:  We talked about these directly imaged telescopes earlier, these missions that want to take a photo.

00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:21,758
SPEAKER_1:  quote Carl Sagan the pale blue dot of our planet but the pale blue dot of an exoplanet

00:38:22,402 --> 00:38:24,350
SPEAKER_1:  And that's the dream to one day capture that.

00:38:24,738 --> 00:38:27,262
SPEAKER_1:  But as impressive as the resolution is that we are

00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:31,774
SPEAKER_1:  planning and conspiring to design for the future generation of telescopes to achieve that.

00:38:32,162 --> 00:38:33,502
SPEAKER_1:  Even those telescopes.

00:38:33,762 --> 00:38:39,774
SPEAKER_1:  will not have the capability of resolving the Earth and the Moon within that. It'll be a pale blue dot pixel.

00:38:40,482 --> 00:38:43,582
SPEAKER_1:  but the moon's gray, grayness will be intermixed.

00:38:43,938 --> 00:38:44,798
SPEAKER_1:  with that pixel.

00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:49,886
SPEAKER_1:  And so this is a big problem because one of the ways that we are claiming to look for life in the universe

00:38:50,306 --> 00:38:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  is a chemical DC equilibrium.

00:38:52,962 --> 00:38:57,630
SPEAKER_1:  So you see two molecules that just shouldn't be there. They normally react with each other.

00:38:57,922 --> 00:39:01,438
SPEAKER_1:  or even one molecule that's just too reactive to be hanging around the atmosphere by itself.

00:39:01,794 --> 00:39:02,494
SPEAKER_1:  So if you had.

00:39:02,818 --> 00:39:05,118
SPEAKER_1:  oxygen and methane hanging out together.

00:39:05,442 --> 00:39:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  those would normally react fairly easily.

00:39:08,162 --> 00:39:11,998
SPEAKER_1:  And so if you detected those two molecules in your pale blue dot spectra,

00:39:12,226 --> 00:39:16,830
SPEAKER_1:  But okay, we have evidence for life. Something's metabolizing on this planet.

00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:17,758
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:21,150
SPEAKER_1:  However, the challenge is what if that moon was Titan?

00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,134
SPEAKER_1:  Titan has a methane rich atmosphere.

00:39:23,746 --> 00:39:24,990
SPEAKER_1:  And what if the pale blue dot?

00:39:25,346 --> 00:39:27,294
SPEAKER_1:  was in fact a plant devoid of life.

00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:28,734
SPEAKER_1:  but it had oxygen.

00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:30,014
SPEAKER_1:  because of water.

00:39:30,306 --> 00:39:33,982
SPEAKER_1:  undergoing this photolysis reaction splitting into oxygen hydrogen separately

00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,678
SPEAKER_1:  So then you have all of the...

00:39:36,098 --> 00:39:39,038
SPEAKER_1:  hallmarks of what we would claim to be life.

00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:40,638
SPEAKER_1:  Through it all you attract.

00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:43,262
SPEAKER_1:  It was just a moon that was deceiving you.

00:39:43,874 --> 00:39:44,318
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

00:39:45,122 --> 00:39:48,414
SPEAKER_1:  We are never going to, we never going to, I would claim really understand.

00:39:49,026 --> 00:39:49,502
SPEAKER_1:  THE END

00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:54,110
SPEAKER_1:  or complete this quest of looking for life by signatures in the universe.

00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:55,326
SPEAKER_1:  Unless we...

00:39:56,066 --> 00:39:59,966
SPEAKER_1:  have a deep knowledge of the prevalence and role that moons have.

00:40:00,386 --> 00:40:03,806
SPEAKER_1:  They may even affect the habitability of the planets themselves, because I rain moon.

00:40:04,322 --> 00:40:05,182
SPEAKER_1:  Frequently large.

00:40:05,538 --> 00:40:09,438
SPEAKER_1:  By mass ratio, it's the largest moon in the solar system. It's a 1% mass moon.

00:40:09,986 --> 00:40:12,926
SPEAKER_1:  I feel like at Jupiter's moons I like 10 to the power of minus 4, much smaller.

00:40:13,314 --> 00:40:16,702
SPEAKER_1:  So our own moon seems to stabilize the obliquity of our planet.

00:40:16,994 --> 00:40:18,334
SPEAKER_1:  It gives rise to tides.

00:40:18,786 --> 00:40:22,398
SPEAKER_1:  Especially early on when the moon was closer those ties would have covered entire continents.

00:40:22,818 --> 00:40:23,838
SPEAKER_1:  And there's those.

00:40:24,418 --> 00:40:29,790
SPEAKER_1:  rock pools that would have been scattered across the entire plateau may have been the origin of life on our planet.

00:40:30,274 --> 00:40:34,142
SPEAKER_1:  the moon forming impact may have stripped a significant fraction lithosphere.

00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:34,942
SPEAKER_1:  of the Earth.

00:40:35,298 --> 00:40:39,166
SPEAKER_1:  which without a plate tectonics may not have been possible. It would have had a stagnant lid.

00:40:39,426 --> 00:40:42,686
SPEAKER_1:  because there was just too much lithosphere stuck on the top of the planet.

00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:43,614
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

00:40:43,906 --> 00:40:44,478
SPEAKER_1:  There are-

00:40:45,122 --> 00:40:48,350
SPEAKER_1:  speculative reasons, but intriguing reasons as to why

00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:49,790
SPEAKER_1:  A large moon?

00:40:50,498 --> 00:40:51,230
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe.

00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:56,990
SPEAKER_1:  Not just important, but central to the question of having the conditions necessary.

00:40:57,218 --> 00:40:57,982
SPEAKER_1:  for life. So.

00:40:58,242 --> 00:41:00,606
SPEAKER_1:  Moons can be habitable in their own right?

00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,430
SPEAKER_1:  but they can also...

00:41:02,818 --> 00:41:04,126
SPEAKER_1:  play significant influence.

00:41:04,578 --> 00:41:06,462
SPEAKER_1:  on the habitability of the planets they orbit.

00:41:06,946 --> 00:41:07,966
SPEAKER_1:  And further.

00:41:08,386 --> 00:41:08,990
SPEAKER_1:  They will.

00:41:09,474 --> 00:41:12,286
SPEAKER_1:  surely interfere with our attempts to detect life.

00:41:12,994 --> 00:41:14,078
SPEAKER_1:  remotely from afar.

00:41:15,138 --> 00:41:20,958
SPEAKER_0:  So taking a tangent upon a tangent, you've written about binary planets.

00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:22,654
SPEAKER_0:  What's...

00:41:22,978 --> 00:41:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  and that they're surprisingly common.

00:41:26,882 --> 00:41:28,734
SPEAKER_0:  or they might be surprisingly common.

00:41:29,826 --> 00:41:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  What's the difference between a large moon and binary planets? What are binary planets?

00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  What's interesting to say here about giant rocks flying to space and orbiting each other.

00:41:40,258 --> 00:41:41,758
SPEAKER_1:  The thing that's interesting about binary...

00:41:42,018 --> 00:41:44,254
SPEAKER_1:  Objects is that they're very common in the universe.

00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:46,206
SPEAKER_1:  Binary stars are everywhere.

00:41:46,562 --> 00:41:50,270
SPEAKER_1:  the majority of stars seem to live in binary systems.

00:41:50,722 --> 00:41:51,198
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:58,270
SPEAKER_1:  When we look at the outer edges of the solar system, we see binary Kuiper belt objects all the time, asteroids basically bound to one another.

00:41:58,914 --> 00:42:03,070
SPEAKER_1:  Pluto-Sharon is kind of an example of that. It's a 10% mass ratio system.

00:42:03,522 --> 00:42:07,294
SPEAKER_1:  It almost is by many definitions a binary planet, but now it's a...

00:42:07,586 --> 00:42:08,510
SPEAKER_1:  Dwarf Pirates so.

00:42:08,738 --> 00:42:10,622
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. I don't know when you call that now.

00:42:11,074 --> 00:42:14,942
SPEAKER_1:  But we know that the universe likes to make things in pairs.

00:42:15,426 --> 00:42:16,126
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:42:16,482 --> 00:42:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  So you're saying our son.

00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  is an in cell.

00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  It's looking. So most things are dating, they're in relationships and ours is alone.

00:42:25,538 --> 00:42:26,814
SPEAKER_1:  It's not a complete-

00:42:27,106 --> 00:42:29,758
SPEAKER_1:  Freak of the universe to be alone, but it is.

00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:37,982
SPEAKER_1:  It's more common for Sun-like stars. If you count up all the Sun-like stars in the universe, about half of the Sun-like star systems are in binary or trinary systems.

00:42:38,242 --> 00:42:39,518
SPEAKER_1:  and the other half a single.

00:42:39,842 --> 00:42:42,302
SPEAKER_1:  But because those binaries are two or three stars...

00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:43,710
SPEAKER_1:  then cumulatively.

00:42:44,002 --> 00:42:47,646
SPEAKER_1:  maybe like a third of all Sunlight Stars are single. I'm trying hard.

00:42:48,258 --> 00:42:50,883
SPEAKER_0:  to not anthropomorphize the relationship.

00:42:50,883 --> 00:42:54,633
SPEAKER_1:  start off with each other. Yeah. The triplets. The triplets. Yeah.

00:42:54,633 --> 00:42:57,758
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I've met those folks also.

00:42:58,018 --> 00:43:03,518
SPEAKER_0:  So is there something interesting to learn about the habitability, the how that affects the probability of.

00:43:04,002 --> 00:43:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  habitable worlds.

00:43:05,698 --> 00:43:08,190
SPEAKER_0:  when they kind of couple up like that in those different ways

00:43:08,546 --> 00:43:11,102
SPEAKER_1:  It depends what we're talking about the stars and planets. Sunny.

00:43:11,426 --> 00:43:15,134
SPEAKER_1:  If stars couple up, that has a big influence on the habitability.

00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:15,966
SPEAKER_1:  um...

00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:23,934
SPEAKER_1:  Of course, this is very famous from Star Wars, Tatooine in Star Wars is a binary star system and you have Luke Skywalker looking at the sunset and seeing two stars come down.

00:43:24,386 --> 00:43:26,878
SPEAKER_1:  And for years we thought that was.

00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:30,334
SPEAKER_1:  purely a product of George Lucas's incredibly creative mind.

00:43:30,786 --> 00:43:31,646
SPEAKER_1:  and we

00:43:32,578 --> 00:43:38,078
SPEAKER_1:  didn't think that planets would exist around binary star systems. It seems like too tumultuous an environment.

00:43:38,562 --> 00:43:39,006
SPEAKER_1:  for.

00:43:39,394 --> 00:43:43,646
SPEAKER_1:  a quiescent planetary disk, circumstellar disk, to form planets.

00:43:43,938 --> 00:43:44,254
SPEAKER_1:  from.

00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:45,758
SPEAKER_1:  And yet...

00:43:46,018 --> 00:43:46,622
SPEAKER_1:  One of the.

00:43:46,946 --> 00:43:48,798
SPEAKER_1:  astounding discoveries from Kepler.

00:43:49,122 --> 00:43:50,718
SPEAKER_1:  was that these appear to be quite common.

00:43:51,106 --> 00:43:55,550
SPEAKER_1:  In fact, as far as we can tell, they're just as common around binary stars as singular stars.

00:43:56,002 --> 00:44:00,382
SPEAKER_1:  The only caveat to that is that you don't get plants close into binary stars.

00:44:00,642 --> 00:44:03,550
SPEAKER_1:  they have like a clearance region in on the inside.

00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:04,478
SPEAKER_1:  Webhaz.

00:44:04,706 --> 00:44:06,878
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe they form there, but they don't last.

00:44:07,618 --> 00:44:09,118
SPEAKER_1:  they are dynamically unstable.

00:44:09,474 --> 00:44:10,238
SPEAKER_1:  in that zone.

00:44:10,754 --> 00:44:14,878
SPEAKER_1:  But once you get out to about the distance that the Earth orbits the sun, we're even a little bit closer in.

00:44:15,202 --> 00:44:17,726
SPEAKER_1:  you start to find planets emerging.

00:44:18,178 --> 00:44:22,782
SPEAKER_1:  And so that's the right distance for liquid water, that's the right distance for potentially life on those parts.

00:44:23,042 --> 00:44:26,622
SPEAKER_1:  And so there may very well be plenty of habitable planets around the binary stars.

00:44:27,074 --> 00:44:31,326
SPEAKER_1:  Binary planets is a little bit different. Binary planets, I don't think we have, um,

00:44:31,906 --> 00:44:33,342
SPEAKER_1:  any serious connection?

00:44:33,794 --> 00:44:34,174
SPEAKER_1:  of

00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:36,542
SPEAKER_1:  to client banarity to habitability.

00:44:36,866 --> 00:44:42,910
SPEAKER_1:  Certainly when we investigated it, that wasn't our drive, that this is somehow the solution to life in the universe or anything.

00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:47,134
SPEAKER_1:  It was really just a, like all good science questions, a curiosity driven.

00:44:47,362 --> 00:44:47,806
SPEAKER_1:  question.

00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  What's the dynamic? Are they legit orbiting each other?

00:44:51,042 --> 00:44:52,917
SPEAKER_0:  as they orbit the...

00:44:52,917 --> 00:44:55,838
SPEAKER_1:  the star. So the formation mechanism proposed here.

00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:58,078
SPEAKER_1:  because it is very difficult to form.

00:44:58,498 --> 00:44:59,006
SPEAKER_1:  to.

00:44:59,298 --> 00:45:04,638
SPEAKER_1:  protoplanets close to each other like this. They would generally merge within the disk, and so that's why you normally get single planets.

00:45:05,026 --> 00:45:08,542
SPEAKER_1:  But you could have something like Jupiter and Saturn form at separate distances.

00:45:09,058 --> 00:45:12,190
SPEAKER_1:  they could dynamically be scattered in towards one another.

00:45:12,514 --> 00:45:16,126
SPEAKER_1:  and basically not quite collide, but have a very close on encounter.

00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  Now because uh...

00:45:18,146 --> 00:45:20,318
SPEAKER_1:  the tidal forces increase dramatically.

00:45:20,546 --> 00:45:22,782
SPEAKER_1:  as the distance decreases between two objects.

00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:25,630
SPEAKER_1:  the tides can actually dissipate the kinetic energy.

00:45:25,922 --> 00:45:28,222
SPEAKER_1:  and bring them bound into one another.

00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:29,086
SPEAKER_1:  So.

00:45:29,442 --> 00:45:30,110
SPEAKER_1:  That seems...

00:45:30,626 --> 00:45:37,694
SPEAKER_1:  When you first hear that, you think, well, that seems fairly contrived that you'd have the conditions just right to get these ties to cause a capture.

00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:42,174
SPEAKER_1:  Numerical simulations have shown that about 10% of planet-planet encounters

00:45:42,978 --> 00:45:47,486
SPEAKER_1:  are shown to produce something like binoplanets, which is a startling prediction.

00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:48,414
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:45:48,834 --> 00:45:53,118
SPEAKER_1:  And so that seems at odds with naively the exoplanet catalog for which we know of.

00:45:53,762 --> 00:45:55,390
SPEAKER_1:  So far, no binoplasts.

00:45:55,810 --> 00:46:00,798
SPEAKER_1:  And we propose one of the resolutions to this might be that the binary planets are just incredibly difficult to detect.

00:46:01,122 --> 00:46:02,750
SPEAKER_1:  which is also counterintuitive.

00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:03,934
SPEAKER_1:  because

00:46:04,162 --> 00:46:08,798
SPEAKER_1:  Remember how they form is through this title mechanism. And so they form extremely close to each other.

00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:14,494
SPEAKER_1:  So the distance that Io is away from Jupiter, just a few planetary radii, they're almost touching one another.

00:46:14,786 --> 00:46:17,694
SPEAKER_1:  and they're just tightly locked facing each other for eternity.

00:46:18,114 --> 00:46:19,710
SPEAKER_1:  And so in that configuration...

00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:22,430
SPEAKER_1:  as it transits across the star, it kind of looks like...

00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:27,454
SPEAKER_1:  You can't really resolve this two planets. It just looks like one planet to you that's going across the star.

00:46:27,714 --> 00:46:31,134
SPEAKER_1:  The temporal resolution of the data is rarely good enough to distinguish that.

00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:33,278
SPEAKER_1:  And so you'd see one transit.

00:46:33,634 --> 00:46:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  but in fact it's two planets very close together.

00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:37,470
SPEAKER_1:  which are transiting at once.

00:46:37,826 --> 00:46:41,054
SPEAKER_1:  And so yeah, we wrote a paper just recently where we developed.

00:46:41,378 --> 00:46:45,470
SPEAKER_1:  some techniques to try and get around this problem and hopefully provide a tool.

00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:48,583
SPEAKER_1:  where we could finally look for these plants.

00:46:48,583 --> 00:46:50,833
SPEAKER_0:  of detection of these finds when they're so close.

00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:52,446
SPEAKER_1:  our focus was how do you

00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:55,774
SPEAKER_1:  How do you get around this merging problem? So be like, welcome to the tyres Molly, so you're getting it.

00:46:56,322 --> 00:46:57,502
SPEAKER_1:  whether they're out there or not.

00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:01,566
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, we don't know. We were planning to do a search for them.

00:47:01,922 --> 00:47:08,510
SPEAKER_1:  But it remains an open question. And I think just one of those fun astrophysics curiosities questions, whether

00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:15,326
SPEAKER_1:  binary planets exist in the universe. Cause then you know, you have binary earths, you could have binary Neptune, all sorts of wild stuff that

00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:17,886
SPEAKER_1:  would you know float the sci-fi imagination

00:47:17,986 --> 00:47:19,646
SPEAKER_0:  I wonder what the physics...

00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,142
SPEAKER_0:  Binary Planet feels like.

00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:23,422
SPEAKER_0:  It might be trivial.

00:47:23,746 --> 00:47:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  I have to think about that.

00:47:25,314 --> 00:47:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  I wonder if there's some interesting dynamics. Make it feel multiple.

00:47:28,898 --> 00:47:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  or would gravity feel different at different parts of the surface of the sphere when there's another large sphere?

00:47:34,274 --> 00:47:36,126
SPEAKER_1:  That's it. Yeah. I think that the.

00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:37,182
SPEAKER_1:  force would be.

00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:41,534
SPEAKER_1:  fairly similar because the shape of the object would deform.

00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:46,430
SPEAKER_1:  to a flat geopotential, essentially a uniform geopotential, but it would lead to a...

00:47:46,658 --> 00:47:47,454
SPEAKER_1:  distorted.

00:47:47,714 --> 00:47:50,398
SPEAKER_1:  shape for the two objects. I think they'd become ellipsoids.

00:47:50,786 --> 00:47:51,582
SPEAKER_1:  facing one another.

00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:54,174
SPEAKER_1:  Um, so it would be pretty wild.

00:47:54,562 --> 00:48:00,990
SPEAKER_1:  When you, you know, people like flat earth or spherical earth, you fly from space and you see a football-shaped earth. Yeah. That's your own planet.

00:48:01,314 --> 00:48:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  Finally, there's proof and I wonder how difficult it'd be to travel from one to the other.

00:48:05,986 --> 00:48:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  because you have to overcome the one.

00:48:09,026 --> 00:48:11,422
SPEAKER_0:  No, it might be kind of easy.

00:48:12,194 --> 00:48:17,502
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean, they're so close to each other that helps and I think the most critical factor would be how massive is the planet?

00:48:17,858 --> 00:48:22,878
SPEAKER_1:  That's always, I mean, one of the challenges with escaping paths, there was a fun paper when my colleagues wrote.

00:48:23,266 --> 00:48:29,054
SPEAKER_1:  that suggested that super-earth planets may be inescapable. If you're a civilization that were born on a super-earth,

00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:31,262
SPEAKER_1:  The surface gravity is so high.

00:48:31,714 --> 00:48:33,758
SPEAKER_1:  that the chemical potential energy

00:48:34,178 --> 00:48:37,694
SPEAKER_1:  of hydrogen or methane, whatever fuel you're using.

00:48:38,018 --> 00:48:38,782
SPEAKER_1:  Simply.

00:48:39,266 --> 00:48:42,654
SPEAKER_1:  is at odds with the gravity of the planet itself.

00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:44,702
SPEAKER_1:  And so you would, you know.

00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:50,878
SPEAKER_1:  Current rockets, I'm not sure with the fraction, but maybe like 90% of the rocket is fuel or something by mass. These things would have to be...

00:48:51,138 --> 00:48:55,550
SPEAKER_1:  Um, like the size of the, the geezer pyramids of fuel with just a tiny.

00:48:55,778 --> 00:48:58,878
SPEAKER_1:  tip on the top in order just to escape that planetary atmosphere.

00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:01,854
SPEAKER_1:  And so it has been argued that if you live on a super earth.

00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:08,574
SPEAKER_1:  You may be forced to live there forever. There may be no escape unless you invent a space elevator or something, but then...

00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:13,662
SPEAKER_1:  How do we even build the infrastructure and space to do something like that in the absence of...

00:49:13,922 --> 00:49:15,230
SPEAKER_1:  successful rocket program.

00:49:15,714 --> 00:49:19,614
SPEAKER_1:  And so the more and more we look at our earth and think about

00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:21,310
SPEAKER_1:  the sorts of problems we're facing.

00:49:22,498 --> 00:49:25,118
SPEAKER_1:  the more you see things about the earth which make it.

00:49:25,602 --> 00:49:29,726
SPEAKER_1:  ideally suited in so many regards. It's almost spooky, right? That we...

00:49:29,986 --> 00:49:33,086
SPEAKER_1:  not only live on a planet which has the right conditions for life

00:49:33,538 --> 00:49:35,198
SPEAKER_1:  for intelligent life, for sustained.

00:49:35,554 --> 00:49:40,798
SPEAKER_1:  fossil fuel industry just happens to be in the ground. We have plenty of fossil fuels to get our industrial revolution going.

00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:45,630
SPEAKER_1:  but also the chemical energy contained within those fossil fuels.

00:49:45,986 --> 00:49:50,846
SPEAKER_1:  and hydrogen and other fuels is sufficient that we have the ability to escape our plant tree.

00:49:51,138 --> 00:49:52,702
SPEAKER_1:  atmosphere and plantar gravity.

00:49:52,994 --> 00:49:53,950
SPEAKER_1:  to have a space program.

00:49:54,402 --> 00:49:56,542
SPEAKER_1:  And we also happen to have a celestial body.

00:49:56,898 --> 00:49:58,302
SPEAKER_1:  which is just within reach.

00:49:58,562 --> 00:49:58,974
SPEAKER_1:  The Moon.

00:49:59,682 --> 00:50:03,358
SPEAKER_1:  which doesn't also necessarily have to be true. Were the moon not there?

00:50:03,842 --> 00:50:06,014
SPEAKER_1:  what effect would that have had on a...

00:50:06,242 --> 00:50:08,158
SPEAKER_1:  aspirations of a space program.

00:50:08,482 --> 00:50:12,350
SPEAKER_1:  In the 1960s, would there have ever been a space race to Mars or to Venus?

00:50:12,674 --> 00:50:17,854
SPEAKER_1:  It's a much harder, certainly for a human program, that seems almost impossible with 1960s technology to imagine.

00:50:18,114 --> 00:50:19,239
SPEAKER_1:  Have a come to fruition.

00:50:19,239 --> 00:50:21,022
SPEAKER_0:  is if somebody constructed a set of.

00:50:21,826 --> 00:50:24,286
SPEAKER_0:  challenging obstacles before us.

00:50:24,642 --> 00:50:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  challenging problems to solve.

00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,582
SPEAKER_0:  They're challenging.

00:50:28,034 --> 00:50:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  but they're doable.

00:50:29,186 --> 00:50:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  And there's a sequence of them.

00:50:30,466 --> 00:50:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  Gravity is very difficult to overcome.

00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  but we have given the size of Earth.

00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,630
SPEAKER_0:  It's not so bad that we can still actually.

00:50:37,858 --> 00:50:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  construct propulsion systems that can escape it.

00:50:40,066 --> 00:50:40,382
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:42,206
SPEAKER_1:  And the same with climate change, perhaps. I mean-

00:50:42,562 --> 00:50:45,630
SPEAKER_1:  climate change is the next major problem facing our civilization.

00:50:46,306 --> 00:50:47,678
SPEAKER_1:  But we know.

00:50:48,066 --> 00:50:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  It is technically surmountable.

00:50:49,954 --> 00:50:51,198
SPEAKER_1:  You know, it's a...

00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:55,870
SPEAKER_1:  It does seem sometimes like there has been a series of challenges laid out.

00:50:56,162 --> 00:50:56,766
SPEAKER_1:  to

00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:00,702
SPEAKER_1:  progress towards a mature civilization that can one day.

00:51:01,122 --> 00:51:02,526
SPEAKER_1:  perhaps expand to the stars.

00:51:02,946 --> 00:51:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  I'm a little more concerned about nuclear weapons, AI and

00:51:06,914 --> 00:51:10,289
SPEAKER_0:  uh... uh... natural or artificial pandemics but yes

00:51:10,289 --> 00:51:22,270
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, plenty of milestones that we need to cross. And we can argue about the severity of each of them, but there is no doubt that we live in a world that has serious challenges that-

00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:24,510
SPEAKER_1:  are pushing our intellects in our will.

00:51:24,802 --> 00:51:26,206
SPEAKER_1:  to the limit of.

00:51:27,522 --> 00:51:31,006
SPEAKER_1:  whether we're really ready to progress to the next stage of our development.

00:51:31,426 --> 00:51:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  So thank you for taking the tangent and there'll be a million more, but can we step back to Kepler?

00:51:36,514 --> 00:51:37,886
SPEAKER_0:  1625B.

00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:39,678
SPEAKER_0:  What is it? End

00:51:39,906 --> 00:51:42,526
SPEAKER_0:  You've talked about this kind of journey, this.

00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  effort to.

00:51:44,738 --> 00:51:45,534
SPEAKER_0:  Discover.

00:51:45,922 --> 00:51:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  uh... exo moons

00:51:47,522 --> 00:51:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  So moons out there or small.

00:51:50,722 --> 00:51:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  cool objects out there.

00:51:52,418 --> 00:51:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  Where does that effort stand and what is coupler 1625B?

00:51:56,418 --> 00:51:57,214
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean, I.

00:51:57,506 --> 00:52:00,894
SPEAKER_1:  been searching for maximum means for most of my professional career. And I think.

00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:02,718
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of my colleagues think I'm...

00:52:03,202 --> 00:52:03,614
SPEAKER_1:  kind of.

00:52:04,258 --> 00:52:07,358
SPEAKER_1:  it crazy to still be doing it, you know, after.

00:52:08,674 --> 00:52:14,942
SPEAKER_1:  After five years of not finding anything, I think most people would probably try doing something else. I even had people say that to me. They said,

00:52:15,266 --> 00:52:19,710
SPEAKER_1:  professors and I remember a cocktail party took me to the side, an MIT professor, and he said

00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:20,606
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:52:21,218 --> 00:52:30,430
SPEAKER_1:  You know, you should just look, look for hot Jupiters. They're everywhere. It's really, you can write PAPUS. That's so easy to find. I was like, yeah, but hot Jupiters just.

00:52:31,074 --> 00:52:33,822
SPEAKER_1:  They're not interesting to me. I want to do something that I feel.

00:52:34,242 --> 00:52:35,102
SPEAKER_1:  intellectually.

00:52:35,714 --> 00:52:40,638
SPEAKER_1:  pushes me to the edge and is maybe a contribution that not no one else could do, but

00:52:40,962 --> 00:52:42,014
SPEAKER_1:  maybe a little bit, maybe or maybe a little bit maybe more to add to as a

00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:50,174
SPEAKER_1:  is not certainly the thing that anybody could do. I don't wanna just be the first to something for the sake of being first. I wanna do something that feels like meaningful.

00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:53,854
SPEAKER_1:  intellectual contribution to our society. And so...

00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:57,982
SPEAKER_1:  You know, this exomemon problem has been haunting me for years to try and solve this.

00:52:58,370 --> 00:52:58,718
SPEAKER_1:  Now.

00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:01,150
SPEAKER_1:  As I said, we looked for years and years using Kepler.

00:53:01,954 --> 00:53:03,966
SPEAKER_1:  and the closest we ever got was just a hint.

00:53:04,354 --> 00:53:09,342
SPEAKER_1:  for this one star, Kepler-1625, has a Jupiter-like planet in orbit of it.

00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:16,286
SPEAKER_1:  and that Jupiter-like planet is on a 287 day period. So it's almost the same distance as the Earth around the Sun.

00:53:16,642 --> 00:53:17,438
SPEAKER_1:  but for Jupiter.

00:53:17,954 --> 00:53:18,398
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:53:19,138 --> 00:53:28,094
SPEAKER_1:  So that was already unusual. I don't think people realize that jupiter-like planets are quite rare in the universe. Certainly many nap tunes and nap tunes are extremely common.

00:53:28,578 --> 00:53:34,759
SPEAKER_1:  But Jupiter's only about 10% of Sun-like stars have Jupiters around them as far as we can tell. When you say Jupiter,

00:53:34,759 --> 00:53:35,509
SPEAKER_0:  which aspect.

00:53:35,509 --> 00:53:37,278
SPEAKER_1:  of Jupiter. So, it's mass.

00:53:37,602 --> 00:53:40,926
SPEAKER_1:  and it's a major access. So anything beyond about.

00:53:41,282 --> 00:53:43,838
SPEAKER_1:  half an AU, so half the distance of the Earth and the Sun.

00:53:44,162 --> 00:53:48,638
SPEAKER_1:  and something of order of a tenth of a Jupiter mass, so that's the mass of Saturn.

00:53:49,058 --> 00:53:52,894
SPEAKER_1:  up to say 10 Jupiter masses, which is basically where you start to get to brown dwarfs.

00:53:53,378 --> 00:53:59,198
SPEAKER_1:  those types of objects appear to be somewhat unusual. Most solar systems do not have Jupiters, which

00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:01,246
SPEAKER_1:  is really interesting because

00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:04,318
SPEAKER_1:  Jupiter again, like the moon, seems to have been.

00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:08,510
SPEAKER_1:  a pivotal character in the story of the development of our solar system.

00:54:08,866 --> 00:54:11,262
SPEAKER_1:  perhaps especially having a large influence on the development of

00:54:11,554 --> 00:54:16,158
SPEAKER_1:  the late heavy bombardment and the rate of asteroid impacts that we receive and things like this.

00:54:16,866 --> 00:54:20,158
SPEAKER_1:  Anyway, to come back to 1625, this juped-like planet...

00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:25,566
SPEAKER_1:  Um, had a hint of, of something in the data. But what I mean by that is when we looked at the transit.

00:54:25,954 --> 00:54:27,294
SPEAKER_1:  We got the familiar.

00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:30,686
SPEAKER_1:  decrease in light that we always see when a plant truss in front of the star.

00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:34,334
SPEAKER_1:  But we saw something extra just on the edges. We saw some extra.

00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:36,158
SPEAKER_1:  dips around the outside.

00:54:37,058 --> 00:54:39,262
SPEAKER_1:  It was right at the hairy edge of detectability.

00:54:39,682 --> 00:54:40,542
SPEAKER_1:  We didn't believe it.

00:54:40,866 --> 00:54:41,918
SPEAKER_1:  because...

00:54:42,402 --> 00:54:44,382
SPEAKER_1:  I think one of the challenges of

00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:46,462
SPEAKER_1:  looking for something for 10 years.

00:54:46,914 --> 00:54:51,934
SPEAKER_1:  is that you become your own greatest skeptic. And no matter what you're shown, you're always.

00:54:52,354 --> 00:54:53,022
SPEAKER_1:  thinking I've been.

00:54:53,314 --> 00:54:56,766
SPEAKER_1:  It's like falling in love so many times and it not working out.

00:54:56,994 --> 00:54:57,502
SPEAKER_1:  You.

00:54:58,530 --> 00:54:59,966
SPEAKER_1:  convince yourself it's never gonna be.

00:55:00,226 --> 00:55:01,182
SPEAKER_1:  It's never going to happen.

00:55:01,474 --> 00:55:09,086
SPEAKER_1:  Not for me, you know, this just isn't, this isn't going to happen. And so I saw that and I didn't really believe it because I didn't dare let myself believe it.

00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,198
SPEAKER_1:  but being a good scientist.

00:55:11,778 --> 00:55:13,758
SPEAKER_1:  We knew we had an obligation to.

00:55:14,018 --> 00:55:14,526
SPEAKER_1:  publish it.

00:55:14,914 --> 00:55:18,782
SPEAKER_1:  to talk about the result and to follow it up and to try and resolve what was going on.

00:55:19,586 --> 00:55:22,846
SPEAKER_1:  So we asked for Hubble Space Telescript time, which was...

00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  awarded in that case that we were one of those lucky 20 that got telescope time.

00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:31,038
SPEAKER_1:  and we stared at it for about 40 hours continuously.

00:55:31,842 --> 00:55:33,086
SPEAKER_1:  And...

00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:40,702
SPEAKER_1:  provide some context, the dip that we saw on the Capidator corresponding to a Neptune sized moon around a Jupiter sized planet which

00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:43,230
SPEAKER_1:  was another reason why I was sceptical, that-

00:55:43,778 --> 00:55:46,238
SPEAKER_1:  We don't have that in the solar system. That seems so strange.

00:55:46,882 --> 00:55:48,446
SPEAKER_1:  And then when we got the Hubble data.

00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:52,094
SPEAKER_1:  Seem to confirm exactly that there was.

00:55:52,546 --> 00:55:57,214
SPEAKER_1:  two really striking pieces of evidence in the data that suggested this moon was there.

00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:58,366
SPEAKER_1:  Another wizard.

00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:02,462
SPEAKER_1:  fairly clear second dip in light, pretty clearly resolved by Hubble.

00:56:02,722 --> 00:56:04,254
SPEAKER_1:  It was about a five sigma detection.

00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:07,326
SPEAKER_1:  And on top of that, we could see the planet.

00:56:07,682 --> 00:56:13,278
SPEAKER_1:  didn't transit when it should have done. It actually transited earlier than we expected it to, about 20 minutes or so.

00:56:13,794 --> 00:56:18,526
SPEAKER_1:  And so that's a hallmark of a gravitational interaction between the planet and the moon. We actually expected that.

00:56:18,914 --> 00:56:21,886
SPEAKER_1:  You can also expect that if the moon transits after the planet...

00:56:22,562 --> 00:56:25,342
SPEAKER_1:  then the planet should come in earlier than expected.

00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:30,238
SPEAKER_1:  because the barycenter, the center of mass, lives between the two of them. Kind of like another—

00:56:30,562 --> 00:56:31,742
SPEAKER_1:  balancing arm between them.

00:56:32,418 --> 00:56:35,006
SPEAKER_1:  And so we saw that as well. So the face signature matched up.

00:56:35,554 --> 00:56:38,494
SPEAKER_1:  The mass of the Moon was measured to be Neptune mass.

00:56:39,106 --> 00:56:43,326
SPEAKER_1:  and the size of the moon was measured to be Neptune radius. And so everything just.

00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:44,286
SPEAKER_1:  Really?

00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:45,438
SPEAKER_1:  lined up.

00:56:45,762 --> 00:56:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  And, um...

00:56:47,202 --> 00:56:49,790
SPEAKER_1:  We spent months and months trying to kill it.

00:56:50,498 --> 00:56:52,542
SPEAKER_1:  This is my strategy for anything interesting.

00:56:53,058 --> 00:56:56,830
SPEAKER_1:  We just try to throw the kitchen sink at it and say, we must be tricked by something.

00:56:57,282 --> 00:57:05,950
SPEAKER_1:  And so we tried looking at the centroid motion of the telescope, but the different wavelength channels have been observed, the pixel level information.

00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:08,382
SPEAKER_1:  And no matter what we did, we just couldn't get rid of it.

00:57:08,866 --> 00:57:10,302
SPEAKER_1:  And so we...

00:57:10,626 --> 00:57:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  submit it to science. And I think at the time, science, which is one of the top journals said to us, would you mind calling your paper, discovery of an exomoon?

00:57:18,786 --> 00:57:19,390
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:21,342
SPEAKER_1:  I had to push back and we said no.

00:57:21,634 --> 00:57:22,558
SPEAKER_1:  We're not calling it that.

00:57:23,074 --> 00:57:23,390
SPEAKER_1:  Allez!

00:57:23,714 --> 00:57:26,270
SPEAKER_1:  even despite everything we've done, we're not calling it a discovery.

00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:28,990
SPEAKER_1:  We're calling it evidence for an exo moon.

00:57:29,474 --> 00:57:31,518
SPEAKER_1:  because for me I'd want to see this repeat.

00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:33,982
SPEAKER_1:  two times, three times, four times.

00:57:34,274 --> 00:57:35,646
SPEAKER_1:  before I really would.

00:57:36,066 --> 00:57:37,086
SPEAKER_1:  Bet my house.

00:57:37,346 --> 00:57:39,390
SPEAKER_1:  This is the real deal. And I do worry.

00:57:39,842 --> 00:57:41,918
SPEAKER_1:  As I said, perhaps that's my own scepticism.

00:57:42,274 --> 00:57:43,870
SPEAKER_1:  self skepticism going too far.

00:57:44,386 --> 00:57:49,246
SPEAKER_1:  But I think it was the right decision. And since that paper came out,

00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:55,454
SPEAKER_1:  There has been continuous interest in the subject. Another team independently analyzed that star.

00:57:55,874 --> 00:57:59,070
SPEAKER_1:  and recovered actually pretty much exactly the same results as us, the same dip.

00:57:59,586 --> 00:58:00,030
SPEAKER_1:  The same.

00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:02,014
SPEAKER_1:  the same wobble of the planet.

00:58:02,434 --> 00:58:10,782
SPEAKER_1:  And a third team looked at it and they actually got something different. They saw the dip was diminished compared to what we saw. They saw a little hint of a dip, but not as pronounced as what we saw.

00:58:11,426 --> 00:58:12,094
SPEAKER_1:  and they saw.

00:58:12,386 --> 00:58:13,214
SPEAKER_1:  The Wobble as well.

00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:14,494
SPEAKER_1:  So this been...

00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:16,766
SPEAKER_1:  a little bit of tension about

00:58:17,666 --> 00:58:20,638
SPEAKER_1:  analyzing the reduction of the Hubble data.

00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:21,662
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:28,670
SPEAKER_1:  And so the only way my mind to resolve this is just to look again. We actually did propose to Hubble straight after that.

00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:29,790
SPEAKER_1:  And we said, look.

00:58:30,402 --> 00:58:31,326
SPEAKER_1:  if our model is right.

00:58:31,586 --> 00:58:32,478
SPEAKER_1:  If the moon is there.

00:58:33,058 --> 00:58:37,214
SPEAKER_1:  It came in late last time. It transited after the planet.

00:58:37,794 --> 00:58:42,238
SPEAKER_1:  Because of the orbit, we can calculate that it should transit before the planet next time.

00:58:43,074 --> 00:58:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  If it's not there, if it doesn't transit before, and even if we see a dip afterwards, we know that's not our moon. It's obviously some instrumental effect with the data.

00:58:50,658 --> 00:58:53,150
SPEAKER_1:  We had a causal prediction as to where the moon should be.

00:58:53,794 --> 00:58:54,430
SPEAKER_1:  And so...

00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:57,470
SPEAKER_1:  I was really excited about that, but we didn't get the telescope time.

00:58:58,082 --> 00:59:00,638
SPEAKER_1:  And fortunately, if you go further into the future...

00:59:00,898 --> 00:59:05,950
SPEAKER_1:  we no longer have the predictive capability because it's like predicting the weather. You might be able to predict the weather next week.

00:59:06,178 --> 00:59:09,086
SPEAKER_1:  to some level of accuracy, but predicting the weather next year.

00:59:09,378 --> 00:59:11,006
SPEAKER_1:  becomes incredibly hard.

00:59:11,266 --> 00:59:15,391
SPEAKER_1:  Uncertainties just grow and compound as you go forward into the future more and more.

00:59:15,391 --> 00:59:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  were you able to know where the moon would be positioned?

00:59:18,434 --> 00:59:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  So you're able to.

00:59:19,714 --> 00:59:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  told.

00:59:20,546 --> 00:59:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  D-D-D-Duh.

00:59:22,082 --> 00:59:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  orbiting

00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  Like, geometry and-

00:59:24,706 --> 00:59:29,758
SPEAKER_1:  And frequency. Yeah. So from the basically from the wobbles of the planet itself,

00:59:30,242 --> 00:59:33,246
SPEAKER_1:  that tells us the orbital motion.

00:59:33,474 --> 00:59:36,099
SPEAKER_1:  of the moon, it's the reflex motion of the moon.

00:59:36,099 --> 00:59:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  Isn't it just an estimate to where

00:59:39,874 --> 00:59:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  Like I'm concerned about you making a strong prediction here because like if you don't get

00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  If you don't get the moon where the moon leads on the next time around, if you did get in the Hubble time, couldn't that mean something else if you didn't see that?

00:59:52,994 --> 00:59:55,166
SPEAKER_0:  Because you said it would be an instrumental.

00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  I feel...

00:59:58,978 --> 01:00:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  the strong urge to disprove your, which is a really good imperative. It's a good way to do science, but like.

01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:12,155
SPEAKER_0:  This is such a noisy signal, right? Or blurry signal maybe, low resolutions.

01:00:12,155 --> 01:00:15,102
SPEAKER_1:  maybe that's the better answer. I mean it's a five sigma signal.

01:00:15,394 --> 01:00:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  That's at the slightly uncomfortable edge. I mean.

01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:20,766
SPEAKER_1:  It's often said that for any detection of a first new phenomena...

01:00:21,474 --> 01:00:25,854
SPEAKER_1:  You really want like a 20, 25 sigma detection. Then there's just no doubt that.

01:00:26,114 --> 01:00:27,102
SPEAKER_1:  what you're seeing is real.

01:00:27,778 --> 01:00:34,654
SPEAKER_1:  This was at that edge. I mean, I guess it's comparable to the Higgs boson, but the Higgs boson was slightly different because there was so much theoretical impetus as to expect.

01:00:35,042 --> 01:00:35,646
SPEAKER_1:  a signal.

01:00:35,906 --> 01:00:37,278
SPEAKER_1:  at that precise location.

01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:48,990
SPEAKER_1:  A Neptune-sized moon was not predicted by anyone. No one, there was no papers you can find that expect Neptune-sized moons around Jupiter-sized planets. So there was, I think we were inherently skeptical about its reality for that reason.

01:00:49,506 --> 01:00:49,886
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:00:50,242 --> 01:00:51,614
SPEAKER_1:  but this is Science in Action and

01:00:52,162 --> 01:00:59,070
SPEAKER_1:  When we fit the wobbles, we fit the dips, and we have this 3G geometric model for the motion of the orbit.

01:00:59,522 --> 01:01:04,894
SPEAKER_1:  And projecting that forward, we found that about 80% of our projections led to the Moon.

01:01:05,154 --> 01:01:06,750
SPEAKER_1:  to be before, so it's not 100%.

01:01:07,042 --> 01:01:08,190
SPEAKER_1:  There is maybe.

01:01:08,418 --> 01:01:09,982
SPEAKER_1:  20% of the cases it was over here.

01:01:10,402 --> 01:01:13,118
SPEAKER_1:  But to me, that was a hard enough...

01:01:13,346 --> 01:01:14,622
SPEAKER_1:  A hard enough projection.

01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:15,390
SPEAKER_1:  that

01:01:15,906 --> 01:01:20,510
SPEAKER_1:  We felt confident that we could refute the exit, which was what I really wanted. I wanted a refutable exit.

01:01:21,058 --> 01:01:23,486
SPEAKER_1:  That's the basis of science, a falsifiable hypothesis.

01:01:23,842 --> 01:01:30,558
SPEAKER_1:  How can you make progress in science if you don't have a falsifiable testable hypothesis? So that was the beauty of this particular case.

01:01:31,042 --> 01:01:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  So there's a numerical simulation with a moon.

01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  that fits the data that we observed, and then you can now make predictions based on that simulation.

01:01:40,034 --> 01:01:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  This is so cool.

01:01:41,602 --> 01:01:43,390
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, it's fun. These are like little...

01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:48,734
SPEAKER_1:  solar systems that we can simulate on the computer and re-en衍act the system.

01:01:49,026 --> 01:01:49,406
SPEAKER_1:  but

01:01:50,274 --> 01:01:57,790
SPEAKER_1:  We are, we are pushing things to the very limits of what's possible. And that's double-edged sword. It's both incredibly exciting intellectually, but.

01:01:58,306 --> 01:01:59,230
SPEAKER_1:  Euroways.

01:01:59,746 --> 01:02:03,070
SPEAKER_1:  you're always risking to some degree the pushing too far.

01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  So I'd like to ask you about the recent paper you co-authored.

01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:11,262
SPEAKER_0:  an exomoon survey of 70 cool giant exoplanets.

01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  and the new candidate coupler 1708 PI.

01:02:15,362 --> 01:02:18,142
SPEAKER_1:  I would say there's like three or four candidates at this point.

01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:21,118
SPEAKER_1:  Of which we have published two of them. And to me.

01:02:21,762 --> 01:02:22,878
SPEAKER_1:  to a quote.

01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:24,158
SPEAKER_1:  compelling.

01:02:24,482 --> 01:02:26,366
SPEAKER_1:  and deserve full up observations.

01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:27,198
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:02:27,586 --> 01:02:28,222
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

01:02:28,802 --> 01:02:29,214
SPEAKER_1:  direct

01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:33,086
SPEAKER_1:  To get a confirmed detection, at least in our case, we would need to see it repeat, for sure.

01:02:33,442 --> 01:02:37,950
SPEAKER_1:  One of the problems with some of the other methods that have been proposed is that you don't get that repeatability.

01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:42,750
SPEAKER_1:  So for instance, an example of a technique that would lack that would be gravitational microlensing.

01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:46,046
SPEAKER_1:  so it is possible with a new telescope coming up in the future.

01:02:46,402 --> 01:02:51,838
SPEAKER_1:  called the Roman space telescope, which is basically a repurposed by satellite. That's the size of

01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:52,830
SPEAKER_1:  The Hubble Mirror.

01:02:53,218 --> 01:02:54,174
SPEAKER_1:  Getting a pint of space.

01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:57,982
SPEAKER_1:  Um, it will stare at millions of stars simultaneously.

01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:01,374
SPEAKER_1:  And it will look to see instead of whether any of those stars.

01:03:02,402 --> 01:03:03,646
SPEAKER_1:  dimmer for a short amount of time.

01:03:04,066 --> 01:03:05,022
SPEAKER_1:  which would be a transit.

01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:08,062
SPEAKER_1:  It'll look for the opposite. It'll look to see if anything can get brighter.

01:03:08,578 --> 01:03:11,646
SPEAKER_1:  and that brightness increase is caused by another planetary system.

01:03:12,002 --> 01:03:12,990
SPEAKER_1:  Passing in front.

01:03:13,314 --> 01:03:17,182
SPEAKER_1:  and then gravitationally lensing light around it to close the brightening

01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:19,102
SPEAKER_1:  And so this is a method of.

01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:20,638
SPEAKER_1:  discovering an entire.

01:03:20,866 --> 01:03:22,686
SPEAKER_1:  solar system, but only.

01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:24,766
SPEAKER_1:  only for a glimpse.

01:03:25,186 --> 01:03:30,558
SPEAKER_1:  You just get a short glimpse of it passing like a ship sailing through the night. Just that one photo of it.

01:03:31,298 --> 01:03:32,894
SPEAKER_1:  Now the problem with that is that...

01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:35,038
SPEAKER_1:  It's very difficult.

01:03:35,522 --> 01:03:36,414
SPEAKER_1:  The physics of.

01:03:36,866 --> 01:03:39,742
SPEAKER_1:  gravitational lenses are not surprisingly quite complicated.

01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:44,926
SPEAKER_1:  And so there's many, many possible solutions. So you might have a solution which is this could be.

01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:46,494
SPEAKER_1:  A Red Wolf Star

01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:50,302
SPEAKER_1:  with a Jupiter-like planet around it. That's one solution.

01:03:50,658 --> 01:03:55,102
SPEAKER_1:  But another solution is that it's a free-floating planet, a rogue planet like Jupiter.

01:03:55,362 --> 01:03:56,830
SPEAKER_1:  with an Earth-like moon around it.

01:03:57,186 --> 01:03:59,390
SPEAKER_1:  And those two solutions are almost indistinguishable.

01:04:00,098 --> 01:04:10,686
SPEAKER_1:  Now, ideally, we would be able to repeat the observation. We'd be able to go back and see, well, if the moon really is there, then we could predict its mass, its predicted motion and expect it to be maybe over here next time or something.

01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:12,414
SPEAKER_1:  With microlensing it's a one.

01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:13,982
SPEAKER_1:  snapshot event.

01:04:14,626 --> 01:04:15,806
SPEAKER_1:  And so for me.

01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:20,126
SPEAKER_1:  It's intriguing as a way of revealing something about the exome population.

01:04:20,546 --> 01:04:24,414
SPEAKER_1:  But I always come back to transits because it's the only method we really have that's

01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:30,430
SPEAKER_1:  absolutely repeatable that we'll be able to come back and prove to everyone that look

01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:39,422
SPEAKER_1:  On the 17th of October, the moon will be over here and the moon will look like this and we can actually capture that image. And that's what we see with, of course, many exoplanets. So we want to get to that same point of...

01:04:39,906 --> 01:04:43,102
SPEAKER_1:  Full confidence, full confirmation, the slam dunk detection.

01:04:43,394 --> 01:04:44,670
SPEAKER_1:  of these xm moons but...

01:04:45,122 --> 01:04:47,230
SPEAKER_1:  Um, yeah, it's, it's been a

01:04:47,458 --> 01:04:48,862
SPEAKER_1:  hell of a journey.

01:04:49,378 --> 01:04:51,166
SPEAKER_1:  to try and push.

01:04:51,394 --> 01:04:53,278
SPEAKER_1:  the field into that direction and

01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,015
SPEAKER_1:  uh... is that summer

01:04:55,015 --> 01:04:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  Resistance to the transit method.

01:04:56,706 --> 01:05:03,102
SPEAKER_1:  Not to the transit method, I just say to exomeons. So the transit method is by far the most popular method for looking for exoplanets.

01:05:03,522 --> 01:05:04,222
SPEAKER_1:  But um...

01:05:04,802 --> 01:05:10,974
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, as I've alluded to, exo-moons is kind of a niche topic within the discipline of exoplanets.

01:05:11,330 --> 01:05:13,822
SPEAKER_1:  And that's largely because there are.

01:05:14,274 --> 01:05:16,542
SPEAKER_1:  people I think are waiting for those slam dunks.

01:05:17,186 --> 01:05:18,206
SPEAKER_1:  And it was like the.

01:05:18,466 --> 01:05:20,478
SPEAKER_1:  If you go back to the first exoplanet discovery...

01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:24,126
SPEAKER_1:  that was made in 1995 by Michel Mayor and Didier Calloz.

01:05:24,578 --> 01:05:25,022
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:32,926
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's true at the time that they were seen as mavericks, that the idea of looking for planets around stars was considered fringe science.

01:05:33,474 --> 01:05:39,038
SPEAKER_1:  And I'm sure many colleagues told them, why don't you do something more safe, like study eclipsing stars?

01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:44,414
SPEAKER_1:  to binary star systems, we know those exist. So why are you wasting your time looking for planets? You're gonna get this.

01:05:44,834 --> 01:05:45,310
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:05:45,986 --> 01:05:49,758
SPEAKER_1:  Alien moniker or something, you'll be seen as a fringe maverick scientist.

01:05:50,082 --> 01:05:53,342
SPEAKER_1:  And so I think it was quite difficult for those early planet hunters.

01:05:53,698 --> 01:05:56,350
SPEAKER_1:  to get legitimacy and be taken seriously.

01:05:56,610 --> 01:06:01,630
SPEAKER_1:  And so very few people risked their careers to do it, except for those that were either emboldened to try.

01:06:02,018 --> 01:06:04,382
SPEAKER_1:  or had maybe the career.

01:06:04,706 --> 01:06:05,342
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:09,502
SPEAKER_1:  maybe like tenure or something so they didn't have to necessarily worry about the implications of failure.

01:06:09,986 --> 01:06:10,590
SPEAKER_1:  And so...

01:06:11,362 --> 01:06:13,598
SPEAKER_1:  Once that happened, once they made the first discoveries...

01:06:13,986 --> 01:06:14,782
SPEAKER_1:  Overnight.

01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:21,886
SPEAKER_1:  you know, everyone and their dog was gunning into exoplanets and all of a sudden the whole, you know, the whole astronomy community shifted and...

01:06:22,242 --> 01:06:23,742
SPEAKER_1:  huge numbers of people that were.

01:06:24,002 --> 01:06:28,542
SPEAKER_1:  once upon a time studying eclipsing binaries, a change to becoming exoplanet scientists.

01:06:28,834 --> 01:06:31,102
SPEAKER_1:  And so that was the first wave of exoplanet scientists.

01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:34,046
SPEAKER_1:  We're now in a kind of a second wave or in the third wave.

01:06:34,338 --> 01:06:34,750
SPEAKER_1:  where

01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:43,326
SPEAKER_1:  People like me to some degree kind of grew up with the idea of exoplanets as being normal. I was 11 years old I guess when the first exoplanet was discovered.

01:06:43,586 --> 01:06:45,246
SPEAKER_1:  And so to me, it was a fairly.

01:06:45,794 --> 01:06:48,094
SPEAKER_1:  a normal idea to grow up with.

01:06:48,418 --> 01:06:49,822
SPEAKER_1:  Um, and so we've been.

01:06:50,402 --> 01:06:50,910
SPEAKER_1:  Schreienden.

01:06:51,586 --> 01:06:53,406
SPEAKER_1:  in exoplanets from the very beginning.

01:06:53,730 --> 01:06:54,910
SPEAKER_1:  And so that brings...

01:06:55,554 --> 01:07:00,606
SPEAKER_1:  different perspective to those who have maybe transitioned from a different career path.

01:07:01,154 --> 01:07:01,630
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:07:01,922 --> 01:07:02,558
SPEAKER_1:  And so...

01:07:02,914 --> 01:07:04,926
SPEAKER_1:  I suspect with Exo Moons and

01:07:05,346 --> 01:07:06,782
SPEAKER_1:  probably technosignatures.

01:07:07,202 --> 01:07:09,214
SPEAKER_1:  astrobiology, many of the

01:07:09,474 --> 01:07:10,846
SPEAKER_1:  topics which I've seen at the.

01:07:11,074 --> 01:07:12,350
SPEAKER_1:  the fringes of...

01:07:12,738 --> 01:07:13,598
SPEAKER_1:  What's possible?

01:07:14,754 --> 01:07:17,182
SPEAKER_1:  They will all open up into becoming mainstream one day.

01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:19,966
SPEAKER_1:  but there's a lot of people who are just waiting.

01:07:20,226 --> 01:07:21,566
SPEAKER_1:  waiting for that.

01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:23,230
SPEAKER_1:  assuredness.

01:07:23,522 --> 01:07:24,350
SPEAKER_1:  that there is a

01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:29,173
SPEAKER_1:  secure career net ahead of them before they commit.

01:07:29,173 --> 01:07:31,166
SPEAKER_0:  It does seem to me that Exo-Moon's...

01:07:31,394 --> 01:07:32,030
SPEAKER_0:  Open.

01:07:32,706 --> 01:07:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  wider or open for the first time the door to to aliens.

01:07:37,474 --> 01:07:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  more seriously academically studying, all right, let's look at like alien worlds. So I think it's still pretty fringe.

01:07:45,154 --> 01:07:49,342
SPEAKER_0:  to talk about alien life, even on like on Mars and the moons and so on. You're kinda like...

01:07:50,274 --> 01:07:54,494
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it'll be nice, but imagine the first time you discover a living organism.

01:07:54,754 --> 01:07:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  That's gonna change.

01:07:56,546 --> 01:07:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  then everybody would look like an idiot for not-

01:07:59,234 --> 01:08:00,990
SPEAKER_0:  focusing everything on this.

01:08:01,378 --> 01:08:05,598
SPEAKER_0:  because the possibility of the things will, it's possible it might be super boring.

01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  It might be very boring bacteria, but even the existence of life elsewhere.

01:08:10,562 --> 01:08:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  I mean that changes everything. That means life is everywhere.

01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:16,734
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. If you knew now that in five years, 10 years...

01:08:17,186 --> 01:08:20,926
SPEAKER_1:  the first life would be discovered elsewhere. you knew that in advance.

01:08:21,442 --> 01:08:22,430
SPEAKER_1:  It would surely.

01:08:22,658 --> 01:08:34,403
SPEAKER_1:  affect the way you approach your entire career as a, especially someone junior in astronomy, you would surely be like, well, this is clearly going to be the direction I have to dedicate my classes and my training and my education towards that direction.

01:08:34,403 --> 01:08:35,903
SPEAKER_0:  textbooks all the

01:08:35,903 --> 01:08:37,406
SPEAKER_1:  That's right.

01:08:37,538 --> 01:08:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, and I think there's a lot of value to hedging.

01:08:41,218 --> 01:08:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  like allocating some of the time.

01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  to that possibility because the kind of discovery will.

01:08:47,618 --> 01:08:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  the kind of discoveries we might get in the next few decades.

01:08:51,842 --> 01:08:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  It feels like we're on the verge of a lot of...

01:08:54,914 --> 01:08:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  getting a lot of really good data and

01:08:57,666 --> 01:09:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  having better and better tools that can process that data. So there's just going to be a continuous increase of the kind of discoveries that will open. Like, but a slam dunk.

01:09:07,266 --> 01:09:08,286
SPEAKER_0:  That's hard to come by.

01:09:08,866 --> 01:09:11,294
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I think a lot of us are anticipating.

01:09:11,554 --> 01:09:14,686
SPEAKER_1:  We're already seeing it to some degree with venus and the phosphine incident.

01:09:15,138 --> 01:09:19,006
SPEAKER_1:  But we've seen it before with Bill Clinton and the White House lawn announcing life.

01:09:19,394 --> 01:09:25,246
SPEAKER_1:  from Mars and there are inevitably going to be spurious claims or at least claims which are

01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:27,326
SPEAKER_1:  ambiguous to some degree.

01:09:27,874 --> 01:09:30,046
SPEAKER_1:  There will be for sure a...

01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:35,262
SPEAKER_1:  high profile journal like Nature of Science that will one day publish a paper saying

01:09:35,842 --> 01:09:38,174
SPEAKER_1:  by a signature discovered or something like that on.

01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:39,774
SPEAKER_1:  Trappist 1 or some other planet.

01:09:40,194 --> 01:09:44,318
SPEAKER_1:  And then there will be years of back and forth in the literature.

01:09:44,578 --> 01:09:50,366
SPEAKER_1:  And that might seem frustrating, but that's how science works. That's the mechanism of science at play of people.

01:09:50,626 --> 01:09:53,694
SPEAKER_1:  scrutinizing the results to intense skepticism.

01:09:54,146 --> 01:09:54,622
SPEAKER_1:  and.

01:09:55,138 --> 01:10:00,510
SPEAKER_1:  It's like a crucible, you know, you burn away all the relevance is until whatever is left is the truth.

01:10:00,802 --> 01:10:02,110
SPEAKER_1:  And so you're left with this.

01:10:02,338 --> 01:10:03,134
SPEAKER_1:  this product.

01:10:03,458 --> 01:10:08,830
SPEAKER_1:  which is that, okay, we either believe or don't believe that Biosynchros are there. So there's inevitably going to be a lot of.

01:10:09,378 --> 01:10:12,958
SPEAKER_1:  controversy and debate and argument about it. We just have to anticipate that.

01:10:13,314 --> 01:10:14,110
SPEAKER_1:  And so I think.

01:10:14,882 --> 01:10:19,710
SPEAKER_1:  You have to basically have a thick skin to some degree academically to dive into that world.

01:10:20,066 --> 01:10:22,814
SPEAKER_1:  And you're seeing that with phosphine.

01:10:23,426 --> 01:10:23,966
SPEAKER_1:  It's been.

01:10:24,322 --> 01:10:24,990
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:26,622
SPEAKER_1:  It's been...

01:10:26,914 --> 01:10:28,830
SPEAKER_1:  Uncomfortable to watch from the outside?

01:10:29,314 --> 01:10:32,926
SPEAKER_1:  the kind of dialogue that some of the scientists have been having with each other.

01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:34,430
SPEAKER_1:  about that because...

01:10:34,882 --> 01:10:36,702
SPEAKER_1:  Um, they get a little aggressive.

01:10:37,058 --> 01:10:38,654
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, you can understand.

01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:40,926
SPEAKER_1:  You can understand why, because...

01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:50,334
SPEAKER_1:  Jealousy? I don't know. That's me saying, not you. That's me talking. I'm sure there's some envy and jealousy involved.

01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:52,350
SPEAKER_1:  on the on the

01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:56,254
SPEAKER_1:  behalf of those who are not part of the visual discovery.

01:10:56,706 --> 01:11:05,022
SPEAKER_1:  But there's also in any case, just leave the particular people involved in Venus alone in any case of making it a claim of that magnitude.

01:11:05,922 --> 01:11:06,782
SPEAKER_1:  Especially life.

01:11:07,106 --> 01:11:08,414
SPEAKER_1:  Because life is pretty much...

01:11:08,962 --> 01:11:12,542
SPEAKER_1:  One of the biggest discoveries of all time, you can imagine scientifically.

01:11:12,962 --> 01:11:13,438
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

01:11:13,986 --> 01:11:21,150
SPEAKER_1:  You can see, and I'm so conscious of this in myself when I get close to, as I said, even the much smaller goal of setting an exomoon.

01:11:21,762 --> 01:11:23,134
SPEAKER_1:  The ego creepin'.

01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:27,550
SPEAKER_1:  And so as a scientist, we have to be so guarded against our own egos.

01:11:27,938 --> 01:11:29,086
SPEAKER_1:  You see.

01:11:29,666 --> 01:11:37,566
SPEAKER_1:  the lights in your eyes of a Nobel Prize or the fame and fortune and being remembered in the history books and we all...

01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:43,710
SPEAKER_1:  Grew up in our training learning about Newton and Einstein, these giants of the field Feynman-Maxwell.

01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:44,510
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:11:44,738 --> 01:11:48,254
SPEAKER_1:  You get the idea of these individual contributions, which.

01:11:48,578 --> 01:11:51,358
SPEAKER_1:  get immortalized for all time. And that's seductive.

01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:56,286
SPEAKER_1:  It's why many of us with the skill set to go into maybe banking instead decided

01:11:56,834 --> 01:11:58,334
SPEAKER_1:  Actually, there's something about.

01:11:58,626 --> 01:12:05,342
SPEAKER_1:  idea of being immortalized and contributing towards society in a permanent way that is more attractive than the financial reward.

01:12:05,602 --> 01:12:07,390
SPEAKER_1:  of applying my skills elsewhere.

01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:09,918
SPEAKER_1:  So to some degree that ego can be a benefit.

01:12:10,658 --> 01:12:15,198
SPEAKER_1:  brings in skillful people into our field who might otherwise be tempted by money elsewhere.

01:12:16,002 --> 01:12:16,446
SPEAKER_1:  But.

01:12:17,186 --> 01:12:18,686
SPEAKER_1:  On the other hand, it

01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:21,342
SPEAKER_1:  the closer you get towards.

01:12:21,730 --> 01:12:23,070
SPEAKER_1:  when you start flirting with that.

01:12:23,490 --> 01:12:28,990
SPEAKER_1:  Nobel prize in your, in your eyes, or you think you're on the, on the verge of seeing something you can lose objectivity.

01:12:29,698 --> 01:12:31,166
SPEAKER_1:  A very famous example of this is...

01:12:31,554 --> 01:12:32,766
SPEAKER_1:  uh, Barnard's Star.

01:12:33,346 --> 01:12:38,494
SPEAKER_1:  there was a planet claimed there by Peter van der Kamp, I think it was in 1968-69.

01:12:39,010 --> 01:12:42,206
SPEAKER_1:  And at the time it would have been the first ever exoplanet ever claimed.

01:12:42,722 --> 01:12:43,870
SPEAKER_1:  And, um...

01:12:44,418 --> 01:12:44,958
SPEAKER_1:  He-

01:12:45,282 --> 01:12:45,662
SPEAKER_1:  He-

01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:52,446
SPEAKER_1:  felt assured that this planet was there. He was actually using the wobbling star method, but using the positions of the stars to see them, to claim this exoplanet.

01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:55,518
SPEAKER_1:  It turned out that this planet was.

01:12:56,098 --> 01:12:56,798
SPEAKER_1:  But it's not there

01:12:57,378 --> 01:13:02,334
SPEAKER_1:  subsequent analyses by both dynamicists and theorists and those looking at the instrumental data.

01:13:02,626 --> 01:13:04,158
SPEAKER_1:  established fairly.

01:13:04,514 --> 01:13:04,990
SPEAKER_1:  um...

01:13:05,442 --> 01:13:06,366
SPEAKER_1:  unanimously that

01:13:06,754 --> 01:13:08,446
SPEAKER_1:  There was no way this planet was really there.

01:13:08,834 --> 01:13:09,214
SPEAKER_1:  But...

01:13:09,602 --> 01:13:12,030
SPEAKER_1:  Peter van der Kamp insisted it was there despite-

01:13:12,322 --> 01:13:13,982
SPEAKER_1:  overwhelming evidence that was accruing.

01:13:14,210 --> 01:13:14,782
SPEAKER_1:  against him.

01:13:15,554 --> 01:13:18,622
SPEAKER_1:  Um, and even to the day he died, which was

01:13:19,042 --> 01:13:20,894
SPEAKER_1:  I think in the early 90s.

01:13:21,122 --> 01:13:26,302
SPEAKER_1:  he was still insisting this planet was there, even when we were starting to make the first genuine exoplanet discoveries.

01:13:26,818 --> 01:13:29,758
SPEAKER_1:  And even at that point, I think Hubble had even looked at that star.

01:13:30,082 --> 01:13:32,254
SPEAKER_1:  and had totally ruled out.

01:13:32,514 --> 01:13:34,366
SPEAKER_1:  any possibility of what he was talking about.

01:13:34,978 --> 01:13:35,614
SPEAKER_1:  And so...

01:13:35,906 --> 01:13:38,270
SPEAKER_1:  That's the problem, how do you get to a point as a scientist where...

01:13:38,594 --> 01:13:40,094
SPEAKER_1:  You just can't accept.

01:13:40,706 --> 01:13:44,478
SPEAKER_1:  anything that comes otherwise, because you're, it starts out with.

01:13:44,802 --> 01:13:46,526
SPEAKER_1:  the dream of fame.

01:13:46,946 --> 01:13:50,654
SPEAKER_1:  And then it ends in a stubborn refusal to ever back down.

01:13:50,818 --> 01:13:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  Of course the flip side of that.

01:13:52,866 --> 01:13:55,102
SPEAKER_0:  Sometimes you need that.

01:13:55,394 --> 01:13:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  to have the strength.

01:13:57,218 --> 01:14:02,206
SPEAKER_0:  to carry a belief against the entire scientific community that resists your beliefs.

01:14:02,978 --> 01:14:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  And so it's a double edged sword.

01:14:05,666 --> 01:14:10,334
SPEAKER_1:  That can happen, but I guess the distinction here is evidence. Yes. So in this case.

01:14:11,458 --> 01:14:19,838
SPEAKER_1:  that the evidence was so overwhelming. It wasn't really a matter of interpretation. It was, you had to collect, you'd observe this start with the same.

01:14:20,226 --> 01:14:23,998
SPEAKER_1:  the same star, but with maybe 10, even a hundred times greater precision.

01:14:24,514 --> 01:14:30,014
SPEAKER_1:  for prolonged much longer periods of time. And there was just no doubt at this point this planet was a mirage.

01:14:30,594 --> 01:14:31,038
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:14:31,426 --> 01:14:38,078
SPEAKER_1:  And so that's why you have to be very careful. I always say don't ever name, you know, my wife, my daughter, name this planet after me that you discover.

01:14:38,338 --> 01:14:39,134
SPEAKER_1:  I can't.

01:14:39,650 --> 01:14:41,214
SPEAKER_1:  I can't ever name a planet after you.

01:14:41,794 --> 01:14:42,494
SPEAKER_1:  because I'll be...

01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:44,030
SPEAKER_1:  I won't be objective anymore.

01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:48,958
SPEAKER_1:  How could I ever turn around to you and say that planet wasn't real that I named after you?

01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  So you're somebody that talks about and is clear in your eyes and in your way of being.

01:14:54,242 --> 01:14:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  that you love the process of discovery, that joy, the magic of just...

01:14:58,338 --> 01:14:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

01:14:59,554 --> 01:15:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  You know, uh...

01:15:00,802 --> 01:15:04,190
SPEAKER_0:  seeing something, a new observation, a new idea.

01:15:05,186 --> 01:15:06,654
SPEAKER_0:  Um, but I guess.

01:15:06,914 --> 01:15:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  The point is when you have that great feeling.

01:15:09,954 --> 01:15:11,934
SPEAKER_0:  is to then switch on the skepticism.

01:15:12,962 --> 01:15:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  like to start like testing.

01:15:15,234 --> 01:15:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  What does this actually mean?

01:15:17,474 --> 01:15:19,838
SPEAKER_0:  Is this real? What are the possible?

01:15:20,066 --> 01:15:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, different interpretations that could make this a lot less grand than I first imagined. And so both have the wander and the skepticism on one brain.

01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:30,334
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I think the-

01:15:30,594 --> 01:15:32,702
SPEAKER_1:  Generally the more I want something to be true.

01:15:33,058 --> 01:15:35,102
SPEAKER_1:  the more I inherently doubt it.

01:15:35,426 --> 01:15:37,118
SPEAKER_1:  And I think that just comes from, you know, I...

01:15:37,346 --> 01:15:37,790
SPEAKER_1:  I grew up.

01:15:38,562 --> 01:15:39,070
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:15:39,298 --> 01:15:41,310
SPEAKER_1:  with a religious family and...

01:15:41,762 --> 01:15:47,166
SPEAKER_1:  was just sort of indoctrinated to some degree, like many children are, that, okay, this is normal, you know, there's a garden.

01:15:47,554 --> 01:15:48,670
SPEAKER_1:  This is the way the world is.

01:15:48,994 --> 01:15:51,742
SPEAKER_1:  God created the earth. And then as I became more...

01:15:52,418 --> 01:15:52,766
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

01:15:53,058 --> 01:15:56,766
SPEAKER_1:  well-read and literate of what was happening in the world scientifically.

01:15:57,026 --> 01:15:57,950
SPEAKER_1:  I started to doubt.

01:15:58,274 --> 01:15:59,934
SPEAKER_1:  and it really just struck me.

01:16:00,226 --> 01:16:01,886
SPEAKER_1:  that the hardest thing to let go of

01:16:02,210 --> 01:16:04,990
SPEAKER_1:  when you do decide not to be religious anymore.

01:16:05,538 --> 01:16:11,550
SPEAKER_1:  And it's not really like a light bulb moment, but it just kind of happens over my over 11 to 13. I think for me it was happening.

01:16:12,162 --> 01:16:12,510
SPEAKER_1:  But

01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:15,870
SPEAKER_1:  It's that sadness of letting go of this beautiful...

01:16:16,482 --> 01:16:25,502
SPEAKER_1:  dream which you had in your mind of eternal life for behaving yourself on Earth, you would have this beautiful heaven that you could go to and live forever.

01:16:25,826 --> 01:16:27,262
SPEAKER_1:  And that's very attractive.

01:16:27,682 --> 01:16:28,926
SPEAKER_1:  And for me personally...

01:16:29,314 --> 01:16:29,790
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:16:30,402 --> 01:16:38,238
SPEAKER_1:  That was one of the things that pulled me against it was this. It's like, it's too good to be true and it's very convenient.

01:16:38,562 --> 01:16:41,342
SPEAKER_1:  that this could be so.

01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:46,782
SPEAKER_1:  and I have no evidence directly in terms of a scientific sense to support this hypothesis.

01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:48,286
SPEAKER_1:  and it just became...

01:16:48,546 --> 01:16:50,846
SPEAKER_1:  really difficult to reconcile.

01:16:51,362 --> 01:16:56,030
SPEAKER_1:  um, my growth as a scientist. And I know some people find that reconciliation.

01:16:56,674 --> 01:16:57,566
SPEAKER_1:  I have not.

01:16:58,210 --> 01:16:59,422
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe I will one day.

01:16:59,842 --> 01:17:00,318
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:17:01,442 --> 01:17:02,398
SPEAKER_1:  as a general.

01:17:02,946 --> 01:17:04,638
SPEAKER_1:  guiding principle, which I think I...

01:17:05,378 --> 01:17:07,102
SPEAKER_1:  I obtained from that experience.

01:17:07,618 --> 01:17:09,630
SPEAKER_1:  was that I have to be extremely guarded.

01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:11,742
SPEAKER_1:  about what I want to be true because

01:17:12,226 --> 01:17:15,902
SPEAKER_1:  it's going to sway me to say things which...

01:17:16,418 --> 01:17:21,150
SPEAKER_1:  which are not true if I'm not careful. And that's not what we're trying to do as scientists.

01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:24,286
SPEAKER_0:  So you felt from a religious perspective that there was a...

01:17:25,378 --> 01:17:31,070
SPEAKER_0:  a little bit of a gravitational field in terms of your opinions, like it was affecting how you could be as a scientist.

01:17:31,778 --> 01:17:34,430
SPEAKER_0:  Like as a scientific thinker, obviously we're young.

01:17:35,298 --> 01:17:36,798
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I think...

01:17:38,050 --> 01:17:40,222
SPEAKER_1:  I think that's, that's true that whenever you're.

01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:43,230
SPEAKER_1:  whenever there's something you want to be true.

01:17:43,842 --> 01:17:44,446
SPEAKER_1:  It's...

01:17:45,218 --> 01:17:47,326
SPEAKER_1:  It's the ultimate seduction, intellectually.

01:17:47,778 --> 01:17:50,302
SPEAKER_1:  And I worry about this a lot with...

01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:52,830
SPEAKER_1:  UFOs with

01:17:53,154 --> 01:17:56,702
SPEAKER_1:  It's true already with things like Venus, Phosphine and...

01:17:57,058 --> 01:17:59,102
SPEAKER_1:  searching for astrobiological signals.

01:18:00,066 --> 01:18:06,270
SPEAKER_1:  We have to guard against this all the way through from however we're looking for life, however we're looking for whatever this big question is.

01:18:06,658 --> 01:18:08,350
SPEAKER_1:  there is a part of us, I think.

01:18:08,834 --> 01:18:10,622
SPEAKER_1:  I would love that to be life in the universe.

01:18:11,138 --> 01:18:11,582
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:18:11,842 --> 01:18:13,790
SPEAKER_1:  I hope there is life in the universe, but-

01:18:14,242 --> 01:18:14,686
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:18:15,074 --> 01:18:15,998
SPEAKER_1:  I'm somewhat.

01:18:16,354 --> 01:18:16,862
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:18:17,570 --> 01:18:19,998
SPEAKER_1:  been on record several times as being fairly

01:18:20,546 --> 01:18:22,142
SPEAKER_1:  about trying to remain.

01:18:22,498 --> 01:18:24,798
SPEAKER_1:  consciously agnostic about that question.

01:18:25,154 --> 01:18:28,574
SPEAKER_1:  I don't want to make up my mind about what the answer is.

01:18:28,962 --> 01:18:32,318
SPEAKER_1:  before I've collected evidence to inform that decision. And that's how.

01:18:32,642 --> 01:18:34,206
SPEAKER_1:  That should work. If I only know...

01:18:34,658 --> 01:18:35,710
SPEAKER_1:  What the answer is.

01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:42,590
SPEAKER_1:  then what am I doing? And that's not a scientific experiment anymore. You've already decided. So what are you trying to learn? What's the point of

01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:44,926
SPEAKER_1:  doing the experiment if you already know what the answer is. There's no point.

01:18:45,122 --> 01:18:48,126
SPEAKER_0:  It's so complicated because so far I'm being arseful myself.

01:18:50,946 --> 01:18:53,726
SPEAKER_0:  when I imagine the universe. So first thing I imagine.

01:18:54,338 --> 01:18:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  about our world is that

01:18:56,450 --> 01:18:58,686
SPEAKER_0:  We humans and me certainly as one.

01:18:59,522 --> 01:19:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  human.

01:19:01,890 --> 01:19:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  uh... no very...

01:19:04,930 --> 01:19:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  First assumption is I know almost nothing.

01:19:07,618 --> 01:19:09,022
SPEAKER_0:  about how anything works.

01:19:10,082 --> 01:19:11,742
SPEAKER_0:  So first of all, that actually applies for.

01:19:11,970 --> 01:19:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  for things that humans do know.

01:19:14,370 --> 01:19:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  of

01:19:15,394 --> 01:19:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  the quantum mechanics, all the things that there's different expertises that I just have not dedicated to. So even that starting point. If we take all of knowledge.

01:19:23,970 --> 01:19:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  As human civilization, we know almost nothing. That's kind of an assumption I have.

01:19:28,866 --> 01:19:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  because it seems like we keep discovering mysteries and it seems like

01:19:32,962 --> 01:19:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  history.

01:19:34,018 --> 01:19:45,246
SPEAKER_0:  human history is defined by moments when we said, okay, we pretty much figured it all out. And then you realize a century later, you've, when you said that you didn't figure out anything. Okay, so that's like a starting point.

01:19:45,858 --> 01:19:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  The second thing I have is...

01:19:48,194 --> 01:19:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like...

01:19:50,466 --> 01:19:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  the entirety of the universe is just filled with alien civilizations.

01:19:56,290 --> 01:19:57,374
SPEAKER_0:  statistically.

01:19:58,786 --> 01:19:59,198
SPEAKER_0:  There's

01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:01,022
SPEAKER_0:  The important...

01:20:01,346 --> 01:20:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  thing that enables that belief for me is that they don't have to be human like. It could be anything.

01:20:08,386 --> 01:20:12,766
SPEAKER_0:  And it's just the fact that life exists and just seeing the way life is on earth.

01:20:13,378 --> 01:20:14,942
SPEAKER_0:  that it just finds a way.

01:20:15,522 --> 01:20:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  It finds a way in so many different complicated environments.

01:20:19,138 --> 01:20:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  It finds a way, whatever that force is.

01:20:21,954 --> 01:20:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  That same force has to find a way elsewhere also.

01:20:26,178 --> 01:20:27,998
SPEAKER_0:  But then if I'm also being honest,

01:20:28,354 --> 01:20:30,910
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know how many hours in a day I spend.

01:20:32,066 --> 01:20:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  seriously considering the possibility that we're alone.

01:20:36,194 --> 01:20:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know what I'm-

01:20:38,018 --> 01:20:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  Good night.

01:20:38,754 --> 01:20:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  When my heart is in mind or filled with wonder, I think about all the different...

01:20:42,978 --> 01:20:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  life that's out there.

01:20:44,866 --> 01:20:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  but to really imagine that we're alone?

01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  Like really imagine all the vastness that's out there. We're alone.

01:20:51,554 --> 01:20:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  Not even bacteria?

01:20:53,986 --> 01:20:56,830
SPEAKER_1:  I would say you don't have to believe that we are alone.

01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:57,726
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:20:58,242 --> 01:20:59,102
SPEAKER_1:  that you have to.

01:20:59,362 --> 01:21:02,878
SPEAKER_1:  admit it's a possibility of our ignorance of the universe so far.

01:21:03,522 --> 01:21:03,998
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:21:05,186 --> 01:21:08,286
SPEAKER_1:  You can have a belief about something in the absence of evidence.

01:21:09,122 --> 01:21:09,470
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:21:09,826 --> 01:21:12,190
SPEAKER_1:  Carl Sagan famously described that as the definition of faith.

01:21:12,546 --> 01:21:14,846
SPEAKER_1:  if you believe something when there's no evidence.

01:21:15,426 --> 01:21:17,310
SPEAKER_1:  You have faith that there's life in the universe.

01:21:17,666 --> 01:21:18,270
SPEAKER_1:  But you can't.

01:21:19,202 --> 01:21:23,070
SPEAKER_1:  You can't demonstrate, you can't prove it mathematically, you can't show me evidence of that.

01:21:23,490 --> 01:21:23,966
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:21:24,162 --> 01:21:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  But is there some, so mathematically math is a funny thing. Is there, I mean the way physicists think, like intuition.

01:21:30,562 --> 01:21:32,126
SPEAKER_0:  So, so basic reasoning.

01:21:32,994 --> 01:21:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  Is there some value to that?

01:21:35,842 --> 01:21:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  Bye!

01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:41,630
SPEAKER_1:  I'd say we're all there. Certainly you can certainly make a very good argument. I think you've kind of already made one.

01:21:42,242 --> 01:21:46,654
SPEAKER_1:  Just the vastness of the universe is the default argument people often turn to.

01:21:46,946 --> 01:21:50,334
SPEAKER_1:  that surely there should be others out there. It's hard to imagine.

01:21:50,754 --> 01:21:52,094
SPEAKER_1:  There are a order of...

01:21:52,482 --> 01:21:55,390
SPEAKER_1:  10 to the 22 stars in our observable universe.

01:21:55,906 --> 01:22:01,310
SPEAKER_1:  And so really the question comes down to what is the probability of one of those 10 to 22.

01:22:01,602 --> 01:22:04,094
SPEAKER_1:  planets let's say, Earth like planets if they all have Earth like planets.

01:22:04,674 --> 01:22:05,982
SPEAKER_1:  Um, going on.

01:22:06,402 --> 01:22:07,038
SPEAKER_1:  to form life.

01:22:07,746 --> 01:22:08,734
SPEAKER_1:  spontaneously.

01:22:09,314 --> 01:22:13,118
SPEAKER_1:  That's the process of abiogenesis, the spontaneous emergence of life.

01:22:14,018 --> 01:22:15,893
SPEAKER_0:  Also the word spontaneous is a funny

01:22:15,893 --> 01:22:18,046
SPEAKER_1:  Well, maybe we won't use spontaneous, but.

01:22:19,266 --> 01:22:19,774
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:22:20,386 --> 01:22:27,582
SPEAKER_1:  Not being, so to say, seeded by some other civilization or something like this. It naturally emerges.

01:22:27,746 --> 01:22:29,182
SPEAKER_0:  because even the word spontaneous.

01:22:29,826 --> 01:22:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  makes it seem less likely?

01:22:31,714 --> 01:22:34,755
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. Like this, there's just this chemistry and extremely random.

01:22:34,755 --> 01:22:40,679
SPEAKER_1:  It could be a very gradual process over millions of years of growing complexity in chemical networks.

01:22:40,679 --> 01:22:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  force in the universe that

01:22:42,722 --> 01:22:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  pushes it towards interesting complexity pockets of complexity.

01:22:46,498 --> 01:22:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  Ultimately.

01:22:47,586 --> 01:22:50,238
SPEAKER_0:  create something like life which we can't possibly define yet.

01:22:50,562 --> 01:22:58,078
SPEAKER_0:  and sometimes it manifests itself into something that looks like humans, but it can be a totally different kind of computational information processing system.

01:22:58,498 --> 01:23:00,318
SPEAKER_0:  that were too dumb to even visualize.

01:23:00,706 --> 01:23:05,246
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean, certainly, I mean, it's kind of weird that complexity develops at all, right? Because

01:23:05,826 --> 01:23:06,878
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like the-

01:23:07,234 --> 01:23:11,422
SPEAKER_1:  opposite to our physical intuition, if you're training in physics of entropy, that thing should

01:23:11,810 --> 01:23:16,702
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, complexity is hard to spontaneously, I shouldn't say spontaneously, but hard to emerge in general.

01:23:17,058 --> 01:23:17,534
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:23:18,146 --> 01:23:24,446
SPEAKER_1:  And so that's an interesting problem. I think there's been, certainly from an evolutionary perspective, you do see growing complexity.

01:23:24,898 --> 01:23:27,262
SPEAKER_1:  And there's a nice argument I think it's by God.

01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:28,030
SPEAKER_1:  Who?

01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:31,102
SPEAKER_1:  who shows that if you have a certain amount of complexity.

01:23:31,586 --> 01:23:35,838
SPEAKER_1:  It can either become less complex or more complex through random mutation.

01:23:36,290 --> 01:23:41,726
SPEAKER_1:  And the less complex things are stripping away something, something that was necessary potentially to their survival.

01:23:42,306 --> 01:23:44,190
SPEAKER_1:  And so in general, that's going to be.

01:23:44,514 --> 01:23:50,750
SPEAKER_1:  not particularly useful in its survival. And so it's going to be detrimental to strip away a significant amount of its useful traits.

01:23:51,106 --> 01:23:52,414
SPEAKER_1:  Whereas if you add something...

01:23:52,834 --> 01:23:54,622
SPEAKER_1:  the most typical.

01:23:55,106 --> 01:23:57,598
SPEAKER_1:  that you add is probably not useful at all. It's probably just...

01:23:58,178 --> 01:23:58,558
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:23:58,882 --> 01:24:03,454
SPEAKER_1:  doesn't really affect its survival negatively, but neither does it provide any significant benefit.

01:24:03,874 --> 01:24:07,774
SPEAKER_1:  But sometimes on rare occasions, of course, it will be of benefit. So.

01:24:08,194 --> 01:24:12,798
SPEAKER_1:  If you have a certain level of complexity, it's hard to go back in complexity, but it's fairly easy to do.

01:24:13,314 --> 01:24:14,910
SPEAKER_1:  easy to go forward with enough.

01:24:15,234 --> 01:24:20,062
SPEAKER_1:  bites at the cherry, you will eventually build up in complexity and that tends to be why we see complexity.

01:24:20,354 --> 01:24:21,182
SPEAKER_1:  growing in.

01:24:21,410 --> 01:24:23,358
SPEAKER_1:  in certainly in an evolutionary sense.

01:24:23,714 --> 01:24:27,774
SPEAKER_1:  but also perhaps it's operating in chemical networks that led to the emergence of life.

01:24:28,450 --> 01:24:29,662
SPEAKER_1:  I guess the real...

01:24:30,338 --> 01:24:30,718
SPEAKER_1:  Uh

01:24:30,978 --> 01:24:33,918
SPEAKER_1:  problem I have with it with the numbers games come back to that is that.

01:24:34,466 --> 01:24:37,374
SPEAKER_1:  we are talking about a certain probability of that occurring.

01:24:37,922 --> 01:24:39,550
SPEAKER_1:  It may be to go from...

01:24:39,842 --> 01:24:45,182
SPEAKER_1:  the primordial soup, however you want to call it, the ingredients that the earth started with, the organic molecules.

01:24:45,666 --> 01:24:47,326
SPEAKER_1:  the probability of going from that.

01:24:47,554 --> 01:24:48,510
SPEAKER_1:  Initial condition.

01:24:49,058 --> 01:24:49,534
SPEAKER_1:  to.

01:24:49,954 --> 01:24:54,110
SPEAKER_1:  something that was capable of Darwinian natural selection that maybe we could define as life.

01:24:54,498 --> 01:24:55,006
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:24:55,234 --> 01:25:00,446
SPEAKER_1:  The probability that is maybe 1% of the time that happens, in which case you're right, the universe will be f***ed.

01:25:00,706 --> 01:25:01,822
SPEAKER_1:  Absolutely teeming with life.

01:25:02,178 --> 01:25:03,134
SPEAKER_1:  but across a big.

01:25:03,394 --> 01:25:06,430
SPEAKER_1:  10 to the power minus 10, in which case it's 1 per galaxy.

01:25:06,754 --> 01:25:13,054
SPEAKER_1:  or 10 to the power of minus 100, in which case the vast majority of universes even do not have life within it.

01:25:13,410 --> 01:25:13,854
SPEAKER_0:  or

01:25:14,306 --> 01:25:15,582
SPEAKER_0:  90%

01:25:15,874 --> 01:25:23,591
SPEAKER_0:  Or 90% you said 1% it could be 90% if the conditions, the chemical conditions of a planet are correct or a moon are correct.

01:25:23,591 --> 01:25:25,566
SPEAKER_1:  I admit that. It could be any of those numbers.

01:25:25,890 --> 01:25:26,366
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:25:26,754 --> 01:25:28,478
SPEAKER_1:  The challenge is we just have no.

01:25:29,634 --> 01:25:36,190
SPEAKER_1:  rigorous reason to expect why 90% is any, because we're talking about a probability for probability.

01:25:36,930 --> 01:25:37,278
SPEAKER_1:  Worst.

01:25:37,602 --> 01:25:41,310
SPEAKER_1:  Is, is 90% more a priori likely.

01:25:41,602 --> 01:25:43,102
SPEAKER_1:  then 10 to the power minus.

01:25:43,330 --> 01:25:44,455
SPEAKER_1:  Well the thing is...

01:25:44,455 --> 01:25:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  We do have an observation, N of 1.

01:25:46,978 --> 01:25:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  of the Earth.

01:25:48,002 --> 01:25:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  Mm-hmm.

01:25:48,546 --> 01:25:52,894
SPEAKER_0:  And it's difficult to know what to do with that, what kind of intuition you build.

01:25:53,986 --> 01:25:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  On top of that.

01:25:55,074 --> 01:25:56,478
SPEAKER_0:  because on Earth...

01:25:56,930 --> 01:25:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  It seems like life finds a way.

01:25:59,266 --> 01:26:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  Okay. In all kinds of conditions.

01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:08,702
SPEAKER_0:  in all kinds of crazy conditions. And it's able to build up from the basic chemistry. You could say, okay.

01:26:09,858 --> 01:26:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe it takes a little bit of time to develop some complicated technology like mitochondria. I don't know like photosynthesis

01:26:16,674 --> 01:26:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  fine but it seems to figure it out.

01:26:19,714 --> 01:26:20,094
SPEAKER_0:  and like.

01:26:20,354 --> 01:26:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  do it extremely well.

01:26:21,762 --> 01:26:24,286
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, but I would say you're describing a different process. I mean.

01:26:24,706 --> 01:26:25,118
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:26:25,506 --> 01:26:30,270
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe I'm, I'm at fault for separating these two processes, but to me, you're describing.

01:26:30,594 --> 01:26:32,350
SPEAKER_1:  Basically natural selection evolution at that point.

01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:37,854
SPEAKER_1:  Um, whereas I'm really describing ABO genesis, which is to me, a separate, distinct process.

01:26:37,954 --> 01:26:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  to you limited to human scientists, yes, but why would it be a separate process?

01:26:42,818 --> 01:26:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  Why is the birth of life a separate process from the process of life?

01:26:47,938 --> 01:26:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  Why is the f-

01:26:50,082 --> 01:26:53,502
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, we're uncomfortable with the, we're comfortable with the big bang.

01:26:54,146 --> 01:26:56,382
SPEAKER_0:  Or I'm comfortable with the first thing, I think.

01:26:56,642 --> 01:26:58,302
SPEAKER_1:  Like where did this come from? Right, so I think-

01:26:58,562 --> 01:27:00,574
SPEAKER_1:  I would say I just twist that question around and say what

01:27:00,898 --> 01:27:03,326
SPEAKER_1:  You're saying why is it a different process?

01:27:03,842 --> 01:27:09,470
SPEAKER_1:  Um, why, and I would say why shouldn't it be a different process, which isn't really a good defense, except to say that we have.

01:27:10,178 --> 01:27:11,358
SPEAKER_1:  We have knowledge of how.

01:27:11,778 --> 01:27:14,462
SPEAKER_1:  natural selection evolution works.

01:27:14,978 --> 01:27:16,286
SPEAKER_1:  think we understand that process.

01:27:16,930 --> 01:27:21,662
SPEAKER_1:  almost no information about the earliest stages of how life emerged on our planet.

01:27:21,922 --> 01:27:25,182
SPEAKER_1:  It may be that you're right and it is a part of a continuum.

01:27:25,730 --> 01:27:28,126
SPEAKER_1:  It may be that it is also a distinct.

01:27:28,898 --> 01:27:32,990
SPEAKER_1:  improbable set of circumstances that led to the emergence of life.

01:27:33,538 --> 01:27:36,702
SPEAKER_1:  As a scientist, I'm just trying to be open-minded.

01:27:37,122 --> 01:27:41,534
SPEAKER_1:  to both possibilities. If I assert that life must be everywhere,

01:27:42,594 --> 01:27:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  To me, you run the risk of experiment as bias.

01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:51,198
SPEAKER_1:  Um, if you think, you know what the answer is, if you look at an Earth like planet and you, and you are preconditioned.

01:27:51,554 --> 01:27:54,110
SPEAKER_1:  to think there's a 90% chance of life on this planet.

01:27:54,466 --> 01:27:55,454
SPEAKER_1:  It's going to.

01:27:55,778 --> 01:27:59,518
SPEAKER_1:  at some level affect your interpretation of that data.

01:27:59,938 --> 01:28:00,894
SPEAKER_1:  Whereas if I...

01:28:01,442 --> 01:28:06,494
SPEAKER_1:  However critical you might be of the agnosticism that I impose upon myself.

01:28:07,266 --> 01:28:08,510
SPEAKER_1:  Remain open.

01:28:08,738 --> 01:28:10,078
SPEAKER_1:  to both possibilities.

01:28:10,530 --> 01:28:15,742
SPEAKER_1:  then I trusted myself to make a fair assessment as to the reality of that evidence for life.

01:28:17,186 --> 01:28:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, but I wonder sort of scientifically and that's really beautiful to hear and inspiring to hear.

01:28:24,706 --> 01:28:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  I wonder...

01:28:26,498 --> 01:28:28,798
SPEAKER_0:  scientifically how many firsts

01:28:29,826 --> 01:28:31,166
SPEAKER_0:  we truly know of.

01:28:32,098 --> 01:28:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  Ike.

01:28:32,802 --> 01:28:34,750
SPEAKER_0:  and then we don't eventually explain.

01:28:35,234 --> 01:28:36,766
SPEAKER_0:  as actually.

01:28:37,570 --> 01:28:38,078
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

01:28:38,530 --> 01:28:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  a step number one million in a long process.

01:28:42,370 --> 01:28:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  So I think

01:28:43,650 --> 01:28:45,022
SPEAKER_0:  That's a really interesting.

01:28:45,410 --> 01:28:47,646
SPEAKER_0:  if there's truly first in this universe.

01:28:48,162 --> 01:28:52,798
SPEAKER_0:  You know, for us, whatever happened at the Big Bang is a kind of first, the origin of stuff.

01:28:53,602 --> 01:28:55,358
SPEAKER_0:  But it's just, again.

01:28:56,610 --> 01:29:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  It seems like history shows that we'll figure out that it's actually a continuation of something. But then physicists say that time is emergent and there are causality in times.

01:29:05,314 --> 01:29:08,702
SPEAKER_0:  is a very human kind of construct that is very possible that all of this

01:29:09,026 --> 01:29:10,718
SPEAKER_0:  So there could be really first.

01:29:11,426 --> 01:29:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  of a thing to which we attach a name.

01:29:14,690 --> 01:29:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  So whatever we call life.

01:29:16,866 --> 01:29:17,991
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe there is an or-

01:29:17,991 --> 01:29:18,398
SPEAKER_1:  of it.

01:29:18,946 --> 01:29:22,430
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. And I would also say I'm open to that idea of it being part of a continuation.

01:29:23,138 --> 01:29:26,238
SPEAKER_1:  but the continuation maybe is more broader and it's a continuation of

01:29:26,498 --> 01:29:28,190
SPEAKER_1:  chemical systems and chemical networks.

01:29:28,482 --> 01:29:33,886
SPEAKER_1:  And what we call this one particular type of chemistry in this behavior of chemistry life.

01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:34,814
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:29:35,266 --> 01:29:37,790
SPEAKER_1:  but it is just one manifestation of all the.

01:29:38,210 --> 01:29:42,398
SPEAKER_1:  trillions of possible permutations in which chemical reactions can occur.

01:29:42,850 --> 01:29:47,262
SPEAKER_1:  And we assert specialness to it because that's what we are.

01:29:47,714 --> 01:29:52,478
SPEAKER_1:  And so this is, it's also true of intelligence. You could extend the same thing and say, you know, we're, we're looking for.

01:29:52,962 --> 01:29:55,006
SPEAKER_1:  intelligent life in the universe and then you started

01:29:55,554 --> 01:29:58,302
SPEAKER_1:  Where does, where do you define intelligence? Where, where's that?

01:29:58,690 --> 01:30:01,630
SPEAKER_1:  continuum of something that's really like us, are we alone?

01:30:02,178 --> 01:30:06,750
SPEAKER_1:  There may be a continuum of chemical systems, a continuum of intelligences out there.

01:30:07,426 --> 01:30:07,934
SPEAKER_1:  end.

01:30:08,354 --> 01:30:08,766
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:30:09,282 --> 01:30:10,238
SPEAKER_1:  We have to be.

01:30:10,722 --> 01:30:17,246
SPEAKER_1:  careful of our own arrogance, of assuming specialness about what we are, that we are some distinct category.

01:30:17,762 --> 01:30:18,302
SPEAKER_1:  of

01:30:18,754 --> 01:30:19,390
SPEAKER_1:  Phenomena

01:30:19,714 --> 01:30:21,982
SPEAKER_1:  whereas the universe doesn't really care about what

01:30:22,274 --> 01:30:33,118
SPEAKER_1:  category we are, it's just doing what it's doing and doing everything in infinite diversity and infinite combinations is essentially what it's doing. And so we are taking this one slice.

01:30:33,442 --> 01:30:34,078
SPEAKER_1:  and saying

01:30:34,530 --> 01:30:36,254
SPEAKER_1:  No, this has to be treated separately.

01:30:36,706 --> 01:30:37,790
SPEAKER_1:  And I...

01:30:38,178 --> 01:30:43,070
SPEAKER_1:  I'm open to the idea that it could be a truly separate phenomenon, but it may just be.

01:30:43,522 --> 01:30:46,334
SPEAKER_1:  like a snowflake, every snowflake's different.

01:30:46,786 --> 01:30:48,766
SPEAKER_1:  and maybe just be that this one particular.

01:30:49,538 --> 01:30:52,766
SPEAKER_1:  iteration is another variant of the vast continuum.

01:30:53,154 --> 01:30:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  And maybe the algorithm of natural selection itself is an invention of Earth.

01:30:58,626 --> 01:31:01,534
SPEAKER_0:  I kind of also tend to suspect that this.

01:31:01,794 --> 01:31:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  this, whatever the algorithm is, it kind of operates.

01:31:04,770 --> 01:31:06,558
SPEAKER_0:  at all levels throughout the universe.

01:31:06,882 --> 01:31:09,982
SPEAKER_0:  But maybe this is a very kind of peculiar thing.

01:31:10,754 --> 01:31:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  That's...

01:31:12,130 --> 01:31:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:31:13,506 --> 01:31:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  where there's a bunch of chemical.

01:31:16,002 --> 01:31:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  systems.

01:31:17,282 --> 01:31:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  that compete against each other.

01:31:19,522 --> 01:31:22,014
SPEAKER_0:  somehow for survival under limited resources.

01:31:22,274 --> 01:31:25,630
SPEAKER_0:  And that's a very earth like thing. Mm hmm.

01:31:25,986 --> 01:31:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  There's.

01:31:27,426 --> 01:31:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  a large number of resources enough.

01:31:29,634 --> 01:31:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  to have a bunch of different kinds of systems competing, but not so many that...

01:31:33,698 --> 01:31:34,238
SPEAKER_0:  uh

01:31:35,042 --> 01:31:36,094
SPEAKER_0:  They get lazy.

01:31:36,578 --> 01:31:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. And maybe that's why bacteria were very lazy for a long time. Maybe they had...

01:31:40,482 --> 01:31:41,726
SPEAKER_0:  They didn't have much competition.

01:31:42,370 --> 01:31:45,054
SPEAKER_1:  Quite possibly. I mean, I tried to.

01:31:45,314 --> 01:31:48,222
SPEAKER_1:  As, as fun as it is to get into the speculation about.

01:31:48,866 --> 01:31:55,998
SPEAKER_1:  the definitions of life and what life does and this gross network of possibilities.

01:31:56,610 --> 01:31:59,006
SPEAKER_1:  Honestly, for me, the strongest argument.

01:31:59,714 --> 01:32:00,958
SPEAKER_1:  remaining agnostic.

01:32:01,538 --> 01:32:07,326
SPEAKER_1:  is to avoid that bias in assessing data. And we've seen it, I mean...

01:32:07,586 --> 01:32:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  Pestful lol I talked about on my channel.

01:32:09,730 --> 01:32:13,854
SPEAKER_1:  maybe last year or two years ago, you know, who's a very famous astronomer.

01:32:14,210 --> 01:32:18,430
SPEAKER_1:  who in the 19th century was claiming the evidence of canals on Mars.

01:32:18,914 --> 01:32:19,486
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:32:19,906 --> 01:32:32,574
SPEAKER_1:  from him, from his perspective, and even at the time, culturally, it was widely accepted that Mars would, of course, have life. I mean, I think it seems silly to us, but it was kind of similar arguments to what we're using now about exoplanets that, well, of course, there must be.

01:32:32,866 --> 01:32:38,270
SPEAKER_1:  life in the universe, how could it just be here? And so it seemed obvious to people that when you looked at Mars with its polar caps,

01:32:38,658 --> 01:32:40,350
SPEAKER_1:  even if you know its atmosphere.

01:32:40,610 --> 01:32:41,790
SPEAKER_1:  had seasons.

01:32:42,018 --> 01:32:53,150
SPEAKER_1:  It seemed obvious to them that that too would be a place where life not only was present, but had emerged to a civilization, which actually was fairly comparable in technology to our own, because it was building canal systems.

01:32:53,570 --> 01:33:01,502
SPEAKER_1:  Um, of course, the canal system seems a bizarre, technosignature to us, but it was a product of their time to them. And that was the cutting edge in technology.

01:33:01,858 --> 01:33:05,438
SPEAKER_1:  It should be a warning shot actually a little bit for us that if we think.

01:33:05,794 --> 01:33:08,510
SPEAKER_1:  you know, solar panels or building star links or...

01:33:09,090 --> 01:33:12,158
SPEAKER_1:  whatever space mining is like an inevitable technosignature.

01:33:12,418 --> 01:33:14,014
SPEAKER_1:  That may be laughably.

01:33:14,242 --> 01:33:15,038
SPEAKER_1:  antiquated.

01:33:15,426 --> 01:33:18,878
SPEAKER_1:  compared to what other civilizations far more advanced than this may be doing.

01:33:19,394 --> 01:33:26,014
SPEAKER_1:  And so anyway, Percival Lowell, he was, he, I think was a product of his time that he thought life was there. But inevitably he even wrote about it extensively.

01:33:26,402 --> 01:33:27,774
SPEAKER_1:  And so when he saw...

01:33:28,034 --> 01:33:32,894
SPEAKER_1:  these lines, these lineae on the surface of Mars, to him it was just obvious they were canals.

01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:39,134
SPEAKER_1:  And he was, he, that was experimented by us playing out. He was told for one that he had basically the greatest eyesight.

01:33:39,490 --> 01:33:48,158
SPEAKER_1:  Um, out of any of his peers and ophthalmologists had told him that in Boston, that his eyesight was absolutely spectacular. So he just was convinced everything he saw was real.

01:33:48,546 --> 01:33:48,990
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:33:49,346 --> 01:33:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  And secondly, he was convinced there was life there. And so it

01:33:52,802 --> 01:33:55,230
SPEAKER_1:  to him, it just added up and then that kind of wasted.

01:33:55,906 --> 01:33:59,166
SPEAKER_1:  decades of research of treating the idea.

01:33:59,554 --> 01:34:02,878
SPEAKER_1:  of Mars being inhabited by this canal civilization.

01:34:03,362 --> 01:34:07,390
SPEAKER_1:  But on the other hand, it's maybe not a waste because it is a lesson in history of.

01:34:07,618 --> 01:34:09,342
SPEAKER_1:  how we should be always on guard.

01:34:09,666 --> 01:34:12,510
SPEAKER_1:  against our own preconceptions and biases about what...

01:34:13,090 --> 01:34:18,078
SPEAKER_1:  whether life is out there and furthermore, what types of things life might do if it is there.

01:34:18,818 --> 01:34:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  If I were running this simulation, which we'll also talk about because you make the case against it.

01:34:23,298 --> 01:34:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  But if I were running a simulation, I would definitely put you in a room with an alien.

01:34:27,074 --> 01:34:29,758
SPEAKER_0:  and just to see you mentally freak out for hours at a time.

01:34:30,082 --> 01:34:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, you for sure would have thought...

01:34:32,546 --> 01:34:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  You will be.

01:34:33,954 --> 01:34:35,550
SPEAKER_0:  Convince that you've lost your mind.

01:34:36,162 --> 01:34:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, no, not that, but I mean, like, if we discover...

01:34:39,970 --> 01:34:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  life we discovered interesting new physical phenomena.

01:34:42,818 --> 01:34:48,414
SPEAKER_0:  I think the right approach is definitely to be extremely skeptical and be very, very careful about things you want to be true.

01:34:48,930 --> 01:34:57,182
SPEAKER_1:  That's, that's, I'm not like some extreme denialist of evidence. If there was, if there was compelling evidence for life on another planet, I would.

01:34:57,762 --> 01:35:02,814
SPEAKER_1:  be the first one to be celebrating that and be shaking hands with the alien on the White House lawn. Whatever.

01:35:03,170 --> 01:35:13,630
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I grew up with Star Trek and that was my fantasy was to, you know, be Captain Kirk and fly across the stars, meeting at the civilization. So there's nothing more I'd want to be true as I've said, but, um.

01:35:14,754 --> 01:35:19,454
SPEAKER_1:  We just have to guard against it when we're assessing data.

01:35:20,770 --> 01:35:21,118
SPEAKER_1:  Uh

01:35:21,634 --> 01:35:24,670
SPEAKER_1:  I have to say I'm very skeptical that we will ever have that.

01:35:25,442 --> 01:35:29,822
SPEAKER_1:  Star Trek moment, even if, even if there are other civilizations out there.

01:35:30,914 --> 01:35:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  They're never gonna be.

01:35:32,162 --> 01:35:35,038
SPEAKER_1:  at a point which is in technological lockstep with us.

01:35:35,330 --> 01:35:36,606
SPEAKER_1:  similar development.

01:35:36,994 --> 01:35:38,206
SPEAKER_1:  Even

01:35:38,786 --> 01:35:40,990
SPEAKER_1:  intellectually the idea that they could.

01:35:41,410 --> 01:35:41,790
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

01:35:42,114 --> 01:35:44,702
SPEAKER_1:  have a conversation with us even through a translator.

01:35:45,058 --> 01:35:51,742
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, we can't communicate with Humback whales. We can't communicate with dolphins in a meaningful way. We can sort of bark orders at them, but we can't.

01:35:52,194 --> 01:35:55,390
SPEAKER_1:  have abstract conversations with them about things.

01:35:55,714 --> 01:35:56,990
SPEAKER_1:  Um, and so.

01:35:57,314 --> 01:35:59,390
SPEAKER_1:  the idea that we will ever have that.

01:35:59,970 --> 01:36:00,702
SPEAKER_1:  fulfilling.

01:36:00,994 --> 01:36:03,582
SPEAKER_1:  conversation I'm deeply skeptical of. But I think...

01:36:04,002 --> 01:36:06,302
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of us are drawn to that, it is maybe a replacement.

01:36:06,786 --> 01:36:10,782
SPEAKER_1:  for God to some degree, that that father figure civilization that might step in.

01:36:11,106 --> 01:36:12,894
SPEAKER_1:  teach us there of our ways and.

01:36:13,122 --> 01:36:15,102
SPEAKER_1:  bestow wisdom upon our civilization.

01:36:16,066 --> 01:36:17,662
SPEAKER_1:  they could equally be a giant fungus.

01:36:17,986 --> 01:36:18,654
SPEAKER_1:  that has.

01:36:19,042 --> 01:36:24,702
SPEAKER_1:  doesn't even understand the idea of social, socialization because it's the only entity on its planet. It just.

01:36:25,442 --> 01:36:27,550
SPEAKER_1:  swells over the entire surface.

01:36:27,938 --> 01:36:34,494
SPEAKER_1:  And it doesn't, it's incredibly intelligent because maybe each node communicates with each other to create essentially a giant neural net.

01:36:34,786 --> 01:36:35,166
SPEAKER_1:  But...

01:36:35,586 --> 01:36:38,974
SPEAKER_1:  It has no sense of what communication even is. So...

01:36:39,810 --> 01:36:44,478
SPEAKER_1:  alien life is out there is surely going to be extremely diverse. I'm pretty skeptical that we'll ever get.

01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:48,094
SPEAKER_1:  fantasy moment I always had as a kid of

01:36:48,546 --> 01:36:50,686
SPEAKER_1:  having a dialogue within the civilization.

01:36:50,978 --> 01:36:51,998
SPEAKER_0:  So dialogue.

01:36:52,226 --> 01:36:55,358
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, what about noticing them? What about noticing signals?

01:36:55,874 --> 01:36:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  Do you hope?

01:36:57,250 --> 01:37:02,366
SPEAKER_0:  So one thing we've been talking about is getting signatures, biosignatures, techno signatures about other planets.

01:37:02,882 --> 01:37:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe.

01:37:03,842 --> 01:37:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  I feel extremely lucky in our lifetime to be able to meet

01:37:07,362 --> 01:37:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  life forms.

01:37:09,122 --> 01:37:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  uh... get evidence of living or dead life forms on mars or the moons of jupiter and saturn what about getting signals from outer space interstellar signals

01:37:18,242 --> 01:37:20,862
SPEAKER_0:  What would those signals potentially look like?

01:37:22,114 --> 01:37:30,238
SPEAKER_1:  That's a hard question to answer because we are essentially engaging in Xeno-psychology to some degree. What are the activities of another civilization?

01:37:31,234 --> 01:37:31,838
SPEAKER_1:  But a lot of that...

01:37:32,066 --> 01:37:33,941
SPEAKER_0:  What is the word xeno-psychology? What is the word xeno-psychology?

01:37:33,941 --> 01:37:34,910
SPEAKER_1:  interrupt mean.

01:37:35,362 --> 01:37:43,038
SPEAKER_1:  Well, maybe I'm just fabricating that word really, but they're trying to guess at the, um, the machinations and motivations of.

01:37:43,298 --> 01:37:44,862
SPEAKER_1:  another intelligent being that

01:37:45,346 --> 01:37:48,446
SPEAKER_1:  was completely evolutionary divorced from us.

01:37:48,738 --> 01:37:49,182
SPEAKER_1:  for sick.

01:37:49,442 --> 01:37:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  Like you said, exomoons, it's exopsychology.

01:37:51,682 --> 01:37:57,342
SPEAKER_1:  Extrasolar. Yeah. Psychology. Yeah. Uh, alien psychology is another way of maybe making it more grounded, but.

01:37:57,634 --> 01:37:58,142
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:37:58,658 --> 01:37:59,166
SPEAKER_1:  The

01:37:59,426 --> 01:38:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  We can't really guess at their motivations too well, but we can look at the sorts of behaviours we engage in.

01:38:05,890 --> 01:38:07,070
SPEAKER_1:  and at least look for them.

01:38:07,554 --> 01:38:17,726
SPEAKER_1:  Um, we're always guilty that when we look for bio signatures, we're really looking for, and even when we look for planets, we're looking for templates of earth. When we look for bio signatures, we're looking for templates of earth based life.

01:38:18,178 --> 01:38:23,934
SPEAKER_1:  When we look for tetanus signatures, we tend to be looking for templates of our own behaviors or extrapolations of our behaviors.

01:38:24,386 --> 01:38:29,054
SPEAKER_1:  Um, so there's a very long list of tennis signatures that

01:38:29,314 --> 01:38:31,230
SPEAKER_1:  people have suggested we could look for the.

01:38:31,458 --> 01:38:33,950
SPEAKER_1:  The earliest ones were of course Radio Beacons.

01:38:34,402 --> 01:38:37,278
SPEAKER_1:  That was sort of Project Osmo that Frank Drake was involved in.

01:38:37,890 --> 01:38:39,678
SPEAKER_1:  I'm trying to look for radio signatures.

01:38:40,002 --> 01:38:41,278
SPEAKER_1:  which could either be.

01:38:41,634 --> 01:38:42,686
SPEAKER_1:  just like.

01:38:43,074 --> 01:38:48,446
SPEAKER_1:  blurting out high power radio signals saying, hey, we're here, or could even have encoded within them.

01:38:48,802 --> 01:38:53,822
SPEAKER_1:  galactic encyclopedias for us to unlock, which has always been the allure of the radio technique.

01:38:54,210 --> 01:38:54,686
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:38:54,946 --> 01:38:57,758
SPEAKER_1:  but there could also be unintentional signatures.

01:38:58,050 --> 01:39:04,126
SPEAKER_1:  For example, you can have something like the satellite system that we've produced on the Earth's artificial satellite system, Starlink.

01:39:04,482 --> 01:39:06,078
SPEAKER_1:  type systems we mentioned.

01:39:06,306 --> 01:39:11,166
SPEAKER_1:  You could detect the glint of light across those satellites as they orbit around the planet.

01:39:11,554 --> 01:39:11,998
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:39:12,482 --> 01:39:18,206
SPEAKER_1:  You could set a geostationary satellite belt which would block out some light as the planet transited across the star.

01:39:18,754 --> 01:39:22,846
SPEAKER_1:  You could detect solar panels potentially spectrally on the surface of the planet.

01:39:23,170 --> 01:39:26,014
SPEAKER_1:  Heat Island effects, New York is hotter than New York state.

01:39:26,274 --> 01:39:30,398
SPEAKER_1:  by a couple of degrees because the heat island effect of the city and so you could thermally map

01:39:30,850 --> 01:39:32,702
SPEAKER_1:  different planets and detect these. So.

01:39:33,346 --> 01:39:34,814
SPEAKER_1:  It's a large array.

01:39:35,202 --> 01:39:36,958
SPEAKER_1:  of things that we do.

01:39:37,282 --> 01:39:40,574
SPEAKER_1:  that we can go out and hypothesize we could look for.

01:39:40,930 --> 01:39:45,502
SPEAKER_1:  And then on the furthest end of the scale, we have things which go far beyond our capabilities.

01:39:45,794 --> 01:39:53,886
SPEAKER_1:  such as warp drive signatures, which have been proposed. You get these bright flashes of light or even gravitational wave detections from LIGO could be detected.

01:39:54,370 --> 01:39:54,846
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:39:55,170 --> 01:39:56,894
SPEAKER_1:  You could have Dyson spheres.

01:39:57,154 --> 01:40:05,086
SPEAKER_1:  the idea of covering a star is completely covered by some kind of structure which collects all the light from the star to power the civilization.

01:40:05,634 --> 01:40:09,598
SPEAKER_1:  And that would be pretty easily detectable to some degree.

01:40:10,466 --> 01:40:11,710
SPEAKER_1:  transferring all of the

01:40:12,162 --> 01:40:13,214
SPEAKER_1:  visible light.

01:40:13,634 --> 01:40:16,894
SPEAKER_1:  Thermodynamically it has to be re-emitted so it would come out as infrared light.

01:40:17,154 --> 01:40:19,454
SPEAKER_1:  so you'd have an incredibly bright infrared star.

01:40:19,810 --> 01:40:21,854
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, one that was visibly...

01:40:22,498 --> 01:40:24,382
SPEAKER_1:  not present at all, and so there would be...

01:40:24,770 --> 01:40:26,942
SPEAKER_1:  pretty intriguing signature to look for.

01:40:27,330 --> 01:40:28,455
SPEAKER_1:  Is there effort?

01:40:28,455 --> 01:40:32,955
SPEAKER_0:  to look for something like that for different Dyson spheres out there for with the with the strong infrared

01:40:32,955 --> 01:40:39,550
SPEAKER_1:  signal. There has been. Yeah, there has been and there's been, I think in the literature, there was one with the IRAS satellite, which is an infrared satellite.

01:40:39,970 --> 01:40:42,654
SPEAKER_1:  They targeted, I think, a vote of 100,000 stars.

01:40:43,106 --> 01:40:45,246
SPEAKER_1:  nearby stars and found no

01:40:45,666 --> 01:40:48,926
SPEAKER_1:  convincing examples of what looked like a Dyson Sphere Star.

01:40:49,218 --> 01:40:53,342
SPEAKER_1:  And then Jason Wright and his team extended this, I think, using Wwise.

01:40:53,698 --> 01:40:55,198
SPEAKER_1:  which is another infrared satellite.

01:40:55,490 --> 01:40:57,470
SPEAKER_1:  to look around galaxies.

01:40:57,986 --> 01:41:01,374
SPEAKER_1:  could an entire galaxy have been converted into Dyson spheres?

01:41:01,730 --> 01:41:07,262
SPEAKER_1:  or a significant fraction of the galaxy, which is basically the, the kind of share of type three, right? This is the.

01:41:07,554 --> 01:41:11,230
SPEAKER_1:  when you've basically mastered the entire galactic pool of resources.

01:41:11,746 --> 01:41:20,318
SPEAKER_1:  And again, out of 100,000 nearby galaxies, there appears to be no compelling examples of what looks like a Dyson galaxy, if you want to call it that.

01:41:20,866 --> 01:41:21,566
SPEAKER_1:  Um, so.

01:41:21,954 --> 01:41:23,390
SPEAKER_1:  That by no means...

01:41:24,034 --> 01:41:24,702
SPEAKER_1:  proves that.

01:41:25,154 --> 01:41:25,502
SPEAKER_1:  day.

01:41:26,018 --> 01:41:29,822
SPEAKER_1:  don't exist or don't happen, but it seems like it's an unusual behaviour.

01:41:30,306 --> 01:41:35,646
SPEAKER_1:  for a civilization to get to that stage of development and start harvesting the entire stellar output.

01:41:36,514 --> 01:41:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  Unusually, yes, I and I mean like oh it's super interesting with gravitational waves

01:41:42,370 --> 01:41:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  if that kind of experiment could start seeing some weirdness, some weird signals.

01:41:47,298 --> 01:41:47,742
SPEAKER_0:  some

01:41:48,322 --> 01:41:49,470
SPEAKER_0:  that compare to the-

01:41:49,922 --> 01:41:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  to the power of.

01:41:51,394 --> 01:41:52,382
SPEAKER_0:  cosmic phenomena.

01:41:52,610 --> 01:41:52,926
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:41:53,186 --> 01:41:57,246
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean, it's a whole new window to the universe, not just in terms of astrophysics, but

01:41:57,538 --> 01:42:04,606
SPEAKER_1:  potentially for 10 inches as well. I have to say with the warp drives, I am skeptical that warp drives are possible because

01:42:04,962 --> 01:42:05,374
SPEAKER_1:  You can.

01:42:05,634 --> 01:42:09,502
SPEAKER_1:  you have kind of fundamental problem relativity, you can either really have relativity.

01:42:09,826 --> 01:42:16,926
SPEAKER_1:  Fast and light travel or causality. You can only choose two of those three things. You really can't have all three in a coherent universe.

01:42:17,186 --> 01:42:23,387
SPEAKER_1:  If you have all three, you basically end up with a possibility of these kind of temporal paradoxes and time loops and grandfather paradoxes.

01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:25,246
SPEAKER_0:  Or can't there be pockets of causality?

01:42:25,474 --> 01:42:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  Something like that.

01:42:26,370 --> 01:42:29,575
SPEAKER_0:  like where there's like pockets of consistent.

01:42:29,575 --> 01:42:35,230
SPEAKER_1:  You could design it in that way. You could be, you know, if you had a warp drive or a time machine, essentially, you could be.

01:42:35,554 --> 01:42:35,998
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:42:36,258 --> 01:42:44,190
SPEAKER_1:  You can be very conscious and careful of the way you use it so as to not to cause paradoxes or just do it in a local area or something.

01:42:44,642 --> 01:42:46,270
SPEAKER_1:  But the real fundamental problem is...

01:42:46,498 --> 01:42:47,518
SPEAKER_1:  You always have the...

01:42:47,842 --> 01:42:49,118
SPEAKER_1:  ability to do it.

01:42:49,666 --> 01:42:52,382
SPEAKER_1:  And so in a vast cosmic universe, if...

01:42:52,642 --> 01:42:54,078
SPEAKER_1:  Time machines are all over the place.

01:42:54,722 --> 01:42:55,102
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

01:42:55,970 --> 01:43:03,582
SPEAKER_1:  there's too much risk of someone doing it, right? Of somebody having the option of essentially breaking the universe with it. So this is...

01:43:03,938 --> 01:43:09,918
SPEAKER_1:  A fundamental problem Hawking has this chronology protection conjecture where he said that essentially

01:43:10,210 --> 01:43:19,294
SPEAKER_1:  It's this just can't be allowed because it breaks. It breaks all our laws of physics. If time travel is possible, current laws of physics. Yes. Correct. Yeah. Um, and so.

01:43:19,810 --> 01:43:26,654
SPEAKER_1:  We need to rip up relativity. I mean, that's the point is the current law is physics. So you'd have to rip up our current law of relativity to make sense of how FTL.

01:43:26,946 --> 01:43:32,798
SPEAKER_1:  could live in that universe, because you can't have relativity, FTL and causality sit nicely and play nicely together.

01:43:34,498 --> 01:43:35,550
SPEAKER_0:  but we're currently.

01:43:35,810 --> 01:43:40,685
SPEAKER_0:  don't have quantum mechanics and relativity playing nice together anyway, so it's not like everything is all

01:43:40,685 --> 01:43:43,454
SPEAKER_1:  and that's a little fat. It's certainly not the full picture. It's probably not the determined picture that it must be,

01:43:43,682 --> 01:43:44,862
SPEAKER_1:  More to go. Thank you. Baek still looks really used to hands.

01:43:45,346 --> 01:43:46,471
SPEAKER_1:  Um, so it's already.

01:43:46,471 --> 01:43:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  ripped up so might as well rip it up a little more.

01:43:49,570 --> 01:43:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  And in the process, I actually try to connect the two things.

01:43:53,122 --> 01:43:56,126
SPEAKER_0:  because maybe in the unification of...

01:43:56,514 --> 01:44:00,382
SPEAKER_0:  of the standard model and general relativity may be their lies.

01:44:00,866 --> 01:44:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  some kind of new wisdom.

01:44:02,466 --> 01:44:03,006
SPEAKER_0:  about

01:44:03,682 --> 01:44:06,974
SPEAKER_0:  of about war drives. So by the way, war drives is somehow...

01:44:07,362 --> 01:44:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  Messing with the fabric.

01:44:09,954 --> 01:44:12,254
SPEAKER_0:  of the universe to be able to travel faster than the speed of light.

01:44:12,610 --> 01:44:16,798
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, you're basically bending space time. You could also do it with a wormhole.

01:44:17,858 --> 01:44:19,070
SPEAKER_1:  talking about some of the

01:44:19,298 --> 01:44:26,654
SPEAKER_1:  hypothetical FTL system. It doesn't have to necessarily be the Alcubair drive, the warp drive. It could be any faster than light system, as long as it...

01:44:27,234 --> 01:44:30,517
SPEAKER_1:  travel superluminally it will violate causality.

01:44:30,517 --> 01:44:32,017
SPEAKER_0:  Presumably that will be observable.

01:44:32,017 --> 01:44:32,734
SPEAKER_1:  with LEGO.

01:44:33,762 --> 01:44:38,974
SPEAKER_1:  Potentially, yeah, potentially. It depends on, I think, you know, the properties of whatever the spacecraft is.

01:44:39,330 --> 01:44:39,742
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:44:40,002 --> 01:44:44,606
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, one problem with warp drives is there's all sorts of problems with warp drives.

01:44:44,866 --> 01:44:45,991
SPEAKER_1:  When I started this.

01:44:45,991 --> 01:44:46,741
SPEAKER_0:  It

01:44:46,741 --> 01:44:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  One problem. There's just this one minor problem that we have to get around.

01:44:52,866 --> 01:44:55,806
SPEAKER_1:  When it arrives at its destination, it basically collects.

01:44:56,066 --> 01:44:57,438
SPEAKER_1:  This vast, uh...

01:44:57,762 --> 01:45:03,262
SPEAKER_1:  It has like an event horizon almost at the front of it. And so it collects all this radiation at the front as it goes.

01:45:03,554 --> 01:45:07,262
SPEAKER_1:  And when it arrives, all that radiation gets dumped on its destination.

01:45:07,490 --> 01:45:11,070
SPEAKER_1:  basically completely exterminate the planet it arrives at.

01:45:11,490 --> 01:45:18,398
SPEAKER_1:  That radiation is also incident within the shell itself, there's Hawking radiation occurring within the shell, which is pretty dangerous.

01:45:18,850 --> 01:45:19,326
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:45:19,650 --> 01:45:21,726
SPEAKER_1:  And then it also raises all sorts of...

01:45:22,050 --> 01:45:26,654
SPEAKER_1:  exacerbations of the Fermi paradox, of course, as well. So you might be able to explain why.

01:45:27,010 --> 01:45:28,030
SPEAKER_1:  we don't see.

01:45:28,386 --> 01:45:30,142
SPEAKER_1:  a galactic empire.

01:45:30,594 --> 01:45:36,062
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, even here it's hard. You might be able to explain why we don't see Galactic Empire if everybody's limited to Voyager 2.

01:45:36,546 --> 01:45:39,262
SPEAKER_1:  rocket speeds of like 20 kilometers per second or something.

01:45:39,618 --> 01:45:41,502
SPEAKER_1:  but it's a lot harder to explain.

01:45:41,762 --> 01:45:42,878
SPEAKER_1:  why we don't see.

01:45:43,298 --> 01:45:46,302
SPEAKER_1:  the stars populated by Galactic Empires.

01:45:47,138 --> 01:45:50,590
SPEAKER_1:  when warp drive is eminently possible because it makes...

01:45:50,914 --> 01:45:53,598
SPEAKER_1:  expansion so much more trivial that

01:45:53,890 --> 01:45:54,366
SPEAKER_1:  It's it.

01:45:54,850 --> 01:46:02,206
SPEAKER_1:  It makes our life harder. Um, there was, there's some wonderful simulation work being done out of Rochester where they actually simulate all the stars in the galaxy.

01:46:02,562 --> 01:46:04,190
SPEAKER_1:  or a fraction of them.

01:46:04,610 --> 01:46:07,166
SPEAKER_1:  and they spawn a civilization and one of them.

01:46:07,586 --> 01:46:10,142
SPEAKER_1:  and they let it spread out at sublight speeds.

01:46:10,498 --> 01:46:11,486
SPEAKER_1:  And actually the very...

01:46:11,746 --> 01:46:16,606
SPEAKER_1:  mixing of the stars themselves, because the stars are not static, they're in orbit of the galactic centre and they

01:46:16,834 --> 01:46:18,462
SPEAKER_1:  have crossing paths with each other.

01:46:19,042 --> 01:46:22,238
SPEAKER_1:  If you just have a range of even like five light years.

01:46:22,562 --> 01:46:26,494
SPEAKER_1:  and your speed is of order of a few percent the speed of light is the maximum you can muster.

01:46:26,722 --> 01:46:32,350
SPEAKER_1:  you can populate the entire galaxy within something like 100,000, to about a million years or so.

01:46:32,898 --> 01:46:36,222
SPEAKER_1:  So in a fraction of the lifetime of the galaxy itself.

01:46:36,578 --> 01:46:38,014
SPEAKER_1:  And so this raises some.

01:46:38,658 --> 01:46:41,726
SPEAKER_1:  fairly serious problems because

01:46:42,178 --> 01:46:42,526
SPEAKER_1:  If.

01:46:42,818 --> 01:46:46,974
SPEAKER_1:  any civilization in the entire history of the galaxy decided to do that.

01:46:47,394 --> 01:46:52,894
SPEAKER_1:  then either we shouldn't be here or we happen to live in this kind of rare pocket where they chose not to.

01:46:53,378 --> 01:46:54,206
SPEAKER_1:  populate to.

01:46:54,626 --> 01:46:55,806
SPEAKER_1:  And so this is sometimes called.

01:46:56,034 --> 01:46:57,758
SPEAKER_1:  Fact A, hearts fact A.

01:46:58,018 --> 01:46:58,398
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:46:58,850 --> 01:47:00,670
SPEAKER_1:  as the fact is that.

01:47:01,090 --> 01:47:04,830
SPEAKER_1:  a civilization is not here now, an alien civilization has not.

01:47:05,218 --> 01:47:07,198
SPEAKER_1:  is not in present occupation of the earth.

01:47:07,586 --> 01:47:09,150
SPEAKER_1:  and that's difficult to...

01:47:10,114 --> 01:47:13,438
SPEAKER_1:  resolve with the apparent ease at which even

01:47:14,114 --> 01:47:19,166
SPEAKER_1:  a small extrapolation of our own technology could potentially populate a galaxy.

01:47:19,458 --> 01:47:20,798
SPEAKER_1:  in far faster than.

01:47:21,058 --> 01:47:21,886
SPEAKER_1:  history.

01:47:22,754 --> 01:47:23,166
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:47:23,426 --> 01:47:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  to me.

01:47:24,290 --> 01:47:24,926
SPEAKER_0:  By the way.

01:47:25,442 --> 01:47:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, the firm paradox is truly a paradox for me.

01:47:30,018 --> 01:47:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  I suspect that if alien visited Earth.

01:47:33,634 --> 01:47:35,582
SPEAKER_0:  I suspect if they do.

01:47:35,842 --> 01:47:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:47:36,962 --> 01:47:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  if they are everywhere.

01:47:38,370 --> 01:47:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  I think they're already here.

01:47:39,586 --> 01:47:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  and we're too dumb to see it.

01:47:41,858 --> 01:47:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  but leaving that aside.

01:47:43,298 --> 01:47:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  Mm-hmm.

01:47:44,546 --> 01:47:46,910
SPEAKER_0:  I think we should be able to in that case.

01:47:47,266 --> 01:47:48,446
SPEAKER_0:  have very strong.

01:47:50,050 --> 01:47:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  obvious signals when we look up at the stars.

01:47:53,282 --> 01:47:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  at the emanation of energy.

01:47:55,490 --> 01:47:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  required. We will see. We will see.

01:47:58,402 --> 01:47:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  We'll see some weirdness.

01:48:00,034 --> 01:48:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  that like where these are these kinds of stars and these are these kinds of stars that are being messed with. Like leveraging the nuclear fusion of stars.

01:48:08,066 --> 01:48:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  to do something useful. The fact that we don't really see that.

01:48:12,034 --> 01:48:17,342
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe you can correct me. Wouldn't we be able to, if there is like alien civilizations running galaxies.

01:48:17,762 --> 01:48:22,974
SPEAKER_0:  Wouldn't we see weirdnesses from an astronomy perspective with the way the stars are behaving?

01:48:23,362 --> 01:48:34,942
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean, it depends exactly what they're doing, but I mean, the Dyson Sphere example is one that we already discussed where a survey of 100,000 nearby galaxies find that they are not, have all been transformed into Dyson Sphere collectors.

01:48:35,490 --> 01:48:35,966
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:48:36,418 --> 01:48:44,926
SPEAKER_1:  You could also imagine them doing things like, we wrote a paper about this recently of starlifting, where you can extend the life of your star by scooping mass off the star. So you'd be with, you know.

01:48:45,154 --> 01:48:46,750
SPEAKER_1:  doing stellar engineering essentially.

01:48:47,298 --> 01:48:47,742
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:48:48,066 --> 01:48:50,910
SPEAKER_1:  space if you're doing a huge amount of asteroid mining.

01:48:51,330 --> 01:48:58,046
SPEAKER_1:  you would have a spectral signature because you're basically filling the solar system with dust. By doing that there'd be debris from that activity.

01:48:58,498 --> 01:49:00,222
SPEAKER_1:  And so there are...

01:49:00,770 --> 01:49:02,590
SPEAKER_1:  some limits on this.

01:49:02,978 --> 01:49:04,862
SPEAKER_1:  Certainly we don't see...

01:49:05,858 --> 01:49:13,118
SPEAKER_1:  uh, you know, bright flashes, which would be, you know, one of these consequences of what drivers have said is as they decelerate, they produce these bright flashes of light.

01:49:13,666 --> 01:49:16,222
SPEAKER_1:  We don't seem to see evidence of those kind of things.

01:49:16,578 --> 01:49:17,086
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:49:17,666 --> 01:49:23,390
SPEAKER_1:  We don't see anything obvious around the nearby stars or the stars that we've severed in detail beyond that.

01:49:24,194 --> 01:49:25,534
SPEAKER_1:  indicate any kind of.

01:49:26,050 --> 01:49:31,518
SPEAKER_1:  artificial civilization, the closest maybe we had was Boyajin Star, there was a lot of interest in

01:49:32,194 --> 01:49:32,958
SPEAKER_1:  Who was a star?

01:49:33,442 --> 01:49:37,022
SPEAKER_1:  that was just very peculiarly dipping in and out as brightness.

01:49:37,506 --> 01:49:46,430
SPEAKER_1:  And it was hypothesized for a time that that may indeed be some kind of Dyson-like structure. So maybe a Dyson sphere that's...

01:49:46,754 --> 01:49:47,390
SPEAKER_1:  half built.

01:49:47,938 --> 01:49:51,838
SPEAKER_1:  And so as it comes in and out, it's blocking out huge swaths of the star.

01:49:52,226 --> 01:49:53,438
SPEAKER_1:  It was very difficult to explain it.

01:49:53,794 --> 01:49:57,086
SPEAKER_1:  really with any kind of planet model at the time.

01:49:57,762 --> 01:49:58,206
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:49:58,466 --> 01:50:09,822
SPEAKER_1:  But an easier hypothesis that was proposed was it could just be a large number of comets or dust or something, or maybe a planet that had broken apart and as its fragments orbit around it blocks out starlight.

01:50:10,402 --> 01:50:10,846
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:50:11,074 --> 01:50:18,206
SPEAKER_1:  It turned out with subsequent observations of that star, which especially the amateur astronomy community made a big contribution to as well.

01:50:18,722 --> 01:50:19,262
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:50:19,618 --> 01:50:22,590
SPEAKER_1:  that the dips were chromatic, which was a...

01:50:22,946 --> 01:50:25,726
SPEAKER_1:  a real important clue that that probably wasn't.

01:50:26,018 --> 01:50:30,750
SPEAKER_1:  solid structure then that was going around it, it was more likely to be dust. Dust is chromatic.

01:50:31,106 --> 01:50:33,822
SPEAKER_1:  By chromatic I mean, it looks different in different colours.

01:50:34,178 --> 01:50:37,950
SPEAKER_1:  so it blocks out more red light than blue light. It was a solid structure.

01:50:38,818 --> 01:50:43,774
SPEAKER_1:  shouldn't do that. It should be opaque, right? A solid metal structure or something.

01:50:44,226 --> 01:50:46,430
SPEAKER_1:  So that was one of the clear indications and the...

01:50:46,882 --> 01:50:47,710
SPEAKER_1:  behavior.

01:50:48,034 --> 01:50:54,878
SPEAKER_1:  of in the way the light changed or the dips changed across wavelengths was fully consistent with the expectations of what small particulates would do.

01:50:55,746 --> 01:50:56,222
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:50:56,578 --> 01:50:59,230
SPEAKER_1:  And so that's, that's very hard. I mean, the real problem with.

01:51:00,098 --> 01:51:01,022
SPEAKER_1:  Alien hunting?

01:51:02,210 --> 01:51:06,335
SPEAKER_1:  And the real problem, this is the real problem.

01:51:06,335 --> 01:51:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  The one problem with the warp drive and the one problem.

01:51:08,610 --> 01:51:09,310
SPEAKER_0:  Alien hunting.

01:51:09,410 --> 01:51:11,230
SPEAKER_1:  Yes. Actually, I'd say this.

01:51:11,490 --> 01:51:15,198
SPEAKER_1:  big problems for me with any search for life which includes UFOs.

01:51:15,554 --> 01:51:17,662
SPEAKER_1:  all the way to fossils and Mars.

01:51:18,274 --> 01:51:20,126
SPEAKER_1:  is that aliens have three

01:51:20,418 --> 01:51:22,526
SPEAKER_1:  unique properties as a hypothesis.

01:51:22,914 --> 01:51:26,238
SPEAKER_1:  One is they have essentially unbounded explanatory capability.

01:51:26,754 --> 01:51:27,198
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:51:27,426 --> 01:51:34,270
SPEAKER_1:  There's almost no phenomenon I can show you that you couldn't explain with aliens to some degree. You could say well the aliens just have some super high tech.

01:51:34,658 --> 01:51:36,638
SPEAKER_1:  way of creating that illusion.

01:51:37,026 --> 01:51:37,534
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:51:37,986 --> 01:51:39,230
SPEAKER_1:  The second one would be.

01:51:39,586 --> 01:51:41,758
SPEAKER_1:  unbounded avoidance capacity.

01:51:42,178 --> 01:51:47,966
SPEAKER_1:  So I might see a UFO tomorrow and then the next day and then the next day and then predict I should see it.

01:51:48,226 --> 01:51:49,726
SPEAKER_1:  on Thursday at the end of the week.

01:51:50,114 --> 01:51:53,598
SPEAKER_1:  But then I don't see it, but I could always get out of that and say, well.

01:51:53,858 --> 01:51:56,798
SPEAKER_1:  That's just because they chose not to come here. You know, they have this.

01:51:57,122 --> 01:52:01,150
SPEAKER_1:  They can always avoid future observations fairly easily.

01:52:01,570 --> 01:52:02,046
SPEAKER_1:  Um

01:52:02,402 --> 01:52:03,198
SPEAKER_1:  If you...

01:52:03,458 --> 01:52:08,862
SPEAKER_1:  survey an exoplanet for biosignatures and you don't see oxygen, you don't see methane, that doesn't mean there's no one living there.

01:52:09,314 --> 01:52:19,262
SPEAKER_1:  They could always be either tricking their atmosphere, engineering it. We actually wrote a paper about that, how you can use lasers to hide your biosignatures as advanced civilization.

01:52:19,938 --> 01:52:20,414
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:52:20,738 --> 01:52:24,638
SPEAKER_1:  Or you could just be living underground or under water or something where there's no signage

01:52:24,866 --> 01:52:25,182
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:52:25,410 --> 01:52:26,206
SPEAKER_1:  You can never...

01:52:26,754 --> 01:52:32,158
SPEAKER_1:  really disproved his life on another planet or another star. It has infinite avoidance.

01:52:32,450 --> 01:52:37,438
SPEAKER_1:  And then finally, the third one is that we have incomplete physical understanding of the universe.

01:52:37,890 --> 01:52:44,606
SPEAKER_1:  So if I see a new phenomena, which Boyaj and Star was a good example of that, we saw this new phenomena of these strange dips we'd never seen before.

01:52:45,762 --> 01:52:49,054
SPEAKER_1:  was hypothesized immediately this could be aliens. Like a God of the gaps.

01:52:49,410 --> 01:52:51,806
SPEAKER_1:  but it turned out to be incomplete physical understanding.

01:52:52,162 --> 01:52:55,902
SPEAKER_1:  And so that happens all the time in the first pulsar that was discovered.

01:52:56,578 --> 01:52:57,438
SPEAKER_1:  Same story.

01:52:57,730 --> 01:52:58,942
SPEAKER_1:  um, just limbo.

01:52:59,298 --> 01:52:59,742
SPEAKER_1:  kind of.

01:53:00,002 --> 01:53:08,414
SPEAKER_1:  somewhat tongue-in-cheek called it Little Green Man 1 because it looked a lot like the radio signature that was expected from an alien civilization.

01:53:08,898 --> 01:53:14,110
SPEAKER_1:  But of course it turned out to be a completely new type of star that we had never seen before, which was a neutron star.

01:53:14,594 --> 01:53:17,470
SPEAKER_1:  with these two jets coming out the top of it. And so.

01:53:17,858 --> 01:53:18,334
SPEAKER_1:  um...

01:53:18,594 --> 01:53:21,982
SPEAKER_1:  That's a challenge. Those three things are really...

01:53:22,754 --> 01:53:23,742
SPEAKER_1:  really difficult.

01:53:24,034 --> 01:53:29,374
SPEAKER_1:  in terms of experimental design for a scientist to work around. Something that can explain anything.

01:53:29,666 --> 01:53:32,286
SPEAKER_1:  avoid anything so it's almost un-falsifiable.

01:53:32,770 --> 01:53:34,526
SPEAKER_1:  and could always just be.

01:53:34,754 --> 01:53:40,350
SPEAKER_1:  some degree, as you said, we have this very limited knowledge of the infinite possibilities of physical law.

01:53:40,642 --> 01:53:42,462
SPEAKER_1:  and we're probably only scratching the surface.

01:53:43,106 --> 01:53:46,078
SPEAKER_1:  each time and we've seen it so often in history.

01:53:46,434 --> 01:53:48,894
SPEAKER_1:  we may just be detecting some new phenomena.

01:53:49,410 --> 01:53:50,814
SPEAKER_0:  Well, that last one.

01:53:51,842 --> 01:53:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  I think I'm a little more okay with making mistakes on.

01:53:55,266 --> 01:53:58,334
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, which is exciting still. It's because no matter what.

01:53:58,466 --> 01:54:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  So you might exaggerate the importance of the discovery, but the whole point.

01:54:02,786 --> 01:54:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  Is to try to find stuff in this world that's weird and try to characterize that weirdness. Sure. You can throw a little green man as a label on it.

01:54:10,978 --> 01:54:12,350
SPEAKER_0:  But eventually...

01:54:12,962 --> 01:54:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  it like

01:54:14,114 --> 01:54:20,190
SPEAKER_0:  It's as mysterious and as beautiful as interesting as little agreement that we tend to think that there's some kind of

01:54:20,482 --> 01:54:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  Threshold.

01:54:21,442 --> 01:54:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  but like there's all kinds of weird organisms on this earth that operate very differently than humans that are super interesting. The human mind is super interesting. I mean like uh-

01:54:30,882 --> 01:54:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  Weirdness.

01:54:31,970 --> 01:54:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  and complexity.

01:54:33,954 --> 01:54:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  Is.

01:54:35,650 --> 01:54:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  is as interesting in any of its forms as what we might think from Hollywood what aliens are

01:54:41,442 --> 01:54:44,862
SPEAKER_0:  So like that's okay, looking for weirdnesses on Mars.

01:54:45,346 --> 01:54:48,254
SPEAKER_1:  Okay. That's one of the best sales pitches to do technical work.

01:54:48,610 --> 01:54:53,342
SPEAKER_1:  is that we always have that as our fallback, that we're going to look for alien signatures.

01:54:53,570 --> 01:54:54,814
SPEAKER_1:  If we fail, we're going to...

01:54:55,170 --> 01:54:58,270
SPEAKER_1:  discover some awesome new physics along the way.

01:54:58,658 --> 01:54:59,582
SPEAKER_1:  And even a

01:54:59,938 --> 01:55:04,062
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, if any kind of signature that we detect is always going to be interesting.

01:55:04,482 --> 01:55:05,470
SPEAKER_1:  And so that.

01:55:05,698 --> 01:55:07,902
SPEAKER_1:  that compels us to.

01:55:08,386 --> 01:55:13,310
SPEAKER_1:  have not only the question of looking for life in the universe, but it gives us a strong sense of meaning.

01:55:13,538 --> 01:55:19,582
SPEAKER_1:  scientific grounding as to why this sort of research should be funded and should be executed because it always pushes the frontiers knowledge

01:55:19,938 --> 01:55:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  I wonder if we'll be able to discover and be open enough.

01:55:24,322 --> 01:55:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  to a broad definition of aliens, where we see some kind of techno signature.

01:55:29,186 --> 01:55:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  Basically like a touring test, like this thing is intelligent.

01:55:32,226 --> 01:55:32,542
SPEAKER_0:  Hmm.

01:55:33,154 --> 01:55:35,646
SPEAKER_0:  Like it's processing information in a very interesting way.

01:55:36,034 --> 01:55:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  But you can say that about chemistry, you can say that about physics.

01:55:40,450 --> 01:55:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  maybe not physics chemistry they can't just think

01:55:43,522 --> 01:55:44,798
SPEAKER_0:  complex chemistry.

01:55:45,122 --> 01:55:48,062
SPEAKER_0:  say that this is processing, this is storing information.

01:55:48,450 --> 01:55:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  This is propagating information over time.

01:55:52,386 --> 01:55:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  I want, I-

01:55:54,722 --> 01:55:56,958
SPEAKER_0:  It's a gray area between a living organism.

01:55:57,186 --> 01:55:58,238
SPEAKER_0:  we'll call an alien.

01:55:58,466 --> 01:56:01,091
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that's super interesting. It's able to carry some kind of a-

01:56:01,091 --> 01:56:01,694
SPEAKER_1:  intelligence.

01:56:02,082 --> 01:56:03,582
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, information is...

01:56:04,066 --> 01:56:04,638
SPEAKER_1:  A really.

01:56:05,122 --> 01:56:08,190
SPEAKER_1:  useful way to frame what we're looking for though because it

01:56:08,642 --> 01:56:10,430
SPEAKER_1:  then you're divorced from.

01:56:11,010 --> 01:56:12,638
SPEAKER_1:  making assumptions about even

01:56:12,866 --> 01:56:15,614
SPEAKER_1:  civilization necessarily or anything like that.

01:56:15,970 --> 01:56:18,078
SPEAKER_1:  any kind of information rig signature. Indeed.

01:56:18,402 --> 01:56:25,054
SPEAKER_1:  you can take things like the light curve from Biogenstar and ask what is the minimum number of free parameters or

01:56:25,378 --> 01:56:28,734
SPEAKER_1:  the minimum information content that must be encoded within this light curve.

01:56:29,154 --> 01:56:29,598
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:56:30,274 --> 01:56:34,718
SPEAKER_1:  The hope is that maybe from, you know, a good example would be from a radio signature, you detect something.

01:56:35,682 --> 01:56:41,022
SPEAKER_1:  has a thousand megabytes of parameters essentially contained within it.

01:56:41,538 --> 01:56:41,886
SPEAKER_1:  That's.

01:56:42,114 --> 01:56:47,326
SPEAKER_1:  pretty clearly at that point, not the product of a natural process, but at least any natural process that we could possibly...

01:56:47,586 --> 01:56:49,630
SPEAKER_1:  Imagine without current understanding the universe

01:56:49,890 --> 01:56:50,558
SPEAKER_1:  And so...

01:56:51,106 --> 01:56:58,238
SPEAKER_1:  Thinking, even if we can't decode, which actually I'm skeptical would be able to ever decode in our lifetimes, it would probably take decades to fully.

01:56:58,594 --> 01:57:00,350
SPEAKER_1:  ever figure out what they're trying to tell us.

01:57:00,578 --> 01:57:05,694
SPEAKER_1:  But if there was a message there, we could at least know that there is a high information content.

01:57:06,146 --> 01:57:09,822
SPEAKER_1:  and there is complexity and that this is a attempt.

01:57:10,210 --> 01:57:12,318
SPEAKER_1:  communication information transfer.

01:57:12,610 --> 01:57:13,822
SPEAKER_1:  and leave it to her.

01:57:14,146 --> 01:57:17,630
SPEAKER_1:  subsequent generations to figure out what exactly it is they're trying to say.

01:57:18,626 --> 01:57:19,198
SPEAKER_1:  What?

01:57:19,298 --> 01:57:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  Again, wild question and thank you for.

01:57:23,362 --> 01:57:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  entertaining them. I really really appreciate that.

01:57:27,426 --> 01:57:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  but what kind of signal in our lifetime, what kind of thing do you think might happen?

01:57:32,770 --> 01:57:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  could possibly happen.

01:57:35,458 --> 01:57:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  where the scientific community would be convinced that.

01:57:38,754 --> 01:57:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  There's.

01:57:39,298 --> 01:57:40,670
SPEAKER_0:  alien civilizations out there.

01:57:40,962 --> 01:57:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  Like what?

01:57:42,178 --> 01:57:46,901
SPEAKER_0:  So you already said maybe a strong infrared signature for something like a Dyson Sphere.

01:57:46,901 --> 01:57:50,558
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, that's possibly that that's also in some degree a little bit ambiguous.

01:57:50,850 --> 01:57:51,975
SPEAKER_1:  because that's.

01:57:51,975 --> 01:57:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  challenge. So interrupt this.

01:57:54,050 --> 01:57:54,686
SPEAKER_0:  where

01:57:55,554 --> 01:57:59,454
SPEAKER_0:  Your brain would be like you as a scientist would be like.

01:57:59,906 --> 01:58:02,750
SPEAKER_0:  I know it's ambiguous, but this is really weird. Yeah.

01:58:03,682 --> 01:58:04,158
SPEAKER_1:  I think.

01:58:05,218 --> 01:58:07,806
SPEAKER_1:  If you had some, I can imagine something like a prime number sequence.

01:58:08,514 --> 01:58:12,478
SPEAKER_1:  or a mathematical sequence like the Fibonacci series, something being broadcast. Mathematically.

01:58:12,706 --> 01:58:15,331
SPEAKER_0:  Proveable that this is not a physical phenomenon

01:58:15,331 --> 01:58:24,158
SPEAKER_1:  Right, I mean, yeah, prime numbers is a pretty good case because there's no natural phenomena that produces prime number sequences. It seems to be a purely an abstract mathematical concept as far as I'm aware.

01:58:24,610 --> 01:58:26,206
SPEAKER_1:  And so if we detected.

01:58:26,466 --> 01:58:28,830
SPEAKER_1:  uh, you know, a series of radio blips.

01:58:29,250 --> 01:58:30,846
SPEAKER_1:  that were following that sequence, it would-

01:58:31,522 --> 01:58:34,430
SPEAKER_1:  pretty clear to me or it could even be in a car scene again.

01:58:34,818 --> 01:58:41,022
SPEAKER_1:  suggested that pi could be encoded and that or you might use the hydrogen line but multiplied by pi like some very specific

01:58:41,410 --> 01:58:43,806
SPEAKER_1:  a frequency of the universe, like a hydrogen line.

01:58:44,066 --> 01:58:49,886
SPEAKER_1:  but multiply it by an abstract mathematical constant that would imply strongly that there was someone.

01:58:50,242 --> 01:58:51,646
SPEAKER_1:  behind the scenes operating that.

01:58:52,162 --> 01:58:53,287
SPEAKER_1:  amount of work at

01:58:53,287 --> 01:58:55,070
SPEAKER_0:  I stored in which phenomena though.

01:58:55,458 --> 01:59:00,126
SPEAKER_1:  So in that case, I think of a radio wave, but the information, I mean, we kind of toyed with us.

01:59:01,026 --> 01:59:04,318
SPEAKER_1:  idea in a video I did about hypothetical civilization on my channel.

01:59:05,154 --> 01:59:13,566
SPEAKER_1:  But one kind of fun way, I do want to bring this conversation towards time a little bit and thinking about not just looking for...

01:59:13,826 --> 01:59:15,006
SPEAKER_1:  life and intelligence.

01:59:15,362 --> 01:59:18,718
SPEAKER_1:  around us right now, but looking into the past and even into the future.

01:59:19,266 --> 01:59:21,150
SPEAKER_1:  to some degree or communicating with the future.

01:59:21,666 --> 01:59:25,086
SPEAKER_1:  And so we had this fun experiment of imagining a civilization that was born.

01:59:25,314 --> 01:59:27,550
SPEAKER_1:  at the beginning of the history of the galaxy.

01:59:27,874 --> 01:59:30,494
SPEAKER_1:  and being the first and what it would be like for them. And they would part.

01:59:30,722 --> 01:59:33,566
SPEAKER_1:  desperately searching for evidence of life but couldn't find it.

01:59:33,890 --> 01:59:36,606
SPEAKER_1:  And so they decided to try and leave something behind.

01:59:36,866 --> 01:59:40,286
SPEAKER_1:  for future civilizations to discover, tell them about themselves.

01:59:40,802 --> 01:59:48,734
SPEAKER_1:  But of course a radio signature is not gonna work there because it has a power source and that's a piece of machinery it's gonna eventually break down, it's gonna be hard to maintain that.

01:59:49,090 --> 01:59:51,038
SPEAKER_1:  for billions of years time scale.

01:59:51,426 --> 01:59:53,374
SPEAKER_1:  And so you wanted something that was kind of passive.

01:59:53,762 --> 01:59:57,022
SPEAKER_1:  that doesn't require an energy source but can somehow transmit.

01:59:57,378 --> 01:59:58,142
SPEAKER_1:  Information.

01:59:58,370 --> 02:00:01,822
SPEAKER_1:  which is hard to think about something that satisfies those criteria.

02:00:02,338 --> 02:00:05,534
SPEAKER_1:  But there was a proposal by one of my colleagues, Luke Arnold.

02:00:06,210 --> 02:00:08,670
SPEAKER_1:  which inspired a lot of us in Techno Signatures.

02:00:09,122 --> 02:00:12,094
SPEAKER_1:  And he suggested that you could build artificial transitors.

02:00:12,482 --> 02:00:16,510
SPEAKER_1:  So you could build sheets of material that transit in front of the star.

02:00:16,866 --> 02:00:17,886
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe one.

02:00:18,210 --> 02:00:24,574
SPEAKER_1:  thin sheet passes across first, then two, then three, then five, and seven, so you could follow the prime number sequence of these.

02:00:24,802 --> 02:00:26,366
SPEAKER_1:  and so there'd be a clear indication.

02:00:26,754 --> 02:00:28,318
SPEAKER_1:  that someone had manufactured those.

02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:37,694
SPEAKER_1:  They don't require any energy source because they're just sheets of material in order of the star. They would eventually degrade from micrometeorites, maybe they would always become destabilised, but...

02:00:37,986 --> 02:00:40,062
SPEAKER_1:  They should have lifetimes far exceeding.

02:00:40,482 --> 02:00:41,822
SPEAKER_1:  the lifetime of any...

02:00:42,082 --> 02:00:47,070
SPEAKER_1:  battery or mechanical electronic system that we could, at least with our technology, conceive building.

02:00:47,458 --> 02:00:49,982
SPEAKER_1:  And so you can imagine an extending that and how could you

02:00:50,434 --> 02:00:53,726
SPEAKER_1:  in code, not just a prime number sequence, but maybe in the spatial pattern.

02:00:54,114 --> 02:00:56,574
SPEAKER_1:  of this very complex light curve we see.

02:00:56,930 --> 02:01:00,862
SPEAKER_1:  you could encode more and more information through 2D shapes and

02:01:01,154 --> 02:01:02,878
SPEAKER_1:  the way those odd quotations happen.

02:01:03,202 --> 02:01:03,934
SPEAKER_1:  and maybe...

02:01:04,610 --> 02:01:06,174
SPEAKER_1:  You could even encode.

02:01:06,466 --> 02:01:11,806
SPEAKER_1:  messages and in-depth information from that. You could even imagine it being like a

02:01:12,418 --> 02:01:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  a lower layer of information, which is just the prime number sequence, but then you look closely and you see a second layer of data.

02:01:17,314 --> 02:01:18,238
SPEAKER_1:  the smaller.

02:01:18,594 --> 02:01:23,294
SPEAKER_1:  Divids embedded within those that have a deeper layer of information to extract.

02:01:23,746 --> 02:01:24,126
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:01:24,482 --> 02:01:26,046
SPEAKER_1:  And so to me, something like that would be.

02:01:26,626 --> 02:01:30,846
SPEAKER_1:  really compelling that that was somebody who would mind if in essence just a

02:01:31,234 --> 02:01:32,542
SPEAKER_1:  very impressive hoax.

02:01:32,802 --> 02:01:36,177
SPEAKER_1:  That would be a pretty compelling evidence for civilization.

02:01:36,177 --> 02:01:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  the methods.

02:01:37,314 --> 02:01:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  of uh...

02:01:39,138 --> 02:01:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  astronomy right now.

02:01:40,930 --> 02:01:42,206
SPEAKER_0:  are kind of marching towards.

02:01:43,522 --> 02:01:45,397
SPEAKER_0:  being able to better and better detect this.

02:01:45,397 --> 02:01:45,982
SPEAKER_1:  like that.

02:01:47,010 --> 02:01:47,454
SPEAKER_1:  I mean...

02:01:47,714 --> 02:01:51,486
SPEAKER_1:  To some degree, it's just building bigger aperture in space, the bigger the telescope.

02:01:51,746 --> 02:01:52,958
SPEAKER_1:  the finer.

02:01:53,218 --> 02:01:55,843
SPEAKER_1:  ability to detect those minute signals.

02:01:55,843 --> 02:01:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  What is the current scientific community?

02:01:58,786 --> 02:02:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  but just the observations that are happening now.

02:02:01,314 --> 02:02:02,718
SPEAKER_0:  Do you think they're ready for her?

02:02:03,202 --> 02:02:04,350
SPEAKER_0:  prime number sequence.

02:02:04,770 --> 02:02:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  in the

02:02:06,722 --> 02:02:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  So if we're using the current method, the transit timing.

02:02:10,658 --> 02:02:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  variation method.

02:02:12,162 --> 02:02:12,478
SPEAKER_0:  Like.

02:02:12,898 --> 02:02:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  Do you think?

02:02:14,178 --> 02:02:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  You're ready. Do you have the tools?

02:02:16,450 --> 02:02:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  to detect the prime number sequence.

02:02:19,010 --> 02:02:19,326
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

02:02:19,618 --> 02:02:20,958
SPEAKER_1:  for sure. I mean, there's...

02:02:21,826 --> 02:02:28,830
SPEAKER_1:  200,000 stars that Kepler monitored and it monitored them all the time. It took a photo of each one of them every 30 minutes, measured their brightness.

02:02:29,218 --> 02:02:31,966
SPEAKER_1:  and it did that for four and a half years.

02:02:32,290 --> 02:02:35,486
SPEAKER_1:  And so you have already, and Tess is doing it right now, another mission.

02:02:35,778 --> 02:02:39,198
SPEAKER_1:  And so you have already an existing catalog and people are.

02:02:39,650 --> 02:02:45,982
SPEAKER_1:  Genuinely scouring through each of those light curves with automated machine learning techniques. We even developed some in our own team.

02:02:46,562 --> 02:02:48,254
SPEAKER_1:  that can look for weird behaviour.

02:02:48,770 --> 02:02:54,686
SPEAKER_1:  We wrote a code called the weird detector for instance, that was just the most generic thing possible.

02:02:55,010 --> 02:02:55,358
SPEAKER_1:  Let's-

02:02:55,682 --> 02:03:09,054
SPEAKER_1:  Don't assume anything about the signal shape. Just look for anything that repeats. The signal shape can be anything. Can we kind of learn the template of the signal from the data itself? And then it's like a template matching filter to see if that repeats many, many times in the data.

02:03:09,378 --> 02:03:11,198
SPEAKER_1:  And so we actually applied that and found.

02:03:11,522 --> 02:03:13,758
SPEAKER_1:  A bunch of interesting stuff, but we didn't see.

02:03:14,114 --> 02:03:17,598
SPEAKER_1:  anything that was the prime number sequence, at least in the capital data.

02:03:17,858 --> 02:03:19,230
SPEAKER_1:  That's 200,000 stars.

02:03:19,458 --> 02:03:20,382
SPEAKER_1:  Which sounds like a lot.

02:03:20,674 --> 02:03:26,302
SPEAKER_1:  But compared to 200 billion stars in the Milky Way, it's really just scratching the surface.

02:03:26,658 --> 02:03:27,262
SPEAKER_1:  So one.

02:03:27,522 --> 02:03:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  because there could be something much more generalizable than the prime number sequence.

02:03:31,138 --> 02:03:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  It's ultimately the question of...

02:03:33,090 --> 02:03:34,814
SPEAKER_0:  signal that's very difficult to compress.

02:03:35,490 --> 02:03:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  in the general.

02:03:37,026 --> 02:03:40,446
SPEAKER_0:  sensible compress means. So maybe as we get better and better machine learning methods.

02:03:40,898 --> 02:03:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  that automatically figure out.

02:03:43,522 --> 02:03:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  analyze the data to understand how to compress it.

02:03:46,626 --> 02:03:49,950
SPEAKER_0:  You'll be able to discover data that's for some reason not compressible.

02:03:50,818 --> 02:03:53,182
SPEAKER_0:  But then, you know, compression really...

02:03:53,602 --> 02:03:55,358
SPEAKER_0:  is a bottomless pit because like.

02:03:55,618 --> 02:03:58,243
SPEAKER_0:  That's really what intelligence is, is being able to compress and

02:03:58,243 --> 02:04:00,798
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. And to some degree the more you.

02:04:01,314 --> 02:04:05,726
SPEAKER_1:  I would imagine, I don't work in compression algorithms, but I would imagine the more you compress your signal, the more you compress your signal.

02:04:06,274 --> 02:04:06,782
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:04:07,426 --> 02:04:07,998
SPEAKER_1:  The...

02:04:08,226 --> 02:04:13,854
SPEAKER_1:  The more assumptions that kind of go on behalf of the decoder, the more skilled they really have to be.

02:04:14,146 --> 02:04:15,070
SPEAKER_1:  You know, some of the

02:04:15,394 --> 02:04:17,118
SPEAKER_1:  a prime number sequence is completely...

02:04:17,538 --> 02:04:19,774
SPEAKER_1:  unencoded information, essentially.

02:04:20,290 --> 02:04:22,718
SPEAKER_1:  But if you look at the Arecibo message.

02:04:23,554 --> 02:04:28,574
SPEAKER_1:  they were fairly careful with their pixelation of this simple image they sent.

02:04:29,026 --> 02:04:30,142
SPEAKER_1:  to try and...

02:04:31,106 --> 02:04:33,630
SPEAKER_1:  make it as interpretable as possible to be.

02:04:34,562 --> 02:04:39,230
SPEAKER_1:  even a dumb alien would be able to figure out what we're trying to show them here because

02:04:39,554 --> 02:04:40,574
SPEAKER_1:  There's all sorts of.

02:04:40,834 --> 02:04:46,046
SPEAKER_1:  conventions and rules that are built in that we tend to presume when we design our messages.

02:04:46,562 --> 02:04:48,030
SPEAKER_1:  And so if your messages.

02:04:48,546 --> 02:04:50,686
SPEAKER_1:  assuming they know how to do an MP3.

02:04:51,010 --> 02:04:51,678
SPEAKER_1:  Decoder.

02:04:52,226 --> 02:04:54,622
SPEAKER_1:  particular compression algorithm.

02:04:55,138 --> 02:05:00,190
SPEAKER_1:  I'm sure they could eventually reverse engineer it and figure it out, but you're, you're making it.

02:05:00,418 --> 02:05:02,398
SPEAKER_1:  harder for them to get to that.

02:05:03,074 --> 02:05:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  So maybe I always think you probably would have a two tier system, right? You'd probably have some lower tier key.

02:05:08,066 --> 02:05:13,310
SPEAKER_1:  system and then maybe beneath that you'd have a deeper compressed layer of more in-depth information.

02:05:14,082 --> 02:05:15,262
SPEAKER_1:  What about maybe...

02:05:15,746 --> 02:05:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  observing

02:05:17,154 --> 02:05:22,014
SPEAKER_0:  physical actual physical objects. So first let me go to your tweet as a source of inspiration.

02:05:22,370 --> 02:05:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  You tweeted that it's interesting to ponder that if Oort clouds...

02:05:26,402 --> 02:05:27,390
SPEAKER_0:  or ever mind.

02:05:27,906 --> 02:05:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

02:05:29,026 --> 02:05:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  the systems of alien civilizations.

02:05:30,946 --> 02:05:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  mining equipment from billions of years ago could be in our ore cloud since the ore clouds.

02:05:36,642 --> 02:05:42,078
SPEAKER_0:  they extend really, really, really, really far outside the actual star.

02:05:42,434 --> 02:05:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

02:05:43,266 --> 02:05:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  that mining equipment, just like basic boring.

02:05:46,818 --> 02:05:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  mining equipment out there. I don't know if there's something interesting to say about ore claws themselves that

02:05:51,170 --> 02:05:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  that are interesting to you and about possible.

02:05:54,242 --> 02:05:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  Non-shiny.

02:05:56,130 --> 02:05:59,505
SPEAKER_0:  light emitting mining equipment from alien civilization.

02:05:59,505 --> 02:06:02,398
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean, that's what I mean, that's kind of the beauty of.

02:06:02,722 --> 02:06:05,182
SPEAKER_1:  the field of technosignatures and looking for life.

02:06:05,762 --> 02:06:06,334
SPEAKER_1:  is.

02:06:06,946 --> 02:06:13,854
SPEAKER_1:  You can find inspiration and intellectual joy in just the smallest little thing that starts a whole thread of

02:06:14,466 --> 02:06:17,342
SPEAKER_1:  building upon it and wondering about the implications.

02:06:17,762 --> 02:06:21,086
SPEAKER_1:  And so in this case, I was just really struck by.

02:06:21,602 --> 02:06:24,158
SPEAKER_1:  We kind of mentioned this a little bit earlier, the idea that...

02:06:24,642 --> 02:06:27,774
SPEAKER_1:  Stars are not static, we tend to think of the galaxy...

02:06:28,290 --> 02:06:32,990
SPEAKER_1:  as having stars in a certain location from the center of the galaxy, and they kind of live there, but...

02:06:33,218 --> 02:06:34,942
SPEAKER_1:  In truth, the stars are not any.

02:06:35,234 --> 02:06:37,278
SPEAKER_1:  orbiting around the center of the galaxy

02:06:37,762 --> 02:06:38,206
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:06:38,434 --> 02:06:42,174
SPEAKER_1:  But those orbits are themselves changing over time they're processing.

02:06:42,466 --> 02:06:46,942
SPEAKER_1:  And so in fact, the orbits look more like a spirograph if you've ever done those as a kid. Ca

02:06:47,522 --> 02:06:50,558
SPEAKER_1:  whirl around and trace out all sorts of strange patterns.

02:06:50,882 --> 02:06:53,662
SPEAKER_1:  And so the stars intersect with one another.

02:06:54,050 --> 02:06:54,622
SPEAKER_1:  And so...

02:06:54,978 --> 02:06:57,534
SPEAKER_1:  The current closest star to us is Proxima Centauri.

02:06:58,210 --> 02:07:05,662
SPEAKER_1:  which is about 4.2 light years away, but it will not always be the closest star and over millions of years it will be supplanted by other stars.

02:07:06,114 --> 02:07:10,014
SPEAKER_1:  In fact, stars will come even closer than Proxima within just a couple of light years.

02:07:10,306 --> 02:07:14,878
SPEAKER_1:  And that's been happening, not just we can project that will happen over the next few million years.

02:07:15,170 --> 02:07:19,998
SPEAKER_1:  But that's been happening presumably throughout the entire history of the galaxy for billions of years.

02:07:20,386 --> 02:07:26,398
SPEAKER_1:  And so if you went back in time, there would have been all sorts of different nearest stars at different stages of the Earth's history.

02:07:26,882 --> 02:07:28,638
SPEAKER_1:  and those stars are so close.

02:07:29,058 --> 02:07:30,302
SPEAKER_1:  that they're Ork Clouds.

02:07:30,786 --> 02:07:36,638
SPEAKER_1:  do intermix with one another so the Oort Cloud can extend out to even a light year or two around the earth.

02:07:37,154 --> 02:07:43,550
SPEAKER_1:  debate about exactly where it ends. It probably doesn't really have a definitive end, but kind of more just kind of peters out more and more and more.

02:07:43,938 --> 02:07:45,063
SPEAKER_1:  as you go further away.

02:07:45,063 --> 02:07:50,238
SPEAKER_0:  By the way, for people who don't know, NorCloud, I don't know what the technical definition is, but a bunch of rocks that kind of, no.

02:07:50,690 --> 02:07:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  Objects.

02:07:51,970 --> 02:07:56,853
SPEAKER_0:  that orbit the star, and they can extend really, really far.

02:07:56,853 --> 02:07:59,742
SPEAKER_1:  These are objects that probably are mostly icy rich.

02:08:00,066 --> 02:08:04,958
SPEAKER_1:  They were probably formed fairly similar distances to Jupiter and Saturn.

02:08:05,314 --> 02:08:09,374
SPEAKER_1:  but were scattered out through the interactions of those giant planets.

02:08:09,730 --> 02:08:10,142
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:08:10,498 --> 02:08:13,214
SPEAKER_1:  We see a circular disk of objects around us.

02:08:13,474 --> 02:08:16,446
SPEAKER_1:  which kind of looks like the asteroid belt, but just further away called the Kuiper belt.

02:08:16,770 --> 02:08:19,070
SPEAKER_1:  And then further beyond that, you get the orc cloud.

02:08:19,362 --> 02:08:23,678
SPEAKER_1:  And the all cloud is not a disk, it's just a sphere, it kind of surrounds us in all directions.

02:08:24,482 --> 02:08:26,046
SPEAKER_1:  So these are objects that were scattered out.

02:08:26,498 --> 02:08:29,278
SPEAKER_1:  through three dimensionally in all different directions.

02:08:29,762 --> 02:08:32,894
SPEAKER_1:  And so those objects are potentially.

02:08:33,250 --> 02:08:35,838
SPEAKER_1:  resources for us, especially if you were planning.

02:08:36,322 --> 02:08:38,686
SPEAKER_1:  to do an interstellar mission one day.

02:08:38,946 --> 02:08:44,894
SPEAKER_1:  you might want to mine the water that's embedded within those and use that as either oxygen or fuel for your rocket.

02:08:45,314 --> 02:08:46,782
SPEAKER_1:  And so it's quite possible.

02:08:47,202 --> 02:08:53,630
SPEAKER_1:  There's also some rare earth metals and things like that as well, but it's quite possible that a civilization might use or cloud objects as a jumping off point.

02:08:54,178 --> 02:08:54,686
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:08:55,202 --> 02:08:55,646
SPEAKER_1:  or

02:08:56,098 --> 02:09:03,774
SPEAKER_1:  Or in the Kuiper Belt, you have things like Planet 9 evens. There might even be objects beyond in the Oort cloud, which are actually planet-like that we just cannot detect.

02:09:04,226 --> 02:09:07,838
SPEAKER_1:  These objects are very, very faint, so that's why they're so hard to see. I mean, even Planet 9.

02:09:08,514 --> 02:09:12,926
SPEAKER_1:  it's hypothesized to exist, but we've not been able to confirm its existence because

02:09:13,154 --> 02:09:17,406
SPEAKER_1:  It's at something like a thousand AU away from us, a thousand times the distance of the Earth from the Sun.

02:09:17,730 --> 02:09:19,614
SPEAKER_1:  And so even though it's probably larger than the Earth.

02:09:20,226 --> 02:09:25,150
SPEAKER_1:  the amount of light it reflects from the sun. The sun is what just looks like a star at that point, so far away from it.

02:09:26,050 --> 02:09:29,278
SPEAKER_1:  it barely reflects anything back. It's extremely difficult to detect.

02:09:29,730 --> 02:09:33,534
SPEAKER_1:  So there's all sorts of wonders that may be lurking out in the outer solar system.

02:09:34,274 --> 02:09:36,062
SPEAKER_1:  And so this leads you to wonder.

02:09:36,514 --> 02:09:37,022
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:09:38,018 --> 02:09:39,070
SPEAKER_1:  in the Ork Cloud.

02:09:39,842 --> 02:09:43,422
SPEAKER_1:  That Oort cloud must have intermixed with other Oort clouds in the past.

02:09:43,810 --> 02:09:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  And so what fraction of the cloud is...

02:09:47,394 --> 02:09:48,190
SPEAKER_1:

02:09:48,674 --> 02:09:52,382
SPEAKER_1:  belongs to us, belongs to what was scattered from Jupiter and Saturn.

02:09:52,802 --> 02:09:53,918
SPEAKER_1:  What fraction of it?

02:09:54,274 --> 02:09:55,390
SPEAKER_1:  could in fact be.

02:09:55,618 --> 02:09:57,054
SPEAKER_1:  interstellar visitors.

02:09:57,634 --> 02:10:02,110
SPEAKER_1:  And of course, we've got excited about this recently because of Oumuamua, this interstellar asteroid.

02:10:02,690 --> 02:10:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  which seemed to be at the time the first evidence of an interstellar.

02:10:05,762 --> 02:10:06,302
SPEAKER_1:  object.

02:10:07,042 --> 02:10:07,390
SPEAKER_1:  But.

02:10:07,682 --> 02:10:09,726
SPEAKER_1:  When you think about the Alt Cloud intermixing.

02:10:09,954 --> 02:10:14,622
SPEAKER_1:  It may be that a large fraction of comets, comets are seeded from the Oort cloud.

02:10:14,850 --> 02:10:15,710
SPEAKER_1:  eventually come in.

02:10:16,226 --> 02:10:18,654
SPEAKER_1:  Some of those comments may indeed.

02:10:19,010 --> 02:10:21,374
SPEAKER_1:  have been interstellar in the first place that we just didn't know about.

02:10:21,986 --> 02:10:22,974
SPEAKER_1:  through this process.

02:10:23,426 --> 02:10:29,982
SPEAKER_1:  There even is an example, I can't remember the name, there's an example of a comet that has a very peculiar spectral signature that has been hypothesized.

02:10:30,306 --> 02:10:31,294
SPEAKER_1:  to have actually been.

02:10:31,618 --> 02:10:34,142
SPEAKER_1:  and it's not a visitor, but one that was.

02:10:34,498 --> 02:10:36,990
SPEAKER_1:  essentially sourced through this Ork Cloud mixing.

02:10:37,602 --> 02:10:40,126
SPEAKER_1:  And so this is kind of intriguing.

02:10:41,058 --> 02:10:43,518
SPEAKER_1:  It also, you know, the outer solar system is just such a.

02:10:44,066 --> 02:10:48,638
SPEAKER_1:  It's like at the bottom of the ocean, we know so little about what's on the bottom of our own planet's ocean.

02:10:49,122 --> 02:10:54,174
SPEAKER_1:  And we know next to nothing about what's in the outskirts of our own solar system. It's all darkness.

02:10:54,338 --> 02:10:54,718
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

02:10:55,042 --> 02:10:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  So like.

02:10:56,482 --> 02:10:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  That's one of the things is...

02:10:58,626 --> 02:11:00,542
SPEAKER_0:  To understand the phenomena, we need light.

02:11:01,602 --> 02:11:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  and we need to see how light interacts with it or would light emanate from it

02:11:07,234 --> 02:11:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  with most of our universe is darkness. So it's...

02:11:10,210 --> 02:11:14,846
SPEAKER_0:  There could be a lot of interesting stuff. I mean, this is where your interest is with the cool worlds.

02:11:15,298 --> 02:11:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  interesting stuff lurks in the darkness, right?

02:11:17,506 --> 02:11:22,910
SPEAKER_1:  Basically all of us, you know, 400 years of astronomy, our only window into the universe has been light.

02:11:23,490 --> 02:11:27,326
SPEAKER_1:  And that has only changed quite recently with the discovery of gravitational waves.

02:11:27,714 --> 02:11:29,598
SPEAKER_1:  That's now a new window.

02:11:30,050 --> 02:11:36,190
SPEAKER_1:  And hopefully, well, to some degree, I guess, solar neutrinos we've been detecting for our but they come from the Sun, not interstellar space.

02:11:36,546 --> 02:11:46,270
SPEAKER_1:  but we may be able to soon detect neutrino messages as even been hypothesized as a way of communicating between civilizations as well, or just do neutrino telescopes to study the universe.

02:11:46,562 --> 02:11:49,534
SPEAKER_1:  And so there's a growing interest in what we call multi-messenger.

02:11:49,858 --> 02:11:54,142
SPEAKER_1:  astronomy now, so not just messages from light but messages from these.

02:11:54,466 --> 02:11:54,942
SPEAKER_1:  other.

02:11:55,298 --> 02:11:56,446
SPEAKER_1:  physical

02:11:56,674 --> 02:11:57,054
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

02:11:57,634 --> 02:11:59,550
SPEAKER_1:  packets of information that are coming our way.

02:12:00,194 --> 02:12:02,270
SPEAKER_1:  But when it comes to the outer solar system...

02:12:02,946 --> 02:12:05,310
SPEAKER_1:  Light really is our only window. There's two.

02:12:05,634 --> 02:12:11,166
SPEAKER_1:  There's two ways of doing that. One is you detect the light from the Aort Cloud object itself, which as I just said is very, very difficult.

02:12:11,650 --> 02:12:12,638
SPEAKER_1:  There's another trick.

02:12:12,962 --> 02:12:14,174
SPEAKER_1:  which we do in the Kuiper belt.

02:12:14,498 --> 02:12:15,294
SPEAKER_1:  especially

02:12:15,714 --> 02:12:20,446
SPEAKER_1:  and that's called an occultation. And so sometimes those objects will just...

02:12:20,802 --> 02:12:23,582
SPEAKER_1:  pass in front of a distant star just coincidentally.

02:12:23,938 --> 02:12:27,166
SPEAKER_1:  These are very, very brief moments. They last for less than a second.

02:12:27,650 --> 02:12:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  and so you have to have a very fast camera to detect them.

02:12:30,978 --> 02:12:37,054
SPEAKER_1:  Which conventionally astronomers don't usually build fast cameras. Most of the phenomena we observe occurs on hours, minutes, days even.

02:12:37,410 --> 02:12:41,246
SPEAKER_1:  but now we're developing cameras which can take thousands of images per second.

02:12:41,666 --> 02:12:46,974
SPEAKER_1:  and yet do it at the kind of astronomical fidelity that we need for this kind of precise measurement.

02:12:47,362 --> 02:12:48,382
SPEAKER_1:  And so you can see.

02:12:48,642 --> 02:12:55,038
SPEAKER_1:  these very fast dips, you even get these kind of diffraction patterns that come around, which are really cool to look at.

02:12:55,522 --> 02:12:56,126
SPEAKER_1:  And that's—

02:12:56,514 --> 02:12:58,558
SPEAKER_1:  I kind of love it because it's almost like passive radar.

02:12:59,202 --> 02:13:01,790
SPEAKER_1:  You have these pinpricks of light. Imagine having to do really weird stuff.

02:13:02,210 --> 02:13:04,926
SPEAKER_1:  that you live in a giant black sphere.

02:13:05,250 --> 02:13:07,582
SPEAKER_1:  but there's these little pinholes that have been poked.

02:13:08,066 --> 02:13:10,814
SPEAKER_1:  and through those pinholes almost laser light is shining through.

02:13:11,362 --> 02:13:13,342
SPEAKER_1:  and inside this black sphere.

02:13:13,858 --> 02:13:18,430
SPEAKER_1:  There are unknown things wandering around, drifting around that we are trying to discover.

02:13:18,722 --> 02:13:22,334
SPEAKER_1:  and sometimes they will pass in front of those little pencil thin laser beams.

02:13:22,978 --> 02:13:25,310
SPEAKER_1:  block something out so we can tell that it's there.

02:13:25,602 --> 02:13:27,742
SPEAKER_1:  And it's not an active radar, because we didn't actually...

02:13:28,354 --> 02:13:34,398
SPEAKER_1:  beam anything out and get a reflection off, which is what the sun does. The sun's light comes off and comes back. That's how I can activate our system.

02:13:34,722 --> 02:13:36,702
SPEAKER_1:  It's more like a passive radar system where.

02:13:36,962 --> 02:13:38,878
SPEAKER_1:  We are just listening very intently.

02:13:39,202 --> 02:13:39,774
SPEAKER_1:  And so...

02:13:40,130 --> 02:13:43,838
SPEAKER_1:  I'm kind of so fascinated by that, the idea that we could.

02:13:44,322 --> 02:13:45,310
SPEAKER_1:  Map out.

02:13:45,634 --> 02:13:46,174
SPEAKER_1:  D.

02:13:46,658 --> 02:13:49,374
SPEAKER_1:  rich architecture of the outer solar system.

02:13:50,018 --> 02:13:55,102
SPEAKER_1:  just by doing something that we could have done potentially for a long time, okay, which is just listening in the right way, just...

02:13:55,426 --> 02:13:58,366
SPEAKER_1:  just tuning our instrumentation to the correct.

02:13:58,722 --> 02:14:01,150
SPEAKER_1:  way of not listening but…

02:14:01,506 --> 02:14:03,838
SPEAKER_1:  viewing the universe to catch those objects.

02:14:04,418 --> 02:14:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I mean, it's really fascinating. It seems almost obvious that your efforts.

02:14:08,834 --> 02:14:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  when projected out in over like 100, 200 years.

02:14:12,514 --> 02:14:13,758
SPEAKER_0:  We'll have a really good map.

02:14:14,434 --> 02:14:18,302
SPEAKER_0:  through even methods like basically transit timing, high resolution transit timing.

02:14:18,626 --> 02:14:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  but basically the planetary and the...

02:14:21,602 --> 02:14:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  planet's satellite movements.

02:14:23,490 --> 02:14:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  of all the different.

02:14:26,178 --> 02:14:27,326
SPEAKER_1:  star systems out there.

02:14:27,618 --> 02:14:30,430
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, and it could revolutionize the way we think about the solar system. I mean.

02:14:31,266 --> 02:14:36,542
SPEAKER_1:  That revolution has happened several times in the past when we discovered Vesta in the 19th century.

02:14:37,090 --> 02:14:38,814
SPEAKER_1:  That was, I think, the-

02:14:39,074 --> 02:14:43,902
SPEAKER_1:  the seventh planet for a while or the eighth planet when it was first discovered and then we discovered Ceres and...

02:14:44,290 --> 02:14:46,462
SPEAKER_1:  There was a bunch of asteroid objects, JNES.

02:14:46,786 --> 02:14:48,798
SPEAKER_1:  And so for a while the textbooks had.

02:14:49,122 --> 02:14:51,774
SPEAKER_1:  There was something like 13 planets in the solar system.

02:14:52,066 --> 02:14:55,902
SPEAKER_1:  And then that was just a new capability that was emerging to test those small objects.

02:14:56,130 --> 02:14:58,174
SPEAKER_1:  And then we ripped that up and said, no, no, we're gonna.

02:14:58,466 --> 02:14:59,870
SPEAKER_1:  change the definition of a planet.

02:15:00,162 --> 02:15:05,950
SPEAKER_1:  And then the same thing happened when we started looking at the outer skirts of the solar system. And again, we found Eris, we found Sedna.

02:15:06,274 --> 02:15:07,358
SPEAKER_1:  these objects which.

02:15:07,682 --> 02:15:08,926
SPEAKER_1:  resembled Pluto.

02:15:09,282 --> 02:15:11,550
SPEAKER_1:  and the more and more of them we found, make make.

02:15:11,906 --> 02:15:15,006
SPEAKER_1:  And eventually we again had to rethink.

02:15:15,426 --> 02:15:18,942
SPEAKER_1:  the way we even contextualize what a planet is.

02:15:19,266 --> 02:15:21,374
SPEAKER_1:  what the nature of the outer solar system is.

02:15:21,730 --> 02:15:29,982
SPEAKER_1:  So regardless as to what you think about the debate about whether Pluto should be devoted or not which I know often evokes a lot of strong feelings it is an incredible

02:15:30,242 --> 02:15:31,070
SPEAKER_1:  achievement.

02:15:31,362 --> 02:15:32,318
SPEAKER_1:  that we.

02:15:32,834 --> 02:15:33,950
SPEAKER_1:  were able to.

02:15:34,594 --> 02:15:35,486
SPEAKER_1:  transform.

02:15:35,746 --> 02:15:40,606
SPEAKER_1:  view of the solar system in a matter of years just by basically, you know, charge coupled.

02:15:40,834 --> 02:15:43,102
SPEAKER_1:  devices, the things that's in cameras.

02:15:43,490 --> 02:15:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  Though the invention of that device allowed us to detect objects which were much further away, much fainter.

02:15:50,018 --> 02:15:55,550
SPEAKER_1:  and revealed all of this stuff that was there all along. And so that's the beauty of astronomy. It's just.

02:15:55,938 --> 02:15:58,238
SPEAKER_1:  so much to discover.

02:15:58,498 --> 02:16:00,318
SPEAKER_1:  and even in our own backyard.

02:16:00,834 --> 02:16:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  Do you ever think about this? What are the things that you can't even imagine?

02:16:04,162 --> 02:16:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  that will completely change astronomy over the next 100 years.

02:16:06,818 --> 02:16:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  Like if you transport yourself forward.

02:16:09,058 --> 02:16:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  100 years, what are the things?

02:16:11,202 --> 02:16:13,662
SPEAKER_0:  that will blow your mind when you look at, wait, what?

02:16:14,466 --> 02:16:15,326
SPEAKER_0:  Would it be?

02:16:15,682 --> 02:16:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  just a very high resolution mapping of things like.

02:16:18,786 --> 02:16:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  Holy crap, like one surprising thing might be.

02:16:21,410 --> 02:16:22,526
SPEAKER_0:  Holy crap, there's...

02:16:24,130 --> 02:16:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  Earth-like moons everywhere.

02:16:26,850 --> 02:16:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  Another one could be just totally different devices for sensing.

02:16:31,490 --> 02:16:36,414
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I think usually astronomy moves forward dramatically and science in general.

02:16:36,770 --> 02:16:40,190
SPEAKER_1:  when you have a new technological capability come online for the first time.

02:16:40,930 --> 02:16:44,510
SPEAKER_1:  And we kind of just gave examples of that there with the solar system.

02:16:44,866 --> 02:16:45,342
SPEAKER_1:  So.

02:16:45,698 --> 02:16:51,198
SPEAKER_1:  what kind of new capabilities might emerge the next 100 years. The capability I'd love to see.

02:16:51,554 --> 02:16:56,990
SPEAKER_1:  is not just, I mean, in the next 10, 20 years, we're hoping to take these pale blue dot images we spoke about.

02:16:57,570 --> 02:17:01,438
SPEAKER_1:  That requires building something like JVST, but on an even larger scale.

02:17:01,730 --> 02:17:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  and optimize for direct imaging, you don't have to have either coronagraph.

02:17:04,930 --> 02:17:07,390
SPEAKER_1:  or a star shade or something to block out the starlight.

02:17:07,618 --> 02:17:09,246
SPEAKER_1:  and reveal those pale blue dots.

02:17:09,538 --> 02:17:12,606
SPEAKER_1:  So in the next sort of decades, I think that's the...

02:17:13,026 --> 02:17:16,990
SPEAKER_1:  achievement that we can look forward to in our lifetimes is to see photos of.

02:17:17,602 --> 02:17:18,110
SPEAKER_1:  Earths?

02:17:18,818 --> 02:17:23,550
SPEAKER_1:  going beyond that maybe in our lifetimes, towards the end of our lifetimes perhaps. I'd love it if we-

02:17:23,778 --> 02:17:28,382
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's technically possible as Breakthrough Starshot are giving us a lot of encouragement with.

02:17:28,834 --> 02:17:35,134
SPEAKER_1:  to maybe send a small probe to the nearest stars and start actually taking high resolution images of these objects.

02:17:35,458 --> 02:17:37,790
SPEAKER_1:  There's only so much you can do from far away.

02:17:38,530 --> 02:17:39,390
SPEAKER_1:  if you want to have.

02:17:39,778 --> 02:17:46,238
SPEAKER_1:  And we can see it in the solar system. I mean, there's only so much you can learn about Europa by pointing Hubble Space Telescope at it, but if you really want to understand that.

02:17:46,466 --> 02:17:49,278
SPEAKER_1:  that moon, you're going to have to send something to orbit it.

02:17:49,602 --> 02:17:51,934
SPEAKER_1:  hopefully land on it and drill down to the surface.

02:17:52,258 --> 02:17:57,982
SPEAKER_1:  And so the idea of even taking a flyby and doing a snapshot photo that gets beam back.

02:17:58,370 --> 02:17:59,134
SPEAKER_1:  that could be.

02:17:59,586 --> 02:18:08,126
SPEAKER_1:  doesn't even have to be more than 100 pixels by 100 pixels. Even that would be a completely game-changing capability to be able to truly image these objects.

02:18:08,770 --> 02:18:09,182
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:18:09,602 --> 02:18:10,046
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:18:10,402 --> 02:18:10,942
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe.

02:18:11,490 --> 02:18:13,566
SPEAKER_1:  at home in our own solar system.

02:18:13,826 --> 02:18:18,046
SPEAKER_1:  we can certainly get to a point where we produce crude maps of exoplanets.

02:18:18,498 --> 02:18:18,974
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:18:19,362 --> 02:18:22,782
SPEAKER_1:  one of the kind of the ultimate limit of what a telescope could do.

02:18:23,074 --> 02:18:24,798
SPEAKER_1:  is given by its size.

02:18:25,250 --> 02:18:29,054
SPEAKER_1:  And so the largest telescope you could probably ever build would be one that was the size of the sun.

02:18:30,018 --> 02:18:34,206
SPEAKER_1:  There's a clever trick for doing this without physically building a telescope that's the size of the sun.

02:18:34,562 --> 02:18:36,638
SPEAKER_1:  and that's to use the sun as a gravitational lens.

02:18:37,218 --> 02:18:43,230
SPEAKER_1:  This was proposed, I think, by Von Eschlaman in like 1979, but it builds upon Einstein's.

02:18:43,554 --> 02:18:45,342
SPEAKER_1:  The year of general relativity of course there is

02:18:45,730 --> 02:18:47,102
SPEAKER_1:  a warping of light.

02:18:47,426 --> 02:18:49,918
SPEAKER_1:  a bending of light from the Sun's gravitational field.

02:18:50,242 --> 02:18:54,014
SPEAKER_1:  And so a distant starlight, it's like a magnifying glass, anything that bends light.

02:18:54,274 --> 02:18:56,990
SPEAKER_1:  is basically can be used as a telescope.

02:18:57,378 --> 02:18:58,878
SPEAKER_1:  it's going to bend light to a point.

02:18:59,330 --> 02:19:01,054
SPEAKER_1:  Now it turns out the sun's gravity is not.

02:19:01,346 --> 02:19:02,878
SPEAKER_1:  strong enough to create a

02:19:03,170 --> 02:19:05,886
SPEAKER_1:  particularly great telescope here because the focus point...

02:19:06,338 --> 02:19:11,678
SPEAKER_1:  is really out in the Kuiper belt. It's at 550 astronomical units away.

02:19:11,970 --> 02:19:15,006
SPEAKER_1:  the Earth, so 550 times further away from the Sun than we are.

02:19:15,362 --> 02:19:17,854
SPEAKER_1:  And we've, you know, that's beyond any of our spacecraft we've ever gone.

02:19:18,338 --> 02:19:21,438
SPEAKER_1:  So you have to send a spacecraft to that distance, which would take...

02:19:22,178 --> 02:19:23,198
SPEAKER_1:  30, 40 years.

02:19:23,426 --> 02:19:27,294
SPEAKER_1:  even optimistically improving our chemical propulsion system significantly.

02:19:27,746 --> 02:19:29,534
SPEAKER_1:  you'd have to bound it into that orbit.

02:19:30,146 --> 02:19:30,750
SPEAKER_1:  But then...

02:19:31,074 --> 02:19:33,310
SPEAKER_1:  You could use the entire sun as your telescope.

02:19:33,634 --> 02:19:37,470
SPEAKER_1:  And with that kind of capability, you could image planets to

02:19:37,858 --> 02:19:40,574
SPEAKER_1:  kilometer scale resolution from afar.

02:19:41,474 --> 02:19:43,166
SPEAKER_1:  That really makes you wonder, I mean...

02:19:43,682 --> 02:19:46,686
SPEAKER_1:  If we can conceive, maybe we can't engineer it.

02:19:47,010 --> 02:19:48,958
SPEAKER_1:  But if we can conceive of such a device...

02:19:49,762 --> 02:19:54,110
SPEAKER_1:  what might other civilizations be currently observing about our own planet?

02:19:54,850 --> 02:19:55,294
SPEAKER_1:  NUMB

02:19:55,810 --> 02:19:56,382
SPEAKER_1:  End.

02:19:57,250 --> 02:19:58,526
SPEAKER_1:  Perhaps that is a...

02:19:59,106 --> 02:20:03,742
SPEAKER_1:  why nobody is visiting us because there is so much you can do from afar.

02:20:04,866 --> 02:20:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  them that's enough. Maybe they can get to the point where they can detect our radio leakage.

02:20:09,666 --> 02:20:13,086
SPEAKER_1:  They can touch restaurant in television signals.

02:20:13,634 --> 02:20:14,686
SPEAKER_1:  Um, they can.

02:20:14,946 --> 02:20:21,502
SPEAKER_1:  map out our surfaces, they can tell we have cities, they can even do infrared mapping of the heat island effect and this kind of stuff they can tell.

02:20:21,794 --> 02:20:23,390
SPEAKER_1:  the chemical composition of our planet.

02:20:23,842 --> 02:20:31,326
SPEAKER_1:  And so that might be enough. Maybe they don't need to come down to the surface and study anthropology and see what our civilization is like.

02:20:31,810 --> 02:20:33,214
SPEAKER_1:  But there's certainly...

02:20:33,698 --> 02:20:37,726
SPEAKER_1:  a huge amount you can do, which is significantly cheaper to some degree than flying there.

02:20:38,146 --> 02:20:41,918
SPEAKER_1:  just by exploiting cleverly the physics of the universe itself.

02:20:42,978 --> 02:20:44,103
SPEAKER_1:  So your intuition is...

02:20:44,103 --> 02:20:47,422
SPEAKER_0:  and that's very well made to be true, the observation.

02:20:48,098 --> 02:20:49,822
SPEAKER_0:  might be way easier than travel.

02:20:50,786 --> 02:20:53,662
SPEAKER_0:  from our perspective, from an alien perspective. Like we could-

02:20:54,018 --> 02:20:55,550
SPEAKER_0:  get very high resolution.

02:20:56,962 --> 02:20:57,726
SPEAKER_0:  imaging.

02:20:58,082 --> 02:21:00,158
SPEAKER_1:  before we can ever get there. It depends on what-

02:21:00,674 --> 02:21:04,798
SPEAKER_1:  information you want. If you want to know the chemical composition

02:21:05,314 --> 02:21:08,414
SPEAKER_1:  and you want to know kilometer scale maps of the planet.

02:21:08,706 --> 02:21:11,038
SPEAKER_1:  then you could do that from afar with some...

02:21:11,650 --> 02:21:14,110
SPEAKER_1:  version of these kind of gravitational lenses.

02:21:14,370 --> 02:21:23,358
SPEAKER_1:  If you want to do better than that, if you want to image a newspaper, selling the porch of somebody's house, you're going to have to fly there. There's no way unless you had.

02:21:23,842 --> 02:21:27,710
SPEAKER_1:  you know, a touch get the size of such serious a star or something. You just simply cannot.

02:21:28,322 --> 02:21:31,326
SPEAKER_1:  collect enough light to do that from many light years away.

02:21:31,810 --> 02:21:33,630
SPEAKER_1:  So there is certainly...

02:21:34,082 --> 02:21:34,654
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

02:21:35,618 --> 02:21:40,862
SPEAKER_1:  reasons why visiting will always have its place depending on what kind of information you want.

02:21:41,570 --> 02:21:42,046
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:21:42,274 --> 02:21:44,094
SPEAKER_1:  We've proposed in my team actually that

02:21:44,514 --> 02:21:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  The Sun is...

02:21:45,506 --> 02:21:45,982
SPEAKER_1:  is a

02:21:46,754 --> 02:21:49,022
SPEAKER_1:  is the ultimate pinnacle of telescope design.

02:21:49,762 --> 02:21:53,790
SPEAKER_1:  But flying to 1000 AU is a real pain in the butt because it's just going to take so long.

02:21:54,338 --> 02:21:55,038
SPEAKER_1:  And so...

02:21:55,746 --> 02:21:58,590
SPEAKER_1:  A more practical way of achieving this might be to use the Earth.

02:21:59,234 --> 02:22:04,382
SPEAKER_1:  Now the Earth doesn't have anywhere near enough gravity to create a substantial gravitational lens.

02:22:04,898 --> 02:22:06,622
SPEAKER_1:  Um, but it has an atmosphere.

02:22:07,298 --> 02:22:12,734
SPEAKER_1:  and that atmosphere refracts light, it bends light. So whenever you see a sunset.

02:22:13,250 --> 02:22:15,454
SPEAKER_1:  just as the sun setting below her horizon.

02:22:16,002 --> 02:22:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  It's actually already.

02:22:17,378 --> 02:22:20,798
SPEAKER_1:  beneath the horizon, it's just that the light is bending.

02:22:21,218 --> 02:22:26,398
SPEAKER_1:  through the atmosphere, it's actually already about half a degree down beneath, and what you're seeing is that.

02:22:26,626 --> 02:22:28,510
SPEAKER_1:  is that curvature of the light path.

02:22:29,090 --> 02:22:33,054
SPEAKER_1:  And your brain interprets it of course to be following a straight line because your brain always thinks that.

02:22:33,602 --> 02:22:34,014
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:22:34,434 --> 02:22:40,926
SPEAKER_1:  And so you can use that bending whenever you have bending, you have a telescope. And so we've proposed to my team that you could use this refraction.

02:22:41,410 --> 02:22:41,854
SPEAKER_1:  to.

02:22:42,114 --> 02:22:44,574
SPEAKER_1:  Similarly, create an Earth-sized telescope.

02:22:45,250 --> 02:22:48,734
SPEAKER_1:  called the Terrascope. The Terrascope. Yeah. Great video on that. Yeah. Good mid year to如果你 straight from like kind of like offici away on re- advance strfil in da

02:22:49,314 --> 02:23:02,398
SPEAKER_1:  Do you have a paper on the telescope? I do. Yeah. Great. Um, sometimes get confused this because they've heard of an earth sized telescope because of the, may have heard of the event horizon telescope, which took an image of, um, what's the taken image right now at the center of our black hole.

02:23:02,978 --> 02:23:04,446
SPEAKER_1:  And it's very impressive.

02:23:04,674 --> 02:23:06,078
SPEAKER_1:  previously did Messier 87.

02:23:06,466 --> 02:23:08,382
SPEAKER_1:  and nearby supermassive black hole.

02:23:08,706 --> 02:23:13,662
SPEAKER_1:  And so those images were interferometric. So they were small telescopes scattered across the earth.

02:23:14,146 --> 02:23:17,822
SPEAKER_1:  and they combine the light paths together interferometrically.

02:23:18,146 --> 02:23:20,958
SPEAKER_1:  to create effectively an earth-sized.

02:23:21,570 --> 02:23:22,526
SPEAKER_1:  angle resolution.

02:23:23,042 --> 02:23:28,062
SPEAKER_1:  Telescopes always have two properties. There's the angular resolution, which is how small of a thing you can see.

02:23:28,418 --> 02:23:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  on the surface and then there's the magnification.

02:23:31,074 --> 02:23:35,390
SPEAKER_1:  How much brighter does that object get versus just your eye versus some small object?

02:23:35,842 --> 02:23:36,414
SPEAKER_1:  not what

02:23:37,026 --> 02:23:39,038
SPEAKER_1:  what the Event Horizon Telescope did.

02:23:39,362 --> 02:23:41,342
SPEAKER_1:  It traded off.

02:23:41,954 --> 02:23:43,614
SPEAKER_1:  amplification or magnification.

02:23:44,162 --> 02:23:44,670
SPEAKER_1:  4

02:23:44,994 --> 02:23:53,086
SPEAKER_1:  for the angular resolution. That's what it wanted. It wanted that high angular resolution, but it doesn't really have much photon collecting power because each telescope individually is very small.

02:23:53,602 --> 02:23:55,230
SPEAKER_1:  The telescope is different because

02:23:55,714 --> 02:23:58,206
SPEAKER_1:  It is literally collecting light with a...

02:23:58,466 --> 02:24:00,926
SPEAKER_1:  light bucket, which is essentially the size of the은

02:24:01,474 --> 02:24:06,494
SPEAKER_1:  And so that gives you both benefits potentially, not only the high angular resolution.

02:24:06,914 --> 02:24:15,166
SPEAKER_1:  that a large aperture promises you, but also actually physically collects all those photons so you can detect light from very, very far away, through outer edges of the universe.

02:24:15,618 --> 02:24:16,062
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:24:16,386 --> 02:24:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

02:24:17,250 --> 02:24:20,158
SPEAKER_1:  We propose this as a possible.

02:24:20,674 --> 02:24:21,374
SPEAKER_1:  future.

02:24:21,602 --> 02:24:25,662
SPEAKER_1:  a technological way of achieving these extreme.

02:24:26,754 --> 02:24:28,830
SPEAKER_1:  Goals, ambitious goals we have in astronomy.

02:24:29,538 --> 02:24:35,358
SPEAKER_1:  But it's a very difficult system to test because you essentially have to fly out to these focus points.

02:24:35,714 --> 02:24:38,206
SPEAKER_1:  and these focus points lie beyond the moon, so you have to have...

02:24:38,882 --> 02:24:52,670
SPEAKER_1:  someone who was willing to fly beyond the moon and hitchhike an experimental telescope onto it and do that cheaply. If it was something doing low earth orbit, it'd be easy. You could just attach a CubeSat to the next Falcon 9 rocket or something.

02:24:53,058 --> 02:24:54,686
SPEAKER_1:  test it out, it'll probably only cost you.

02:24:55,234 --> 02:24:57,694
SPEAKER_1:  few tens of thousands of dollars, maybe hundreds of thousand dollars, but to...

02:24:57,922 --> 02:25:00,542
SPEAKER_1:  There's basically no one who flies out that far.

02:25:00,802 --> 02:25:08,542
SPEAKER_1:  except for bespoke missions such as a mission that's going to Mars or something that would pass through that.

02:25:08,930 --> 02:25:10,238
SPEAKER_1:  kind of space and they.

02:25:10,562 --> 02:25:11,966
SPEAKER_1:  typically don't have a lot of.

02:25:12,258 --> 02:25:15,902
SPEAKER_1:  leeway in excess payload that they're willing to strap on for.

02:25:16,226 --> 02:25:17,534
SPEAKER_1:  radical experiments.

02:25:17,986 --> 02:25:24,126
SPEAKER_1:  That's been the problem with it. In theory, it should work beautifully, but it's a very difficult idea to experimentally test.

02:25:24,386 --> 02:25:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  Can you elaborate why the focal point is that far away?

02:25:27,714 --> 02:25:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  So.

02:25:28,418 --> 02:25:34,302
SPEAKER_1:  You get about half a degree bend from the Earth's atmosphere when you're looking at the sun at the horizon, and you get that.

02:25:34,850 --> 02:25:42,110
SPEAKER_1:  times over if you're outside of the planet's atmosphere because it comes, you know, the star is half a bend to you still on the horizon and half a degree

02:25:42,498 --> 02:25:44,542
SPEAKER_1:  back out the other way so you get about a one degree bend.

02:25:45,026 --> 02:25:47,486
SPEAKER_1:  Check the rates of the Earth, which is about 7,000 kilometers.

02:25:47,778 --> 02:25:55,902
SPEAKER_1:  and do your arctan function, you'll end up with a distance that's about, it's actually the inner focal point is about two thirds the distance of the Earth-Moon system.

02:25:56,546 --> 02:25:59,070
SPEAKER_1:  The problem with that inner focal point is not useful.

02:25:59,490 --> 02:26:03,294
SPEAKER_1:  because that light ray path had to basically scrape the surface of the Earth.

02:26:03,842 --> 02:26:08,478
SPEAKER_1:  So it passes through the clouds, it passes through all the thick atmosphere, and it gets a lot of extinction along the way.

02:26:09,154 --> 02:26:10,846
SPEAKER_1:  If you go higher up in altitude...

02:26:11,266 --> 02:26:18,014
SPEAKER_1:  you get less extinction. In fact, you can even go above the clouds. And so that's even better because the clouds obviously are gonna be a pain in the neck if you're doing anything optical.

02:26:18,594 --> 02:26:22,366
SPEAKER_1:  But the problem with that is that the atmosphere, because it gets thinner at higher altitude...

02:26:22,594 --> 02:26:24,126
SPEAKER_1:  it bends like less.

02:26:24,450 --> 02:26:26,526
SPEAKER_1:  And so that pushes the focal point out.

02:26:26,850 --> 02:26:32,414
SPEAKER_1:  So the most useful focal point is actually about three or four times the distance of the Earth-Moon separation.

02:26:32,738 --> 02:26:35,358
SPEAKER_1:  And so that's what we call one of the Lagrange points, essentially.

02:26:35,618 --> 02:26:40,158
SPEAKER_1:  And so there was a stable orbit, kind of the outermost stable orbit you could have around the Earth.

02:26:40,834 --> 02:26:41,959
SPEAKER_1:  So the atmosphere.

02:26:41,959 --> 02:26:42,398
SPEAKER_0:

02:26:43,106 --> 02:26:46,110
SPEAKER_0:  does bad things to the signal.

02:26:46,466 --> 02:26:49,831
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's absorbing light.

02:26:49,831 --> 02:26:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  possible to reconstruct.

02:26:51,682 --> 02:26:52,414
SPEAKER_0:  3, 2, 2.

02:26:52,834 --> 02:26:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  to remove the noise, whatever. So it's just strength. It's not nothing else.

02:26:57,090 --> 02:27:01,374
SPEAKER_1:  It's possible to reconstruct, I mean to some degree we do this as a technology called adaptive optics.

02:27:01,954 --> 02:27:05,822
SPEAKER_1:  that can correct for what's called wavefront errors that happen through the Earth's atmosphere.

02:27:06,146 --> 02:27:08,798
SPEAKER_1:  The Earth's atmosphere is turbulent. It is not a-

02:27:09,506 --> 02:27:14,814
SPEAKER_1:  single plane of air of the same density. There's all kind of wiggles and currents in the air.

02:27:15,426 --> 02:27:16,222
SPEAKER_1:  And so...

02:27:16,738 --> 02:27:23,838
SPEAKER_1:  Each little layer is bending light in slightly different ways. So the light actually kind of follows a wiggly path on its way down.

02:27:24,450 --> 02:27:25,310
SPEAKER_1:  What that means is that...

02:27:25,730 --> 02:27:28,350
SPEAKER_1:  two light rays which are traveling at slightly different.

02:27:28,866 --> 02:27:30,430
SPEAKER_1:  spatial separations from each other.

02:27:30,914 --> 02:27:39,038
SPEAKER_1:  will arrive at the detector at different times, because one maybe goes on more or less a straight path and the one wiggles down a bit more before it arrives. So you have an incoherent.

02:27:39,554 --> 02:27:40,798
SPEAKER_1:  um, light source.

02:27:41,378 --> 02:27:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  And when you're trying to image reconstruction, you always want a coherent light source. So the way they correct for this is that this

02:27:47,234 --> 02:27:49,502
SPEAKER_1:  If this path had to travel a little bit faster.

02:27:49,954 --> 02:27:52,830
SPEAKER_1:  the straight one goes faster and the wiggly one takes longer.

02:27:53,154 --> 02:28:00,670
SPEAKER_1:  The mirror is deformable. And so you actually bend the mirror on this, on the, on the straight one down a little bit to make it an equivalent light path distance.

02:28:01,090 --> 02:28:04,094
SPEAKER_1:  So the mirror itself has all these little actuators.

02:28:04,418 --> 02:28:07,966
SPEAKER_1:  It's actually made up of like thousands of little elements, almost looks like a liquid mirror.

02:28:08,290 --> 02:28:11,006
SPEAKER_1:  because they can manipulate it in real time.

02:28:11,426 --> 02:28:15,902
SPEAKER_1:  And so they scan the atmosphere with a laser beam to tell what the deformations are in the atmosphere.

02:28:16,290 --> 02:28:23,966
SPEAKER_1:  and then make the corrections to the mirror to account for it. That's amazing. So you could, you could do something like this for the terrorist group, but it would be.

02:28:24,386 --> 02:28:24,862
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:28:24,962 --> 02:28:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  It's cheaper and easier to go above the atmosphere.

02:28:27,778 --> 02:28:28,542
SPEAKER_0:  I just fly out.

02:28:28,642 --> 02:28:38,110
SPEAKER_1:  I think so. It would be very, it's a very, that's a very challenging thing to do. And normally when you do adaptive optics, as it's called, you're looking straight up. So you're very close to straight up.

02:28:38,370 --> 02:28:41,982
SPEAKER_1:  If you look at the horizon, we basically never do astronomical observations on the horizon.

02:28:42,274 --> 02:28:43,806
SPEAKER_1:  because you're looking through more atmosphere.

02:28:44,290 --> 02:28:53,054
SPEAKER_1:  If you go straight up, you're looking at the thinnest portion atmosphere possible. But as you go closer and closer towards the horizon, you're increasing what we call the air mass, the amount of air you have to travel through.

02:28:53,666 --> 02:28:57,566
SPEAKER_1:  So here it's kind of the worst case because you're going through the entire atmosphere.

02:28:57,890 --> 02:29:00,254
SPEAKER_1:  In and out again with a pteroscope.

02:29:00,642 --> 02:29:04,958
SPEAKER_1:  So you'd need a very impressive adaptive optics system to create for that. objects flight lime

02:29:05,442 --> 02:29:08,318
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I would say it's probably simpler, at least for test proof of principle.

02:29:08,898 --> 02:29:10,654
SPEAKER_1:  just to test it with.

02:29:11,170 --> 02:29:14,878
SPEAKER_1:  with having some satellite that was at a much wider orbit.

02:29:15,554 --> 02:29:16,830
SPEAKER_0:  Now, speaking of traveling.

02:29:17,122 --> 02:29:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  out into deep space. You already mentioned this a little bit.

02:29:21,954 --> 02:29:22,846
SPEAKER_0:  You are...

02:29:23,330 --> 02:29:26,174
SPEAKER_0:  made a beautiful video called The Journey to the End of the Universe.

02:29:26,818 --> 02:29:30,014
SPEAKER_0:  And sort of at the start of that, you're talking about office and Tari.

02:29:30,786 --> 02:29:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  So what would it take for humans?

02:29:33,634 --> 02:29:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  of four.

02:29:34,594 --> 02:29:36,469
SPEAKER_0:  human-like creatures to travel out.

02:29:36,469 --> 02:29:37,438
SPEAKER_1:  to Alpha Centauri.

02:29:38,786 --> 02:29:41,854
SPEAKER_1:  There's a few different ways of doing it, I suppose.

02:29:42,562 --> 02:29:45,918
SPEAKER_1:  One is it depends on how fast your ship is. That's always going to be the determining factor.

02:29:46,466 --> 02:29:48,638
SPEAKER_1:  If we devised some.

02:29:48,898 --> 02:29:52,030
SPEAKER_1:  inter-side proportion system that could travel a fraction of the speed of light.

02:29:52,642 --> 02:29:54,270
SPEAKER_1:  than we could do in our lifetimes.

02:29:54,658 --> 02:29:55,390
SPEAKER_1:  Which is, I think.

02:29:55,650 --> 02:29:56,990
SPEAKER_1:  But people normally...

02:29:57,410 --> 02:30:00,702
SPEAKER_1:  dream of when I think about instilled propulsion and travel.

02:30:01,186 --> 02:30:02,430
SPEAKER_1:  that you could literally.

02:30:02,754 --> 02:30:06,590
SPEAKER_1:  Step onto the spacecraft, maybe a few years later, you step off and have a Centauri B.

02:30:07,106 --> 02:30:14,078
SPEAKER_1:  you walk around the surface and come back and visit your family. There would be of course a lot of relativistic time dilation as a result of that trip.

02:30:14,626 --> 02:30:19,966
SPEAKER_1:  you would have aged a lot less than people back on earth by traveling close to the speed of light for some fraction of time

02:30:20,802 --> 02:30:21,150
SPEAKER_1:  hum.

02:30:22,370 --> 02:30:26,622
SPEAKER_1:  The challenge of this of course is that we have no such propulsion system that can achieve this.

02:30:27,074 --> 02:30:27,614
SPEAKER_1:  So...

02:30:27,842 --> 02:30:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  But you think it's possible, like, so you, yeah.

02:30:31,938 --> 02:30:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  uh... you have a paper called the hill drive

02:30:34,882 --> 02:30:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  fuel-free relativistic propulsion of large masses via recycled boomerang photons.

02:30:40,386 --> 02:30:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  So do you think, first of all, what is that? And second of all,

02:30:45,922 --> 02:30:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  how difficult are alternate propulsion systems.

02:30:49,346 --> 02:30:50,110
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so.

02:30:50,946 --> 02:30:51,326
SPEAKER_1:  The.

02:30:52,002 --> 02:30:53,534
SPEAKER_1:  Before I took in the Hayley drive, there was...

02:30:54,146 --> 02:30:56,190
SPEAKER_1:  There was an idea, because I think the Halo Drive...

02:30:56,930 --> 02:30:58,366
SPEAKER_1:  is not gonna solve this problem.

02:30:58,818 --> 02:31:04,958
SPEAKER_1:  I'll talk about the Halo drive in a moment, but the Halo drive is useful for a civilization, which is a bit more advanced than that that has spread across the stars.

02:31:05,250 --> 02:31:07,038
SPEAKER_1:  and is looking for a cheap highway system.

02:31:07,362 --> 02:31:08,734
SPEAKER_1:  to get across the galaxy.

02:31:09,794 --> 02:31:11,134
SPEAKER_1:  for that first step.

02:31:11,778 --> 02:31:12,222
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:31:12,834 --> 02:31:14,462
SPEAKER_1:  Cause just to context that.

02:31:14,786 --> 02:31:19,166
SPEAKER_1:  the halo drive requires a black hole. So that's why you're not gonna be able to do this on the earth right now.

02:31:19,682 --> 02:31:25,150
SPEAKER_1:  But there are lots of black cars in the Milky Way, so that's the good news. So we'll come to that in a moment. But if you're trying to travel to Afsintory...

02:31:25,570 --> 02:31:26,590
SPEAKER_1:  Without a black hole.

02:31:27,074 --> 02:31:27,518
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:31:27,874 --> 02:31:28,606
SPEAKER_1:  than the most.

02:31:29,058 --> 02:31:34,654
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, there were some ideas out there. There was a project Daedalus and project Icarus that were two projects at the.

02:31:35,010 --> 02:31:35,358
SPEAKER_1:  uh

02:31:35,810 --> 02:31:40,318
SPEAKER_1:  British Interplanetary Society conjured up on a 20-30 year timescale.

02:31:40,642 --> 02:31:42,206
SPEAKER_1:  and they ask themselves if we.

02:31:42,466 --> 02:31:45,374
SPEAKER_1:  took existing and speculatively.

02:31:45,698 --> 02:31:49,982
SPEAKER_1:  but realistic attempts at future technology that are emerging over the next few decades.

02:31:50,274 --> 02:31:52,734
SPEAKER_1:  How far could we push instead of...

02:31:52,994 --> 02:31:53,854
SPEAKER_1: ordo.blogspot.com

02:31:54,338 --> 02:31:55,710
SPEAKER_1:  Ahem, no Settledon.

02:31:56,354 --> 02:31:59,934
SPEAKER_1:  fusion drives in that. So if we had the ability to essentially...

02:32:00,290 --> 02:32:00,606
SPEAKER_1:  uh

02:32:00,866 --> 02:32:08,094
SPEAKER_1:  either detonate, you can always imagine that kind of nuclear fission or nuclear fusion bombs going off behind the spacecraft and propelling it that way.

02:32:08,482 --> 02:32:11,966
SPEAKER_1:  or having some kind of successful nuclear fusion reaction.

02:32:12,322 --> 02:32:12,798
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:32:13,218 --> 02:32:16,766
SPEAKER_1:  which obviously we haven't really demonstrated yet as a propulsion system.

02:32:16,994 --> 02:32:21,182
SPEAKER_1:  then you could achieve something like 10% the speed of light in their systems. But these are...

02:32:21,794 --> 02:32:25,278
SPEAKER_1:  huge spacecrafts. I think you need a huge spacecraft if you're going to take people along.

02:32:25,858 --> 02:32:31,934
SPEAKER_1:  Um, the conversation recently has actually switched and that's, that idea is kind of antiquated now.

02:32:32,450 --> 02:32:32,798
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:32:33,122 --> 02:32:34,910
SPEAKER_1:  Most of us have kind of given up an idea of

02:32:35,234 --> 02:32:37,086
SPEAKER_1:  people physically, biologically.

02:32:37,794 --> 02:32:39,422
SPEAKER_1:  stepping on board the spacecraft.

02:32:40,066 --> 02:32:45,054
SPEAKER_1:  And maybe we'll be sending something that's more like a micro probe that maybe just weighs a gram or two.

02:32:45,442 --> 02:32:50,014
SPEAKER_1:  and that's much easier to accelerate. You could push that with a laser system to very high speed.

02:32:50,306 --> 02:32:52,126
SPEAKER_1:  get it to maybe 20% of the speed of light.

02:32:52,514 --> 02:32:58,718
SPEAKER_1:  It has to survive the journey, probably a large fraction of them won't survive the journey, but they're cheap enough that you could maybe manufacture millions of them.

02:32:59,042 --> 02:33:02,526
SPEAKER_1:  and some of them do arrive and able to send back an image or

02:33:03,202 --> 02:33:06,142
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe even if you wanted to have a person there.

02:33:06,370 --> 02:33:07,390
SPEAKER_1:  We might have some.

02:33:07,650 --> 02:33:11,198
SPEAKER_1:  where you're doing like a telepresence or some kind of delayed telepresence or

02:33:11,746 --> 02:33:12,126
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:33:12,802 --> 02:33:19,454
SPEAKER_1:  some kind of reconstruction of the planet, which is sent back. So you can digitally interact with that environment in a way which is

02:33:19,874 --> 02:33:28,126
SPEAKER_1:  not real time, but representative of what that planet would be like to be on the surface. So we might be more like digital visitors to these planets.

02:33:28,450 --> 02:33:29,278
SPEAKER_1:  Certainly far.

02:33:29,570 --> 02:33:31,902
SPEAKER_1:  easier practically to do that than physically.

02:33:32,418 --> 02:33:33,310
SPEAKER_1:  forcing this.

02:33:33,762 --> 02:33:34,174
SPEAKER_1:  wet.

02:33:34,626 --> 02:33:38,142
SPEAKER_1:  chunk of meat to fly across space to do that.

02:33:38,594 --> 02:33:39,070
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:33:39,554 --> 02:33:41,214
SPEAKER_1:  And so that's maybe.

02:33:41,506 --> 02:33:44,030
SPEAKER_1:  uh, something we can imagine down the road.

02:33:44,578 --> 02:33:47,262
SPEAKER_1:  The Halo drive as I said is thinking even further ahead.

02:33:48,066 --> 02:33:49,598
SPEAKER_1:  And if you did want to...

02:33:50,018 --> 02:33:51,582
SPEAKER_1:  launch large masses.

02:33:52,162 --> 02:33:53,502
SPEAKER_1:  large masses could even be.

02:33:53,730 --> 02:33:55,806
SPEAKER_1:  planet-sized things in the case of the halo drive.

02:33:56,322 --> 02:33:57,694
SPEAKER_1:  You can use black holes.

02:33:58,658 --> 02:34:00,190
SPEAKER_1:  So this is kind of...

02:34:00,770 --> 02:34:03,134
SPEAKER_1:  a trick of physics. You know, I often think of...

02:34:03,682 --> 02:34:05,534
SPEAKER_1:  the universe is like a big computer game.

02:34:05,794 --> 02:34:07,070
SPEAKER_1:  and you're trying to find.

02:34:07,618 --> 02:34:10,206
SPEAKER_1:  cheat codes, hacks, exploits, the...

02:34:10,434 --> 02:34:14,238
SPEAKER_1:  the universe didn't intend for you to use, but once you find them you can

02:34:14,850 --> 02:34:18,014
SPEAKER_1:  address all sorts of interesting capabilities that you didn't previously have.

02:34:18,242 --> 02:34:18,558
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

02:34:19,074 --> 02:34:19,838
SPEAKER_1:  and um...

02:34:20,066 --> 02:34:25,438
SPEAKER_1:  The Halo Drive does that with black holes. So if you have two black holes, which is a very common situation, a binary black hole.

02:34:25,922 --> 02:34:31,966
SPEAKER_1:  And they're inspiring towards each other. LIGOs detected, I think, dozens of these things, moving over 100 at this point.

02:34:32,674 --> 02:34:34,270
SPEAKER_1:  and these things as they merge together.

02:34:34,530 --> 02:34:35,486
SPEAKER_1:  They.

02:34:35,810 --> 02:34:40,350
SPEAKER_1:  the pre-merger phase, they're orbiting very, very fast, even close to the speed of light.

02:34:41,090 --> 02:34:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  And so Freeman Dyson, before he passed away, I think in the 70s,

02:34:45,570 --> 02:34:52,126
SPEAKER_1:  provocative paper called gravitational machines and he suggested that you could use neutron stars as a interstellar propulsion system

02:34:53,314 --> 02:34:55,198
SPEAKER_1:  And Neutron Stars are sort of the...

02:34:55,522 --> 02:34:55,870
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

02:34:56,738 --> 02:34:59,902
SPEAKER_1:  the lower mass version of a binary black hole system essentially.

02:35:00,578 --> 02:35:05,598
SPEAKER_1:  In this case, he suggested just doing gravitational slingshot, just fly your spacecraft.

02:35:06,114 --> 02:35:06,910
SPEAKER_1:  into this.

02:35:07,394 --> 02:35:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

02:35:08,226 --> 02:35:08,734
SPEAKER_1:  very

02:35:09,378 --> 02:35:10,174
SPEAKER_1:  Compact.

02:35:10,626 --> 02:35:17,278
SPEAKER_1:  and relativistic binary system. And you do need neutron stars because if there were two stars, they'd be physically touching each other.

02:35:17,826 --> 02:35:25,054
SPEAKER_1:  So the neutron stars are so small, like 10 kilometers across, they can get really close to each other and have these very, very fast orbits with respect to each other.

02:35:25,890 --> 02:35:29,502
SPEAKER_1:  You shoot your spacecraft through, right through the mineralite, right through the eye of a needle.

02:35:29,858 --> 02:35:31,902
SPEAKER_1:  and you do a slingshot around one of them.

02:35:32,194 --> 02:35:38,110
SPEAKER_1:  and you do it around the one that's coming towards you. So one will be coming away, one will be coming towards you at any one point.

02:35:38,338 --> 02:35:44,126
SPEAKER_1:  And then you could basically steal some of the kinetic energy in the slingshot. In principle, you can set up to twice the...

02:35:44,354 --> 02:35:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  speed.

02:35:45,378 --> 02:35:46,622
SPEAKER_1:  You can take your speed.

02:35:47,010 --> 02:35:47,870
SPEAKER_1:  and it becomes.

02:35:48,290 --> 02:35:54,046
SPEAKER_1:  Your speed plus twice the speed of the Neutron Star in this case. And that will be your new speed after the slingshot.

02:35:54,658 --> 02:35:58,142
SPEAKER_1:  This seems great because it's just free energy basically you're not

02:35:58,466 --> 02:35:59,486
SPEAKER_1:  doing it, you know, you know.

02:35:59,810 --> 02:36:02,878
SPEAKER_1:  generate, you don't have a nuclear power reactor or anything to generate this, you're just stealing it.

02:36:03,426 --> 02:36:07,294
SPEAKER_1:  And indeed you can get to relativistic speeds this way. So I loved that paper.

02:36:07,906 --> 02:36:09,054
SPEAKER_1:  But I had a criticism.

02:36:09,314 --> 02:36:16,318
SPEAKER_1:  And the criticism was that this is like trying to fly your ship into a blender, right? This is this is two neutron stars.

02:36:16,642 --> 02:36:18,366
SPEAKER_1:  which have huge tidal forces.

02:36:18,722 --> 02:36:23,486
SPEAKER_1:  and they're whipping around each other once every second or even less than a second.

02:36:23,842 --> 02:36:27,710
SPEAKER_1:  and you're trying to fly your spaceship and do this maneuver that is pretty precarious.

02:36:28,258 --> 02:36:31,486
SPEAKER_1:  And so it just didn't seem practical to me to do this, but I loved it.

02:36:32,162 --> 02:36:41,534
SPEAKER_1:  And so I took that idea and this is how science is. It's iterative. It's, it's, you take a previous great man's idea and you just sort of maybe slightly tweak and improve it.

02:36:41,986 --> 02:36:43,294
SPEAKER_1:  That's how I see the Hello Drive.

02:36:43,810 --> 02:36:46,814
SPEAKER_1:  And I just suggested, why not replace those out for black holes?

02:36:47,618 --> 02:36:48,670
SPEAKER_1:  which is certainly very common.

02:36:49,122 --> 02:36:51,550
SPEAKER_1:  and rather than flying your ship into that.

02:36:51,938 --> 02:36:56,862
SPEAKER_1:  that hellhole of a blender system, you just stand back and you fire a laser beam.

02:36:57,506 --> 02:37:04,350
SPEAKER_1:  Now because black holes have such intense gravitational fields, they can bend light into complete 180s. They can actually become mirrors.

02:37:04,866 --> 02:37:08,350
SPEAKER_1:  So, you know, the sun bends light by maybe a fraction of a degree.

02:37:08,738 --> 02:37:10,782
SPEAKER_1:  through gravitational lensing but

02:37:11,042 --> 02:37:15,102
SPEAKER_1:  you know, a compact object like a black hole can do a full 180. In fact, if you obviously, if you.

02:37:15,362 --> 02:37:19,934
SPEAKER_1:  If you went too close, if you put the laser beam too close, the black hole would just fall into it and never come back out.

02:37:20,386 --> 02:37:25,598
SPEAKER_1:  So you just kind of push it out, push it out, push it out until you get to a point where it's just skirting the event horizon.

02:37:26,114 --> 02:37:28,414
SPEAKER_1:  and then that laser beam skirts around and it comes back.

02:37:29,058 --> 02:37:32,382
SPEAKER_1:  Now the laser beam wants to do a grav- I mean it is doing a gravitational slingshot.

02:37:33,314 --> 02:37:36,670
SPEAKER_1:  but laser, I mean light photons can't speed up unlike.

02:37:36,962 --> 02:37:38,366
SPEAKER_1:  in like the spaceship case.

02:37:38,850 --> 02:37:43,422
SPEAKER_1:  So instead of speeding up, the way they steal energy is they increase their frequency.

02:37:43,938 --> 02:37:47,934
SPEAKER_1:  so they become higher energy photon packets essentially, they get blueshifted.

02:37:48,258 --> 02:37:52,222
SPEAKER_1:  so that you send maybe a red laser beam that comes back blue, it's got more energy in it.

02:37:52,770 --> 02:37:55,230
SPEAKER_1:  And because photons carry momentum...

02:37:55,618 --> 02:38:01,534
SPEAKER_1:  which is somewhat unintuitive in everyday experience, but they do, that's how solar cells work, they carry momentum, they push things.

02:38:02,018 --> 02:38:05,598
SPEAKER_1:  You can even use them as laser tweezers and things to pick things up.

02:38:06,082 --> 02:38:06,526
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:38:06,850 --> 02:38:07,902
SPEAKER_1:  because they push.

02:38:08,386 --> 02:38:10,750
SPEAKER_1:  It comes back with more momentum than it left.

02:38:11,522 --> 02:38:11,934
SPEAKER_1:  So.

02:38:12,162 --> 02:38:14,686
SPEAKER_1:  you get an acceleration force from this.

02:38:15,042 --> 02:38:19,422
SPEAKER_1:  And again, you're just seeing energy from the black hole to do this. So you can get up to the same speed.

02:38:20,098 --> 02:38:23,614
SPEAKER_1:  Basically the same idea as Freeman Dyson, but doing it from a safer distance.

02:38:24,098 --> 02:38:29,182
SPEAKER_1:  And there should be a border of a million or so or 10 million black holes in the Milky Way galaxy.

02:38:29,986 --> 02:38:30,942
SPEAKER_1:  Some of them.

02:38:31,362 --> 02:38:35,102
SPEAKER_1:  would be even as close as sort of 10 to 20 light years when you do that.

02:38:35,458 --> 02:38:38,718
SPEAKER_1:  occurrence rate statistics of how close you might expect a feasibly one to be.

02:38:39,042 --> 02:38:43,102
SPEAKER_1:  They're of course difficult to detect because they're black, so they're inherently hard to see.

02:38:43,394 --> 02:38:51,838
SPEAKER_1:  But statistically, there should be plenty out there in the Milky Way. And so these objects would be natural waypoint stations. You could use them to both accelerate away.

02:38:52,258 --> 02:38:54,046
SPEAKER_1:  and to break and slow down.

02:38:55,138 --> 02:39:02,558
SPEAKER_0:  And on top of all this, you know, there's, we've been talking about astronomy and cosmology. There's been a lot of exciting.

02:39:03,362 --> 02:39:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  breakthroughs in detection and exploration of

02:39:07,202 --> 02:39:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  black holes.

02:39:08,482 --> 02:39:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  So the boomerang photons that you're talking about.

02:39:13,282 --> 02:39:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  There's been a lot of work on.

02:39:14,978 --> 02:39:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  photon rings and just...

02:39:16,354 --> 02:39:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  All the fun stuff going on outside.

02:39:18,914 --> 02:39:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  black holes.

02:39:21,890 --> 02:39:24,766
SPEAKER_0:  The garbage outside is actually might be the thing that.

02:39:25,378 --> 02:39:25,822
SPEAKER_0:  holds.

02:39:26,338 --> 02:39:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  a key to understanding what's going on inside. And there's the Hawking radiation, there's all kinds of fascinating stuff like a

02:39:32,546 --> 02:39:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, there's trippy stuff about black holes that most people don't understand.

02:39:37,538 --> 02:39:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  I mean the holographic.

02:39:39,874 --> 02:39:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  principle with the plate and the information being stored.

02:39:42,722 --> 02:39:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  potentially outside of the black hole.

02:39:45,602 --> 02:39:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  I don't even, I can't even comprehend.

02:39:48,290 --> 02:39:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  how you can project a three dimensional object onto a 2D and some hostile information where it doesn't destroy it

02:39:53,730 --> 02:39:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  And if it does destroy it, challenging all of physics, all of this is very-

02:39:59,106 --> 02:40:00,030
SPEAKER_0:  interesting.

02:40:00,866 --> 02:40:05,726
SPEAKER_0:  especially for kind of more practical applications of how the black hole can be used for propulsion.

02:40:06,018 --> 02:40:06,750
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean.

02:40:07,458 --> 02:40:10,238
SPEAKER_1:  It may be that black cards are used in all sorts of ways.

02:40:10,466 --> 02:40:11,934
SPEAKER_1:  advanced civilizations

02:40:12,418 --> 02:40:13,182
SPEAKER_1:  I think...

02:40:13,602 --> 02:40:23,422
SPEAKER_1:  Again, it's been a popular idea in science fiction or science fiction tropes that Sagittarius A star, the supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy could be the best place to look for intelligent life in the universe.

02:40:23,874 --> 02:40:25,214
SPEAKER_1:  Because it is a giant.

02:40:25,794 --> 02:40:26,206
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

02:40:26,562 --> 02:40:27,742
SPEAKER_1:  Engine in a way.

02:40:28,130 --> 02:40:28,926
SPEAKER_1:  and it was unique.

02:40:29,282 --> 02:40:36,702
SPEAKER_1:  capability of a black hole is you can basically throw matter into it and you can get these jets that come out the accretion discs and the jets that fly out.

02:40:37,058 --> 02:40:38,206
SPEAKER_1:  And so you can more or less.

02:40:38,466 --> 02:40:44,094
SPEAKER_1:  use them to convert matter into energy V equals MC squared. And there's pretty much nothing else.

02:40:44,482 --> 02:40:49,086
SPEAKER_1:  except for annihilation with its own antiparticle as a way of doing that.

02:40:49,986 --> 02:40:55,134
SPEAKER_1:  So they have some unique properties. You could perhaps power a civilization by just throwing garbage into a black hole.

02:40:55,682 --> 02:41:01,054
SPEAKER_1:  Right. Just throwing asteroids in and how your civilization with as much energy as you really would ever possibly need.

02:41:01,666 --> 02:41:04,990
SPEAKER_1:  and you could also use them to accelerate away across the universe.

02:41:05,378 --> 02:41:11,774
SPEAKER_1:  And you can even imagine using small artificial black holes as thermal generators, right? So the Hawking radiation from them.

02:41:12,354 --> 02:41:15,614
SPEAKER_1:  kind of exponentially increases as they get smaller and smaller in size.

02:41:16,034 --> 02:41:16,734
SPEAKER_1:  I'm so.

02:41:17,122 --> 02:41:20,830
SPEAKER_1:  a very small black hole, one that you can almost imagine like holding in your hand.

02:41:21,186 --> 02:41:23,486
SPEAKER_1:  would be a fairly significant heat source.

02:41:23,906 --> 02:41:26,430
SPEAKER_1:  And so that raises all sorts of.

02:41:26,690 --> 02:41:28,414
SPEAKER_1:  prospects about how you might.

02:41:28,706 --> 02:41:32,126
SPEAKER_1:  use that in an engineering context to power your civilization as well.

02:41:33,058 --> 02:41:33,566
SPEAKER_1:  Oh.

02:41:33,890 --> 02:41:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  You have a video of becoming a Kardashev type 1 civilization. What's our hope?

02:41:38,498 --> 02:41:40,373
SPEAKER_0:  for doing that, or a few orders of magnification.

02:41:40,373 --> 02:41:41,150
SPEAKER_1:  you away from that.

02:41:42,018 --> 02:41:45,182
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it is surprising. I think people tend to think that we're...

02:41:45,666 --> 02:41:51,006
SPEAKER_1:  close to this, this scale that the Kharishchev type one is defined as a civilization.

02:41:51,458 --> 02:41:55,806
SPEAKER_1:  which is using as much energy as is essentially insulin upon the planet from the star.

02:41:56,386 --> 02:41:56,798
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:41:57,090 --> 02:42:03,838
SPEAKER_1:  Sets of water I think for the Earth of something like 10 to the 5 TeraWatts or 10 to the 7 TeraWatts is a gigantic amount of energy.

02:42:04,066 --> 02:42:06,910
SPEAKER_1:  And we're using a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of that right now.

02:42:07,586 --> 02:42:08,574
SPEAKER_1:  So...

02:42:09,314 --> 02:42:15,422
SPEAKER_1:  If you became a Kalashev type one civilization, which is seen not necessarily as a goal into itself, I think people think, well, why?

02:42:15,714 --> 02:42:17,406
SPEAKER_1:  Why are we aspiring to become?

02:42:17,922 --> 02:42:20,894
SPEAKER_1:  this energy hungry civilization, you know, surely.

02:42:21,314 --> 02:42:21,790
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:42:22,018 --> 02:42:27,070
SPEAKER_1:  our energy needs might become, you know, might improve our efficiency or something as time goes on.

02:42:27,394 --> 02:42:29,854
SPEAKER_1:  But ultimately the more energy you have access to.

02:42:30,370 --> 02:42:33,342
SPEAKER_1:  the greater your capabilities will be. If you want to lift.

02:42:33,858 --> 02:42:35,262
SPEAKER_1:  Mount Everest into space.

02:42:35,810 --> 02:42:41,214
SPEAKER_1:  there is just a calculable amount of potential energy change that's going to take in order to accomplish that.

02:42:41,634 --> 02:42:47,710
SPEAKER_1:  then the more energy you have access to as a civilization, then clearly the easier that energy achievement is going to be.

02:42:48,226 --> 02:42:52,606
SPEAKER_1:  So depends on what your aspirations are as a civilization. Might not be something you want to ever do, but-

02:42:53,122 --> 02:43:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  Well, but we should make clear that lifting heavy things isn't the only thing, it's just doing work. So it could be computation. Right, right.

02:43:01,474 --> 02:43:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  It could be more and more and more and more sophisticated and larger and larger and larger computation, which is

02:43:06,402 --> 02:43:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  It does seem where we're headed.

02:43:08,162 --> 02:43:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  with the very fast increase.

02:43:11,746 --> 02:43:12,510
SPEAKER_0:  in, um...

02:43:13,538 --> 02:43:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  the scale and the quality of our computation outside the human brain.

02:43:18,402 --> 02:43:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  artificial computation.

02:43:19,650 --> 02:43:20,638
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean.

02:43:20,898 --> 02:43:22,526
SPEAKER_1:  Competition is a great example of.

02:43:22,914 --> 02:43:28,990
SPEAKER_1:  I mean already I think some like 10% of US power electricity use is going towards the supercomputing centers, so there's a...

02:43:29,282 --> 02:43:33,886
SPEAKER_1:  There's a vast amount of current engine needs which are already going towards computing surely.

02:43:34,274 --> 02:43:35,454
SPEAKER_1:  only increase over time.

02:43:36,098 --> 02:43:40,286
SPEAKER_1:  If we start ever doing anything like mind uploading or creating.

02:43:40,642 --> 02:43:42,238
SPEAKER_1:  simulated realities that

02:43:42,594 --> 02:43:47,902
SPEAKER_1:  that cost will surely become almost a dominant source of our energy requirements at that point if civilization

02:43:48,354 --> 02:43:49,086
SPEAKER_1:  completely.

02:43:49,346 --> 02:43:51,774
SPEAKER_1:  moves over to this kind of post-humanism stage.

02:43:52,258 --> 02:43:52,958
SPEAKER_1:  And so...

02:43:53,314 --> 02:43:59,870
SPEAKER_1:  It's not unreasonable that our energy needs would continue to grow, certainly historically they always have at about 2% per year.

02:44:00,386 --> 02:44:03,326
SPEAKER_1:  And so if that continues, there is going to be a certain point.

02:44:03,778 --> 02:44:04,318
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:44:04,738 --> 02:44:11,806
SPEAKER_1:  where you're running up against the amount of energy which you can harvest because it's you're using every even if you cover the entire planet in solar panels

02:44:12,258 --> 02:44:13,790
SPEAKER_1:  there's no more energy to be had.

02:44:14,306 --> 02:44:14,718
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:44:15,170 --> 02:44:19,518
SPEAKER_1:  And so this is a, you know, there's a few ways of achieving this. I sort of talked about in the video how.

02:44:19,842 --> 02:44:23,518
SPEAKER_1:  There were several renewable energy sources that we're excited about like geothermal.

02:44:23,970 --> 02:44:25,342
SPEAKER_1:  wind power waves but...

02:44:25,986 --> 02:44:27,102
SPEAKER_1:  Prim it all of those.

02:44:27,490 --> 02:44:34,910
SPEAKER_1:  don't really scratch the surface or don't really scratch the itch of getting into a Kardashev type 1 civilization. They're meaningful now I would never tell anybody don't do.

02:44:35,426 --> 02:44:39,838
SPEAKER_1:  wind power now because it's clearly useful for our current stage of civilization.

02:44:40,194 --> 02:44:40,734
SPEAKER_1:  But it's not.

02:44:41,058 --> 02:44:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  it's going to be a pretty negligible fraction of our energy requirements if we got to that stage of development.

02:44:45,858 --> 02:44:47,518
SPEAKER_1:  And so there has to be a breakthrough.

02:44:47,874 --> 02:44:50,494
SPEAKER_1:  in either our ability to harvest solar energy.

02:44:50,754 --> 02:44:55,710
SPEAKER_1:  which would require maybe something like a space array of solar panels to beaming the energy back down.

02:44:56,290 --> 02:44:57,406
SPEAKER_1:  or some.

02:44:58,018 --> 02:45:04,702
SPEAKER_1:  developments and innovations in nuclear fusion that will allow us to essentially reproduce the same process of

02:45:05,058 --> 02:45:06,526
SPEAKER_1:  what's producing the solar photons.

02:45:06,754 --> 02:45:07,582
SPEAKER_1:  but here on Earth.

02:45:08,066 --> 02:45:13,342
SPEAKER_1:  But even that comes with some consequences. If you're generating the energy here on earth and you're doing work on it on earth

02:45:13,890 --> 02:45:18,590
SPEAKER_1:  then that work is going to produce waste heat and that waste heat is going to increase the ambient temperature of the planet.

02:45:19,202 --> 02:45:19,774
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

02:45:20,386 --> 02:45:30,366
SPEAKER_1:  you whether even if this isn't really a greenhouse effect that you're increasing the temperature of the planet, this is just the amount of computers that are churning. You can feel the warmth coming off them.

02:45:30,882 --> 02:45:32,190
SPEAKER_1:  if you do that much work.

02:45:32,578 --> 02:45:36,702
SPEAKER_1:  of literally the entire instant energy of the planet is doing that work.

02:45:37,186 --> 02:45:40,510
SPEAKER_1:  the planet is going to warm up significantly as a result of that.

02:45:41,218 --> 02:45:42,814
SPEAKER_1:  And so, you know, that's a...

02:45:44,066 --> 02:45:44,926
SPEAKER_1:  that clearly...

02:45:45,698 --> 02:45:54,590
SPEAKER_1:  indicates that this is not a sustainable path, that civilizations as they approach color shift type one are gonna have to leave planet Earth, which is really the point of that video to show that.

02:45:55,106 --> 02:45:55,614
SPEAKER_1:  It's.

02:45:56,546 --> 02:45:57,150
SPEAKER_1:  Akashive.

02:45:57,634 --> 02:46:00,830
SPEAKER_1:  Type 1 civilization even though it's defined as instant energy upon a planet.

02:46:01,282 --> 02:46:02,910
SPEAKER_1:  That is not a species.

02:46:03,266 --> 02:46:05,054
SPEAKER_1:  that is going to still be living on their planet.

02:46:05,282 --> 02:46:05,950
SPEAKER_1:  erliest.

02:46:06,370 --> 02:46:11,262
SPEAKER_1:  Um, in isolation, they will have to be harvesting energy from afar. They will have to be.

02:46:11,714 --> 02:46:15,102
SPEAKER_1:  You doing work on that energy outside of that planet because

02:46:15,490 --> 02:46:18,878
SPEAKER_1:  Otherwise you're going to dramatically change the environment in which you live.

02:46:19,490 --> 02:46:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  Well, yeah, so that's a.

02:46:22,242 --> 02:46:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  The more energy you create, the more energy you use.

02:46:24,770 --> 02:46:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  the higher the imperative to expand out into the universe, but also not just the imperative but the capabilities.

02:46:31,042 --> 02:46:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  and you're...

02:46:32,098 --> 02:46:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  You've kind of as a side.

02:46:34,466 --> 02:46:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  on your lab page mentioned that you're sometimes interested in astro engineering.

02:46:39,362 --> 02:46:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  So what kind of space architectures do you think we can build?

02:46:44,290 --> 02:46:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  house.

02:46:45,186 --> 02:46:47,422
SPEAKER_0:  humans or interesting things outside of Earth.

02:46:48,546 --> 02:46:49,278
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean...

02:46:49,762 --> 02:46:56,222
SPEAKER_1:  There's a lot of fun ideas here. One of the classic ideas is an O'Neill cylinder or a Stanford Taurus. These are like two.

02:46:56,610 --> 02:47:00,702
SPEAKER_1:  rotating structures that were devised in space. And that was the 3rd basicly

02:47:01,314 --> 02:47:06,430
SPEAKER_1:  using the centrifugal force as artificial gravity. And so these are structures which tend to be...

02:47:06,818 --> 02:47:10,590
SPEAKER_1:  many kilometers across that you're building in space, but could potentially.

02:47:11,042 --> 02:47:15,390
SPEAKER_1:  habitat, millions of people in orbit of the Earth.

02:47:15,970 --> 02:47:22,526
SPEAKER_1:  And of course you could imagine putting them if you know the expanse does a pretty good job I think of exploring the idea of

02:47:22,818 --> 02:47:25,182
SPEAKER_1:  human exploration of the solar system and having

02:47:25,570 --> 02:47:26,014
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

02:47:26,402 --> 02:47:31,358
SPEAKER_1:  many objects, many of the small near-earth objects and asteroids inhabited by mining colonies.

02:47:31,906 --> 02:47:32,414
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:47:33,154 --> 02:47:37,694
SPEAKER_1:  One of the ideas we've played around with our group is this technology called a quasi.

02:47:38,274 --> 02:47:39,678
SPEAKER_1:  A quasi is.

02:47:40,386 --> 02:47:40,862
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:47:41,378 --> 02:47:45,694
SPEAKER_1:  An extension, again, we always tend to extend previous ideas, ideas built upon ideas.

02:47:46,050 --> 02:47:48,030
SPEAKER_1:  an extension idea called a statite.

02:47:48,546 --> 02:48:01,790
SPEAKER_1:  A statite was an idea proposed, I think by Ron Forward in the 1970s. 1970 seemed to have all sorts of wacky ideas. I don't know what was going on then. We had the Stanford, I think the Stanford Taurus, the O'Neill departures has stopped, beautiful, to the believe or believe in만 new land

02:48:02,178 --> 02:48:08,510
SPEAKER_1:  The gravitational lens, people were really having fun with dreaming about space in the 70s.

02:48:08,962 --> 02:48:11,134
SPEAKER_1:  The Stata is basically.

02:48:11,458 --> 02:48:12,606
SPEAKER_1:  A solar sail.

02:48:13,250 --> 02:48:19,902
SPEAKER_1:  but it's such an efficient solar sail that the outward force of radiation pressure equals the inward force of gravity from the Sun.

02:48:20,642 --> 02:48:21,790
SPEAKER_1:  and so it doesn't need to orbit.

02:48:22,594 --> 02:48:26,654
SPEAKER_1:  Normally you avoid, the sun is pulling us right now through force of gravity.

02:48:26,946 --> 02:48:27,518
SPEAKER_1:  but we're not.

02:48:27,746 --> 02:48:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  We are not.

02:48:28,706 --> 02:48:30,174
SPEAKER_1:  getting closer towards the sun.

02:48:30,786 --> 02:48:38,558
SPEAKER_1:  even though we are falling towards the sun because we're in orbit, which means our translational speed is just enough to keep us at the same altitude essentially from the sun.

02:48:39,170 --> 02:48:44,286
SPEAKER_1:  And so you're in orbit and that's how you maintain distance. A Stato doesn't need to do that. It can be basically.

02:48:44,802 --> 02:48:47,838
SPEAKER_1:  completely static and inertial space.

02:48:48,194 --> 02:48:53,054
SPEAKER_1:  but it's just balancing the two forces of radiation pressure and inward gravitational pressure.

02:48:53,570 --> 02:48:56,414
SPEAKER_1:  A quasi is the in between of those two states.

02:48:56,834 --> 02:48:58,142
SPEAKER_1:  So it's...

02:48:58,722 --> 02:49:01,534
SPEAKER_1:  has some significant outward pressure, but not enough.

02:49:01,954 --> 02:49:07,294
SPEAKER_1:  to resist fully falling into the star. And so it compensates for that by having some translational motion.

02:49:07,650 --> 02:49:08,702
SPEAKER_1:  So it's in between.

02:49:08,994 --> 02:49:10,302
SPEAKER_1:  an orbit and a statite.

02:49:10,946 --> 02:49:14,526
SPEAKER_1:  And so what that allows you to do is maintain artificial orbits.

02:49:14,882 --> 02:49:19,806
SPEAKER_1:  So normally, if you want to calculate your orbital speed of something that's say half an AU,

02:49:20,034 --> 02:49:23,518
SPEAKER_1:  you would use Kepler's third law and go through that and you say okay, if it's set.

02:49:23,906 --> 02:49:28,062
SPEAKER_1:  Half an AU I can calculate the period by p squared proportional to a cubed and go through that.

02:49:28,578 --> 02:49:29,438
SPEAKER_1:  but for a

02:49:29,666 --> 02:49:32,574
SPEAKER_1:  Um, a quasi you can basically have any speed you want.

02:49:32,802 --> 02:49:34,590
SPEAKER_1:  It's just a matter of how much.

02:49:35,010 --> 02:49:37,502
SPEAKER_1:  How much of the gravitational force are you balancing out?

02:49:38,210 --> 02:49:43,326
SPEAKER_1:  You effectively enter an orbit where you're making the mass of the star be less massive than it really is.

02:49:43,810 --> 02:49:48,414
SPEAKER_1:  So it's as if you're orbiting a 0.1 solar mass star or a 0.2 solar mass star, whatever you want.

02:49:48,866 --> 02:49:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  I say that means that...

02:49:50,498 --> 02:49:54,942
SPEAKER_1:  Mercury orbits with a pretty fast orbital speed.

02:49:55,618 --> 02:49:56,286
SPEAKER_1:  Around the sun.

02:49:56,738 --> 02:49:58,622
SPEAKER_1:  because it's closer to the sun than we are.

02:49:58,978 --> 02:50:00,926
SPEAKER_1:  but we could put something in Mercury's orbit.

02:50:01,442 --> 02:50:05,150
SPEAKER_1:  that would have a slower speed and so it would co-track with the earth.

02:50:05,794 --> 02:50:09,118
SPEAKER_1:  And so we would always be aligned with them at all times.

02:50:09,442 --> 02:50:10,750
SPEAKER_1:  And so this could be useful.

02:50:11,138 --> 02:50:13,598
SPEAKER_1:  if you wanted to have a...

02:50:14,210 --> 02:50:19,742
SPEAKER_1:  either a chain of colonies or something that we're able to easily communicate and

02:50:20,386 --> 02:50:20,798
SPEAKER_1:  uh

02:50:21,442 --> 02:50:24,126
SPEAKER_1:  and move between one another between these different bases.

02:50:24,386 --> 02:50:27,454
SPEAKER_1:  you'd probably use something like this to maintain that.

02:50:27,810 --> 02:50:28,350
SPEAKER_1:  Easy.

02:50:28,738 --> 02:50:29,630
SPEAKER_1:  transferability.

02:50:30,306 --> 02:50:35,838
SPEAKER_1:  Or you could even use it as a space weather monitoring system, which we actually propose in the paper.

02:50:36,738 --> 02:50:37,950
SPEAKER_1:  We know that...

02:50:38,370 --> 02:50:44,958
SPEAKER_1:  major events like the Carrington event that happened, you know, it can knock out all of our electromagnetic systems quite easily, a major solar flare could do that.

02:50:45,282 --> 02:50:46,366
SPEAKER_1:  a G-man manic storm.

02:50:47,522 --> 02:50:49,534
SPEAKER_1:  if we had the ability to detect.

02:50:50,050 --> 02:50:51,166
SPEAKER_1:  those.

02:50:51,490 --> 02:50:53,854
SPEAKER_1:  higher elevated activity cycles.

02:50:54,114 --> 02:50:55,070
SPEAKER_1:  in advance.

02:50:55,426 --> 02:50:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  The problem is they travel obviously pretty fast and so it's hard to get ahead of them.

02:50:59,714 --> 02:51:04,926
SPEAKER_1:  but you could have a station which is basically sampling solar flares very close to the surface of the Earth as soon as it detects anything.

02:51:05,218 --> 02:51:06,078
SPEAKER_1:  Suspicious.

02:51:06,370 --> 02:51:11,422
SPEAKER_1:  magnetically it could then send that information straight back at the speed light to your earth and give you

02:51:11,650 --> 02:51:12,158
SPEAKER_1:  maybe.

02:51:12,578 --> 02:51:17,374
SPEAKER_1:  a half an hour warning or something that something bad was coming, you should shut off all your

02:51:17,794 --> 02:51:21,150
SPEAKER_1:  systems or get in your Faraday cage now and protect yourself.

02:51:21,570 --> 02:51:23,998
SPEAKER_1:  Um, and so these, these cries are kind of a cool.

02:51:24,514 --> 02:51:27,006
SPEAKER_1:  trick of again kind of hacking the laws of physics.

02:51:27,522 --> 02:51:30,942
SPEAKER_1:  It's like another one of these exploits that the universe seems to allow us to do.

02:51:31,426 --> 02:51:31,934
SPEAKER_1:  to.

02:51:32,514 --> 02:51:37,726
SPEAKER_1:  potentially manifest these artificial systems that would otherwise be difficult to

02:51:38,018 --> 02:51:38,622
SPEAKER_1:  to produce.

02:51:39,170 --> 02:51:40,606
SPEAKER_1:  leveraging natural phenomena.

02:51:42,850 --> 02:51:43,646
SPEAKER_1:  That's always the key.

02:51:43,874 --> 02:51:44,862
SPEAKER_1:  is to work.

02:51:45,538 --> 02:51:48,254
SPEAKER_1:  In my mind it's to work with nature. That's how I see astro engineering.

02:51:48,514 --> 02:51:50,750
SPEAKER_1:  rather than against it. You're not trying to...

02:51:51,266 --> 02:51:55,838
SPEAKER_1:  force it to do something. That's why we always think solar energy is so powerful because

02:51:56,226 --> 02:52:03,486
SPEAKER_1:  in the battle against nuclear fusion nuclear fusion you're really fighting a battle where you're trying to confine plasma into this extremely tight space or

02:52:04,002 --> 02:52:05,438
SPEAKER_1:  Um, it's...

02:52:05,794 --> 02:52:08,094
SPEAKER_1:  The sun does this for free. It has gravitation.

02:52:08,546 --> 02:52:09,214
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

02:52:10,434 --> 02:52:15,070
SPEAKER_1:  the earth in essence what a solar panel does it is a nuclear fusion reactive.

02:52:15,330 --> 02:52:15,806
SPEAKER_1:  Cured.

02:52:16,386 --> 02:52:17,278
SPEAKER_1:  Energy System

02:52:17,730 --> 02:52:24,158
SPEAKER_1:  but it's just using gravitation for the confinement and having a huge standoff distance for his energy collection.

02:52:24,674 --> 02:52:25,342
SPEAKER_1:  And so...

02:52:25,698 --> 02:52:26,974
SPEAKER_1:  Um, there are.

02:52:27,362 --> 02:52:31,262
SPEAKER_1:  tricks like that, it's a very naive simple trick in that case, where we can

02:52:31,618 --> 02:52:33,150
SPEAKER_1:  rather having to reinvent the wheel.

02:52:33,378 --> 02:52:36,062
SPEAKER_1:  we can use the space infrastructure if you like.

02:52:36,386 --> 02:52:38,814
SPEAKER_1:  astrophysical infrastructure that's already there to our benefit.

02:52:39,170 --> 02:52:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I think in the long arc of human history.

02:52:42,434 --> 02:52:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  Probably natural phenomena is the right solution.

02:52:45,410 --> 02:52:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  That's the simple, that's the elegant solution because all the power is already there. That's why I dice in the sphere in the long.

02:52:51,330 --> 02:52:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  Serve.

02:52:52,930 --> 02:52:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  You don't know what a death sphere would look like, but some kind of...

02:52:56,706 --> 02:53:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  thing that leverages the power, the energy that's already in the sun is better than.

02:53:01,538 --> 02:53:03,390
SPEAKER_0:  creating artificial nuclear.

02:53:04,002 --> 02:53:06,078
SPEAKER_0:  fusion reaction but then again

02:53:07,042 --> 02:53:07,358
SPEAKER_0:  that

02:53:07,842 --> 02:53:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  brings us to the topic of AI.

02:53:09,954 --> 02:53:11,102
SPEAKER_0:  How much of this?

02:53:12,450 --> 02:53:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  If we're traveling...

02:53:13,634 --> 02:53:14,238
SPEAKER_0:  out there.

02:53:15,458 --> 02:53:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  Interstellar travel or

02:53:18,818 --> 02:53:20,862
SPEAKER_0:  doing some of the interesting things we'll be talking about.

02:53:21,410 --> 02:53:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  How much?

02:53:22,850 --> 02:53:25,950
SPEAKER_0:  of those ships would be occupied by AI systems, do you think?

02:53:28,066 --> 02:53:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  What would the...

02:53:31,746 --> 02:53:34,814
SPEAKER_0:  What would be the living organisms occupying those ships?

02:53:37,058 --> 02:53:37,822
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it-

02:53:38,402 --> 02:53:41,566
SPEAKER_1:  It's depressing to think about AI in the search for life because

02:53:42,850 --> 02:53:50,302
SPEAKER_1:  I've been thinking about this a lot over the last few weeks with playing around with chat gbt3 like many of us and being astonished with its capabilities.

02:53:50,658 --> 02:53:51,550
SPEAKER_1:  and you see.

02:53:51,938 --> 02:53:53,630
SPEAKER_1:  the NASA society.

02:53:54,498 --> 02:53:54,910
SPEAKER_1:  is

02:53:55,330 --> 02:53:56,542
SPEAKER_1:  undergoing a change.

02:53:57,698 --> 02:54:01,438
SPEAKER_1:  seems significant in terms of the development of artificial intelligence. We've been...

02:54:01,730 --> 02:54:02,590
SPEAKER_1:  Promise this.

02:54:03,074 --> 02:54:05,374
SPEAKER_1:  revolution to singularity for a long time.

02:54:05,762 --> 02:54:07,134
SPEAKER_1:  but it really seems to be...

02:54:07,362 --> 02:54:08,062
SPEAKER_1:  stepping up.

02:54:08,322 --> 02:54:11,390
SPEAKER_1:  its pace of development at this point.

02:54:12,130 --> 02:54:12,670
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

02:54:13,026 --> 02:54:13,950
SPEAKER_1:  That's interesting.

02:54:14,466 --> 02:54:15,262
SPEAKER_1:  because...

02:54:15,618 --> 02:54:16,990
SPEAKER_1:  as someone who looks radiant live.

02:54:17,538 --> 02:54:18,718
SPEAKER_1:  out there in the universe.

02:54:19,458 --> 02:54:19,934
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:54:20,578 --> 02:54:21,630
SPEAKER_1:  It sort of implies that...

02:54:22,018 --> 02:54:23,390
SPEAKER_1:  our current stage of development.

02:54:23,682 --> 02:54:24,862
SPEAKER_1:  is highly transitional.

02:54:25,794 --> 02:54:26,174
SPEAKER_1:  And that.

02:54:27,362 --> 02:54:32,030
SPEAKER_1:  you know, you go back for the last four and a half billion years, the planet was done, essentially.

02:54:32,546 --> 02:54:33,342
SPEAKER_1:  if you go back.

02:54:33,666 --> 02:54:37,854
SPEAKER_1:  That's a few thousand years of civilization, but it wasn't reproducing any technosignatures

02:54:38,242 --> 02:54:42,398
SPEAKER_1:  And then over the last maybe 100 years, there's been something that might be detectable from afar.

02:54:43,394 --> 02:54:47,518
SPEAKER_1:  But we're approaching this cusp where we might imagine it. Get to the end of this bold test.

02:54:47,906 --> 02:54:51,390
SPEAKER_1:  We're thinking of like maybe years and decades with AI development.

02:54:51,650 --> 02:54:52,926
SPEAKER_1:  typically when we talk about this.

02:54:53,410 --> 02:54:56,990
SPEAKER_1:  But as an astronomer, I have to think about much longer timescales of centuries.

02:54:57,378 --> 02:54:58,046
SPEAKER_1:  millennia

02:54:58,370 --> 02:54:59,390
SPEAKER_1:  millions of years.

02:54:59,906 --> 02:55:00,830
SPEAKER_1:  And so if this...

02:55:01,602 --> 02:55:04,350
SPEAKER_1:  if this wave continues over that time scale.

02:55:04,674 --> 02:55:07,390
SPEAKER_1:  Which is still the blink of an eye on a cosmic timescale.

02:55:08,226 --> 02:55:09,118
SPEAKER_1:  That implies that

02:55:10,498 --> 02:55:13,406
SPEAKER_1:  everything will be AI essentially out there if this is a common

02:55:13,698 --> 02:55:17,406
SPEAKER_1:  behavior. And so that's intriguing because it sort of implies that we are

02:55:18,178 --> 02:55:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  special.

02:55:19,586 --> 02:55:22,462
SPEAKER_1:  in terms of our moment in time as a civilization.

02:55:23,170 --> 02:55:24,862
SPEAKER_1:  which normally is...

02:55:25,954 --> 02:55:34,430
SPEAKER_1:  something we're averse to as astronomers. We normally like this mediocrity principle. We're not special, we're a typical part of the universe. We're not the cosmological principle.

02:55:34,850 --> 02:55:36,862
SPEAKER_1:  but in a temporal sense we may be.

02:55:37,442 --> 02:55:39,486
SPEAKER_1:  in a unique location.

02:55:40,130 --> 02:55:45,662
SPEAKER_1:  And perhaps that is part of the solution to the Fermi paradox, in fact, that if it is true that

02:55:46,306 --> 02:55:48,638
SPEAKER_1:  planets tend to go through basically three phases.

02:55:49,186 --> 02:55:51,390
SPEAKER_1:  dumb life for the vast majority.

02:55:52,354 --> 02:55:54,622
SPEAKER_1:  a brief period of biological intelligence.

02:55:54,882 --> 02:55:58,750
SPEAKER_1:  and then an extended period of artificial intelligence that they transition to.

02:55:59,170 --> 02:55:59,614
SPEAKER_1:  then

02:56:00,098 --> 02:56:00,638
SPEAKER_1:  We would be.

02:56:01,346 --> 02:56:06,430
SPEAKER_1:  in a unique and special moment in galactic history that would be of particular interest for any.

02:56:06,786 --> 02:56:10,206
SPEAKER_1:  anthropologists out there in the galaxy, right? This would be the time.

02:56:10,626 --> 02:56:13,150
SPEAKER_1:  that you would want to study a civilization.

02:56:13,570 --> 02:56:15,582
SPEAKER_1:  very carefully, you wouldn't want to interfere with it.

02:56:16,226 --> 02:56:18,366
SPEAKER_1:  You would just want to see how it plays out.

02:56:18,690 --> 02:56:22,846
SPEAKER_1:  Kind of similar to the ancestor simulations, but sometimes switched over to the same national argument.

02:56:23,234 --> 02:56:29,246
SPEAKER_1:  that you are able to observe perhaps your own origins and study how the transformation happens.

02:56:29,698 --> 02:56:33,182
SPEAKER_1:  And so yeah, that has for me recently been destroying the Fermi paradox a bit on its head.

02:56:33,634 --> 02:56:38,814
SPEAKER_1:  and this idea of the zoo hypothesis that we may be monitored, which has for a long time been sort of

02:56:39,746 --> 02:56:42,750
SPEAKER_1:  seen as a fringe idea even amongst the SETI community.

02:56:44,258 --> 02:56:45,790
SPEAKER_1:  if we live in this truly.

02:56:46,402 --> 02:56:47,614
SPEAKER_1:  transitional period.

02:56:47,970 --> 02:56:50,526
SPEAKER_1:  It adds a lot of impetus to that idea, I think.

02:56:51,106 --> 02:56:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  or even AI itself.

02:56:54,370 --> 02:56:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  by its very nature would be observing us.

02:56:57,442 --> 02:56:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  by

02:56:58,178 --> 02:56:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it's like a.

02:57:00,322 --> 02:57:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  There used to be this concept of human computation, which is actually exactly what's feeding the current chat.

02:57:06,690 --> 02:57:07,902
SPEAKER_0:  language models.

02:57:08,386 --> 02:57:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  which is leveraging all the busy stuff we're doing.

02:57:12,258 --> 02:57:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  to.

02:57:12,962 --> 02:57:16,702
SPEAKER_0:  do the hard work of learning so like the language models are trained on.

02:57:17,538 --> 02:57:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  human.

02:57:18,786 --> 02:57:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  Interaction in Human Language on the Internet.

02:57:21,282 --> 02:57:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  And so it would

02:57:23,042 --> 02:57:23,934
SPEAKER_0:  AI.

02:57:24,322 --> 02:57:24,926
SPEAKER_0:  feeds.

02:57:25,442 --> 02:57:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  and the...

02:57:26,594 --> 02:57:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  I'll put a brain power from humans.

02:57:29,954 --> 02:57:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  And so like it would be observing observing.

02:57:33,346 --> 02:57:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  and it gets stronger as it observes. So it actually gets extremely good at observing humans.

02:57:38,306 --> 02:57:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  And one of the interesting philosophical questions that starts.

02:57:42,338 --> 02:57:43,966
SPEAKER_0:  percolating is what makes this.

02:57:44,610 --> 02:57:46,494
SPEAKER_0:  What is the interesting thing that makes us human?

02:57:48,290 --> 02:57:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  We tend to think of it...

02:57:49,922 --> 02:57:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  And you said like there's three phases. What's the thing that's hard to come by in phase three?

02:57:55,874 --> 02:57:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  Is it?

02:57:57,090 --> 02:57:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  something like scarcity, which is limited resources.

02:58:00,162 --> 02:58:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  Is it something like consciousness? Is that the thing that's very-

02:58:03,906 --> 02:58:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  What do?

02:58:04,738 --> 02:58:07,646
SPEAKER_0:  uh... that emerged the evolutionary process

02:58:08,258 --> 02:58:09,822
SPEAKER_0:  in biological systems.

02:58:10,082 --> 02:58:11,198
SPEAKER_0:  that are opening under

02:58:11,522 --> 02:58:12,766
SPEAKER_0:  constrained resources.

02:58:14,978 --> 02:58:20,254
SPEAKER_0:  this thing that feels, that it feels like something to experience the world, which we think of as consciousness.

02:58:20,642 --> 02:58:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  Is that really difficult to replicate in artificial systems? Is that the thing that makes us fundamentally human?

02:58:27,554 --> 02:58:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  Or is it just a side effect?

02:58:29,730 --> 02:58:32,126
SPEAKER_0:  that we attribute way too much importance to.

02:58:32,674 --> 02:58:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  Do you have a sense?

02:58:37,890 --> 02:58:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  If you look out into the future and AI systems are the ones that are traveling out there.

02:58:42,530 --> 02:58:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  12th Century and beyond.

02:58:45,986 --> 02:58:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  Do you think they have to carry the flame of consciousness with them?

02:58:51,138 --> 02:58:52,894
SPEAKER_1:  No, not necessarily.

02:58:53,250 --> 02:58:55,710
SPEAKER_1:  They may do, but they may, it may not be.

02:58:56,386 --> 02:58:57,374
SPEAKER_1:  unnecessarily.

02:58:58,562 --> 02:59:01,886
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, there's, I guess we're talking about the difference here between sort of an AGI.

02:59:02,338 --> 02:59:03,902
SPEAKER_1:  Artificial German Ent

02:59:04,162 --> 02:59:05,182
SPEAKER_1:  consciousness which

02:59:05,474 --> 02:59:06,174
SPEAKER_1:  a distinct.

02:59:06,562 --> 02:59:10,687
SPEAKER_1:  ideas and you can certainly have one without the other. So I could imagine.

02:59:10,687 --> 02:59:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  I would disagree with this certainly in that state.

02:59:13,186 --> 02:59:13,566
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

02:59:13,826 --> 02:59:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, I think it's very possible in order to have intelligence you have to have.

02:59:18,786 --> 02:59:20,830
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, well, I mean to a certain degree...

02:59:21,602 --> 02:59:26,270
SPEAKER_1:  chat gbt3 has a level of intelligence already it's not a general intelligence but

02:59:26,850 --> 02:59:30,206
SPEAKER_1:  It displays properties of intelligence with no.

02:59:30,434 --> 02:59:31,422
SPEAKER_1:  consciousness so

02:59:31,810 --> 02:59:33,982
SPEAKER_1:  Again, I would disagree. Okay. Kidsulsive is the name of your situation.

02:59:34,306 --> 02:59:34,686
SPEAKER_1:  Whoa.

02:59:35,554 --> 02:59:38,179
SPEAKER_1:  I don't, I don't, I don't know.

02:59:38,179 --> 02:59:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  It's very nice that you said it displays properties of intelligence.

02:59:43,042 --> 02:59:46,206
SPEAKER_0:  in the same way it displays properties of intelligence, I would say.

02:59:46,434 --> 02:59:49,086
SPEAKER_0:  it's starting to display properties of consciousness.

02:59:49,314 --> 02:59:50,439
SPEAKER_0:  It certainly could fool you.

02:59:50,439 --> 02:59:51,102
SPEAKER_1:  It is conscious.

02:59:52,002 --> 02:59:53,662
SPEAKER_1:  Correct, yeah, I guess I get it.

02:59:54,178 --> 02:59:55,326
SPEAKER_1:  a Turing test problem like.

02:59:55,586 --> 02:59:56,158
SPEAKER_1:  if it's.

02:59:57,154 --> 02:59:58,622
SPEAKER_1:  displaying all those properties.

02:59:59,202 --> 03:00:07,550
SPEAKER_1:  If it, if it cracks like a parrot, looks like a parrot or cracks like a duck, isn't it, isn't it basically a duck at that point? So yeah, I can see that argument.

03:00:08,226 --> 03:00:09,406
SPEAKER_1:  It probably...

03:00:10,946 --> 03:00:13,726
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, certainly as an, I tried to think about it from.

03:00:14,114 --> 03:00:17,534
SPEAKER_1:  The observer's point of view as an astronomer, what am I looking for?

03:00:18,018 --> 03:00:18,910
SPEAKER_1:  whether that

03:00:19,362 --> 03:00:21,726
SPEAKER_1:  intelligence is conscious or not.

03:00:22,018 --> 03:00:23,070
SPEAKER_1:  has little.

03:00:23,298 --> 03:00:24,894
SPEAKER_1:  Daring my thinkers too.

03:00:25,474 --> 03:00:29,918
SPEAKER_1:  what I should be looking for when I'm trying to detect evidence of them.

03:00:30,690 --> 03:00:31,006
SPEAKER_1:  It would.

03:00:31,234 --> 03:00:32,670
SPEAKER_1:  maybe affect their...

03:00:33,186 --> 03:00:35,614
SPEAKER_1:  behavior in ways that I can't.

03:00:35,842 --> 03:00:36,414
SPEAKER_1:  Predict?

03:00:37,058 --> 03:00:37,566
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:00:38,018 --> 03:00:38,430
SPEAKER_1:  but

03:00:38,818 --> 03:00:46,910
SPEAKER_1:  That's again getting into the game of what I would call xenopsychology of trying to make projections about the motivations of an alien species is incredibly difficult.

03:00:47,714 --> 03:00:50,814
SPEAKER_1:  And similarly, for any kind of artificial intelligence, it's...

03:00:51,202 --> 03:00:53,054
SPEAKER_1:  and Fathmo what its intentions may be.

03:00:53,666 --> 03:00:54,174
SPEAKER_1:  I mean...

03:00:54,530 --> 03:00:57,598
SPEAKER_1:  I would sort of question whether it would even be interested in.

03:00:58,146 --> 03:00:59,422
SPEAKER_1:  traveling between the stars at all.

03:01:00,162 --> 03:01:01,502
SPEAKER_1:  if it's primary goal.

03:01:01,730 --> 03:01:02,814
SPEAKER_1:  is computation.

03:01:03,426 --> 03:01:05,278
SPEAKER_1:  computation for the sake of computation.

03:01:05,890 --> 03:01:06,398
SPEAKER_1:  Then.

03:01:07,362 --> 03:01:08,638
SPEAKER_1:  probably going to have a different.

03:01:09,570 --> 03:01:15,262
SPEAKER_1:  way of, you know, it's going to be engineering its solar system and the nearby material around it for a different goal.

03:01:15,778 --> 03:01:17,694
SPEAKER_1:  if it's just simply trying to increase.

03:01:18,114 --> 03:01:19,966
SPEAKER_1:  computer substrate across the universe.

03:01:20,738 --> 03:01:27,230
SPEAKER_1:  And that of course, if that is its principal intention to just essentially convert dumb matter into smart matter as it goes.

03:01:27,810 --> 03:01:28,350
SPEAKER_1:  then

03:01:29,186 --> 03:01:33,150
SPEAKER_1:  I think that would come into conflict with our observations of the universe, right? Because...

03:01:33,890 --> 03:01:34,462
SPEAKER_1:  the

03:01:34,754 --> 03:01:36,670
SPEAKER_1:  The Earth shouldn't be here if that were true.

03:01:36,898 --> 03:01:40,094
SPEAKER_1:  the Earth should have been transformed into computer substrate by this point.

03:01:40,610 --> 03:01:44,414
SPEAKER_1:  There has been plenty of time in the history of the galaxy for that to have happened.

03:01:45,090 --> 03:01:45,502
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:01:45,890 --> 03:01:47,166
SPEAKER_1:  So I'm skeptical.

03:01:47,906 --> 03:01:48,798
SPEAKER_1:  that we can.

03:01:49,346 --> 03:01:49,790
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

03:01:50,818 --> 03:01:56,542
SPEAKER_1:  I'm skeptical in the part that that's a behavior that AI or any civilization really engages in.

03:01:56,930 --> 03:01:59,518
SPEAKER_1:  but I also find it difficult to find a way out of it.

03:02:00,578 --> 03:02:02,366
SPEAKER_1:  I have to explain why.

03:02:02,594 --> 03:02:06,782
SPEAKER_1:  that would never happen in the entire history of the galaxy amongst potentially if life is common.

03:02:07,394 --> 03:02:09,054
SPEAKER_1:  millions, maybe even billions of

03:02:09,282 --> 03:02:12,798
SPEAKER_1:  instant instantiations of AI could have occurred across the galaxy.

03:02:13,410 --> 03:02:16,702
SPEAKER_1:  Um, and so that seems to be a knock against.

03:02:17,218 --> 03:02:18,494
SPEAKER_1:  the idea that.

03:02:18,850 --> 03:02:22,238
SPEAKER_1:  there is life else or intelligent life else in the galaxy

03:02:22,818 --> 03:02:24,606
SPEAKER_1:  the fact that that hasn't occurred.

03:02:24,994 --> 03:02:25,822
SPEAKER_1:  in our history.

03:02:26,402 --> 03:02:30,046
SPEAKER_1:  is maybe the only solid data point we really have about.

03:02:30,338 --> 03:02:32,350
SPEAKER_1:  the activities of other civilizations.

03:02:33,090 --> 03:02:35,742
SPEAKER_0:  Of course, the scary one could be that.

03:02:36,450 --> 03:02:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  or just at this stage.

03:02:38,690 --> 03:02:41,438
SPEAKER_0:  intelligent alien civilizations to start destroying themselves.

03:02:42,594 --> 03:02:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  I guess it becomes too powerful.

03:02:44,354 --> 03:02:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  Everything's just too many weapons, too many nuclear weapons, too many nuclear weapons style systems.

03:02:50,018 --> 03:02:50,558
SPEAKER_0:  that just.

03:02:51,298 --> 03:02:52,926
SPEAKER_0:  from mistake to aggression.

03:02:54,338 --> 03:02:57,022
SPEAKER_0:  Like the probability of self-destruction is too high.

03:02:57,250 --> 03:02:59,006
SPEAKER_0:  relative to the challenge of...

03:02:59,330 --> 03:03:00,254
SPEAKER_0:  of avoiding.

03:03:00,994 --> 03:03:03,582
SPEAKER_0:  the technological challenges of avoiding self-destruction.

03:03:05,090 --> 03:03:06,654
SPEAKER_1:  You mean the AI?

03:03:06,978 --> 03:03:07,774
SPEAKER_1:  destroys itself.

03:03:08,002 --> 03:03:10,110
SPEAKER_1:  or we just write ours prior to the

03:03:10,370 --> 03:03:10,942
SPEAKER_1:  Ad-ferne cookies!

03:03:11,234 --> 03:03:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  as we get smarter and smarter AI.

03:03:14,178 --> 03:03:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  Um, either AI destroys us or other, there could be just a million, like AI is correlated, the development of AI is correlated with all this other technological innovation.

03:03:23,298 --> 03:03:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  genetic engineering.

03:03:27,010 --> 03:03:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  all kinds of engineering at the nanoscale.

03:03:30,722 --> 03:03:36,254
SPEAKER_0:  mass manufacture of things that could destroy us or cracking physics enough to have.

03:03:36,674 --> 03:03:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  very powerful weapons.

03:03:38,338 --> 03:03:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  nuclear weapons.

03:03:39,714 --> 03:03:40,478
SPEAKER_0:  All of it, just.

03:03:40,706 --> 03:03:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  too much.

03:03:41,890 --> 03:03:45,438
SPEAKER_0:  Physics enables way too many things that can destroy us.

03:03:47,266 --> 03:03:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  before it enables the.

03:03:51,202 --> 03:03:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  the propulsion systems that allow us to fly far enough away before we destroy ourselves.

03:03:56,322 --> 03:03:58,197
SPEAKER_0:  So maybe that's what happens to the other aliens.

03:03:58,197 --> 03:04:00,606
SPEAKER_1:  Is that your resolution? Because I mean, I think.

03:04:01,410 --> 03:04:04,126
SPEAKER_1:  us in the Techno Signature community and the astronomy community aren't.

03:04:04,450 --> 03:04:05,822
SPEAKER_1:  thinking about this problem seriously enough.

03:04:06,082 --> 03:04:07,198
SPEAKER_1:  in my opinion. We should.

03:04:07,522 --> 03:04:08,510
SPEAKER_1:  we should be thinking about.

03:04:08,802 --> 03:04:09,406
SPEAKER_1:  The...

03:04:09,698 --> 03:04:10,942
SPEAKER_1:  What AI is.

03:04:11,554 --> 03:04:14,494
SPEAKER_1:  doing to our society and the implications of what we're looking for.

03:04:14,850 --> 03:04:16,542
SPEAKER_1:  And so the only, I think.

03:04:16,866 --> 03:04:17,342
SPEAKER_1:

03:04:17,634 --> 03:04:20,414
SPEAKER_1:  thinking has to involve people like yourself who are

03:04:20,674 --> 03:04:23,742
SPEAKER_1:  more intimate with the machine learning and artificial intelligence world.

03:04:24,162 --> 03:04:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  is your how do you reconcile in your mind?

03:04:27,522 --> 03:04:28,766
SPEAKER_1:  You said earlier that you think.

03:04:29,378 --> 03:04:32,638
SPEAKER_1:  You can't imagine a galaxy where life and intelligence is not.

03:04:33,026 --> 03:04:34,078
SPEAKER_1:  all over the place.

03:04:34,946 --> 03:04:38,974
SPEAKER_1:  And if artificial intelligence is a natural progression for civilizations...

03:04:39,458 --> 03:04:41,374
SPEAKER_1:  How do you reconcile that with?

03:04:42,530 --> 03:04:45,086
SPEAKER_1:  with the absence of any information around us or any...

03:04:45,314 --> 03:04:49,534
SPEAKER_1:  clues or hints of artificial behavior, artificial engineered stars.

03:04:49,986 --> 03:04:53,374
SPEAKER_1:  or colonization, computer substrate, transform planets,γ

03:04:54,050 --> 03:04:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  It's extremely difficult for me.

03:04:57,026 --> 03:04:57,598
SPEAKER_0:  It's exciting.

03:04:57,986 --> 03:05:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  The Fermi paradox broadly defined is extremely difficult for me.

03:05:01,922 --> 03:05:03,454
SPEAKER_0:  And the terrifying thing is.

03:05:03,938 --> 03:05:05,214
SPEAKER_0:  One thing I suspect.

03:05:05,954 --> 03:05:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  is that we keep destroying ourselves. The probability of self-destruction with advanced technology is just extremely high.

03:05:12,610 --> 03:05:14,046
SPEAKER_0:  That's why we're not seeing it.

03:05:15,522 --> 03:05:20,606
SPEAKER_0:  but then again my intuition about why we haven't blown ourselves up with nuclear weapons.

03:05:21,954 --> 03:05:24,702
SPEAKER_0:  It's very surprising to me from a scientific perspective.

03:05:25,314 --> 03:05:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  Given all the cruelty I've seen in the world.

03:05:29,218 --> 03:05:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  uh

03:05:30,082 --> 03:05:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  given

03:05:31,138 --> 03:05:31,806
SPEAKER_0:  The

03:05:32,610 --> 03:05:36,254
SPEAKER_0:  power that nuclear weapons place in the hands of a very small number of individuals.

03:05:36,930 --> 03:05:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  It's very surprising to me we went to destroy ourselves.

03:05:39,778 --> 03:05:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  and it seems to be a very low probability situation we have happening here.

03:05:43,874 --> 03:05:44,286
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:05:45,442 --> 03:05:49,214
SPEAKER_0:  But, and then the other explanation is the zoo, here's the observation.

03:05:49,474 --> 03:05:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  that were just being observed.

03:05:51,650 --> 03:05:55,198
SPEAKER_0:  That's the only other thing. It's just, it's so difficult for me.

03:05:57,218 --> 03:06:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  Of course, all of science, everything is very humbling. It would be very humbling for me.

03:06:02,018 --> 03:06:02,750
SPEAKER_0:  to learn.

03:06:03,586 --> 03:06:05,118
SPEAKER_0:  that we're alone in the universe.

03:06:06,050 --> 03:06:06,942
SPEAKER_0:  It would change.

03:06:08,354 --> 03:06:09,150
SPEAKER_0:  You know what?

03:06:10,050 --> 03:06:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  maybe I do want that to be true because you want us to be special. That's why I'm resisting that thought maybe.

03:06:15,618 --> 03:06:17,182
SPEAKER_0:  There's no way we're that special.

03:06:17,762 --> 03:06:21,137
SPEAKER_0:  There's no way we're that special. That's where my resistance comes from.

03:06:21,137 --> 03:06:22,622
SPEAKER_1:  I would just say, you know

03:06:23,810 --> 03:06:25,502
SPEAKER_1:  The specialness is something we...

03:06:25,730 --> 03:06:34,878
SPEAKER_1:  In implicitly in that statement, there's kind of an assumption that we are something positive, like we're a gift to this planet or something, and that makes a special bit.

03:06:35,202 --> 03:06:35,646
SPEAKER_1:  Hey!

03:06:35,970 --> 03:06:42,718
SPEAKER_1:  It may be that intelligence is more of an, it's like we like rats or cockroaches. We're an infestation of this planet. We're not.

03:06:43,010 --> 03:06:43,870
SPEAKER_1:  We're not some...

03:06:44,578 --> 03:06:46,814
SPEAKER_1:  benevolent property that the planet would.

03:06:47,202 --> 03:06:50,494
SPEAKER_1:  a plant would ideally like to have if you can even say such a thing.

03:06:50,786 --> 03:06:51,902
SPEAKER_1:  But we may be.

03:06:52,290 --> 03:06:59,774
SPEAKER_1:  not only a generally a negative force for a planet's biosphere and its own survivability, which I think you can make a strong argument about.

03:07:00,258 --> 03:07:01,534
SPEAKER_1:  but we may also be.

03:07:01,954 --> 03:07:03,390
SPEAKER_1:  very persistent.

03:07:03,714 --> 03:07:08,862
SPEAKER_1:  infestation that may even in, you know, interesting thoughts in the wake of a nuclear war.

03:07:10,498 --> 03:07:13,950
SPEAKER_1:  Would that be an absolute eradication of every human being, which would be?

03:07:14,210 --> 03:07:15,550
SPEAKER_1:  a fairly extreme event.

03:07:15,970 --> 03:07:16,446
SPEAKER_1:  Oh

03:07:16,770 --> 03:07:21,790
SPEAKER_1:  Would the canal of consciousness, as you might call it, the flame of consciousness, continue with some small pockets?

03:07:22,178 --> 03:07:25,502
SPEAKER_1:  that would maybe in 10,000 years, 100,000 years.

03:07:25,922 --> 03:07:29,822
SPEAKER_1:  we see civilization re-emerge and play out the same thing over again.

03:07:30,146 --> 03:07:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, that certainly, but nuclear weapons aren't powerful enough.

03:07:33,954 --> 03:07:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  But yes, the...

03:07:36,706 --> 03:07:40,126
SPEAKER_0:  to sort of push back on the infestation, sure, but the word special.

03:07:40,578 --> 03:07:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  doesn't have to be positive.

03:07:42,594 --> 03:07:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  I just mean...

03:07:44,066 --> 03:07:46,974
SPEAKER_1:  I think it tends to imply, but I take your point. Yeah, but maybe.

03:07:47,394 --> 03:07:47,902
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:07:49,090 --> 03:07:50,965
SPEAKER_1:  Just maybe extremely rare, might be.

03:07:50,965 --> 03:07:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  And that to me, it just...

03:07:52,642 --> 03:07:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  It's very strange.

03:07:55,810 --> 03:07:56,542
SPEAKER_0:  for me.

03:07:57,186 --> 03:07:57,726
SPEAKER_0:  to be.

03:07:58,562 --> 03:07:59,966
SPEAKER_0:  cosmically unique.

03:08:00,642 --> 03:08:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  It's just very strange.

03:08:03,906 --> 03:08:05,150
SPEAKER_0:  I mean that word.

03:08:05,698 --> 03:08:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  The only.

03:08:06,914 --> 03:08:07,326
SPEAKER_0:  thing.

03:08:08,226 --> 03:08:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  of this level of complexity in the galaxy just seems very strange to me.

03:08:13,122 --> 03:08:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  That was...

03:08:13,634 --> 03:08:14,878
SPEAKER_1:  I would just, yeah.

03:08:15,138 --> 03:08:22,558
SPEAKER_1:  As I do think it depends on this classification, I think there is sort of, again, it's kind of buried within there as a subtext, but there is a

03:08:23,106 --> 03:08:25,630
SPEAKER_1:  A classification that we're doing here that.

03:08:26,178 --> 03:08:32,414
SPEAKER_1:  what we are is a distinct category of life, let's say in this case, when we're talking about intelligence we are something.

03:08:32,642 --> 03:08:33,854
SPEAKER_1:  that can be separated.

03:08:34,370 --> 03:08:38,686
SPEAKER_1:  But of course we see intelligence across the animal kingdom in, you know,

03:08:38,914 --> 03:08:40,510
SPEAKER_1:  Dolphins, Humback whales.

03:08:40,962 --> 03:08:41,406
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:08:41,634 --> 03:08:44,286
SPEAKER_1:  octopuses, crows, ravens, and so it's-

03:08:45,218 --> 03:08:46,174
SPEAKER_1:  possible that

03:08:46,690 --> 03:08:47,166
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:08:48,962 --> 03:08:52,702
SPEAKER_1:  These are all manifestations of the same thing. And we are not.

03:08:53,538 --> 03:08:54,750
SPEAKER_1:  We are not a particularly.

03:08:55,298 --> 03:08:59,134
SPEAKER_1:  distinct class except for the fact we make technology that's really the only difference to our intelligence.

03:08:59,586 --> 03:09:02,174
SPEAKER_1:  and we classify that separately.

03:09:02,850 --> 03:09:08,030
SPEAKER_1:  But from a biological perspective, to some degree, it's really just all part of a continuum. And so that's why I...

03:09:08,834 --> 03:09:11,326
SPEAKER_1:  When we talk about unique, you are.

03:09:12,034 --> 03:09:16,478
SPEAKER_1:  putting yourself in a box which is distinct and saying this is the only example of things that fall into this box.

03:09:16,898 --> 03:09:20,222
SPEAKER_1:  But the walls of that box may themselves be.

03:09:20,578 --> 03:09:22,238
SPEAKER_1:  a construct of our own.

03:09:22,530 --> 03:09:25,534
SPEAKER_1:  arrogance that we are something distinct.

03:09:25,794 --> 03:09:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:09:26,722 --> 03:09:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  uh... but i was also speaking broadly

03:09:28,898 --> 03:09:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  Us, meaning all life on earth.

03:09:32,738 --> 03:09:35,838
SPEAKER_0:  that, but then it's possible that there's all kinds of

03:09:37,058 --> 03:09:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  Living.

03:09:38,498 --> 03:09:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  ecosystems and another planets and other moons.

03:09:42,338 --> 03:09:42,814
SPEAKER_0:  It's just.

03:09:43,138 --> 03:09:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  don't have interest in technological development.

03:09:45,666 --> 03:09:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  And maybe, maybe technological development is the.

03:09:50,178 --> 03:09:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  the parasitic thing, it destroys the organism broadly.

03:09:53,602 --> 03:09:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  And then.

03:09:55,458 --> 03:09:57,726
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe that's actually one of the fundamentals.

03:09:58,306 --> 03:10:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  realities, whatever broad way to categorize technological development, that's just the parasitic thing.

03:10:04,066 --> 03:10:06,471
SPEAKER_0:  that just destroys itself. Yeah.

03:10:06,471 --> 03:10:11,966
SPEAKER_1:  We're flirting around this idea of the great filter a little bit here.

03:10:12,226 --> 03:10:14,366
SPEAKER_1:  asking where is this, does it lie ahead of us?

03:10:14,818 --> 03:10:17,950
SPEAKER_1:  nuclear war, maybe imminent, that would be a filter that's ahead of us.

03:10:18,210 --> 03:10:22,718
SPEAKER_1:  Or could it be behind us and that it's the advent of technology that is genuinely

03:10:22,946 --> 03:10:25,246
SPEAKER_1:  a rare occurrence in the universe and that explains.

03:10:25,570 --> 03:10:27,006
SPEAKER_1:  the Fermi paradox.

03:10:28,034 --> 03:10:29,950
SPEAKER_1:  And so that's, that's something that.

03:10:30,178 --> 03:10:30,782
SPEAKER_1:  Obviously people are.

03:10:31,010 --> 03:10:35,422
SPEAKER_1:  debated and argued about in SETI for decades and decades.

03:10:35,810 --> 03:10:37,246
SPEAKER_1:  It remains a...

03:10:37,634 --> 03:10:38,590
SPEAKER_1:  a persistent.

03:10:39,330 --> 03:10:42,558
SPEAKER_1:  People argue whether should be really quite a paradox or not, but it remains a consistent.

03:10:42,786 --> 03:10:44,062
SPEAKER_1:  Apparent contradiction.

03:10:45,666 --> 03:10:51,166
SPEAKER_1:  you can make a very cogent argument as to why you expect life and intelligence to be common in the universe and yet

03:10:51,906 --> 03:10:52,670
SPEAKER_1:  Everything.

03:10:53,058 --> 03:10:56,222
SPEAKER_1:  Everything we know about the universe is fully compatible.

03:10:56,546 --> 03:10:56,990
SPEAKER_1:  with.

03:10:57,282 --> 03:10:59,390
SPEAKER_1:  just us being here. & that's

03:11:00,130 --> 03:11:00,862
SPEAKER_1:  A haunting.

03:11:01,122 --> 03:11:01,438
SPEAKER_1: そう

03:11:01,762 --> 03:11:02,174
SPEAKER_1:  but

03:11:03,042 --> 03:11:03,486
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:11:03,906 --> 03:11:04,222
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not.

03:11:04,514 --> 03:11:05,022
SPEAKER_1:  I have no-

03:11:05,346 --> 03:11:08,670
SPEAKER_1:  preference or desire for that to be true. I'm not trying to

03:11:08,994 --> 03:11:10,590
SPEAKER_1:  impose that view on anyone.

03:11:11,074 --> 03:11:11,518
SPEAKER_1:  but I...

03:11:11,746 --> 03:11:16,094
SPEAKER_1:  Do ask that we remain open-minded until evidence has been collected either way.

03:11:16,386 --> 03:11:17,598
SPEAKER_1:  The thing is...

03:11:18,178 --> 03:11:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  It's...

03:11:19,490 --> 03:11:25,950
SPEAKER_0:  One of, if not the, probably I would argue is the most important question facing human civilization or the most interesting.

03:11:26,562 --> 03:11:27,582
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

03:11:28,354 --> 03:11:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  Scientifically speaking, like what question is more important?

03:11:32,226 --> 03:11:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  then um

03:11:33,922 --> 03:11:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  somehow....

03:11:36,194 --> 03:11:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the, there could be other ways to sneak.

03:11:38,562 --> 03:11:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  up to it but it gets to the essence of

03:11:42,370 --> 03:11:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  what we are.

03:11:43,906 --> 03:11:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  what these living organisms are.

03:11:45,858 --> 03:11:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  is somehow.

03:11:46,946 --> 03:11:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  seeing another kind.

03:11:49,026 --> 03:11:52,702
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. Helps us understand. It speaks to the human condition, helps us understand.

03:11:53,058 --> 03:11:55,006
SPEAKER_1:  what it is to be human to some degree.

03:11:55,746 --> 03:11:56,254
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:11:57,250 --> 03:11:57,918
SPEAKER_1:  I think, you know.

03:11:58,466 --> 03:12:06,046
SPEAKER_1:  I have tried to remain very agnostic about the idea of life and intelligence. One thing I try to be more optimistic about.

03:12:06,530 --> 03:12:07,198
SPEAKER_1:  and I've been.

03:12:07,746 --> 03:12:11,614
SPEAKER_1:  thinking a lot with our searches for life in the universe is life in the past.

03:12:12,770 --> 03:12:13,214
SPEAKER_1:  You can-

03:12:13,442 --> 03:12:18,462
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's actually not that hard to imagine we are the only civilization in the galaxy right now, living.

03:12:18,722 --> 03:12:20,478
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, this this kernel extent.

03:12:20,930 --> 03:12:21,694
SPEAKER_1:  But there may be v-

03:12:21,922 --> 03:12:28,990
SPEAKER_1:  very many extinct civilizations. If each civilization has a typical lifetime comparable to, let's say AI is the demise of our own.

03:12:29,282 --> 03:12:34,974
SPEAKER_1:  That's only a few hundred years of technological development or maybe 10,000 years if you go back in the electric revolution.

03:12:35,586 --> 03:12:36,830
SPEAKER_1:  the dawn of agriculture.

03:12:37,218 --> 03:12:39,294
SPEAKER_1:  You know, hardly anything can cosmic time span.

03:12:39,714 --> 03:12:40,190
SPEAKER_1:  Um

03:12:40,674 --> 03:12:42,270
SPEAKER_1:  That's nothing, that's the blink of an eye.

03:12:42,658 --> 03:12:47,422
SPEAKER_1:  And so it's not surprising at all that we would happen not to co-exist with anyone else.

03:12:48,130 --> 03:12:50,398
SPEAKER_1:  That doesn't mean nobody else was ever here.

03:12:51,202 --> 03:12:59,966
SPEAKER_1:  And if other civilizations come to that same conclusion and realization, maybe their scour the galaxy around them don't find any evidence for intelligence.

03:13:00,642 --> 03:13:01,054
SPEAKER_1:  Then

03:13:01,378 --> 03:13:03,902
SPEAKER_1:  They have two options, they can either give up on communication.

03:13:04,258 --> 03:13:05,854
SPEAKER_1:  and just say, well, it's never going to happen.

03:13:06,242 --> 03:13:10,398
SPEAKER_1:  We just may as well just worry about what's happening here on our own planet.

03:13:10,978 --> 03:13:14,110
SPEAKER_1:  Or they could attempt communication, but communication through time.

03:13:15,074 --> 03:13:16,798
SPEAKER_1:  And that's, that's almost, um.

03:13:17,154 --> 03:13:17,886
SPEAKER_1:  the most.

03:13:18,146 --> 03:13:19,326
SPEAKER_1:  selfless act.

03:13:19,554 --> 03:13:21,694
SPEAKER_1:  of communication because there's no hope of

03:13:22,018 --> 03:13:23,262
SPEAKER_1:  with getting anything back.

03:13:23,842 --> 03:13:24,638
SPEAKER_1:  It's um...

03:13:24,866 --> 03:13:28,414
SPEAKER_1:  a philanthropic gift almost to that other civilization that you can.

03:13:28,738 --> 03:13:29,182
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe.

03:13:29,442 --> 03:13:35,262
SPEAKER_1:  maybe might just be nothing more than a monument, which the pyramids essentially are, a monument of their existence that these are.

03:13:35,586 --> 03:13:38,942
SPEAKER_1:  the things they achieved, the things they believed in.

03:13:39,554 --> 03:13:41,246
SPEAKER_1:  their language, their culture.

03:13:41,730 --> 03:13:42,814
SPEAKER_1:  or, um...

03:13:43,074 --> 03:13:48,382
SPEAKER_1:  It could be maybe something more than that. It could be sort of lessons from what they learned and their own history. And so.

03:13:49,218 --> 03:13:50,302
SPEAKER_1:  I've been thinking a lot.

03:13:50,594 --> 03:13:51,518
SPEAKER_1:  recently about.

03:13:52,770 --> 03:13:55,102
SPEAKER_1:  How would we send a message?

03:13:55,714 --> 03:13:58,206
SPEAKER_1:  to other civilizations in the future.

03:13:59,042 --> 03:13:59,678
SPEAKER_1:  Because that

03:13:59,938 --> 03:14:00,510
SPEAKER_1:  active

03:14:00,738 --> 03:14:03,518
SPEAKER_1:  thinking seriously about the engineering of how you're designed at

03:14:04,162 --> 03:14:07,454
SPEAKER_1:  would inform us about what we should be looking for.

03:14:08,322 --> 03:14:09,758
SPEAKER_1:  and also perhaps be...

03:14:09,986 --> 03:14:11,678
SPEAKER_1:  Our best chance, quite frankly.

03:14:12,098 --> 03:14:13,278
SPEAKER_1:  I've ever making contact.

03:14:13,506 --> 03:14:15,262
SPEAKER_1:  They might not be the contact we dream of.

03:14:16,162 --> 03:14:24,350
SPEAKER_1:  but it's still contact, there would still be a record of our existence as pitiful as it might be compared to a two-way communication.

03:14:25,218 --> 03:14:26,343
SPEAKER_1:  And I love the humility.

03:14:26,343 --> 03:14:27,070
SPEAKER_0:  behind.

03:14:27,618 --> 03:14:29,182
SPEAKER_0:  project, the Universal Project.

03:14:29,986 --> 03:14:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. It's a sort of.

03:14:32,002 --> 03:14:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  It's humble in the f-

03:14:34,658 --> 03:14:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  it humbles you to the...

03:14:37,570 --> 03:14:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  fast.

03:14:39,490 --> 03:14:40,126
SPEAKER_0:  temporal.

03:14:40,930 --> 03:14:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  Landscape of the Universe.

03:14:42,626 --> 03:14:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  just realizing our like...

03:14:44,162 --> 03:14:48,958
SPEAKER_0:  Day to day lives, they, all of us will be forgotten. It's nice to think about something.

03:14:49,538 --> 03:14:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  that sends a signal out to other.

03:14:51,682 --> 03:14:52,158
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:14:53,282 --> 03:14:56,574
SPEAKER_1:  It was almost like a humility of acceptance as well.

03:14:57,122 --> 03:14:59,838
SPEAKER_1:  of like knowing that you have a terminal disease.

03:15:00,322 --> 03:15:00,862
SPEAKER_1:  But

03:15:01,186 --> 03:15:11,518
SPEAKER_1:  your impact on the earth doesn't have to end with your death, that it could go on beyond with what you leave behind for others to discover with maybe the books you write or what you leave.

03:15:11,906 --> 03:15:12,734
SPEAKER_1:  in the literature.

03:15:12,930 --> 03:15:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  Do you think launching the Roadster vehicle?

03:15:16,578 --> 03:15:17,703
SPEAKER_0:  out in space with a dog.

03:15:17,703 --> 03:15:19,614
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, the roadster.

03:15:20,130 --> 03:15:24,510
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not sure what someone would make of that if they found out. Yeah, that's true.

03:15:24,802 --> 03:15:31,326
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, there have been quasi attempts at it beyond the roadster. I mean, there's like plaques on, there's the pioneer plaques.

03:15:31,714 --> 03:15:33,822
SPEAKER_1:  This is the Voyager 2 golden record.

03:15:34,274 --> 03:15:34,718
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:15:35,042 --> 03:15:37,950
SPEAKER_1:  It's pretty unlikely anybody's going to discover those.

03:15:38,370 --> 03:15:47,166
SPEAKER_1:  because they're just adrift in space and they will eventually mechanically die and not produce any signal for anyone to spot so you'd have to be extremely lucky to come across them.

03:15:47,842 --> 03:15:50,878
SPEAKER_1:  I've often said to my colleagues that I think the best place is the moon.

03:15:51,778 --> 03:15:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  The Moon.

03:15:52,770 --> 03:15:55,230
SPEAKER_1:  unlike the earth has no significant weathering.

03:15:55,714 --> 03:15:56,574
SPEAKER_1:  the, you know, the

03:15:57,122 --> 03:16:02,366
SPEAKER_1:  How long will the Apollo descent stages, which is still sun on the lunar surface, last for?

03:16:03,170 --> 03:16:07,230
SPEAKER_1:  The only real effect is micrometrize, which are slowly...

03:16:07,618 --> 03:16:08,414
SPEAKER_1:  Like dust.

03:16:08,642 --> 03:16:10,110
SPEAKER_1:  smashing against them pretty much.

03:16:10,690 --> 03:16:14,526
SPEAKER_1:  But that's going to take millions, potentially billions of years to erode that.

03:16:14,946 --> 03:16:15,326
SPEAKER_1:  down.

03:16:16,002 --> 03:16:18,302
SPEAKER_1:  And so we have an opportunity, and that's on the surface.

03:16:18,594 --> 03:16:22,622
SPEAKER_1:  If you put something just a few metres beneath the surface, it would have even greater protection.

03:16:23,202 --> 03:16:25,854
SPEAKER_1:  And so it raises the prospect of that if we wanted to.

03:16:27,202 --> 03:16:29,662
SPEAKER_1:  send something a significant amount of information.

03:16:30,050 --> 03:16:34,494
SPEAKER_1:  to a future galactic spanning civilization that maybe cracks the interstellar proportion problem.

03:16:35,266 --> 03:16:37,886
SPEAKER_1:  The moon's gonna be there for five billion years.

03:16:38,434 --> 03:16:41,598
SPEAKER_1:  That's a long time for somebody to come by.

03:16:42,082 --> 03:16:45,342
SPEAKER_1:  and detect maybe a strange pattern that we draw on the sand.

03:16:45,922 --> 03:16:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  for them to, you know, big arrow, big cross, like look into here.

03:16:50,146 --> 03:16:53,502
SPEAKER_1:  and we could have a tomb of knowledge of some record of our civilization.

03:16:54,146 --> 03:16:55,294
SPEAKER_1:  And so I think it's.

03:16:55,842 --> 03:16:56,254
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

03:16:56,610 --> 03:16:59,390
SPEAKER_1:  When you think like that, what that implies to us, well...

03:16:59,842 --> 03:17:05,598
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, the galaxy is 13 billion years old, the moon is already 4 billion years old. There may be places.

03:17:06,274 --> 03:17:08,702
SPEAKER_1:  familiar to us, nearby to us, that we should be.

03:17:09,058 --> 03:17:10,302
SPEAKER_1:  Seriously considering.

03:17:10,978 --> 03:17:11,582
SPEAKER_1:  as

03:17:12,066 --> 03:17:17,054
SPEAKER_1:  places we should look for life and intelligent life or evidence of relics that they might leave behind for us.

03:17:17,282 --> 03:17:20,510
SPEAKER_0:  So that thinking like that will help us find such relics.

03:17:20,738 --> 03:17:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  And it's like a...

03:17:22,562 --> 03:17:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  uh

03:17:23,746 --> 03:17:31,070
SPEAKER_0:  like a beneficial cycle that happens. Yes. Yeah, exactly. That enables the science of, of CID better, like of, of searching for bios.

03:17:31,554 --> 03:17:32,702
SPEAKER_0:  tech signatures and so on.

03:17:33,154 --> 03:17:34,398
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. And it's inspiring.

03:17:34,690 --> 03:17:35,998
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's...

03:17:37,602 --> 03:17:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  It's also inspiring in that we want to leave.

03:17:40,834 --> 03:17:41,918
SPEAKER_0:  A legacy behind.

03:17:42,690 --> 03:17:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  as an entire civilization.

03:17:44,386 --> 03:17:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  Not just in the cymbals, but...

03:17:45,890 --> 03:17:46,814
SPEAKER_0:  Broadly speaking.

03:17:47,234 --> 03:17:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. That's the last thing somehow.

03:17:49,122 --> 03:17:51,742
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. And I'm part of a team that's trying to.

03:17:52,322 --> 03:17:53,182
SPEAKER_1:  Reeve.

03:17:53,602 --> 03:17:55,358
SPEAKER_1:  repeat the golden record experiment.

03:17:56,002 --> 03:18:01,694
SPEAKER_1:  We're trying to create like an open source version of the golden record that future spacecraft are able to download.

03:18:02,082 --> 03:18:04,670
SPEAKER_1:  basically put a little hard drive that they can carry around with them and

03:18:04,898 --> 03:18:08,574
SPEAKER_1:  you know, get these distributed hopefully across the solar system eventually.

03:18:09,026 --> 03:18:10,151
SPEAKER_1:  That's going to be called...

03:18:10,151 --> 03:18:11,651
SPEAKER_0:  The H-Trackers go to the galaxy.

03:18:11,651 --> 03:18:13,790
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it could be. That's a good name for it.

03:18:14,338 --> 03:18:19,678
SPEAKER_1:  We've been toying a little bit with them, but I think probably just be golden record at this point or something, but um,

03:18:20,034 --> 03:18:20,446
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:18:20,770 --> 03:18:21,630
SPEAKER_1:  I think, uh...

03:18:21,986 --> 03:18:22,494
SPEAKER_1:  I think I-

03:18:22,722 --> 03:18:23,230
SPEAKER_1:  Another-

03:18:23,554 --> 03:18:25,630
SPEAKER_1:  benefit that I see of this activity.

03:18:26,338 --> 03:18:29,182
SPEAKER_1:  is that it forces us as a species.

03:18:29,858 --> 03:18:33,182
SPEAKER_1:  to ask those questions about what it is that we want.

03:18:33,442 --> 03:18:35,134
SPEAKER_1:  another civilization to know about us.

03:18:35,682 --> 03:18:37,470
SPEAKER_1:  The Gone Recorder was kind of funny because...

03:18:37,922 --> 03:18:41,694
SPEAKER_1:  It had photos on it, and it had photos of people eating, for instance.

03:18:42,114 --> 03:18:44,862
SPEAKER_1:  but had no photos of people defecating.

03:18:45,666 --> 03:18:48,094
SPEAKER_1:  And so I always thought that was kind of funny.

03:18:48,610 --> 03:18:49,406
SPEAKER_1:  Fire's an alien.

03:18:50,274 --> 03:18:52,574
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, if I was studying in alien, if I saw...

03:18:53,026 --> 03:18:54,174
SPEAKER_1:  Images, I wouldn't...

03:18:54,562 --> 03:18:59,038
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not trying to be like a pervert or anything, but I would want to see the full, I want to understand the biology of that alien.

03:18:59,554 --> 03:19:00,222
SPEAKER_1:  And so...

03:19:00,642 --> 03:19:01,054
SPEAKER_1:  We-

03:19:01,282 --> 03:19:03,966
SPEAKER_1:  We always censor what we show.

03:19:04,482 --> 03:19:07,107
SPEAKER_1:  Um, and we should show the whole act.

03:19:07,107 --> 03:19:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  natural process and then also say we humans tend to censor these things.

03:19:12,130 --> 03:19:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  We tend to not like to walk around naked. We tend to not to talk about.

03:19:15,874 --> 03:19:20,542
SPEAKER_0:  uh, some of the natural biological phenomena and talk a lot about others.

03:19:20,770 --> 03:19:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. And actually just be very.

03:19:23,554 --> 03:19:26,929
SPEAKER_0:  like the way you would be to a therapist or something, very transparent about the way...

03:19:26,929 --> 03:19:32,382
SPEAKER_1:  we actually operate. Yeah. I mean, and Sagan had that with the Gordon record. I think he, he originally.

03:19:32,674 --> 03:19:36,094
SPEAKER_1:  There's a male and a female figure to pitch on the golden record.

03:19:36,770 --> 03:19:41,310
SPEAKER_1:  And the, the woman had a genitalia originally drawn and

03:19:41,570 --> 03:19:48,318
SPEAKER_1:  There was a lot of pushback from, I think, a lot of Christian groups who were not happy about the idea of throwing this into space.

03:19:48,802 --> 03:19:51,198
SPEAKER_1:  And so eventually they had to remove that.

03:19:51,586 --> 03:19:52,318
SPEAKER_1:  And so...

03:19:52,610 --> 03:19:54,686
SPEAKER_1:  It would be confusing biologically.

03:19:55,074 --> 03:20:03,390
SPEAKER_1:  you're trying to study xenobiology of this alien that apparently has no genitalia or the mandus, but for some reason the woman doesn't.

03:20:03,778 --> 03:20:04,638
SPEAKER_1:  You know, and that's how...

03:20:04,930 --> 03:20:07,614
SPEAKER_1:  That's our own societal and cultural.

03:20:08,002 --> 03:20:10,910
SPEAKER_1:  imprint happening into that information.

03:20:11,234 --> 03:20:12,414
SPEAKER_1:  That's to be fair.

03:20:13,538 --> 03:20:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  just even having...

03:20:15,586 --> 03:20:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  sexes.

03:20:16,994 --> 03:20:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  and predators and prey, just a whole, that could be just a very unique Earth-like thing, so that might be confused about.

03:20:22,370 --> 03:20:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  Why there's like pairs of things? Like why are you like, why, why is there.

03:20:27,394 --> 03:20:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  a man and a woman in general, like they.

03:20:30,178 --> 03:20:34,645
SPEAKER_0:  They could be, I mean, they could be confused about a lot of things in general. I don't think that.

03:20:34,645 --> 03:20:37,645
SPEAKER_1:  I don't even know which way to hold the picture.

03:20:37,645 --> 03:20:42,895
SPEAKER_0:  Or there's a picture, they might have very different sensory devices.

03:20:42,895 --> 03:20:47,646
SPEAKER_1:  interpret this as a......sounds as their only way of navigating the world.

03:20:47,906 --> 03:20:48,542
SPEAKER_1:  It's curve.

03:20:48,770 --> 03:20:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  lost to send any kind of, you know, there's been a lot of conversation about sending video.

03:20:52,674 --> 03:20:56,190
SPEAKER_1:  and audio and video and pictures and I've

03:20:56,418 --> 03:20:57,598
SPEAKER_1:  That's one of the things I've been.

03:20:57,954 --> 03:21:00,062
SPEAKER_1:  a little bit resistant about in the team that I've.

03:21:00,290 --> 03:21:01,150
SPEAKER_1:  than thinking, well...

03:21:02,274 --> 03:21:03,742
SPEAKER_1:  they might not have eyes and so...

03:21:03,970 --> 03:21:06,622
SPEAKER_1:  if you lived in the Europa surface.

03:21:07,042 --> 03:21:08,798
SPEAKER_1:  having eyes wouldn't be very useful.

03:21:09,282 --> 03:21:21,310
SPEAKER_1:  If you lived on a very dark planet on the tightly locked night side of an exoplanet, having eyes wouldn't be particularly useful. So it's kind of a presumption of us to think that video is a useful form of communication.

03:21:22,210 --> 03:21:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  Do you hope we become a multi-planetary species? So we almost sneaking up to that, but, um.

03:21:27,778 --> 03:21:29,886
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the efforts of SpaceX, of Elon.

03:21:30,210 --> 03:21:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe in general what your thoughts are about those efforts.

03:21:33,346 --> 03:21:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  You already mentioned Starship will be very interesting for astronomy, for science in general.

03:21:38,338 --> 03:21:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  She's getting stuff out into space.

03:21:40,930 --> 03:21:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  But what about the longer term goal of actually colonizing?

03:21:44,706 --> 03:21:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  of building civilizations on other surfaces, on moons, on...

03:21:48,226 --> 03:21:48,798
SPEAKER_1:  planets.

03:21:49,090 --> 03:21:49,982
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like an...

03:21:50,306 --> 03:21:53,182
SPEAKER_1:  A fairly obvious thing to do for our survival, right? This...

03:21:53,506 --> 03:21:54,622
SPEAKER_1:  a high risk.

03:21:55,170 --> 03:21:55,838
SPEAKER_1:  If we are.

03:21:57,346 --> 03:22:00,350
SPEAKER_1:  committed to trying to keep this human experiment going.

03:22:00,898 --> 03:22:01,374
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:22:01,634 --> 03:22:03,582
SPEAKER_1:  putting all of our eggs in one basket is.

03:22:03,938 --> 03:22:14,750
SPEAKER_1:  always going to be a risky strategy to pursue. It's a nice basket though. But yeah, it is a beautiful basket. I wouldn't want to, I personally have no interest in living on Mars or the moon. I would like to visit.

03:22:15,106 --> 03:22:19,774
SPEAKER_1:  but I would definitely not want to spend the rest of my life and die on Mars. It's a-

03:22:20,290 --> 03:22:25,310
SPEAKER_1:  It means a hell hole. Mars is a very, very diff... I think the idea that this is going to happen...

03:22:25,762 --> 03:22:28,030
SPEAKER_1:  in the next 10, 20 years is.

03:22:28,290 --> 03:22:29,790
SPEAKER_1:  seems to be very optimistic.

03:22:30,370 --> 03:22:33,470
SPEAKER_1:  Um, not that it's insurmountable, but.

03:22:34,050 --> 03:22:34,622
SPEAKER_1:  The.

03:22:34,946 --> 03:22:40,798
SPEAKER_1:  The challenges are extreme to survive on a planet like Mars, which is like a dry frozen desert.

03:22:41,282 --> 03:22:41,790
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:22:42,370 --> 03:22:44,414
SPEAKER_1:  with a high radiation environment. it's

03:22:44,706 --> 03:22:51,134
SPEAKER_1:  It's a challenge of a type we've never faced before. So it's, I'm sure human ingenuity can tackle it, but.

03:22:51,778 --> 03:22:55,614
SPEAKER_1:  I'm skeptical that we will have thousands of people living on Mars in my life.

03:22:56,226 --> 03:22:57,278
SPEAKER_1:  But I would...

03:22:58,114 --> 03:22:59,198
SPEAKER_1:  VELISH DA-

03:22:59,458 --> 03:23:01,502
SPEAKER_1:  opportunity to maybe one day.

03:23:01,858 --> 03:23:05,246
SPEAKER_1:  visit such a settlement and you know...

03:23:05,634 --> 03:23:11,678
SPEAKER_1:  do scientific experiments on Mars or experience Mars, do astronomy from Mars, and all sorts of cool stuff you could do.

03:23:12,002 --> 03:23:12,446
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:23:12,706 --> 03:23:16,734
SPEAKER_1:  Sometimes you see these dreams of outer solar system exploration and you can like...

03:23:17,282 --> 03:23:19,806
SPEAKER_1:  fly through the clouds of Venus, or you could...

03:23:20,162 --> 03:23:26,718
SPEAKER_1:  just do these enormous jumps on these small moons where you can essentially jump as high as a skyscraper.

03:23:27,138 --> 03:23:31,198
SPEAKER_1:  traverse them. So there's all sorts of you know wonderful ice skating on your rope it might be fun.

03:23:31,586 --> 03:23:31,902
SPEAKER_1:  So.

03:23:32,130 --> 03:23:34,590
SPEAKER_1:  Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of us becoming a planet tree.

03:23:34,946 --> 03:23:36,254
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's...

03:23:37,186 --> 03:23:38,654
SPEAKER_1:  It's just a question of.

03:23:39,330 --> 03:23:40,478
SPEAKER_1:  time around.

03:23:40,738 --> 03:23:42,558
SPEAKER_1:  her own destructive tendencies.

03:23:43,202 --> 03:23:43,646
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

03:23:44,258 --> 03:23:46,270
SPEAKER_1:  As you said earlier, add odds.

03:23:46,626 --> 03:23:47,262
SPEAKER_1:  with a...

03:23:47,810 --> 03:23:49,054
SPEAKER_1:  emerging capabilities.

03:23:49,538 --> 03:23:50,686
SPEAKER_1:  to become interpenetrate.

03:23:51,234 --> 03:23:54,430
SPEAKER_1:  And the question is, will we get out of the nest before we burn it down?

03:23:55,426 --> 03:23:57,566
SPEAKER_1:  And I don't know. Obviously, I hope.

03:23:57,954 --> 03:23:58,526
SPEAKER_1:  that we do.

03:23:59,746 --> 03:24:01,598
SPEAKER_1:  I don't have any special insight that...

03:24:02,626 --> 03:24:04,862
SPEAKER_1:  There is a problem, there is somewhat of a...

03:24:06,210 --> 03:24:10,590
SPEAKER_1:  a gnawing intellectual itch I have with the so-called doomsday argument, which

03:24:11,074 --> 03:24:13,086
SPEAKER_1:  Um, I try not to treat.

03:24:13,314 --> 03:24:15,998
SPEAKER_1:  too seriously, but there is some element of it that bothers me.

03:24:16,514 --> 03:24:17,502
SPEAKER_1:  The Doom segment.

03:24:17,762 --> 03:24:18,558
SPEAKER_1:  Basically...

03:24:18,850 --> 03:24:19,870
SPEAKER_1:  suggests that.

03:24:20,866 --> 03:24:23,582
SPEAKER_1:  You know, you're typically the mediocrity principle, you're not special.

03:24:24,066 --> 03:24:27,678
SPEAKER_1:  that you're probably going to be born somewhere in the middle of all human beings who will ever be born.

03:24:28,066 --> 03:24:28,990
SPEAKER_1:  You're unlikely to be

03:24:29,218 --> 03:24:35,614
SPEAKER_1:  one of the first 1% of human beings that ever lived and similarly the last 1% of human beings to a level F

03:24:36,034 --> 03:24:38,366
SPEAKER_1:  because it'd be very unique and special if that were true.

03:24:39,042 --> 03:24:40,286
SPEAKER_1:  And so by this logic.

03:24:40,578 --> 03:24:44,990
SPEAKER_1:  you can sort of calculate how many generations of humans you might expect. is something that the water, sowie and the biological

03:24:45,442 --> 03:24:48,478
SPEAKER_1:  let's say 100 billion human beings that have ever lived on this planet.

03:24:49,122 --> 03:24:53,662
SPEAKER_1:  then you could say to 95% confidence, so you divide by 5%.

03:24:54,114 --> 03:24:58,782
SPEAKER_1:  So 100 billion divided by 0.05 would give you 2 trillion human beings that would ever live.

03:24:59,586 --> 03:25:01,022
SPEAKER_1:  you'd expect by this argument.

03:25:01,474 --> 03:25:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  And so if each.

03:25:03,810 --> 03:25:04,926
SPEAKER_1:  If let's say each.

03:25:05,506 --> 03:25:09,086
SPEAKER_1:  Each planet in general, the planet has a 10 billion population.

03:25:09,698 --> 03:25:10,558
SPEAKER_1:  So that would be.

03:25:10,818 --> 03:25:14,686
SPEAKER_1:  200 generations of humans we would expect ahead of us?

03:25:15,170 --> 03:25:17,982
SPEAKER_1:  And if each one has an average lifetime of say 100 years.

03:25:18,274 --> 03:25:23,966
SPEAKER_1:  then that would be about 20,000 years. So there's 20,000 years left in the clock. That's like a typical doomsday argument type.

03:25:24,290 --> 03:25:24,638
SPEAKER_1:  Hell.

03:25:25,410 --> 03:25:27,070
SPEAKER_1:  That's how they typically lay it out.

03:25:27,906 --> 03:25:35,422
SPEAKER_1:  Um, now you can argue that a lot of the criticisms that do so argument come down to what are you really counting? You're counting humans there.

03:25:35,778 --> 03:25:37,246
SPEAKER_1:  But maybe you should be counting years.

03:25:37,698 --> 03:25:40,798
SPEAKER_1:  Or maybe you should be counting human hours. You know, what are you?

03:25:41,090 --> 03:25:45,246
SPEAKER_1:  Because what you count makes a big difference to what you get out on the other end. This is called the reference class.

03:25:45,794 --> 03:25:48,478
SPEAKER_1:  And so that's one of the big criticisms that do say like.

03:25:49,698 --> 03:25:52,766
SPEAKER_1:  I do think it has a compelling point that it would be surprising.

03:25:53,314 --> 03:25:55,326
SPEAKER_1:  If our future is to one day.

03:25:55,650 --> 03:25:58,718
SPEAKER_1:  blossom and become a galactic spanning empire.

03:25:59,362 --> 03:26:05,182
SPEAKER_1:  trillions upon trillions upon trillions of human beings will one day live across the stars for essentially

03:26:05,442 --> 03:26:08,286
SPEAKER_1:  as long as the galaxy exists and the stars burn.

03:26:09,410 --> 03:26:12,766
SPEAKER_1:  We would live at an incredibly special point in that story.

03:26:13,218 --> 03:26:16,606
SPEAKER_1:  we would be right at the very, very, very beginning.

03:26:17,090 --> 03:26:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  And that's not.

03:26:18,050 --> 03:26:20,510
SPEAKER_1:  impossible, but it's just somewhat improbable.

03:26:21,026 --> 03:26:24,542
SPEAKER_1:  And so there's part of that sort of irks against me.

03:26:24,930 --> 03:26:28,830
SPEAKER_1:  but it also almost feels like a philosophical argument because you're sort of talking about...

03:26:29,442 --> 03:26:32,510
SPEAKER_1:  soul was being drawn from this cosmic pool.

03:26:32,962 --> 03:26:33,406
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:26:33,890 --> 03:26:39,934
SPEAKER_1:  So it's not an argument that I lose sleep about for our fate of the doomsday, but it is.

03:26:41,570 --> 03:26:42,110
SPEAKER_1:  somewhat.

03:26:42,882 --> 03:26:44,606
SPEAKER_1:  intellectually annoying that

03:26:45,282 --> 03:26:50,142
SPEAKER_1:  that there is a slight contradiction now, it feels like with the idea of a galactic spanning empire.

03:26:51,618 --> 03:26:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  But of course there's so many unknowns.

03:26:55,778 --> 03:26:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  I for one would-

03:26:57,122 --> 03:26:59,358
SPEAKER_0:  Love to visit even space but

03:26:59,650 --> 03:27:02,206
SPEAKER_0:  Mars just imagine standing on Mars and looking.

03:27:02,690 --> 03:27:03,454
SPEAKER_0:  back at Earth.

03:27:05,314 --> 03:27:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. So so could one my

03:27:07,394 --> 03:27:07,838
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:27:08,258 --> 03:27:09,054
SPEAKER_1:  incredible site.

03:27:09,890 --> 03:27:10,846
SPEAKER_1:  I'll give you such a...

03:27:11,650 --> 03:27:14,814
SPEAKER_1:  fresh perspective as to your entire existence and what it meant to be human.

03:27:15,266 --> 03:27:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  and then come back to earth and it would give you.

03:27:18,850 --> 03:27:23,006
SPEAKER_0:  give you a heck of a perspective. Plus the sunset on Mars is supposed to be nice.

03:27:23,234 --> 03:27:26,142
SPEAKER_1:  I loved what William Shatner said after his flight.

03:27:26,402 --> 03:27:30,750
SPEAKER_1:  His words really moved me when he came down. And I think-

03:27:31,938 --> 03:27:39,166
SPEAKER_1:  It really captured the idea that we shouldn't really be sending engineers, our scientists into space. We should be sending out poets.

03:27:39,714 --> 03:27:42,622
SPEAKER_1:  because those are the people when they come down who can.

03:27:43,010 --> 03:27:47,582
SPEAKER_1:  who can truly make a difference when they describe their experiences in space.

03:27:48,034 --> 03:27:51,262
SPEAKER_1:  I found it very moving reading what he said.

03:27:51,714 --> 03:27:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, when you talk to astronauts, when they describe what they see, it's like this.

03:27:56,930 --> 03:28:03,454
SPEAKER_0:  Like they discovered a whole new thing that they can't possibly convert back into words. Yeah. Uh, yeah, it's.

03:28:03,682 --> 03:28:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  It's beautiful to see just as a quick.

03:28:06,050 --> 03:28:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  Before I forget, I have to ask you.

03:28:08,770 --> 03:28:12,414
SPEAKER_0:  Can you summarize your argument against the hypothesis that we live in a simulation?

03:28:13,666 --> 03:28:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  Is it similar to our discussion about the...

03:28:16,642 --> 03:28:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  Tuesday clock.

03:28:18,306 --> 03:28:20,734
SPEAKER_1:  Um, no, it's actually pretty more similar to my.

03:28:21,186 --> 03:28:21,598
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:28:21,890 --> 03:28:27,678
SPEAKER_1:  agnosticism about life in the universe, and it's just sort of remaining agnostic about all possibilities.

03:28:28,130 --> 03:28:28,574
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:28:28,834 --> 03:28:29,790
SPEAKER_1:  Dissemination Argument

03:28:30,530 --> 03:28:32,094
SPEAKER_1:  Sometimes it gets...

03:28:33,250 --> 03:28:35,070
SPEAKER_1:  It mix this kind of two.

03:28:35,714 --> 03:28:43,774
SPEAKER_1:  distinct things that we need to consider. One is the probability that we live in so-called base reality that we're not living in a simulated reality itself.

03:28:44,258 --> 03:28:46,750
SPEAKER_1:  And another problem to consider is the probability that...

03:28:47,106 --> 03:28:53,022
SPEAKER_1:  that technology is viable or possible and something we will ultimately choose to one day do.

03:28:53,378 --> 03:28:56,606
SPEAKER_1:  Those are two distinct things. They're probably quite similar numbers to each other.

03:28:56,930 --> 03:28:58,494
SPEAKER_1:  but they are distinct probabilities.

03:28:59,042 --> 03:28:59,678
SPEAKER_1:  semi

03:28:59,938 --> 03:29:01,246
SPEAKER_1:  In my paper, I...

03:29:01,506 --> 03:29:02,526
SPEAKER_1:  I write about this.

03:29:02,882 --> 03:29:06,750
SPEAKER_1:  I just tried to work through the problem. I teach astrocystics. I was actually teaching it this morning.

03:29:07,426 --> 03:29:08,638
SPEAKER_1:  And so it just seemed like a fun...

03:29:09,154 --> 03:29:12,126
SPEAKER_1:  case study of working through a Bayesian calculation for it.

03:29:12,514 --> 03:29:15,038
SPEAKER_1:  Basing calculations work on conditionals.

03:29:15,362 --> 03:29:23,102
SPEAKER_1:  And so when you hear any, what kind of inspired this project was when I heard Musk said was like a billion to one chance that we don't live in a simulation.

03:29:23,746 --> 03:29:24,222
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:29:25,122 --> 03:29:26,014
SPEAKER_1:  He's right.

03:29:26,402 --> 03:29:27,166
SPEAKER_1:  If you add.

03:29:27,394 --> 03:29:28,510
SPEAKER_1:  The Basing Conditional.

03:29:28,930 --> 03:29:34,206
SPEAKER_1:  and the basic condition is conditioned upon the fact that we eventually develop that technology and choose to use it.

03:29:34,722 --> 03:29:37,662
SPEAKER_1:  or it's chosen to be used by such species.

03:29:38,146 --> 03:29:39,294
SPEAKER_1:  by such civilizations.

03:29:39,522 --> 03:29:40,478
SPEAKER_1:  That's the conditional.

03:29:40,866 --> 03:29:43,902
SPEAKER_1:  And you have to add that in because that conditional isn't guaranteed.

03:29:44,674 --> 03:29:47,070
SPEAKER_1:  And so in a Bayesian framework, you can kind of.

03:29:47,714 --> 03:29:52,606
SPEAKER_1:  Make that explicit. You see mathematically explicitly that's a condition on your equation.

03:29:53,314 --> 03:29:59,678
SPEAKER_1:  And the opposite side of the coin is basically in the trilemma that Bostrom originally put forward as options 1 and 2.

03:30:00,002 --> 03:30:06,846
SPEAKER_1:  So option one is that you basically never develop the ability to do that. Option two is you never choose to execute that.

03:30:07,234 --> 03:30:09,438
SPEAKER_1:  So we kind of group those together as sort of the.

03:30:09,858 --> 03:30:11,742
SPEAKER_1:  the non-simulation.

03:30:12,162 --> 03:30:14,206
SPEAKER_1:  scenario, let's call it.

03:30:14,786 --> 03:30:17,214
SPEAKER_1:  And so you've got non-simulation scenario and simulation scenario.

03:30:17,666 --> 03:30:18,046
SPEAKER_1:  and

03:30:18,818 --> 03:30:20,414
SPEAKER_1:  Agnostically, we really...

03:30:20,738 --> 03:30:23,358
SPEAKER_1:  have to give though, you know, how do you assess the model?

03:30:23,586 --> 03:30:26,174
SPEAKER_1:  the a priori model probability of those two scenarios.

03:30:26,722 --> 03:30:27,294
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:30:27,842 --> 03:30:29,118
SPEAKER_1:  It's very difficult and we can...

03:30:29,634 --> 03:30:32,926
SPEAKER_1:  I think people would probably argue about how you assign those priors.

03:30:33,218 --> 03:30:37,470
SPEAKER_1:  In the paper we just assigned 50-50, we just said, this hasn't been demonstrated yet.

03:30:37,858 --> 03:30:41,662
SPEAKER_1:  There's no evidence that this is actually technically possible.

03:30:42,338 --> 03:30:47,358
SPEAKER_1:  but nor is it that it's not technically possible, so we're just going to assign 50-50 probability these two hypotheses.

03:30:47,874 --> 03:30:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  And then in the hypothesis where you have a simulated reality, you have a base reality set at the top.

03:30:52,802 --> 03:30:58,878
SPEAKER_1:  So there is even in the simulated hypothesis, there's a probability you still live in base reality. There's a whole myriad of...

03:30:59,202 --> 03:31:01,406
SPEAKER_1:  universes beneath that which are all simulated.

03:31:01,858 --> 03:31:06,622
SPEAKER_1:  And so you have a very slim probability of being in base reality, if this is true.

03:31:07,170 --> 03:31:13,662
SPEAKER_1:  and you have a 100% probability of living in base reality. On the other hand, if it's not true and we never develop...

03:31:14,050 --> 03:31:16,094
SPEAKER_1:  that ability or choose never to use it.

03:31:16,642 --> 03:31:19,838
SPEAKER_1:  And so then you apply this technique called basic model averaging, which is where you...

03:31:20,290 --> 03:31:23,550
SPEAKER_1:  propagate the uncertainty of your two models to get a final estimate.

03:31:23,874 --> 03:31:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  And because of that one base reality that lives in the simulated scenario.

03:31:28,930 --> 03:31:30,270
SPEAKER_1:  you end up counting this up.

03:31:30,562 --> 03:31:34,366
SPEAKER_1:  and getting that it always has to be less than 50%. The probability limits in

03:31:34,786 --> 03:31:37,950
SPEAKER_1:  in a simulated reality versus a based reality has to be slightly less than 50%

03:31:38,562 --> 03:31:38,974
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:31:39,298 --> 03:31:42,910
SPEAKER_1:  Now that really comes down to that statement of giving it 50-50 odds.

03:31:43,362 --> 03:31:44,030
SPEAKER_1:  To begin with...

03:31:44,738 --> 03:31:50,942
SPEAKER_1:  And on the one hand, you might say, look, David, I'm, you know, I work in artificial intelligence. I'm very confident that this is going to happen.

03:31:51,202 --> 03:31:53,118
SPEAKER_1:  just of extrapolating of current trends.

03:31:53,794 --> 03:31:55,966
SPEAKER_1:  Or on the other hand, a statistician would say...

03:31:56,290 --> 03:32:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  You're giving way too much weight to the simulation hypothesis because it's an intrinsically highly complicated model.

03:32:03,906 --> 03:32:04,926
SPEAKER_1:  You have a whole...

03:32:05,442 --> 03:32:10,430
SPEAKER_1:  hierarchy of realities within realities within realities. Like the inception style thing, right?

03:32:11,010 --> 03:32:12,158
SPEAKER_1:  And so this requires.

03:32:12,578 --> 03:32:16,158
SPEAKER_1:  hundreds thousands millions of parameter is to describe.

03:32:16,482 --> 03:32:21,534
SPEAKER_1:  And by Occam's razor, we would always normally penalize inherently complicated models as being disfavored.

03:32:22,114 --> 03:32:23,134
SPEAKER_1:  So I think you could.

03:32:23,618 --> 03:32:31,006
SPEAKER_1:  I argue on being too generous or too kind with that, but I sort of want to develop the rigorous mathematical tools to explore it.

03:32:31,586 --> 03:32:35,710
SPEAKER_1:  and ultimately it's up to you to decide what you think that 50-50 odds should be.

03:32:36,098 --> 03:32:37,086
SPEAKER_1:  But you can use my

03:32:37,506 --> 03:32:42,174
SPEAKER_1:  formula to plug in whatever you want and get the answer. And I use 50-50. So, but...

03:32:42,306 --> 03:32:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  when in that first pile with the first two parts of the

03:32:47,682 --> 03:32:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  that the boss room talks about, it seems like.

03:32:51,106 --> 03:32:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  Connected to that is the question we've been talking about which is the number of times at bat you get

03:32:56,930 --> 03:32:59,614
SPEAKER_0:  just the number of intelligent civilizations that are out there that can

03:33:00,514 --> 03:33:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  build such simulations.

03:33:04,354 --> 03:33:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  very closely connected because if we're the only ones that are here.

03:33:08,386 --> 03:33:09,790
SPEAKER_0:  and can build such things that...

03:33:10,146 --> 03:33:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  changes things.

03:33:11,426 --> 03:33:12,606
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, yeah, I mean.

03:33:13,282 --> 03:33:15,422
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, the signature embolism has all sorts of...

03:33:15,746 --> 03:33:17,342
SPEAKER_1:  implications like that.

03:33:18,018 --> 03:33:20,382
SPEAKER_1:  I've always loved showing Chara points that are really interesting.

03:33:20,834 --> 03:33:25,022
SPEAKER_1:  contradiction apparently with the simulation hypothesis that I speak about a little bit in the paper.

03:33:25,954 --> 03:33:28,542
SPEAKER_1:  But he showed that, or pointed out that.

03:33:28,930 --> 03:33:41,822
SPEAKER_1:  in this hierarchy of realities, which then develop their own AIs within the realities and then they are, or really ancestor simulations, I should say, rather than AI, they develop their own capability to simulate realities. You get this hierarchy.

03:33:42,050 --> 03:33:43,902
SPEAKER_1:  And so eventually there'll be a bottom layer.

03:33:44,162 --> 03:33:55,198
SPEAKER_1:  which I often call the sewer of reality. It's like the worst layer where it's the most pixelated it could possibly be. So, because each layer is necessarily going to have less computational power than the layer above it.

03:33:55,618 --> 03:34:01,534
SPEAKER_1:  Because not only are you simulating that entire planet, but also some of that's being used for the computers themselves that those are simulated.

03:34:02,082 --> 03:34:05,534
SPEAKER_1:  And so that base reality, also known as the sewer reality.

03:34:06,018 --> 03:34:09,278
SPEAKER_1:  is a reality where they are simply unable.

03:34:09,890 --> 03:34:14,494
SPEAKER_1:  to produce ancestor simulations because the fidelity of the simulation is not sufficient.

03:34:15,010 --> 03:34:20,958
SPEAKER_1:  And so from their point of view, it might not be obvious that the universe is pixelated, but they would just never be able to manifest that capability. What if...

03:34:21,186 --> 03:34:22,686
SPEAKER_0:  They're constantly simulating.

03:34:23,682 --> 03:34:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  uh... cuz it in order to uh... appreciate the limits of the fidelity you have to have an observer

03:34:29,922 --> 03:34:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  What if they're always simulating a dumber and dumber observer? What if the sewer has very dumb observers? They can't like scientists that are the dumbest possible scientists. So like it's very pixelated, but the scientists are too dumb to even see the pixelations.

03:34:47,074 --> 03:34:47,934
SPEAKER_0:  Right.

03:34:48,386 --> 03:34:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  Like built into the universe always has to be a limitation on the cognitive capabilities of the complex systems that are within it.

03:34:55,522 --> 03:34:58,174
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so that's surreality, they would still...

03:34:58,658 --> 03:35:00,062
SPEAKER_1:  Presumably be able to.

03:35:00,450 --> 03:35:06,718
SPEAKER_1:  have a very impressive computational capabilities, they'll probably be able to simulate galactic formation with this kind of impressive stuff.

03:35:07,586 --> 03:35:14,014
SPEAKER_1:  They would be just short of the ability to, however you define it, create a truly sentient conscious experience.

03:35:14,338 --> 03:35:15,902
SPEAKER_1:  in a computer that would just be.

03:35:16,194 --> 03:35:18,142
SPEAKER_1:  just beyond their capabilities.

03:35:18,530 --> 03:35:19,038
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

03:35:19,298 --> 03:35:23,550
SPEAKER_1:  Carol pointed out that if you add up all the counter-pamely realities, there should be...

03:35:24,226 --> 03:35:25,950
SPEAKER_1:  probabilistically, if this is true.

03:35:26,562 --> 03:35:28,478
SPEAKER_1:  Over here, the simulation.

03:35:28,962 --> 03:35:30,526
SPEAKER_1:  hypothesis or scenario.

03:35:30,754 --> 03:35:35,486
SPEAKER_1:  then you're most likely to find yourself in the sewer because there's just far more of them.

03:35:36,162 --> 03:35:38,334
SPEAKER_1:  than there are of any of the higher levels.

03:35:38,914 --> 03:35:41,182
SPEAKER_1:  And so that sort of sets up a contradiction because then...

03:35:41,474 --> 03:35:43,710
SPEAKER_1:  You live in a reality.

03:35:44,034 --> 03:35:48,670
SPEAKER_1:  which is inherently incapable of ever producing ancestor simulations.

03:35:50,402 --> 03:35:54,942
SPEAKER_1:  The premise of the entire argument is that ancestor simulations are possible.

03:35:55,426 --> 03:35:58,051
SPEAKER_1:  There's a contradiction.

03:35:58,051 --> 03:36:03,166
SPEAKER_0:  There's that old quote, we're all living in the sewer, but some of us are looking up at the stars.

03:36:03,362 --> 03:36:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  This is maybe more true than we think.

03:36:07,842 --> 03:36:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  But to me, so there's of course physics and computational fascinating questions here, but to me

03:36:12,674 --> 03:36:14,270
SPEAKER_0:  There's a practical psychological.

03:36:14,658 --> 03:36:15,230
SPEAKER_0:  question.

03:36:15,554 --> 03:36:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  which is...

03:36:16,994 --> 03:36:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  You know, how do you create?

03:36:18,594 --> 03:36:19,998
SPEAKER_0:  A virtual reality world.

03:36:21,154 --> 03:36:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  that is as compelling.

03:36:24,002 --> 03:36:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:36:24,834 --> 03:36:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  None of this is even as realistic.

03:36:26,914 --> 03:36:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  But...

03:36:28,066 --> 03:36:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  Almost as realistic.

03:36:30,242 --> 03:36:33,022
SPEAKER_0:  but as compelling or more compelling than physical reality.

03:36:34,754 --> 03:36:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  because something tells me it's not very difficult.

03:36:38,306 --> 03:36:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  in a in a in a.

03:36:41,282 --> 03:36:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  full history of human civilization.

03:36:43,394 --> 03:36:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  That...

03:36:44,738 --> 03:36:45,918
SPEAKER_0:  is an interesting.

03:36:47,074 --> 03:36:51,294
SPEAKER_0:  kind of simulation to me, because that feels like it's doable in the next 100 years.

03:36:51,778 --> 03:36:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  creating a world where we're all.

03:36:54,018 --> 03:36:56,286
SPEAKER_0:  prefer to live in the digital world.

03:36:56,706 --> 03:36:57,886
SPEAKER_0:  And not like a visit.

03:36:58,210 --> 03:36:58,814
SPEAKER_0:  but like...

03:36:59,458 --> 03:37:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  It's...

03:37:01,954 --> 03:37:03,870
SPEAKER_0:  your scene is insane. No, like

03:37:04,354 --> 03:37:05,598
SPEAKER_0:  You're required.

03:37:06,050 --> 03:37:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  It's unsafe to live outside of the virtual world.

03:37:10,370 --> 03:37:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:37:11,042 --> 03:37:14,366
SPEAKER_0:  It's interesting to me from an engineering perspective how to build that.

03:37:14,882 --> 03:37:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  Because I'm somebody that sort of loves video games and it seems like...

03:37:18,658 --> 03:37:21,694
SPEAKER_0:  You can create incredible worlds there and stay there.

03:37:22,146 --> 03:37:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:37:23,170 --> 03:37:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  That's a, it's a.

03:37:24,450 --> 03:37:25,150
SPEAKER_0:  different.

03:37:26,498 --> 03:37:30,366
SPEAKER_0:  question than creating a ultra high resolution, high fidelity.

03:37:30,786 --> 03:37:32,030
SPEAKER_0:  Simulation of physics.

03:37:33,058 --> 03:37:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  If that world inside a video game is

03:37:36,258 --> 03:37:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  as consistent.

03:37:37,730 --> 03:37:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  as the physics of our reality.

03:37:39,874 --> 03:37:41,662
SPEAKER_0:  You can have your own scientists in that world.

03:37:42,402 --> 03:37:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  trying to understand that physics world. They might look different.

03:37:45,954 --> 03:37:51,134
SPEAKER_1:  and presumably they'd eventually forget, you know, give it long enough they might forget about their origins.

03:37:51,394 --> 03:37:54,110
SPEAKER_1:  being once biological, assume this is their only reality.

03:37:54,562 --> 03:37:55,687
SPEAKER_1:  Especially if you're now.

03:37:55,687 --> 03:37:56,126
SPEAKER_0:  born.

03:37:57,186 --> 03:37:59,166
SPEAKER_0:  you know uh... what certainly if you're born

03:37:59,522 --> 03:38:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  But even if...

03:38:00,770 --> 03:38:04,830
SPEAKER_0:  You were eight years old or something when you first started wearing the headset.

03:38:05,762 --> 03:38:07,390
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, or you have a memory wipe when you go in.

03:38:07,682 --> 03:38:08,318
SPEAKER_1:  I mean it.

03:38:08,546 --> 03:38:14,494
SPEAKER_1:  It also kind of maybe speaks to this issue of like Neuralink and how do we keep up with AI in our world?

03:38:15,202 --> 03:38:23,038
SPEAKER_1:  If you want to augment your intelligence, perhaps one way of competing and the one of your impetus is for going into this digital reality.

03:38:23,362 --> 03:38:25,854
SPEAKER_1:  would be to be competitive intellectually.

03:38:26,338 --> 03:38:33,182
SPEAKER_1:  with artificial interchances that you could trivially augment your reality if your brain was itself artificial but

03:38:33,986 --> 03:38:36,926
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, one, one skepticism I've always had about that is, is whether

03:38:37,346 --> 03:38:41,502
SPEAKER_1:  It's a more philosophical question, but how much is that really you if you do a mind upload?

03:38:42,018 --> 03:38:46,430
SPEAKER_1:  Is this just a duplicate of your memories that thinks it's you?

03:38:46,690 --> 03:38:48,094
SPEAKER_1:  versus truly.

03:38:48,514 --> 03:38:50,654
SPEAKER_1:  a transference of your conscious stream.

03:38:51,074 --> 03:38:53,758
SPEAKER_1:  into that reality and I think we knew.

03:38:54,306 --> 03:38:54,846
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

03:38:56,386 --> 03:38:59,326
SPEAKER_1:  It's almost like the teleportation device in Star Trek.

03:38:59,714 --> 03:39:00,126
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:39:00,578 --> 03:39:00,926
SPEAKER_1:  with.

03:39:01,186 --> 03:39:04,574
SPEAKER_1:  teleportation, quantum teleportation, you can kind of rigorously show that

03:39:05,058 --> 03:39:05,758
SPEAKER_1:  Um, that.

03:39:06,050 --> 03:39:08,094
SPEAKER_1:  you know, all as long as all of the

03:39:08,738 --> 03:39:11,838
SPEAKER_1:  quantum numbers are exactly duplicated as you transfer over

03:39:12,162 --> 03:39:14,430
SPEAKER_1:  It truly is from the universe's perspective.

03:39:14,946 --> 03:39:22,558
SPEAKER_1:  in every way indistinguishable from what was there before. It really is in principle you and all the sense of being you.

03:39:23,010 --> 03:39:26,558
SPEAKER_1:  versus creating a duplicate clone and uploading.

03:39:27,010 --> 03:39:30,462
SPEAKER_1:  memories to that human body or a computer.

03:39:30,786 --> 03:39:31,326
SPEAKER_1:  that would.

03:39:32,034 --> 03:39:32,894
SPEAKER_1:  Surely be.

03:39:33,122 --> 03:39:33,566
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

03:39:33,858 --> 03:39:36,766
SPEAKER_1:  a discontinuation of that conscious experience.

03:39:37,122 --> 03:39:39,550
SPEAKER_1:  by virtue of the fact you've multiplied it. And so i

03:39:40,610 --> 03:39:42,430
SPEAKER_1:  I would be hesitant about uploading.

03:39:42,850 --> 03:39:46,398
SPEAKER_1:  that reason. I would see it mostly as my own.

03:39:46,658 --> 03:39:48,670
SPEAKER_1:  killing myself and having some

03:39:49,218 --> 03:39:49,790
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:39:50,530 --> 03:39:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  AI duplicate of me.

03:39:52,418 --> 03:39:54,398
SPEAKER_1:  that persists in this world, but.

03:39:54,626 --> 03:39:56,606
SPEAKER_1:  is not truly my experience.

03:39:57,058 --> 03:39:57,726
SPEAKER_0:  Typical.

03:39:58,594 --> 03:39:59,966
SPEAKER_0:  20th century human.

03:40:00,354 --> 03:40:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  with an attachment to this particular singular instantiation of brain.

03:40:06,082 --> 03:40:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  and body.

03:40:08,034 --> 03:40:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  how silly humans used to be. Used to have rotary phones and-

03:40:12,066 --> 03:40:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:40:13,858 --> 03:40:14,238
SPEAKER_0:

03:40:15,042 --> 03:40:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  and other silly things.

03:40:17,474 --> 03:40:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:40:19,202 --> 03:40:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  You're an incredible human being. You're an educator. You're a researcher.

03:40:23,554 --> 03:40:23,902
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:40:24,610 --> 03:40:25,310
SPEAKER_0:  You have.

03:40:26,018 --> 03:40:27,198
SPEAKER_0:  like an amazing.

03:40:27,426 --> 03:40:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  YouTube channel

03:40:31,074 --> 03:40:33,470
SPEAKER_0:  Looking to young people if you were to give them advice.

03:40:35,042 --> 03:40:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  How can they have a-

03:40:36,546 --> 03:40:37,342
SPEAKER_0:  A career?

03:40:37,826 --> 03:40:39,550
SPEAKER_0:  that maybe is inspired by yours.

03:40:39,810 --> 03:40:45,534
SPEAKER_0:  inspired by wandering curiosity, a career they can be proud of or a life they can be proud of.

03:40:46,626 --> 03:40:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  What advice would you give?

03:40:49,506 --> 03:40:50,814
SPEAKER_1:  I suddenly think in terms of it.

03:40:51,170 --> 03:40:52,094
SPEAKER_1:  Aquarian

03:40:52,322 --> 03:40:53,022
SPEAKER_1:  Science.

03:40:53,506 --> 03:40:56,638
SPEAKER_1:  One thing that I may be discovered late, but has been

03:40:57,634 --> 03:41:02,494
SPEAKER_1:  incredibly influential on me in terms of my own happiness and my own.

03:41:02,754 --> 03:41:03,646
SPEAKER_1:  productivity.

03:41:04,066 --> 03:41:06,686
SPEAKER_1:  has been this synergy of doing.

03:41:07,266 --> 03:41:08,478
SPEAKER_1:  two passions at once.

03:41:08,866 --> 03:41:12,062
SPEAKER_1:  One passion in science communication and another passion in research.

03:41:12,450 --> 03:41:12,926
SPEAKER_1:  and not.

03:41:13,346 --> 03:41:14,622
SPEAKER_1:  surrendering either one.

03:41:15,202 --> 03:41:15,934
SPEAKER_1:  And I think...

03:41:16,994 --> 03:41:27,806
SPEAKER_1:  that tends to be seen as something that's an either or, you have to completely dedicate yourself to one thing to gain mastery in it. That's a conventional way of thinking about both science and-

03:41:28,354 --> 03:41:29,278
SPEAKER_1:  other disciplines.

03:41:29,890 --> 03:41:33,950
SPEAKER_1:  and I have found that both have been elevated by practicing in each.

03:41:34,434 --> 03:41:34,910
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:41:35,234 --> 03:41:35,966
SPEAKER_1:  And I think.

03:41:36,578 --> 03:41:38,942
SPEAKER_1:  That's true in all assets of life. I mean, if you...

03:41:39,394 --> 03:41:40,222
SPEAKER_1:  1, 2.

03:41:40,482 --> 03:41:42,782
SPEAKER_1:  become the best researcher you possibly can.

03:41:43,618 --> 03:41:44,702
SPEAKER_1:  You're pushing your...

03:41:45,186 --> 03:41:48,542
SPEAKER_1:  intellect and sense your body to a high level.

03:41:49,282 --> 03:41:49,950
SPEAKER_1:  And so...

03:41:50,402 --> 03:41:50,846
SPEAKER_1:  To me.

03:41:51,618 --> 03:42:00,030
SPEAKER_1:  I've always wanted to couple that with training of my body, training of my mind and other ways besides from just what I'm doing when I'm in the lecture room or when I'm in my night watch AfD.

03:42:00,258 --> 03:42:02,334
SPEAKER_1:  office in calculating something.

03:42:02,946 --> 03:42:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:42:04,162 --> 03:42:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  focusing on your own.

03:42:05,826 --> 03:42:06,718
SPEAKER_1:  development.

03:42:07,170 --> 03:42:11,774
SPEAKER_1:  through whatever it is, meditation, for me, it's often running, working out.

03:42:12,258 --> 03:42:12,702
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:42:13,218 --> 03:42:15,486
SPEAKER_1:  and pursuing multiple passions.

03:42:16,002 --> 03:42:19,966
SPEAKER_1:  provides this almost synergistic bliss of all of them together.

03:42:20,418 --> 03:42:21,662
SPEAKER_1:  so often I've had.

03:42:22,338 --> 03:42:28,830
SPEAKER_1:  some of the best research ideas from making a YouTube video and trying to communicate an idea or interacting with my audience who've had.

03:42:29,378 --> 03:42:31,230
SPEAKER_1:  a question that sparked a hole.

03:42:31,714 --> 03:42:34,654
SPEAKER_1:  trail of thought that led down this wonderful intellectual rabbit hole.

03:42:35,266 --> 03:42:37,150
SPEAKER_1:  or maybe to a new intellectual discovery.

03:42:37,410 --> 03:42:39,326
SPEAKER_1:  can go either way sometimes with those things.

03:42:39,842 --> 03:42:40,318
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:42:40,642 --> 03:42:42,078
SPEAKER_1:  And so thinking broadly.

03:42:42,498 --> 03:42:43,326
SPEAKER_1:  diversely.

03:42:44,066 --> 03:42:46,910
SPEAKER_1:  and always looking after yourself in this.

03:42:47,170 --> 03:42:52,222
SPEAKER_1:  in this highly competitive and often extremely stressful world that we live in.

03:42:52,866 --> 03:42:53,406
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:42:54,210 --> 03:42:58,462
SPEAKER_1:  is the best advice I can offer anybody and just try.

03:42:58,690 --> 03:43:02,270
SPEAKER_1:  If you can, it's very cheesy, but if you can follow your passions.

03:43:02,658 --> 03:43:04,798
SPEAKER_1:  you'll always be happy trying to.

03:43:05,058 --> 03:43:05,662
SPEAKER_1:  Sellout.

03:43:06,274 --> 03:43:07,262
SPEAKER_1:  for the quick.

03:43:07,810 --> 03:43:09,246
SPEAKER_1:  cash out for the quick book out.

03:43:09,986 --> 03:43:11,902
SPEAKER_1:  can be tempting in the short term.

03:43:12,450 --> 03:43:14,718
SPEAKER_1:  Looking for exo means it was never easy.

03:43:15,106 --> 03:43:18,398
SPEAKER_1:  but I made a career not out of discovering ex-amines.

03:43:18,690 --> 03:43:21,406
SPEAKER_1:  but out of learning how to communicate the difficult problem.

03:43:21,954 --> 03:43:28,094
SPEAKER_1:  and discovering all sorts of things along the way. We shot for the sky and we discovered all this stuff along the way. We discovered.

03:43:28,322 --> 03:43:30,878
SPEAKER_1:  dozens of new planets using all sorts of new techniques.

03:43:31,298 --> 03:43:33,886
SPEAKER_1:  We pushed this instrumentation to new places.

03:43:34,338 --> 03:43:36,798
SPEAKER_1:  and I've had an extremely productive.

03:43:37,090 --> 03:43:38,014
SPEAKER_1:  Research Career

03:43:38,658 --> 03:43:42,270
SPEAKER_1:  in this world, I've had all sorts of ideas working on techno signatures. It's

03:43:43,362 --> 03:43:44,990
SPEAKER_1:  you know, thinking innovatively.

03:43:45,442 --> 03:43:48,830
SPEAKER_1:  pushes you into all sorts of exciting directions.

03:43:49,218 --> 03:43:50,078
SPEAKER_1:  Um, so.

03:43:51,330 --> 03:43:51,678
SPEAKER_1:  this.

03:43:51,906 --> 03:43:55,070
SPEAKER_1:  Just try to, yeah, it's hard to find that passion, but you can.

03:43:55,426 --> 03:43:59,870
SPEAKER_1:  Sometimes remember it when you were a kid, what your passions were and what fascinated you as a child.

03:44:00,482 --> 03:44:05,726
SPEAKER_1:  For me, as soon as I picked up a space boat when I was five years old, that was it. I was hooked on space and...

03:44:06,338 --> 03:44:12,158
SPEAKER_1:  I almost betrayed my passion at college. I studied physics, which I've always been fascinated by physics as well.

03:44:12,866 --> 03:44:13,214
SPEAKER_1:  But.

03:44:13,762 --> 03:44:16,830
SPEAKER_1:  I came back to astronomy because it was my first love and...

03:44:17,122 --> 03:44:22,366
SPEAKER_1:  I was much happier doing research in astronomy than I was in physics because it spoke to........................................................................

03:44:23,362 --> 03:44:28,318
SPEAKER_1:  wonder I had as a child that first was the spark of curiosity for me in science.

03:44:29,474 --> 03:44:32,702
SPEAKER_0:  So society will try to get you to look at hot Jupiters.

03:44:33,090 --> 03:44:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

03:44:33,730 --> 03:44:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  and the advice is to look for the cool world instead.

03:44:36,834 --> 03:44:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

03:44:38,882 --> 03:44:40,318
SPEAKER_0:  You ever ask yourself why?

03:44:41,730 --> 03:44:42,558
SPEAKER_1:  It's just a ride.

03:44:43,298 --> 03:44:45,982
SPEAKER_1:  That's all right. It's just a ride. We're on a roller coaster.

03:44:46,594 --> 03:44:47,230
SPEAKER_1:  and

03:44:47,490 --> 03:44:48,446
SPEAKER_1:  We have no.

03:44:48,674 --> 03:44:49,438
SPEAKER_1:  purpose.

03:44:49,666 --> 03:44:50,974
SPEAKER_1:  It's an accident, am I?

03:44:51,266 --> 03:44:52,190
SPEAKER_1:  my perspective.

03:44:52,546 --> 03:44:54,750
SPEAKER_1:  There's no meaning to my life, there's no.

03:44:55,138 --> 03:44:56,798
SPEAKER_1:  are very important but very important. Where's the

03:44:57,250 --> 03:45:01,470
SPEAKER_1:  deity who is over watching what I'm doing and I have some fate or destiny.

03:45:01,858 --> 03:45:04,190
SPEAKER_1:  It's all just riding on the roller coaster.

03:45:04,514 --> 03:45:05,630
SPEAKER_1:  and trying to.

03:45:06,178 --> 03:45:09,182
SPEAKER_1:  have a good time and contribute.

03:45:09,954 --> 03:45:10,622
SPEAKER_1:  to.

03:45:10,850 --> 03:45:12,446
SPEAKER_1:  to other people's enjoyment of the ride.

03:45:12,642 --> 03:45:15,582
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, try to make it a happy accident.

03:45:15,682 --> 03:45:18,142
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, yeah, I see no...

03:45:18,754 --> 03:45:20,318
SPEAKER_1:  fundamental.

03:45:20,546 --> 03:45:21,822
SPEAKER_1:  Providence in.

03:45:22,146 --> 03:45:25,694
SPEAKER_1:  in my life or in the nature of the universe. And you just see this.

03:45:25,954 --> 03:45:27,678
SPEAKER_1:  The universe is this beautiful.

03:45:27,906 --> 03:45:30,878
SPEAKER_1:  cosmic accident of galaxies smashing together.

03:45:31,362 --> 03:45:33,854
SPEAKER_1:  stars forging here and there and-

03:45:34,242 --> 03:45:38,270
SPEAKER_1:  Planets occasionally spawning maybe life across the universe.

03:45:38,594 --> 03:45:41,886
SPEAKER_1:  And we are just one of those instantiations. And we should just.

03:45:42,242 --> 03:45:44,126
SPEAKER_1:  Enjoy this very brief.

03:45:44,450 --> 03:45:46,366
SPEAKER_1:  episode that we have and

03:45:47,234 --> 03:45:48,510
SPEAKER_1:  I think trying to...

03:45:48,930 --> 03:45:51,262
SPEAKER_1:  look at it much deeper than that is...

03:45:52,418 --> 03:45:58,622
SPEAKER_1:  is to me, it's not very soul satisfying. I just think enjoy what you've got and appreciate it.

03:45:58,946 --> 03:46:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  It does seem noticing that beauty.

03:46:01,826 --> 03:46:03,582

03:46:33,058 --> 03:46:33,630
SPEAKER_0:  Perhaps.

03:46:33,890 --> 03:46:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  The aliens are here.

03:46:35,682 --> 03:46:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  but are hiding.

03:46:36,962 --> 03:46:37,662
SPEAKER_0:  because of some.

03:46:37,954 --> 03:46:39,166
SPEAKER_0:  Lex Galactica.

03:46:39,842 --> 03:46:43,038
SPEAKER_0:  ethic of non-interference with emerging civilizations.

03:46:43,650 --> 03:46:44,478
SPEAKER_0:  You can imagine them.

03:46:44,994 --> 03:46:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  curious and dispassionate.

03:46:47,138 --> 03:46:47,934
SPEAKER_0:  observing us.

03:46:48,482 --> 03:46:51,230
SPEAKER_0:  as we would watch a bacterial culture in a dish.

03:46:51,906 --> 03:46:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  determine whether this year again.

03:46:54,690 --> 03:46:56,670
