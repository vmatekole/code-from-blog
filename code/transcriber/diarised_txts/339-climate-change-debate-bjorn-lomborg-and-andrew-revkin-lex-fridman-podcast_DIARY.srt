00:00:00,098 --> 00:00:11,326
SPEAKER_1:  people all around the world, their lives have basically dependent on fossil fuels. And so the idea that we're going to get people off by making it so expensive that it becomes impossible for them to live good lives.

00:00:11,874 --> 00:00:13,749
SPEAKER_1:  is almost morally reprehensible.

00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  people who have the most basic science literacy, like who know the most about

00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  greenhouse effect, they're at both ends of the spectrum.

00:00:21,058 --> 00:00:24,446
SPEAKER_0:  of views on climate, dismissives and alarmed.

00:00:24,994 --> 00:00:27,454
SPEAKER_1:  likely the worst effect of climate change.

00:00:29,826 --> 00:00:32,318
SPEAKER_1:  The following is a conversation with Bjorn Lomborg.

00:00:32,578 --> 00:00:33,950
SPEAKER_1:  and Andrew Ravkin.

00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,998
SPEAKER_1:  on the topic of climate change.

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,982
SPEAKER_1:  It is framed as a debate.

00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,862
SPEAKER_1:  but with the goal of having a nuanced conversation.

00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:42,654
SPEAKER_1:  talking with each other.

00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:43,998
SPEAKER_1:  at each other.

00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:49,150
SPEAKER_1:  I hope to continue having debates like these, including on controversial topics.

00:00:49,698 --> 00:00:51,550
SPEAKER_1:  I believe in the power of conversation.

00:00:51,906 --> 00:00:53,054
SPEAKER_1:  to bring people together.

00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:55,198
SPEAKER_1:  Not to convince one side.

00:00:55,426 --> 00:00:56,158
SPEAKER_1:  or the other.

00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,694
SPEAKER_1:  but to enlighten both.

00:00:57,922 --> 00:01:00,062
SPEAKER_1:  with the insights and wisdom that each hold.

00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:05,054
SPEAKER_1:  Bjorn Lomborg is the president of Copenhagen Consensus Think Tank.

00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:06,494
SPEAKER_1:  and author of

00:01:06,818 --> 00:01:07,614
SPEAKER_1:  Foss alarm.

00:01:08,354 --> 00:01:09,470
SPEAKER_1:  Cool it and...

00:01:09,698 --> 00:01:11,454
SPEAKER_1:  skeptical environmentalist.

00:01:12,162 --> 00:01:15,838
SPEAKER_1:  Please check out his work at Lomborg.com that includes his books.

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,886
SPEAKER_1:  articles and other writing.

00:01:18,722 --> 00:01:19,646
SPEAKER_1:  Andrew Ravkin.

00:01:19,938 --> 00:01:23,742
SPEAKER_1:  is one of the most respected journalists in the world on the topic of climate.

00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,422
SPEAKER_1:  He's been writing about global environmental change and risk.

00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,150
SPEAKER_1:  for more than 30 years.

00:01:29,634 --> 00:01:31,550
SPEAKER_1:  20 of it at the New York Times.

00:01:32,322 --> 00:01:33,726
SPEAKER_1:  We check out his work.

00:01:34,114 --> 00:01:35,006
SPEAKER_1:  in the link tree.

00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:38,782
SPEAKER_1:  that includes his books, articles, and other writing.

00:01:39,554 --> 00:01:42,206
SPEAKER_1:  This is the Lex treatment podcast to support it.

00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:44,638
SPEAKER_1:  Please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:01:45,026 --> 00:01:46,238
SPEAKER_1:  And now, dear friends,

00:01:46,594 --> 00:01:47,966
SPEAKER_1:  Here's Bjorn Lomborg.

00:01:48,258 --> 00:01:49,342
SPEAKER_1:  and Andrew.

00:01:49,634 --> 00:01:50,110
SPEAKER_1:  Ravkin.

00:01:51,234 --> 00:01:58,014
SPEAKER_1:  there's a spectrum of belief on the topic of climate change and the landscape of that spectrum has probably changed over

00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:02,494
SPEAKER_1:  several decades. On one extreme, there's a belief that climate change is a hoax.

00:02:02,978 --> 00:02:04,702
SPEAKER_1:  It's not human caused.

00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,046
SPEAKER_1:  to pile on top of that, there's a belief that the institution, scientific, political, the media,

00:02:10,402 --> 00:02:12,126
SPEAKER_1:  are corrupt and are kind of.

00:02:12,706 --> 00:02:16,958
SPEAKER_1:  constructing this fabrication. That's one extreme and then the other extreme.

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,814
SPEAKER_1:  There's a...

00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:21,278
SPEAKER_1:  a level of alarmism.

00:02:22,274 --> 00:02:26,430
SPEAKER_1:  about the catastrophic impacts of climate change that lead to...

00:02:26,786 --> 00:02:27,966
SPEAKER_1:  the extinction of...

00:02:28,258 --> 00:02:29,502
SPEAKER_1:  uh... human civilization

00:02:29,922 --> 00:02:31,998
SPEAKER_1:  So not just economic costs.

00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,678
SPEAKER_1:  hardship, suffering, but literally the destruction of the

00:02:36,098 --> 00:02:38,206
SPEAKER_1:  human species in the short term.

00:02:38,434 --> 00:02:39,038
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so that's.

00:02:39,394 --> 00:02:41,054
SPEAKER_1:  spectrum and I would love to find

00:02:41,602 --> 00:02:42,526
SPEAKER_1:  the center.

00:02:43,298 --> 00:02:46,334
SPEAKER_1:  And my sense is, and the reason I wanted to talk to the two of you...

00:02:46,818 --> 00:02:47,646
SPEAKER_1:  aside from

00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,902
SPEAKER_1:  the humility with which you approach this topic.

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,454
SPEAKER_1:  is I feel like you're close to the center in our on.

00:02:55,746 --> 00:02:57,342
SPEAKER_1:  different sides of that center.

00:02:57,954 --> 00:03:00,414
SPEAKER_1:  if it's possible to define the center. Like there is a.

00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:03,070
SPEAKER_1:  political center for center left and center right.

00:03:03,778 --> 00:03:07,934
SPEAKER_1:  Of course, it's very difficult to define, but can you help me define what the extremes are again?

00:03:08,162 --> 00:03:10,590
SPEAKER_1:  as they have changed over the years, what they are today.

00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  And where's the center? Oh boy. Well, in a way on this issue, I think there is no center except in this.

00:03:17,602 --> 00:03:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  if you're looking on social media or if you're looking on TV.

00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  there are people who are trying to fabricate the idea as a single question.

00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  And that's the first mistake.

00:03:28,226 --> 00:03:31,102
SPEAKER_0:  We are developing a new relationship with the climate system.

00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  and we're rethinking our energy systems. And those are very-

00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:41,182
SPEAKER_0:  disconnected in so many ways that connect around climate change.

00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:44,318
SPEAKER_0:  the first way to me to overcome this idea of.

00:03:44,546 --> 00:03:45,182
SPEAKER_0:  There is this.

00:03:45,922 --> 00:03:46,654
SPEAKER_0:  Polarized.

00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  universe around this issue is to.

00:03:49,474 --> 00:03:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  step back and say, well, what is this actually? And when you do, you realize it's

00:03:53,602 --> 00:03:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  It's kind of an uncomfortable collision between old energy norms.

00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  and a growing awareness of.

00:03:59,298 --> 00:04:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  how the planet works, that if you keep adding gases that are invisible, it's the bubbles in beer.

00:04:05,122 --> 00:04:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  If you keep adding that to the atmosphere because it accumulates, that will change everything is changing everything for thousands of years. That's already happening. What do you mean by bubbles and beer?

00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  CO2, carbon dioxide.

00:04:15,394 --> 00:04:17,118
SPEAKER_0:  main greenhouse gas. why beer?

00:04:17,826 --> 00:04:21,790
SPEAKER_0:  Look, because I like beer. It's also in Coca-Cola. You were talking about Cola before.

00:04:22,242 --> 00:04:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:04:23,202 --> 00:04:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  And so it's innocuous. We grew up with this idea as-

00:04:26,338 --> 00:04:29,438
SPEAKER_0:  CO2, unless you're trapped in a room suffocating.

00:04:30,434 --> 00:04:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  It is innocuous gas. It's plant food.

00:04:33,122 --> 00:04:34,238
SPEAKER_0:  It's beer bubbles.

00:04:34,946 --> 00:04:35,614
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  the idea we can swiftly transition to a world.

00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,726
SPEAKER_0:  where that gas is a pollutant.

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,134
SPEAKER_0:  Regulated.

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  tamp down from the top.

00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:49,278
SPEAKER_0:  is fantastical. Having looked at this for

00:04:49,762 --> 00:04:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  35 years, I brought along one of my tokens.

00:04:52,898 --> 00:04:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  This is my 1988 cover story on global warming.

00:04:56,642 --> 00:04:57,767
SPEAKER_0:  The greenhouse effect.

00:04:57,767 --> 00:04:59,267
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. Two years in.

00:04:59,267 --> 00:04:59,806
SPEAKER_0: .

00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  Jim Hansen, the famous American climate scientist, really, he stimulated this article.

00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,774
SPEAKER_0:  by doing this dramatic testimony.

00:05:08,258 --> 00:05:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  in a Senate committee that summer.

00:05:09,922 --> 00:05:11,710
SPEAKER_0:  in May, actually spring, late spring.

00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:12,766
SPEAKER_0:  It was a hot day.

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:13,822
SPEAKER_0:  And cut.

00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  headlines and this was the result.

00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,134
SPEAKER_0:  but it's complicated. Look what we were selling on the back cover.

00:05:20,034 --> 00:05:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  What you see isn't what you get tobacco.

00:05:21,698 --> 00:05:23,422
SPEAKER_1:  Cigarettes. Cigarettes.

00:05:24,034 --> 00:05:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. Looking back at my own career on the climate question, it's no longer a belief fight over.

00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  Is global warming real or not? You say, well, what kind of energy future do you want? That's a very different question then.

00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  Stop global warming.

00:05:36,482 --> 00:05:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  Um,

00:05:38,242 --> 00:05:39,166
SPEAKER_0:  when you look at climate.

00:05:39,394 --> 00:05:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  Actually.

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,846
SPEAKER_0:  I had this learning journey on my reporting.

00:05:44,354 --> 00:05:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  where I started out with this as the definition of the problem.

00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:48,926
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

00:05:49,154 --> 00:05:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  the 70s and 80s, pollution was changing things that were making things bad.

00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:56,291
SPEAKER_1:  So really focusing on the greenhouse effect and the pollution.

00:05:56,291 --> 00:06:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  But what I missed, the big thing that I missed of the first 15 years of my reporting from 1988.

00:06:02,434 --> 00:06:03,966
SPEAKER_0:  through about 2007.

00:06:05,858 --> 00:06:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  when I was, that period I was at the New York Times.

00:06:09,122 --> 00:06:10,238
SPEAKER_0:  in the middle there.

00:06:10,626 --> 00:06:13,630
SPEAKER_0:  was that we're building vulnerability to climate hazards at the same time.

00:06:13,922 --> 00:06:15,294
SPEAKER_0:  So climate is changing.

00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:21,214
SPEAKER_0:  But we're changing too. And where we are here in Austin, Texas is a great example.

00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  Flash Flood Alley.

00:06:23,394 --> 00:06:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  named in the 1920s west of here.

00:06:26,498 --> 00:06:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  Everyone forgot about flesh floods, built these huge developments.

00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  along these river basins.

00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  that in one side starts saying global warming, global warming.

00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  and the other side is not recognizing.

00:06:38,178 --> 00:06:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  that we've built.

00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,158
SPEAKER_0:  willfully.

00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  greedily.

00:06:42,658 --> 00:06:43,070
SPEAKER_0:  at.

00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  vulnerability in places of utter hazard. Same things played out in Pakistan.

00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  and in Fort Myers, Florida.

00:06:49,954 --> 00:06:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  and you start to understand that we're creating a landscape of risk.

00:06:54,850 --> 00:07:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  as climate is changing, then it feels, oh my God, that's more complex, right? But it also gives you more action points. Like, okay, well, we know how to-

00:07:02,914 --> 00:07:05,310
SPEAKER_0:  design better. We know that today's

00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,134
SPEAKER_0:  won't be tomorrow's coast.

00:07:07,906 --> 00:07:11,070
SPEAKER_0:  work with that. And then let's chart an energy future at the same time.

00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:14,014
SPEAKER_0:  So the story became so different, it didn't become like.

00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  you know, a story you could package into a magazine article.

00:07:19,298 --> 00:07:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  or the like.

00:07:20,258 --> 00:07:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  And it just led me to a whole different way of.

00:07:22,146 --> 00:07:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  Even my journalism changed over time.

00:07:24,514 --> 00:07:25,598
SPEAKER_0:  So I don't fight these.

00:07:25,826 --> 00:07:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  belief disbelief.

00:07:27,362 --> 00:07:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's actually...

00:07:29,762 --> 00:07:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  kind of a waste. It's a good way to start.

00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  the discussion because that's where we're at.

00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  but this isn't about.

00:07:36,802 --> 00:07:39,166
SPEAKER_0:  to me going forward from where we're at isn't about.

00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,182
SPEAKER_0:  tipping that balance.

00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:48,039
SPEAKER_0:  toward the center so much as finding opportunities to just do something about this stuff. What do you think Bjorn?

00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  I agree that it's multiple questions in one.

00:07:50,594 --> 00:07:54,366
SPEAKER_1:  And one big question, do you think it's possible to define the center, where is the center?

00:07:54,722 --> 00:07:56,894
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's wonderful to hear Andy sort of.

00:07:57,314 --> 00:07:58,206
SPEAKER_1:  Unconstruct.

00:07:58,434 --> 00:08:00,990
SPEAKER_1:  the whole conversation and say we should be worried about.

00:08:01,218 --> 00:08:07,614
SPEAKER_1:  different things and I think that's exact or we should be worried about things in a different way that makes it much more useful.

00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:13,438
SPEAKER_1:  I think that's exactly the right way to think about it. On the other hand, that was also where you kind of ended.

00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:18,046
SPEAKER_1:  We are stuck in a place where this very much is the conversation right now.

00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:20,766
SPEAKER_1:  And so I think in one sense.

00:08:20,994 --> 00:08:28,670
SPEAKER_1:  Certainly the people who used to say, oh, this is not happening. They're very, very small and diminishing crowd and certainly not right.

00:08:28,994 --> 00:08:32,062
SPEAKER_1:  Um, but on the other hand, I think to an extent.

00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,494
SPEAKER_1:  it increasing extent.

00:08:34,786 --> 00:08:36,030
SPEAKER_1:  We've gotten into a world.

00:08:36,322 --> 00:08:39,998
SPEAKER_1:  where a lot of people really think this is the end of the times.

00:08:40,226 --> 00:08:49,374
SPEAKER_1:  So the OECD did a new survey of all OECD countries and it's shocking. So it shows that 60% of all people...

00:08:49,602 --> 00:08:51,294
SPEAKER_1:  in the OCD, so the rich world.

00:08:51,874 --> 00:08:56,894
SPEAKER_1:  believes that global warming will likely or very likely lead to the extinction of mankind.

00:08:57,826 --> 00:09:01,342
SPEAKER_1:  And that's scary in a very, very.

00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:06,398
SPEAKER_1:  clear way because look, if this really is true, if global warming is this meter.

00:09:06,722 --> 00:09:07,806
SPEAKER_1:  hurtling towards Earth.

00:09:08,418 --> 00:09:09,662
SPEAKER_1:  and we're gonna be.

00:09:09,954 --> 00:09:14,046
SPEAKER_1:  destroyed in 12 years or whatever the number is today.

00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:19,518
SPEAKER_1:  then clearly we should care about nothing else. We should just be focusing on making sure that that-

00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,902
SPEAKER_1:  asteroid, we should send up Bruce Willis and get this done with.

00:09:24,354 --> 00:09:26,046
SPEAKER_1:  But that's not the way it is.

00:09:26,338 --> 00:09:30,910
SPEAKER_1:  This is not actually what the UN climate panel tells us or anything else. So I think...

00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:39,582
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, it's not so much about arcing against the people who are saying it's a, it's a hoax. That's not really where I am. I don't think that's where Andy or really where the conversation is.

00:09:40,034 --> 00:09:43,262
SPEAKER_1:  but it is a question of sort of pulling people back from this.

00:09:43,618 --> 00:09:52,862
SPEAKER_1:  end of the world conversation because it really skews our way that we think about problems. Also, if you really think this is the end of time and you only have 12 years,

00:09:53,122 --> 00:09:53,918
SPEAKER_1:  Nothing.

00:09:54,242 --> 00:09:56,222
SPEAKER_1:  that can only work in 13 years.

00:09:56,546 --> 00:09:57,278
SPEAKER_1:  can be considered.

00:09:57,858 --> 00:10:03,934
SPEAKER_1:  And the reality of most of what we're talking about in climate and certainly our vulnerability, certainly our energy system.

00:10:04,258 --> 00:10:06,078
SPEAKER_1:  is going to be half to a full century.

00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,606
SPEAKER_1:  and so when you talk to people and say

00:10:09,314 --> 00:10:14,014
SPEAKER_1:  But we're really going to go a lot more renewable in the next half century. They look at you and like...

00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,574
SPEAKER_1:  That's what, 38 years too late.

00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,230
SPEAKER_1:  And I get that, but so I think...

00:10:19,842 --> 00:10:23,262
SPEAKER_1:  in your question, what I'm trying to do, and I would imagine that's

00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:28,990
SPEAKER_1:  for you as well is to try to pull people away from this precipice and this end of the world.

00:10:29,314 --> 00:10:34,558
SPEAKER_1:  and then open it up. And I think Andy did that really well by saying, look, there's so many different.

00:10:34,914 --> 00:10:41,086
SPEAKER_1:  sub conversations and we need to have all of them and we need to be respectful of, of, of some of these.

00:10:41,346 --> 00:10:44,318
SPEAKER_1:  are right in the standard media kind of way.

00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:48,158
SPEAKER_1:  But some of them are very very wrong and actually means that we end up

00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:53,571
SPEAKER_1:  doing much less good, both on climate, but also on all the other problems the world faces. okay

00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  And it just empowers people to, those who believe this, to even, to do true things that shouldn't be done,

00:10:58,178 --> 00:11:01,534
SPEAKER_0:  sit back, even in Adam McKay's movie, the Don't Look Up movie.

00:11:01,858 --> 00:11:04,318
SPEAKER_0:  There was that sort of nihilist crowd for those who've seen it.

00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  who just say, you know, fuck this, we're...

00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,918
SPEAKER_0:  And a lot of people have that, when something's too big.

00:11:11,426 --> 00:11:12,574
SPEAKER_0:  And

00:11:13,282 --> 00:11:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  it just paralyzes you as opposed to giving you these action points.

00:11:16,898 --> 00:11:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  And the other thing is...

00:11:18,882 --> 00:11:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  I hate-

00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,854
SPEAKER_0:  I hate it when economists are right about stuff like the-

00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,495
SPEAKER_0:  I... I... I...

00:11:23,495 --> 00:11:24,995
SPEAKER_1:  I'm gonna have to help her with that.

00:11:24,995 --> 00:11:32,542
SPEAKER_0:  No, no, there are these phrases like I never knew the words path dependency until probably 10 years ago in my reporting.

00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  And basically says you're in a system.

00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:39,774
SPEAKER_0:  the things around you, how we pass laws, the brokenness of the Senate.

00:11:41,058 --> 00:11:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  Those are.

00:11:42,338 --> 00:11:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  We don't have a climate crisis in America, we have a decision crisis.

00:11:45,698 --> 00:11:48,158
SPEAKER_0:  as it comes to how the government works or doesn't work.

00:11:48,386 --> 00:11:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  So those big features of our.

00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  landscape are.

00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:56,126
SPEAKER_0:  It's path dependency. When you when you screw in a light bulb.

00:11:56,834 --> 00:12:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  Even if it's an LED light bulb, it's going into a 113, 120 year old fixture.

00:12:02,402 --> 00:12:04,958
SPEAKER_0:  because, and actually that fixture is almost designed.

00:12:05,282 --> 00:12:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  If you look at like 19th century gas fixtures, they had the screw in.

00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  So we're like on this long path dependencies when it comes to energy and stuff like that.

00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:21,438
SPEAKER_0:  You don't just magically transition a car fleet. A car built today will last 40 years. It'll end up in Mexico, sold on a used car, etc., etc.

00:12:21,858 --> 00:12:22,270
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:12:23,106 --> 00:12:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  So this.

00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  There is no quick.

00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,806
SPEAKER_0:  even if we're true.

00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  that.

00:12:29,026 --> 00:12:32,702
SPEAKER_0:  where things are coming to an end in 13 years, 12 years or 8 years.

00:12:32,802 --> 00:12:36,062
SPEAKER_1:  Most people don't believe that climate change is a hoax.

00:12:36,418 --> 00:12:38,622
SPEAKER_1:  believe that there is an increase.

00:12:39,298 --> 00:12:42,366
SPEAKER_1:  There's a global warming of a few degrees in the next century.

00:12:42,786 --> 00:12:45,790
SPEAKER_1:  and then maybe debate about what the number of the degrees is.

00:12:46,754 --> 00:12:50,142
SPEAKER_1:  And do most people believe that it's human cause?

00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,414
SPEAKER_1:  at this time in the

00:12:52,962 --> 00:12:56,702
SPEAKER_1:  in this history of discussion of climate change. So is that the center still?

00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,110
SPEAKER_1:  Like is there still the-

00:12:58,498 --> 00:13:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  debate on this. Yale University, the climate communication group there for like 13 years has done this.

00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  Six Americas Study.

00:13:06,914 --> 00:13:07,390
SPEAKER_0:  where they've.

00:13:07,906 --> 00:13:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  charted.

00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,646
SPEAKER_0:  pretty carefully and ways that I really find useful.

00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:12,926
SPEAKER_0:  with people.

00:13:13,442 --> 00:13:16,574
SPEAKER_0:  believe and we could talk about the word belief in the context of science too but

00:13:17,154 --> 00:13:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  and they've identified kind of six kinds of us.

00:13:20,162 --> 00:13:25,822
SPEAKER_0:  from dismissive to alarmed and with lots of bubbles in between. I think some of those bubbles in between are.

00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,278
SPEAKER_0:  mostly disengage people who don't really deal with the issue.

00:13:29,858 --> 00:13:34,686
SPEAKER_0:  And they've shown a drift for sure. There's much more majority now at the.

00:13:35,746 --> 00:13:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  alarmed or engaged.

00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  bubbles than just the dismissive bubble.

00:13:40,738 --> 00:13:45,278
SPEAKER_0:  There's a durable, like with vaccination and lots of other issues, there's a durable never anything.

00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  belief.

00:13:47,682 --> 00:13:48,222
SPEAKER_0:  group but

00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:51,998
SPEAKER_0:  on the reality that humans are contributing to climate change.

00:13:52,386 --> 00:13:54,494
SPEAKER_0:  most Americans when you ask them.

00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  And it also depends on how you write your survey.

00:13:57,634 --> 00:13:58,759
SPEAKER_0:  I think there's a...

00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:08,062
SPEAKER_1:  globally. I mean, when you ask around, I mean, and this is, you know, if you hear this story from the media of 20 years, of course, that's what you will believe. And it also happens to be.

00:14:08,962 --> 00:14:17,310
SPEAKER_1:  I think that is what the science, I think, you know, it's perhaps worth saying, and it's a little depressing that you always have to say, but I think it's worth saying that I think we both.

00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:31,614
SPEAKER_1:  really do accept the climate panel science. And there's absolutely global warming. It is an issue and it's probably just worthwhile to get it out of the way. It's an issue and it's caused by humans. It's caused by humans, yeah.

00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  But vulnerability, the losses.

00:14:34,722 --> 00:14:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  that

00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:41,662
SPEAKER_0:  are driven by climate-related events. Still, predominantly are caused by humans, but on the ground.

00:14:42,274 --> 00:14:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  It's where we build stuff.

00:14:44,002 --> 00:14:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  where we settle.

00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,302
SPEAKER_0:  Pakistan.

00:14:47,074 --> 00:14:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  I hear it.

00:14:48,578 --> 00:14:54,366
SPEAKER_0:  In 1960, I just looked these data up, there were 40 million people in Pakistan. Today there are 225 million.

00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  and a big chunk of them are still rural. They live in the floodplain of the amazing Indus River.

00:14:59,714 --> 00:15:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  which comes down from the Himalayas.

00:15:01,858 --> 00:15:04,318
SPEAKER_0:  extraordinary 5,000 year history of.

00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  agriculture there, but when you put...

00:15:06,978 --> 00:15:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  200 million people.

00:15:08,802 --> 00:15:12,382
SPEAKER_0:  in harm's way. And this doesn't say anything about the bigger questions about.

00:15:13,026 --> 00:15:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, shame on Pakistan for having more people.

00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  It just says the reality is.

00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,974
SPEAKER_0:  the losses that we see.

00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:19,870
SPEAKER_0:  in the news.

00:15:20,738 --> 00:15:21,182
SPEAKER_0:  ARR

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  And the science finds this even though there's a new weather attribution group.

00:15:25,986 --> 00:15:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  It's WXRisk on Twitter.

00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,462
SPEAKER_0:  This does pretty good work on...

00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  How much of what just happened was some tweak in the storm from global warming, from CO2 changing weather?

00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  And the media glom onto that.

00:15:42,434 --> 00:15:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  as I did in the 80s, 90s.

00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:45,918
SPEAKER_0:  2000s.

00:15:47,074 --> 00:15:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  But the reports also have a section on, by the way.

00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:55,070
SPEAKER_0:  The vulnerability that was built in this region was a big driver of loss.

00:15:55,618 --> 00:15:57,790
SPEAKER_0:  So discriminating between loss.

00:15:59,394 --> 00:16:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  Change in.

00:16:01,218 --> 00:16:02,590
SPEAKER_0:  What's happening on the ground?

00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  and change in the climate system.

00:16:05,186 --> 00:16:06,846
SPEAKER_0:  is never solely about CO2.

00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  In fact.

00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:09,406
SPEAKER_0:  Lawrence Bauer.

00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  B-O-U-W-E-R.

00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:14,238
SPEAKER_0:  has.

00:16:14,626 --> 00:16:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  I first wrote on his work in 2010 in the New York Times. And basically...

00:16:18,274 --> 00:16:21,630
SPEAKER_0:  In 2010, there was no sign in the data of climate change.

00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  driving disasters.

00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  Climate change is up here. Disasters are on the ground. They depend on how many people are in the way.

00:16:29,218 --> 00:16:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  how much stuff you've built in the way.

00:16:31,138 --> 00:16:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  And so far, we've done so much of that so fast in the 20th century particularly.

00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  that it completely dominates, it makes it hard, impossible to discriminate how much of that disaster.

00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  was from the

00:16:43,714 --> 00:16:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  Change in.

00:16:45,858 --> 00:16:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  weather.

00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  from Global Warming.

00:16:48,194 --> 00:16:49,438
SPEAKER_1:  So a function of...

00:16:50,178 --> 00:16:50,686
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:16:50,946 --> 00:16:52,606
SPEAKER_1:  greenhouse gases.

00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  to human suffering.

00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:56,839
SPEAKER_1:  is a-

00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  That's very much in our control.

00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  Theoretically.

00:17:01,506 --> 00:17:07,838
SPEAKER_1:  The point I think is exactly right that if you look at the Hurricane Ian that went through Florida.

00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,966
SPEAKER_1:  You have a situation where Florida went from what 600,000 houses.

00:17:12,194 --> 00:17:13,886
SPEAKER_1:  in 1940.

00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:15,358
SPEAKER_1:  to seven.

00:17:15,746 --> 00:17:17,214
SPEAKER_1:  13 million houses.

00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,926
SPEAKER_1:  Sorry, 10 million houses, so 17 times more.

00:17:21,602 --> 00:17:23,902
SPEAKER_1:  over a period of 80 years.

00:17:24,258 --> 00:17:33,118
SPEAKER_1:  Of course you're gonna have, what? Yeah, yeah. You're gonna have lots more damage. And many of these houses now have been built on places where you probably shouldn't be building.

00:17:33,506 --> 00:17:40,990
SPEAKER_1:  And so I think a lot of scientists are very focused on saying, can we measure whether global warming had an impact?

00:17:41,442 --> 00:17:44,222
SPEAKER_1:  Which is an interesting science question. I think it's.

00:17:44,514 --> 00:17:44,830
SPEAKER_1:  It's.

00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:48,670
SPEAKER_1:  very implausible that eventually we won't be able to say it has an impact.

00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:54,750
SPEAKER_1:  But the real question, it seems to me, is if we actually wanna make sure that people are less harmed in the future.

00:17:55,874 --> 00:18:09,054
SPEAKER_1:  what are the levers that we can control? And it turns out that the CO2 lever doing something about climate is an incredibly difficult and slightly inefficient way of trying to help these people in the future. Whereas, of course,

00:18:09,442 --> 00:18:10,046
SPEAKER_1:  Soning?

00:18:10,274 --> 00:18:21,073
SPEAKER_1:  making sure that you have better housing rules, what is it, regulations, that you maybe don't have people building the flash flood?

00:18:21,073 --> 00:18:23,323
SPEAKER_0:  Flat Alley. Flat Flat Alley. IoT.

00:18:23,323 --> 00:18:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  It's just simple stuff. And because we're so focused on this one issue,

00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:45,694
SPEAKER_1:  We sort of, it almost feels sacrilegious to talk about these other things that are much more in our power and that we can do something about much quicker and that would help a lot more people. So I think this is gonna be a large part of the whole conversation. Yes, climate is a problem.

00:18:45,922 --> 00:18:54,558
SPEAKER_1:  But it's not the only problem. And there are many other things where we can actually have a much, much bigger impact at much lower cost. Maybe we should also remember those. Can you?

00:18:55,106 --> 00:18:56,830
SPEAKER_1:  Steel Man the Case

00:18:57,634 --> 00:18:58,558
SPEAKER_1:  of Greta.

00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,790
SPEAKER_1:  who's a representative of

00:19:02,178 --> 00:19:03,006
SPEAKER_1:  Alarmism.

00:19:04,194 --> 00:19:11,518
SPEAKER_1:  that we need that kind of level of alarmism for people to pay attention and to think about climate change.

00:19:11,906 --> 00:19:12,574
SPEAKER_1:  So you said.

00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:14,206
SPEAKER_1:  this singular view.

00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:15,678
SPEAKER_1:  uh

00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,878
SPEAKER_1:  is not the correct way to look at it.

00:19:19,202 --> 00:19:20,830
SPEAKER_1:  climate change, just the emissions.

00:19:21,506 --> 00:19:23,774
SPEAKER_1:  but for us to have a discussion.

00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,310
SPEAKER_1:  Shouldn't there be?

00:19:25,794 --> 00:19:26,910
SPEAKER_1:  somebody who's

00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,366
SPEAKER_1:  really raising the concern.

00:19:30,914 --> 00:19:34,078
SPEAKER_1:  Can you still man the case for alarmism, essentially?

00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:36,446
SPEAKER_1:  Is there a better term than alarmism?

00:19:36,898 --> 00:19:37,246
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,678
SPEAKER_1:  communication.

00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,918
SPEAKER_1:  of like holy shit.

00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,414
SPEAKER_1:  We should be thinking about this.

00:19:44,802 --> 00:19:56,382
SPEAKER_1:  So I think, I totally understand why Greta Thunberg is doing what she's doing. I have great respect for her because if, I look at a lot of kids growing up and they're basically being told...

00:19:56,738 --> 00:20:01,214
SPEAKER_1:  You're not going to reach adulthood or at least not, you're not going to get very far into adulthood.

00:20:01,474 --> 00:20:08,542
SPEAKER_1:  And that, of course, you know, this is the meteor hurtling towards earth, and then this is the only thing we should be focusing on.

00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,718
SPEAKER_1:  I understand why she's making that argument.

00:20:10,978 --> 00:20:11,934
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's.

00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  At the end of the day it's...

00:20:13,794 --> 00:20:18,430
SPEAKER_1:  incorrect and I'm sure we'll get around to talking about that. And one of the things is of course

00:20:19,394 --> 00:20:20,638
SPEAKER_1:  her whole generation.

00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:34,814
SPEAKER_1:  I can understand why they're saying, if we're gonna be dead in 12 years, why would I wanna study? Why would I really care about anything? So I totally want to sort of pull Greta and many others out of this end of the world fear.

00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,958
SPEAKER_1:  but I totally get why she's doing it.

00:20:37,218 --> 00:20:41,470
SPEAKER_1:  I think she's done a service in the sense that she's gotten more people to talk about climate.

00:20:41,762 --> 00:20:44,766
SPEAKER_1:  And that's good because we need to have this discussion.

00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:56,510
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's unfortunate and this is just what happens in almost all policy discussions that they end up being discussions from the extreme groups because it's just more fun on media.

00:20:56,802 --> 00:21:12,126
SPEAKER_1:  to have sort of the total deniers and the people who say, we're gonna die tomorrow. And it sort of becomes that discussion. It's more sort of a mud wrestling fight. So what do you think the mud wrestling fight is not useful or is useful for communication for?

00:21:12,514 --> 00:21:17,182
SPEAKER_1:  effective science communication on one of the platforms you're a fan of which is twitter

00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I wrote a piece recently on my sustain what column saying.

00:21:22,626 --> 00:21:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  If you go in there.

00:21:24,418 --> 00:21:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  for the entertainment value of seeing those.

00:21:27,426 --> 00:21:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  Knockdown fights.

00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,198
SPEAKER_0:  I guess that's useful if that's what you're looking for.

00:21:31,906 --> 00:21:33,982
SPEAKER_0:  the thing I found Twitter invaluable for.

00:21:35,554 --> 00:21:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  but it's a practice.

00:21:37,282 --> 00:21:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  It's just like.

00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  the workouts you do or, you know.

00:21:40,898 --> 00:21:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  It's.

00:21:41,538 --> 00:21:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  How do I put this tool to use today? Thinking about energy.

00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  action in poor communities. How do I put this tool today?

00:21:51,138 --> 00:21:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  learning about what really happened with E and the hurricane.

00:21:54,402 --> 00:21:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  who was most at risk.

00:21:56,674 --> 00:21:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  and how would you build that?

00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,318
SPEAKER_0:  I hit build forward better, I hit build back.

00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:22:01,474 --> 00:22:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  Or you can go there and just.

00:22:02,914 --> 00:22:05,118
SPEAKER_0:  Watch it as an entertainment value.

00:22:05,346 --> 00:22:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  not going to get the world anywhere.

00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:07,774
SPEAKER_1:  You don't think.

00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,566
SPEAKER_1:  entertainment.

00:22:10,178 --> 00:22:12,158
SPEAKER_1:  I wouldn't call it entertainment, but.

00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:16,414
SPEAKER_1:  giving voice to the extremes isn't a productive way forward.

00:22:16,706 --> 00:22:17,630
SPEAKER_1:  It seems to...

00:22:18,402 --> 00:22:23,454
SPEAKER_1:  You know, to push back against the main narrative, it seems to work pretty well in the American system. We think.

00:22:24,194 --> 00:22:28,798
SPEAKER_1:  Politics is totally broken, but maybe that works, that oscillation back and forth.

00:22:29,218 --> 00:22:33,982
SPEAKER_1:  You need a grader and you need somebody that pushes back against a grader to get everybody's.

00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:35,998
SPEAKER_1:  to uh...

00:22:36,418 --> 00:22:37,662
SPEAKER_1:  to get everybody's attention.

00:22:38,146 --> 00:22:39,582
SPEAKER_1:  the fun of battle.

00:22:40,322 --> 00:22:41,694
SPEAKER_1:  Over time.

00:22:42,786 --> 00:22:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  Well, and this gets to the point.

00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

00:22:46,178 --> 00:22:50,078
SPEAKER_0:  People who focus on communication science, I'm not a scientist, I write about this stuff.

00:22:51,362 --> 00:22:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  if you're going to try to pride someone.

00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,366
SPEAKER_0:  with a warning.

00:22:54,722 --> 00:22:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  Like...

00:22:56,258 --> 00:22:57,342
SPEAKER_0:  This is three years apart.

00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,526
SPEAKER_0:  Nuclear winner!

00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  Nuclear winter, we'll talk about that. Global warming, well yeah, we'll talk about it. But look at that, this is three years apart in the covers of the magazine. Yeah. But then you have to save to what end? If you're not.

00:23:09,986 --> 00:23:12,606
SPEAKER_0:  directing people to a basket of things to do.

00:23:13,154 --> 00:23:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  And if you want political change, then it would be to support a politician.

00:23:18,018 --> 00:23:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  If you want energy access, it would be to.

00:23:20,674 --> 00:23:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  Look at this $370 billion, the American.

00:23:25,282 --> 00:23:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  government just put into play on climate and say, well, how can my community benefit from that?

00:23:30,114 --> 00:23:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  and I've been told over and over again by people in government.

00:23:33,634 --> 00:23:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  Jigar Shah who heads this

00:23:35,266 --> 00:23:37,150
SPEAKER_0:  giant loan program in the Energy Department.

00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  He says, what I need now is like 19,500.

00:23:40,322 --> 00:23:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  people who are worried about climate change.

00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe because Greta.

00:23:44,226 --> 00:23:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  Cut the mortgage.

00:23:45,922 --> 00:23:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  But here's the thing you could do. You can connect your local government right now with these multimillion dollar loans so you can have electric buses instead of diesel buses.

00:23:53,794 --> 00:23:55,070
SPEAKER_0:  And that's an action pathway.

00:23:56,386 --> 00:23:56,958
SPEAKER_0:  So without.

00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,646
SPEAKER_0:  So, you know, alarm for the sake of.

00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  getting attention or clicks.

00:24:02,754 --> 00:24:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  to me is not any more valuable than.

00:24:05,506 --> 00:24:07,006
SPEAKER_0:  watching an action movie.

00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:14,590
SPEAKER_1:  And again, I think also it very easily ends up sort of skewing our conversation about what are the actual solutions.

00:24:14,914 --> 00:24:23,550
SPEAKER_1:  Because, yes, it's great to get rid of the diesel bus, but probably not for the reason people think. It's because diesel buses are really polluting.

00:24:23,842 --> 00:24:26,142
SPEAKER_1:  in the air pollution sense.

00:24:26,402 --> 00:24:38,238
SPEAKER_1:  Right. And that is why you should get rid of them. Uh, and again, if you really want it to help people, for instance, with hurricanes, you should have better, you know, uh, rules and zoning in Florida.

00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,574
SPEAKER_1:  which is a very different outcome.

00:24:41,058 --> 00:24:46,718
SPEAKER_1:  The mud wrestling fight also gets our attention diverted towards solutions.

00:24:46,946 --> 00:24:47,966
SPEAKER_1:  that seem.

00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:55,070
SPEAKER_1:  Easy, fun, you know, sort of the electric car is a great example of this. The electric car somehow become almost.

00:24:55,906 --> 00:25:00,382
SPEAKER_1:  sign that I care and I'm really going to do something about climate. Of course.

00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:06,462
SPEAKER_1:  Electric cars are great and they're probably part of the solution and they will actually cut carbon emissions somewhat.

00:25:06,882 --> 00:25:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  but they're an incredibly ineffective way of cutting carbon emissions right now. They're fairly expensive, you have to subsidize them a lot, and they still emit quite a bit of CO2, both because the batteries get produced and because they usually run off of power that's not totally clean. Strong words from your love, okay, let's go there. Let's go electric cars, educate us.

00:25:27,586 --> 00:25:33,342
SPEAKER_1:  on the pros and cons of electric cars in this complex picture of climate change.

00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,998
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think of the efforts of Tesla and Elon Musk?

00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:40,446
SPEAKER_1:  on pushing forward the electric car revolution.

00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:41,246
SPEAKER_1:  So look.

00:25:41,602 --> 00:26:00,350
SPEAKER_1:  Electric cars are great. I don't own a car, but I've been driving a Tesla. There you go, socially signaling. Yeah. But yeah, I've- We're in Texas. Well, I flew in here, so it's not like I'm in any way a virtuous guy on that path. But look, they're great cars.

00:26:00,578 --> 00:26:04,254
SPEAKER_1:  and eventually electric cars will take over a significant part.

00:26:04,674 --> 00:26:06,878
SPEAKER_1:  of our driving and that's it.

00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:14,526
SPEAKER_1:  good because they're more effective, they're probably also going to be cheaper. There's a lot of good opportunities with them.

00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,406
SPEAKER_1:  but it's because they've become reified as this.

00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:20,798
SPEAKER_1:  thing that you do to fix climate. And right now.

00:26:21,026 --> 00:26:21,918
SPEAKER_1:  They're not really.

00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:26,398
SPEAKER_1:  all that great for climate. They you need a lot of.

00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:32,670
SPEAKER_1:  extra material into the batteries, which is very polluting and it's also, it emits a lot of CO2.

00:26:32,898 --> 00:26:36,574
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of electric cars are bought as second cars in the US.

00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:43,518
SPEAKER_1:  So we used to think that they were driven almost as much as a regular car. It turns out that they're more likely driven.

00:26:43,778 --> 00:26:50,206
SPEAKER_1:  Less than half as much as a regular cars. So, you know, 89% of all Americans who have an electric car.

00:26:50,498 --> 00:26:51,230
SPEAKER_1:  Also, however.

00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:57,758
SPEAKER_1:  real car that they use for the long trips. And then they use the electric car for a short trip. 89%. 89, yeah.

00:26:58,082 --> 00:26:59,710
SPEAKER_1:  So the point here is...

00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:05,758
SPEAKER_1:  that it's one of these things that become more sort of a virtuous signal and thing. And, again...

00:27:06,818 --> 00:27:12,222
SPEAKER_1:  Once electric cars are sufficiently cheap that people will want to buy them. That's great. And they will.

00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:14,206
SPEAKER_1:  Do some good for the environment.

00:27:14,562 --> 00:27:35,454
SPEAKER_1:  But in reality, what we should be focusing on is instead of getting people electric cars in rich countries, because we're subsidizing typically in many countries, you actually get a sort of sliding scale. You get more subsidy the more expensive it is. We sort of subsidize this to very rich people to buy very large Teslas.

00:27:35,778 --> 00:27:37,022
SPEAKER_1:  uh, to drive around in?

00:27:37,314 --> 00:27:44,382
SPEAKER_1:  Whereas what we should be focusing on is perhaps getting electric motorcycles in third world developing cities

00:27:44,866 --> 00:27:46,814
SPEAKER_1:  where they would do a lot more good.

00:27:47,106 --> 00:28:03,806
SPEAKER_1:  They can actually go as far as you need. There's no worry about running out of them. And they would obviously, they're much, much more polluting, just air pollution wise. And they're much cheaper and they use very little battery. So it's about getting our senses right. But the electric car is not.

00:28:04,034 --> 00:28:04,382
SPEAKER_1:  the cons.

00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:25,662
SPEAKER_1:  It's not a conversation about is it technically really good or is it a somewhat good insight. It's more like it's a virtual signal. So just, I work with economists. I'm actually not an economist, but I like to say I claim I kind of am. But the fundamental point is we would say, well, how much does it cost to cut a ton of CO2?

00:28:26,018 --> 00:28:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  And the answer is for most electric cars.

00:28:28,418 --> 00:28:39,326
SPEAKER_1:  We're paying in the order of a thousand, 2,000. Norway, they pay up to $5,000 or thereabouts. Huge amount for one ton of CO2.

00:28:39,778 --> 00:28:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  You can right now cut a ton of CO2 for about what is it $14 on the Reggie or something?

00:28:45,634 --> 00:28:46,759
SPEAKER_1:  You can read it.

00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,259
SPEAKER_0:  That's the regional greenhouse gas.

00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:53,022
SPEAKER_1:  So you can basically cut it really really cheaply. Why would we not want to cut?

00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:56,318
SPEAKER_1:  Dozens and dozens of tons of CO2 for the same price.

00:28:56,674 --> 00:29:02,782
SPEAKER_1:  Instead of just cutting one ton and the simple answers, we only do that because we're so focused on the electric. Momentureup,

00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:07,975
SPEAKER_1:  typical European, come here in Texas, Tomcat can't have my Ford F-150.

00:29:07,975 --> 00:29:14,197
SPEAKER_0:  But now you can have your F-150 Lightning. That's true. That's true. I'm just joking. Yes.

00:29:14,197 --> 00:29:18,142
SPEAKER_1:  But what do you think about electric cars? If you could just link on that moment and-

00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:22,302
SPEAKER_1:  this particular element of helping reduce.

00:29:22,562 --> 00:29:22,878
SPEAKER_1:  uh

00:29:23,746 --> 00:29:27,358
SPEAKER_0:  Well, you talked about the middle in the beginning and you know.

00:29:27,842 --> 00:29:35,390
SPEAKER_0:  I loved moving through the hybrid. The Prius was fantastic. It did everything our other sedan did, but it was 60 miles per gallon.

00:29:35,938 --> 00:29:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  performance and

00:29:37,538 --> 00:29:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  you don't have range anxiety because it has a regular engine too.

00:29:42,274 --> 00:29:46,174
SPEAKER_0:  We still have a Prius. We also inherited my dad, dear dads.

00:29:46,402 --> 00:29:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  year 2000 Toyota Sienna, which is an old.

00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,006
SPEAKER_0:  100,000 mile.

00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  Minivan.

00:29:53,218 --> 00:29:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  And we use it all the time to do the stuff we can't do in the.

00:29:56,674 --> 00:29:58,078
SPEAKER_0:  in the Prius. like what wine

00:29:58,626 --> 00:30:00,501
SPEAKER_0:  taking stuff to the dump. all I mean

00:30:00,501 --> 00:30:01,251
SPEAKER_1:  in terms of the size.

00:30:01,251 --> 00:30:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  the vehicle. Yeah, size and just convenience factor for a bigger vehicle.

00:30:06,786 --> 00:30:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  I would love to feel fully electrified.

00:30:10,626 --> 00:30:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  transportation world is kind of exciting.

00:30:13,698 --> 00:30:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  I think what Elon did with Tesla, I remember way, way back in the day when the first models were coming out, it was very slick Ferrari style.

00:30:22,306 --> 00:30:25,726
SPEAKER_0:  cars and I thought this is cool and you know there's a history of

00:30:26,082 --> 00:30:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  privileged markets testing new technologies. And I'm all for that.

00:30:31,202 --> 00:30:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's done a huge service prodding.

00:30:34,178 --> 00:30:35,838
SPEAKER_0:  so much more R&D.

00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  And once GM and Ford started to realize, oh my God.

00:30:40,642 --> 00:30:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  This is a real phenomenon, you know, getting them in the game.

00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  There was that.

00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  documentary.

00:30:46,146 --> 00:30:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  who killed the electric car.

00:30:47,938 --> 00:30:49,342
SPEAKER_0:  which seem to imply that.

00:30:49,858 --> 00:30:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  You know, there's...

00:30:51,554 --> 00:30:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  there were fights to keep this tamped down.

00:30:54,114 --> 00:30:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  And it's...

00:30:55,074 --> 00:30:57,406
SPEAKER_0:  It's fundamentally cleaner, fundamentally better. If

00:30:58,242 --> 00:31:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  But then you have to manage these bigger questions.

00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  We're going to do a build out here.

00:31:03,042 --> 00:31:03,582
SPEAKER_0:  How do you make it?

00:31:03,938 --> 00:31:04,350
SPEAKER_0:  Fair.

00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  as you were saying, who actually uses transport cars?

00:31:08,642 --> 00:31:12,766
SPEAKER_0:  And Jagir Shah, that guy at the energy department I mentioned, who has all this money to give out.

00:31:13,474 --> 00:31:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  He wants to give loans to...

00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,814
SPEAKER_0:  if you had an Uber fleet.

00:31:19,618 --> 00:31:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  Those Uber drivers, they're the ones who need.

00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  electric cars.

00:31:23,714 --> 00:31:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  as his work and there was a recent story in Grist also.

00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:33,662
SPEAKER_0:  said that most of the sales of Teslas are the high end of the market. They're 60, $80,000 vehicles.

00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  Each year, like.

00:31:35,586 --> 00:31:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  The hummer, the electric hummer, I can't, there was a.

00:31:38,402 --> 00:31:39,230
SPEAKER_0:  Data point on that.

00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  astonishing data point, the battery in that Hummer.

00:31:43,554 --> 00:31:44,574
SPEAKER_0:  weighs more than

00:31:45,986 --> 00:31:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  I'd have to look it up.

00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  It weighs more than your car. Yeah, I think it might've been the Prius. And think of the material costs there. Think of where that battery, the Cobalt and the lithium, where does this stuff come from?

00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:58,558
SPEAKER_0:  build this stuff out.

00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  I'm all for it, but.

00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,494
SPEAKER_0:  We have to be honest and clear about.

00:32:03,106 --> 00:32:04,574
SPEAKER_0:  That's a new resource rush.

00:32:04,994 --> 00:32:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  like the oil rush back in the early 20th century.

00:32:08,002 --> 00:32:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  And those impacts have to be figured out too.

00:32:10,466 --> 00:32:12,254
SPEAKER_0:  and if they're all big hummers.

00:32:12,578 --> 00:32:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  for rich people.

00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  There's so many contrary arguments to that, I think we have to figure out a way.

00:32:18,818 --> 00:32:19,230
SPEAKER_0:  Oui.

00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,542
SPEAKER_0:  I don't like the word we.

00:32:21,058 --> 00:32:22,334
SPEAKER_0:  I use it too much, we all do.

00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,565
SPEAKER_0:  but we all do.

00:32:24,565 --> 00:32:26,065
SPEAKER_1:  refer when you say we we human

00:32:26,065 --> 00:32:28,414
SPEAKER_0:  We, society, we, government, yeah.

00:32:28,802 --> 00:32:29,630
SPEAKER_0:  There has to be some.

00:32:30,306 --> 00:32:35,550
SPEAKER_0:  thought and attention put to where you put these incentives so that you get the best use of this technology for

00:32:36,194 --> 00:32:36,670
SPEAKER_0:

00:32:36,898 --> 00:32:40,318
SPEAKER_0:  for the carbon benefit for the conventional sooty pollution benefit.

00:32:41,122 --> 00:32:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  for the transportation benefit.

00:32:42,882 --> 00:32:44,007
SPEAKER_0:  Can I sub?

00:32:44,007 --> 00:32:46,750
SPEAKER_1:  back and ask a sort of big question. We'll mention economics.

00:32:47,394 --> 00:32:48,190
SPEAKER_1:  Journalism.

00:32:48,962 --> 00:32:49,310
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:32:51,074 --> 00:32:54,430
SPEAKER_1:  How does an economist and a climate scientist and a journalist...

00:32:54,658 --> 00:33:01,598
SPEAKER_1:  that writes about climate, see the world differently. What are the strengths and potential blind spots of each discipline?

00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:03,294
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, that's just sort of...

00:33:03,554 --> 00:33:04,670
SPEAKER_1:  just so people...

00:33:05,538 --> 00:33:06,814
SPEAKER_1:  may be aware, I think.

00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:09,982
SPEAKER_1:  You gonna fall into the economics camp a bit?

00:33:10,242 --> 00:33:11,774
SPEAKER_1:  There's climate scientists.

00:33:12,098 --> 00:33:13,470
SPEAKER_1:  And there's climate scientists.

00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:14,366
SPEAKER_1:  adjacent

00:33:14,594 --> 00:33:22,878
SPEAKER_1:  people like who hang some of my best friends are climate scientists kind of which is I think where you fall in because you're a journalist. You've been writing it so you're not.

00:33:23,362 --> 00:33:24,670
SPEAKER_1:  completely

00:33:24,994 --> 00:33:25,726
SPEAKER_1:  in

00:33:26,018 --> 00:33:31,006
SPEAKER_1:  the trenches of doing the work, you're just stepping into the trenches every once in a while.

00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:34,398
SPEAKER_1:  So can you speak to that maybe Bjorn like what's?

00:33:34,818 --> 00:33:36,958
SPEAKER_1:  What does the world look like to an economist?

00:33:37,922 --> 00:33:49,918
SPEAKER_1:  Let's try to empathize with these beings that, you know. Unfortunately has fallen into the disreputable economics. So I think the main point that...

00:33:50,146 --> 00:33:54,398
SPEAKER_1:  that I've been trying for a long time. And I think that's also a little bit what Andy has been talking about.

00:33:54,722 --> 00:34:00,798
SPEAKER_1:  For a very long time, the whole conversation was about what does the science tell us? Is global warming real?

00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:03,390
SPEAKER_1:  And to me, it's much more.

00:34:03,778 --> 00:34:05,374
SPEAKER_1:  What can we actually do?

00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:06,654
SPEAKER_1:  What are the?

00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,318
SPEAKER_1:  policies that we can take.

00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:15,742
SPEAKER_1:  and how effective are they going to be? So the conversation we just had about electric cars is a good example of how an economist think about

00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:27,006
SPEAKER_1:  You gotta, this is not a question about whether you feel morally virtuous or whether you can sort of display how much you care about the environment. This is about how much you actually ended up.

00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:28,510
SPEAKER_1:  affecting the world.

00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:33,022
SPEAKER_1:  And the honest answer is that electric cars right now are just more sub colony of both cars, not the driving ones.

00:34:33,314 --> 00:34:34,334
SPEAKER_1:  decade or so.

00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:50,238
SPEAKER_1:  will have a fairly small impact. And unfortunately right now at a very high cost because we're basically subsidizing these things at five or $10,000 around the world per car. That's just not, it's not really sustainable, but it's certainly not a very great way to cut carbon emissions.

00:34:50,466 --> 00:34:53,662
SPEAKER_1:  So I would be the kind of guy and economist would be the...

00:34:54,146 --> 00:34:58,590
SPEAKER_1:  types of people who would say, is there a smarter way where you for less money.

00:34:59,202 --> 00:35:01,662
SPEAKER_1:  can cut more CO2 and the

00:35:01,954 --> 00:35:03,710
SPEAKER_1:  Obvious answer is yes.

00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:06,398
SPEAKER_1:  That's what we've seen, for instance, with fracking.

00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:10,046
SPEAKER_1:  The fact that the US went from a lot of coal

00:35:10,434 --> 00:35:13,022
SPEAKER_1:  a lot of gas because gas became incredibly cheap.

00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:19,678
SPEAKER_1:  because gas emits about half as much as coal does when you use it for power.

00:35:20,066 --> 00:35:24,382
SPEAKER_1:  that basically cut more carbon emissions than pretty much any other single thing.

00:35:24,802 --> 00:35:29,982
SPEAKER_1:  And we should get the rest of the world in some sense to frack because it's really cheap.

00:35:30,594 --> 00:35:36,638
SPEAKER_1:  There are some problems and absolutely we can also have that conversation. No technology is problem free.

00:35:36,898 --> 00:35:39,486
SPEAKER_1:  but fundamentally it's an incredibly cheap way.

00:35:39,874 --> 00:35:40,286
SPEAKER_1:  to get.

00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:42,270
SPEAKER_1:  people to cut a lot of CO2.

00:35:42,498 --> 00:35:47,646
SPEAKER_1:  It's not the final solution because it's still a fossil fuel, but it's a much better fossil fuel, if you will.

00:35:48,034 --> 00:35:50,142
SPEAKER_1:  And it's much more realistic to do that.

00:35:50,370 --> 00:36:06,814
SPEAKER_1:  So that's one part of the thing. The other one is when we talked about, for instance, how do we help people in Florida who gets hit by a hurricane, or how do we help people that get damaged in flash floods, or people who are in heat waves, and the symbol.

00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:12,222
SPEAKER_1:  The simple answer is there's a lot of very, very cheap and effective things that we could do first.

00:36:12,482 --> 00:36:14,942
SPEAKER_1:  So most climate people will tend to sort of say.

00:36:15,394 --> 00:36:22,750
SPEAKER_1:  We got to get rid of all carbon emissions. We got to change our entire, the engine that sort of.

00:36:22,978 --> 00:36:25,534
SPEAKER_1:  powers the world and has powered us for the last 200 years.

00:36:26,082 --> 00:36:30,270
SPEAKER_1:  And that's all good and well, but it's really, really hard to do. And it's probably not going to do very much.

00:36:30,498 --> 00:36:32,798
SPEAKER_1:  And even if you succeed it, it would only help.

00:36:33,122 --> 00:36:35,486
SPEAKER_1:  future victims of future hurricanes.

00:36:35,714 --> 00:36:38,110
SPEAKER_1:  in Florida a tiny, tiny bit at best.

00:36:38,402 --> 00:36:38,814
SPEAKER_1:  So...

00:36:39,074 --> 00:37:01,886
SPEAKER_1:  Instead, let's try to focus on not getting people to build right on the waterfront where you're incredibly vulnerable and where you're very likely to get hit where we subsidize people with federal insurance again, which is actually losing money. So we're much more about saying, it's not a science question. I just take the science for granted. Yes, there is a problem with climate change, but it's much more about saying.

00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:05,694
SPEAKER_1:  How can we make smart decisions? I can ask you about blind spots.

00:37:06,114 --> 00:37:09,150
SPEAKER_1:  When you reduce stuff to numbers, the cost and benefits.

00:37:09,858 --> 00:37:11,710
SPEAKER_1:  Is there stuff you might miss?

00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,118
SPEAKER_1:  about

00:37:13,346 --> 00:37:16,670
SPEAKER_1:  that are important to the flourishing of the human species.

00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  Everyone will have to say, of course there must be blind spots.

00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:36,094
SPEAKER_1:  but I don't know what they are. Yeah, I'm sure Andy would probably be better at telling me what they are. So we try to incorporate all of it, but obviously we're not successful. You can't incorporate everything, for instance, in the cost benefit analysis.

00:37:36,738 --> 00:37:38,750
SPEAKER_1:  But the point is in some way.

00:37:39,618 --> 00:37:42,974
SPEAKER_1:  I would worry a lot about this if we were, you know, sort of.

00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:57,150
SPEAKER_1:  close to perfection human race, we're doing almost everything right, but we're not quite right then we need to get the last digits right. But I think it's much more the point that I tried to make before that we're all focused on going-

00:37:57,378 --> 00:38:00,702
SPEAKER_1:  to an electric car or something else rather than.

00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:09,758
SPEAKER_1:  fracking, we're all focused on cutting carbon emissions instead of reducing vulnerability. So we're similarly getting orders of magnitude wrong.

00:38:10,082 --> 00:38:11,006
SPEAKER_1:  uh and and

00:38:11,426 --> 00:38:20,269
SPEAKER_1:  while I'm sure I have blind spots, I think they're probably not big enough to overturn that point. Andy, why is Bjorn and economists are all wrong about every-

00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:20,734
SPEAKER_0:  everything.

00:38:21,282 --> 00:38:23,550
SPEAKER_0:  Well, the models, we could spend.

00:38:23,842 --> 00:38:25,182
SPEAKER_0:  A whole day on models.

00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  There are economic models. There's this thing called optimization models.

00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  There were two big ones used to assess the.

00:38:32,578 --> 00:38:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  US plan, this new big

00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  IRA.

00:38:36,162 --> 00:38:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  inflation reduction package.

00:38:38,434 --> 00:38:38,942
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:42,238
SPEAKER_0:  they're fine. They're a starting point for understanding.

00:38:43,202 --> 00:38:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  what's possible, but as this gets to the journalism part or the public part

00:38:47,906 --> 00:38:50,046
SPEAKER_0:  You have to look at the caveats. You have to look at the caveats.

00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  What model?

00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  Economists expressly exclude.

00:38:54,018 --> 00:38:55,710
SPEAKER_0:  things that are not modelable.

00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:00,254
SPEAKER_0:  And if you look in the fine print on the repeat project, the Princeton.

00:39:00,514 --> 00:39:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  version of.

00:39:01,346 --> 00:39:02,718
SPEAKER_0:  the assessment of the recent.

00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:03,902
SPEAKER_0:  giant legislation.

00:39:05,378 --> 00:39:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  The fine print.

00:39:06,562 --> 00:39:07,902
SPEAKER_0:  is the front page.

00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:08,958
SPEAKER_0:  For me.

00:39:09,314 --> 00:39:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  is a deep diving journalist because it says.

00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  We didn't include any sources of friction.

00:39:16,418 --> 00:39:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  Meaning.

00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:21,214
SPEAKER_0:  resistance to putting new transmission lines through your community.

00:39:21,634 --> 00:39:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  or

00:39:22,498 --> 00:39:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  people.

00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  who don't want...

00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:25,694
SPEAKER_0:  Mining.

00:39:25,986 --> 00:39:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  in America.

00:39:26,946 --> 00:39:27,806
SPEAKER_0:  because we've...

00:39:28,226 --> 00:39:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  exported all of our mining. We mine our

00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:35,294
SPEAKER_0:  Cobalt and Congo, you know, and trying to get a new mine in Nevada.

00:39:37,026 --> 00:39:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  was a fraught fight that took more than 10 years for lithium.

00:39:40,514 --> 00:39:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,302
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:44,318
SPEAKER_0:  If you're excluding.

00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:48,062
SPEAKER_0:  those elements from your model, which on the surface.

00:39:48,866 --> 00:39:51,070
SPEAKER_0:  makes this $370 billion package.

00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,766
SPEAKER_0:  have an emissions reduction.

00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  trajectory that's really pretty good.

00:39:55,874 --> 00:39:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  And you're not saying in your first line, by the way, these are the things we're not considering.

00:40:00,962 --> 00:40:02,837
SPEAKER_0:  That's the job of a journalist.

00:40:02,837 --> 00:40:05,087
SPEAKER_1:  all of human history with that one.

00:40:05,087 --> 00:40:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  word friction.

00:40:06,658 --> 00:40:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, well inertia.

00:40:08,834 --> 00:40:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  Friction implies there's a force that's already being resisted.

00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:15,230
SPEAKER_0:  But there's also inertia, which is a huge part of our.

00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we have a status quo bias.

00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  the scientists that I.

00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  in grappling with the climate problem.

00:40:24,482 --> 00:40:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  As a journalist, I paid too much attention to climate scientists.

00:40:28,482 --> 00:40:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  That's why I wrote my articles.

00:40:30,082 --> 00:40:31,358
SPEAKER_0:  focused on climate change.

00:40:31,746 --> 00:40:33,982
SPEAKER_0:  And it was 2006, I remember.

00:40:34,274 --> 00:40:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  Now, pretty clearly...

00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:41,598
SPEAKER_0:  I was asked by the weekend review section of the New York Times to write a sort of a weekend thumb sucker, we call them.

00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  on, you know, you're sitting, you're sitting, suck your thumb and think about something.

00:40:46,594 --> 00:40:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  Why is everybody so pissed off about climate change? It was after Al Gore's movie, the Al Gore movie came out in Convened Truth, Hurricane Katrina.

00:40:53,666 --> 00:40:54,494
SPEAKER_0:  Senator Inhofe.

00:40:54,946 --> 00:40:57,598
SPEAKER_0:  in the Senate from Oklahoma wasn't yet throwing snowballs, but.

00:40:58,114 --> 00:41:03,070
SPEAKER_0:  It was close to that. And so I looked into what was going on. Why is this so heated?

00:41:03,426 --> 00:41:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  in 2006.

00:41:05,122 --> 00:41:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  The story is called Yelling Fire on Hot Planet.

00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  And.

00:41:08,898 --> 00:41:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  That was the first time, this is after 18 years of writing about global warming.

00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:15,390
SPEAKER_0:  That was the first time I interviewed a social scientist.

00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:16,574
SPEAKER_0:  not a climate scientist.

00:41:16,898 --> 00:41:17,950
SPEAKER_0:  Her name is Helen Ingram.

00:41:18,274 --> 00:41:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  She's at UC Irvine.

00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  and she...

00:41:21,826 --> 00:41:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  laid out for me the factors that.

00:41:24,834 --> 00:41:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  determine why people vote, what they vote for, what they think about politically.

00:41:29,122 --> 00:41:31,166
SPEAKER_0:  and they were the antithesis of the climate problem.

00:41:32,098 --> 00:41:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  to use the words.

00:41:33,058 --> 00:41:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  She said people.

00:41:34,498 --> 00:41:35,422
SPEAKER_0:  Go in the voting booth.

00:41:36,354 --> 00:41:37,854
SPEAKER_0:  thinking about things that are soon.

00:41:38,274 --> 00:41:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  salient.

00:41:39,394 --> 00:41:40,222
SPEAKER_0:  and certain.

00:41:41,058 --> 00:41:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  and climate change is complex, has long time scales.

00:41:44,578 --> 00:41:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:41:45,602 --> 00:41:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  That really jogged me and then I between 2006, 2010.

00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,278
SPEAKER_0:  I started interviewing other social scientists and I...

00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  This was by far the scariest.

00:41:55,682 --> 00:41:56,350
SPEAKER_0:  Science of all.

00:41:56,802 --> 00:41:58,686
SPEAKER_0:  It's the climate in our heads.

00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,606
SPEAKER_0:  or inconvenient minds.

00:42:01,314 --> 00:42:03,038
SPEAKER_0:  and in how that translates into.

00:42:03,394 --> 00:42:07,326
SPEAKER_0:  political norms and stuff really became the monster, not the climate system.

00:42:07,778 --> 00:42:08,903
SPEAKER_0:  Is there social dynamics?

00:42:08,903 --> 00:42:10,526
SPEAKER_1:  to the scientists themselves.

00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:11,742
SPEAKER_1:  because uh...

00:42:12,994 --> 00:42:14,942
SPEAKER_1:  I've gotten to witness a kind of...

00:42:15,874 --> 00:42:17,726
SPEAKER_1:  flocking behavior with scientists.

00:42:18,178 --> 00:42:20,830
SPEAKER_1:  So it's almost like a flock of birds within the flock.

00:42:21,698 --> 00:42:23,006
SPEAKER_1:  There's a lot of disagreement.

00:42:23,266 --> 00:42:24,382
SPEAKER_1:  and fun debates.

00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,526
SPEAKER_1:  and everybody trying to prove each other wrong.

00:42:26,818 --> 00:42:28,670
SPEAKER_1:  but they're all kinda headed in the same direction.

00:42:29,282 --> 00:42:36,350
SPEAKER_1:  and you don't want to be the bird that kind of leaves that flock. No. So like there's an idea of that science is a mechanism.

00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,238
SPEAKER_1:  will get us towards the truth.

00:42:38,594 --> 00:42:38,942
SPEAKER_1:  but...

00:42:39,426 --> 00:42:40,862
SPEAKER_1:  It'll definitely get us somewhere.

00:42:41,474 --> 00:42:42,206
SPEAKER_1:  but it could.

00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:44,670
SPEAKER_1:  be not the truth in the short term.

00:42:45,058 --> 00:42:47,902
SPEAKER_1:  In the long term, a bigger flock will come along.

00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:50,238
SPEAKER_1:  and it will get us to the truth, but there's a sense.

00:42:50,722 --> 00:42:53,566
SPEAKER_1:  that I don't know if there's a mechanism within science to like...

00:42:54,146 --> 00:42:58,846
SPEAKER_1:  Snap out of it if you're done the wrong track. Usually you get it right, but...

00:42:59,586 --> 00:43:02,211
SPEAKER_1:  Sometimes you don't, when you don't it's very.

00:43:02,211 --> 00:43:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  costly.

00:43:03,106 --> 00:43:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  And there's so many factors that line up to.

00:43:06,178 --> 00:43:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  perpetuate.

00:43:07,426 --> 00:43:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  that flocking behavior.

00:43:09,346 --> 00:43:11,166
SPEAKER_0:  One is media attention.

00:43:11,394 --> 00:43:11,934
SPEAKER_0:  comes in.

00:43:12,962 --> 00:43:14,782
SPEAKER_0:  The other is funding comes in.

00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:20,446
SPEAKER_0:  National Science Foundation or whatever, European foundations pour a huge amount of money into the first two things.

00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  related to climate.

00:43:22,402 --> 00:43:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  And so you're.

00:43:23,394 --> 00:43:25,534
SPEAKER_0:  And then your narrative in your head is...

00:43:26,434 --> 00:43:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  shaped by that aspect of the climate problem.

00:43:29,122 --> 00:43:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  that's in the spotlight.

00:43:30,626 --> 00:43:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  I started using this hashtag.

00:43:33,794 --> 00:43:35,934
SPEAKER_0:  years back, narrative capture.

00:43:36,226 --> 00:43:38,014
SPEAKER_0:  be wary of narrative capture?

00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  where you're...

00:43:40,002 --> 00:43:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  you're on a train and everyone's getting on the train.

00:43:42,978 --> 00:43:47,422
SPEAKER_0:  this is in the media too, not just science, and it becomes self-sustaining.

00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:48,510
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,998
SPEAKER_0:  and contrary indications are ignored or downplayed.

00:43:52,386 --> 00:43:56,990
SPEAKER_0:  No one does replication science because your career doesn't advance through.

00:43:57,282 --> 00:43:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  replicating someone else's work.

00:43:58,946 --> 00:44:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  So those contrary indications are.

00:44:01,602 --> 00:44:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  are not necessarily.

00:44:03,362 --> 00:44:04,574
SPEAKER_0:  you know, really dug in on.

00:44:05,058 --> 00:44:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  And this is for, this is way beyond climate. This is of many fields. As you said, you might've seen this in AI and it's really hard.

00:44:12,354 --> 00:44:12,862
SPEAKER_0:  See you.

00:44:13,378 --> 00:44:17,406
SPEAKER_0:  find it's another form of path dependency. The term I used.

00:44:17,762 --> 00:44:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  for.

00:44:18,914 --> 00:44:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  but breaking narrative capture.

00:44:20,738 --> 00:44:21,214
SPEAKER_0:  to me.

00:44:22,914 --> 00:44:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  for me has come mostly.

00:44:25,378 --> 00:44:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  from stepping back.

00:44:27,682 --> 00:44:31,646
SPEAKER_0:  and reminding myself of the basic principles of journalism. Journalisms.

00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  basic principles are useful for anybody.

00:44:35,042 --> 00:44:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  confronting a big enormous dynamic.

00:44:37,314 --> 00:44:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  complex thing is...

00:44:39,394 --> 00:44:40,478
SPEAKER_0:  to what where when why.

00:44:40,802 --> 00:44:42,238
SPEAKER_0:  just be really rigorous about.

00:44:42,818 --> 00:44:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  Not assuming.

00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:46,430
SPEAKER_0:  because there's a fire in Boulder.

00:44:46,914 --> 00:44:47,966
SPEAKER_0:  or

00:44:48,386 --> 00:44:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  a flood in Fort Myers, that climate, which is in your head because you're part of the climate team at the New York Times or whatever.

00:44:54,978 --> 00:44:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  is the front.

00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  is the foreground part of this problem.

00:44:59,106 --> 00:45:02,302
SPEAKER_1:  What's the psychological challenge of that?

00:45:02,946 --> 00:45:05,534
SPEAKER_1:  If you incorporate the fact that if you.

00:45:06,434 --> 00:45:08,350
SPEAKER_1:  try to step back and have nuance.

00:45:08,578 --> 00:45:10,046
SPEAKER_1:  you might get attacked by...

00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:11,454
SPEAKER_0:  the others in the flock.

00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:15,079
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, I was. Well, you've certainly been.

00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:16,414
SPEAKER_1:  you get attacked.

00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:18,302
SPEAKER_1:  continuously.

00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:19,998
SPEAKER_1:  from different sides.

00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:22,942
SPEAKER_1:  So let me just ask about that. How does that feel?

00:45:23,394 --> 00:45:26,238
SPEAKER_1:  and how do you continue thinking clearly.

00:45:27,618 --> 00:45:28,222
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:45:28,546 --> 00:45:32,702
SPEAKER_1:  continuously try to have humility and step back and not get defensive.

00:45:33,154 --> 00:45:34,494
SPEAKER_1:  in that on.

00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:35,806
SPEAKER_1:  as a communicator.

00:45:36,418 --> 00:45:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  I mean...

00:45:37,794 --> 00:45:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  There are other things happening at the same time, right? I'm now 35 years into them.

00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  almost 40 years into my journalism career.

00:45:44,098 --> 00:45:47,646
SPEAKER_0:  So I have some independence. I'm free from the obligations of-

00:45:48,738 --> 00:45:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  I don't really need my next paycheck. I live in Maine now in a house I love. I own it outright. It's a great privilege and honor.

00:45:55,522 --> 00:45:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  And.

00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  as the result of.

00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of hard work.

00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:02,718
SPEAKER_0:  And so I'm freer to think freely.

00:46:03,106 --> 00:46:07,390
SPEAKER_0:  and I know my colleagues in newsrooms when I was at the New York Times, in the newsroom.

00:46:08,162 --> 00:46:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  you become.

00:46:09,538 --> 00:46:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  captive to a narrative.

00:46:11,042 --> 00:46:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  just as you do.

00:46:12,258 --> 00:46:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  out in the world.

00:46:14,626 --> 00:46:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  The New York Times had a narrative about Saddam Hussein.

00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  drove us into.

00:46:21,026 --> 00:46:24,094
SPEAKER_0:  that war, the times sucked right into that.

00:46:24,738 --> 00:46:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  I'll perpetuate it.

00:46:26,498 --> 00:46:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  I think we're in a bit of a narrative.

00:46:28,578 --> 00:46:28,958
SPEAKER_0:  We.

00:46:29,538 --> 00:46:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  the media.

00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  My friends at the Times and others are on a train ride.

00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  on climate change depicting it in a certain way.

00:46:36,706 --> 00:46:37,342
SPEAKER_0:  that

00:46:37,986 --> 00:46:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  Really, I saw problems with how they handled the Joe Manchin.

00:46:41,634 --> 00:46:44,478
SPEAKER_0:  issue in America, the West Virginia senator.

00:46:45,314 --> 00:46:47,038
SPEAKER_0:  They really kind of piled on and.

00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:49,022
SPEAKER_0:  zoomed in on his investments.

00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  which is really important to do, but they never pulled back.

00:46:52,418 --> 00:46:53,502
SPEAKER_0:  and said, by the way, he's.

00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  rare species. He's a Democrat in West Virginia.

00:46:57,666 --> 00:47:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  and which seat would be otherwise occupied by a Republican. There'd be no talk of a climate deal or any of that stuff.

00:47:03,586 --> 00:47:04,158
SPEAKER_0:  without him.

00:47:04,546 --> 00:47:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  But once you're starting to frame a story in a certain way, you...

00:47:08,322 --> 00:47:09,022
SPEAKER_0:  carried along and

00:47:09,698 --> 00:47:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  As you said, sometimes it breaks and a new norm arrives.

00:47:14,722 --> 00:47:16,830
SPEAKER_0:  climate train is still kind of rushing forward.

00:47:17,314 --> 00:47:18,526
SPEAKER_0:  and missing.

00:47:19,554 --> 00:47:21,694
SPEAKER_0:  opportunity to cut it into its pieces.

00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:24,670
SPEAKER_0:  and say, well, what's really wrong with Florida?

00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  And it's for me when you ask you about how I handle the.

00:47:28,866 --> 00:47:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  slings and arrows and stuff.

00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  It's partially because I'm past.

00:47:33,346 --> 00:47:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  worrying about it too much.

00:47:35,778 --> 00:47:39,166
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it was pretty intense, 2009 Rush Limbaugh.

00:47:40,002 --> 00:47:43,582
SPEAKER_0:  suggested I kill myself on his radio show. It's a really great time. What was that about?

00:47:44,258 --> 00:47:44,926
SPEAKER_0:  I had

00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:47,934
SPEAKER_0:  Actually, this was a meeting in Washington.

00:47:48,578 --> 00:47:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  2009.

00:47:49,954 --> 00:47:51,614
SPEAKER_0:  on population at the Wilson Center.

00:47:52,546 --> 00:47:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  I couldn't be there. So actually this is pre-COVID, but I was zooming in or something like Skyping in.

00:47:57,762 --> 00:47:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  And I was talking about.

00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:02,558
SPEAKER_0:  in a playful way. I said, well, if you really want to worry about

00:48:03,234 --> 00:48:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  carbon.

00:48:04,258 --> 00:48:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  This is during the debate over.

00:48:06,658 --> 00:48:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  carbon tax.

00:48:07,938 --> 00:48:09,790
SPEAKER_0:  model for a bill in America.

00:48:10,882 --> 00:48:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  we should probably have a carbon tax for kids.

00:48:13,986 --> 00:48:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  because a bigger family in America is a big source of.

00:48:17,154 --> 00:48:19,678
SPEAKER_0:  more emissions. It was kind of a playful thought bubble.

00:48:20,258 --> 00:48:25,694
SPEAKER_0:  some right-wing blogger blogged about it, it got into Rush's pile of things to talk about.

00:48:26,402 --> 00:48:28,798
SPEAKER_0:  And the clip is really fun.

00:48:28,898 --> 00:48:30,558
SPEAKER_1:  awesome meetings, so.

00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:32,670
SPEAKER_1:  If humans...

00:48:33,186 --> 00:48:35,742
SPEAKER_1:  are bad for the environment.

00:48:36,194 --> 00:48:36,862
SPEAKER_1:  I reckon benefits will be built amongst different categories of strokes, but would provide an action-packed

00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:38,215
SPEAKER_1:  I can imagine

00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:42,078
SPEAKER_0:  That's amazing. He was very explicit. That's how you know you've made it. He said.

00:48:42,306 --> 00:48:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  Mr. Revkin of the New York, Andrew Revkin of the New York Times, if you really think that people are the worst thing that ever happened to.

00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  this planet. Why don't you just kill yourself and save the planet by dying?

00:48:51,522 --> 00:48:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  it was tough for you

00:48:53,122 --> 00:48:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  It was tough for my family. To me, it did generate some interesting calls and stuff in my...

00:48:58,178 --> 00:48:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  my voicemail.

00:48:59,554 --> 00:48:59,870
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:49:00,578 --> 00:49:02,814
SPEAKER_0:  But on the left I was also...

00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  undercut, Roger Pilkey Jr.

00:49:05,602 --> 00:49:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  prominent researcher of

00:49:07,554 --> 00:49:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  climate risk and climate policy, UC Boulder.

00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  was actively.

00:49:12,578 --> 00:49:14,494
SPEAKER_0:  his career track was.

00:49:15,106 --> 00:49:19,006
SPEAKER_0:  derailed purposefully by people who just thought his message was-

00:49:19,394 --> 00:49:19,870
SPEAKER_0:  too off.

00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  Off the path.

00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:23,262
SPEAKER_0:  when you, you know...

00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  Even.

00:49:25,538 --> 00:49:26,663
SPEAKER_0:  dealing with this for a very long time.

00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:36,414
SPEAKER_1:  So, I just want to get back to the science. I don't think the science get it so much wrong as it just becomes accepted.

00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:40,478
SPEAKER_1:  to make certain assumptions as you just said, we assume no friction.

00:49:40,802 --> 00:49:46,878
SPEAKER_1:  So there's a way that you kind of model the world that ends up being also a convenient message.

00:49:47,138 --> 00:49:54,142
SPEAKER_1:  in many ways and I think the main convenient message in climate and it's not surprising if you think about it.

00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:56,062
SPEAKER_1:  The main convenient message is.

00:49:56,482 --> 00:49:59,710
SPEAKER_1:  that the best way to do something about all the things that we call climate.

00:50:00,322 --> 00:50:01,374
SPEAKER_1:  is to cut CO2.

00:50:02,242 --> 00:50:14,206
SPEAKER_1:  And that turns out to only sometimes be true and with a lot of caveats. But that's sort of the message. And it takes a long time. Yes, it's really, really difficult to do in any meaningful sort of timeframe.

00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:17,214
SPEAKER_1:  And if you challenge that.

00:50:17,794 --> 00:50:29,886
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, you're outside the flock and you get attacked. I've always, so somebody told me once, I think it's true, they say at the Harvard Law School, if you have a good case, pound the case.

00:50:30,146 --> 00:50:32,190
SPEAKER_1:  If you have a bad case, pound the table.

00:50:32,802 --> 00:50:37,982
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, and so I've always felt that when people go after me, they're kind of pounding to table there, you know, they're

00:50:38,274 --> 00:50:44,542
SPEAKER_1:  literally screaming, I don't have a good case. I'm really annoyed with what you're saying. And so to me, that actually means.

00:50:44,898 --> 00:50:47,038
SPEAKER_1:  It's much more important to make this argument.

00:50:47,426 --> 00:50:49,374
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, sure. I mean, I would love-

00:50:49,666 --> 00:50:57,790
SPEAKER_1:  you know, everyone just saying, oh, that's a really good point. I'm going to use that. But, you know, uh, we're, we're stuck in a situation, certainly in a conversation where.

00:50:58,562 --> 00:51:02,398
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of people have invested a lot of time and energy on saying.

00:51:02,658 --> 00:51:05,310
SPEAKER_1:  We should cut carbon emissions. This is the way.

00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:09,758
SPEAKER_1:  to help humankind. And just be clear, I think we should cut carbon emissions as well.

00:51:10,082 --> 00:51:14,878
SPEAKER_1:  but we should also just be realistic about what we can achieve with that. and what are all the other things

00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:16,286
SPEAKER_1:  that we could also do.

00:51:16,578 --> 00:51:22,366
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, and it turns out that a lot of these other things are much cheaper, much more effective will help much more, much quicker.

00:51:22,658 --> 00:51:24,638
SPEAKER_1:  And so getting that point out.

00:51:25,058 --> 00:51:35,134
SPEAKER_1:  is just incredibly important for us to get it right. So in some sense, to make sure that we don't do another Iraq and we don't do another, you know.

00:51:35,586 --> 00:51:47,614
SPEAKER_1:  Lots of stupid decisions. I mean, this is one of the things mankind is very good at. And I guess I see my role and I think that's probably also how you see yourself is trying to, you know,

00:51:47,874 --> 00:51:49,854
SPEAKER_1:  Get everyone to do it slightly less wrong.

00:51:50,466 --> 00:51:55,582
SPEAKER_1:  So let me ask you about a deep psychological effect for you.

00:51:56,034 --> 00:51:58,014
SPEAKER_1:  There's also a drug of martyrdom.

00:51:58,722 --> 00:52:00,766
SPEAKER_1:  So whenever you stand against the flock.

00:52:02,658 --> 00:52:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  There's a... you wrote...

00:52:05,378 --> 00:52:08,158
SPEAKER_1:  A couple of really good books on the topic.

00:52:08,866 --> 00:52:10,750
SPEAKER_1:  their most recent false alarm.

00:52:11,874 --> 00:52:14,174
SPEAKER_1:  I stand as the holder of truth.

00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:17,662
SPEAKER_1:  that everybody who is alarmist is wrong.

00:52:18,146 --> 00:52:22,046
SPEAKER_1:  And here's just simple calm way to express the facts of the matter.

00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:25,886
SPEAKER_1:  and that's very compelling to a very large number of people.

00:52:26,562 --> 00:52:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  They want to make a martyr out of you.

00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:31,838
SPEAKER_1:  Is that, are you worried about your own mind?

00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:36,542
SPEAKER_1:  uh... being corrupted by that by enjoying

00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,558
SPEAKER_1:  standing against the crowd.

00:52:39,106 --> 00:52:50,526
SPEAKER_1:  No, no, no, there's very little, I guess I can see what you're saying sort of in a literary way or something. Yeah, so I'm being poetic here. Yeah, there's very little.

00:52:50,818 --> 00:52:59,902
SPEAKER_1:  or sort of usefulness in annoying a lot of people. Whenever I go to a party, for instance.

00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:03,102
SPEAKER_1:  I know that there's a good chance people are gonna be annoyed with me.

00:53:03,362 --> 00:53:11,486
SPEAKER_1:  And I would love that not to be the case. But what I try to do is, so I try to be very polite and sort of not.

00:53:11,714 --> 00:53:12,030
SPEAKER_1:  We are-

00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:16,702
SPEAKER_1:  push people's buttons unless they sort of actively say, so you're saying I'll-

00:53:17,186 --> 00:53:29,054
SPEAKER_1:  kind of stupid stuff on the climate, right? And then try to engage with them and say, well, what is it you're thinking about? And hopefully, you know, during that party, and then it ends up being a really bad party for me. But anyway, so I'll end up.

00:53:29,314 --> 00:53:32,702
SPEAKER_1:  Possibly convincing one person that I'm not totally stupid

00:53:32,962 --> 00:53:36,670
SPEAKER_1:  But no, I'm not playing the martyr and I'm not enjoying that.

00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  The... is that interesting?

00:53:39,746 --> 00:53:41,726
SPEAKER_0:  The, I mean, the, the, um.

00:53:42,114 --> 00:53:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  Martyr complexes all around the climate question. Michael Mann at the far end of the spectrum of

00:53:47,074 --> 00:53:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  Activism.

00:53:48,226 --> 00:53:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  from where Bjorn is, is a climate scientist who...

00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:54,462
SPEAKER_0:  was actively attacked by

00:53:54,818 --> 00:53:56,190
SPEAKER_0:  in Hoffman.

00:53:56,514 --> 00:53:58,398
SPEAKER_0:  West Virginia politicians.

00:53:59,138 --> 00:54:03,262
SPEAKER_0:  really abused in many ways. He had come up with a very prominent model of

00:54:04,098 --> 00:54:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  looking at long-term records of climate change.

00:54:06,466 --> 00:54:08,894
SPEAKER_0:  and got this hockey stick for temperature.

00:54:09,378 --> 00:54:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  He definitely sits there in a certain kind of.

00:54:13,634 --> 00:54:14,942
SPEAKER_0:  because of that.

00:54:15,394 --> 00:54:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  So it's not.

00:54:17,026 --> 00:54:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  Unique.

00:54:18,114 --> 00:54:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  any particular vantage point in the.

00:54:20,642 --> 00:54:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  the spectrum of sort of prominent people on the debate.

00:54:24,002 --> 00:54:27,806
SPEAKER_1:  Andrew, you co-wrote the book, The Human Planet, Earth at the Dawn.

00:54:28,194 --> 00:54:28,894
SPEAKER_1:  of the...

00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:30,142
SPEAKER_1:  Anthropocene.

00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:36,766
SPEAKER_1:  which is the new age when humans are actually having impact on the environment. Let me ask the question of.

00:54:36,994 --> 00:54:39,619
SPEAKER_1:  What do you find most beautiful and fascinating about?

00:54:39,619 --> 00:54:40,670
SPEAKER_0:  our planet Earth.

00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  It'd be cheap to say everything, but just walking here this morning under the bridge.

00:54:45,858 --> 00:54:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  uh... over the colorado river

00:54:48,002 --> 00:54:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  seeing the birds, knowing there's bat colonies, massive bat colonies around here that I got to visit a few years ago.

00:54:53,538 --> 00:54:54,846
SPEAKER_0:  I experienced one of those.

00:54:55,714 --> 00:54:57,214
SPEAKER_0:  Explosions.

00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,966
SPEAKER_0:  It's mind blowing.

00:55:00,226 --> 00:55:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  the

00:55:01,026 --> 00:55:01,342
SPEAKER_0:  I've.

00:55:01,794 --> 00:55:08,350
SPEAKER_0:  been really lucky as a journalist to have gone to the North Pole, to camp on the sea ice with Russian help.

00:55:08,898 --> 00:55:11,934
SPEAKER_0:  This is a camp that was set up for tourists coming from Europe every year.

00:55:12,418 --> 00:55:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  They were scientists.

00:55:13,378 --> 00:55:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  on the sea ice, floating on the 14,000 foot deep.

00:55:16,706 --> 00:55:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  Arctic Ocean.

00:55:18,018 --> 00:55:21,630
SPEAKER_0:  I was with them for several days. I wrote a book about that too along with my reporting.

00:55:22,498 --> 00:55:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  been in the depths of the Amazon.

00:55:24,002 --> 00:55:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  rainforests have been when I was very young.

00:55:27,426 --> 00:55:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  I was a crew on a sailboat that sailed two thirds of the way around the world.

00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:34,814
SPEAKER_0:  I was halfway across the Indian Ocean, again, and 14,000 foot deep.

00:55:35,362 --> 00:55:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  water, we were just, there was no wind.

00:55:38,338 --> 00:55:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  And we were, this was way before I was a journalist, 22, 23 years old.

00:55:42,818 --> 00:55:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  and we went swimming, swimming in 14,000 foot deep water.

00:55:46,978 --> 00:55:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  500 miles from land, the Western Indian Ocean, halfway between.

00:55:51,138 --> 00:55:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  Somalia and

00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  Maldives.

00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  Is it like so mind boggling, chillingly?

00:55:58,050 --> 00:55:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  fantastical thing.

00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  with a mask on looking at your shadow.

00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  going to the vanishing point below you, looking over at the boat, which is a 60 foot boat, but just looks like a toy.

00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  and then getting back on and being beholden to the elements, a sailboat heading toward.

00:56:13,378 --> 00:56:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  It's the immensity and the power of the elements. And then, you know, and then.

00:56:18,242 --> 00:56:18,814
SPEAKER_0:  The Human.

00:56:19,938 --> 00:56:22,526
SPEAKER_0:  qualities are unbelievable. You know, the Anthropocene.

00:56:23,874 --> 00:56:25,950
SPEAKER_0:  played a bit of a role as a journalist and.

00:56:26,818 --> 00:56:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  waking people up to the idea that this era called the Holocene in the last 11,000 years.

00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  you know, since the last Ice Age.

00:56:34,306 --> 00:56:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  had ended. I wrote.

00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:38,174
SPEAKER_0:  my 1992 book on global warming.

00:56:39,554 --> 00:56:41,726
SPEAKER_0:  Thinking about all that we're just talking about. Thinking about...

00:56:42,146 --> 00:56:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  the wonders of the planet, thinking about the impact of humans so far in our.

00:56:46,562 --> 00:56:49,342
SPEAKER_0:  explosive growth in the 20th century.

00:56:49,922 --> 00:56:52,510
SPEAKER_0:  I wrote that perhaps earth scientists of the future.

00:56:53,154 --> 00:56:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  We'll name this.

00:56:54,594 --> 00:56:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  post-holocene.

00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  era for its formative element for us.

00:57:00,962 --> 00:57:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  because we're kind of.

00:57:03,906 --> 00:57:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  in charge in certain ways, which is hubristic at the same time.

00:57:09,314 --> 00:57:09,630
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

00:57:10,338 --> 00:57:14,463
SPEAKER_0:  the variability of the climate system is still profound without global warming.

00:57:14,463 --> 00:57:17,630
SPEAKER_1:  powerful, beautiful organism that is Earth.

00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:25,566
SPEAKER_1:  the all the different sub-organisms that are on it. Do you see humans as a kind of parasite on this earth? No, no.

00:57:26,146 --> 00:57:26,814
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:57:27,202 --> 00:57:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  as something that helps the flourishing of the entire organism.

00:57:31,202 --> 00:57:32,030
SPEAKER_1:  that can.

00:57:32,386 --> 00:57:32,734
SPEAKER_1:  can.

00:57:33,826 --> 00:57:34,910
SPEAKER_1:  intelligence.

00:57:35,138 --> 00:57:35,742
SPEAKER_1:  Hasn't yet.

00:57:36,802 --> 00:57:38,942
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, aren't we on a...

00:57:39,298 --> 00:57:42,686
SPEAKER_1:  So the ability of the collective intelligence of the human species.

00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  to develop all these kinds of technologies.

00:57:45,666 --> 00:57:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  and to be able to have Twitter to introspect onto itself.

00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:53,982
SPEAKER_0:  Of course. We should get Twitter to be an animal. I think we're doing a...

00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:57,886
SPEAKER_0:  In a way we are. It's catch up. Always in catch up mode, you know.

00:57:58,114 --> 00:57:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:57:58,914 --> 00:58:00,574
SPEAKER_0:  I was at the Vatican.

00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  for a big meeting in 2014 on sustainable humanity, sustainable nature our responsibility.

00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:08,254
SPEAKER_0:  And it was a week of...

00:58:09,442 --> 00:58:11,902
SPEAKER_0:  presentations by like Martin Reese, who's this.

00:58:12,386 --> 00:58:14,494
SPEAKER_0:  famed British scientist, physicist who...

00:58:14,914 --> 00:58:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  Been on this podcast.

00:58:17,634 --> 00:58:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  Well, he's, you know, he's.

00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  fixated on existential risk, right? Yes, he is. There's a week of this stuff.

00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:27,550
SPEAKER_0:  The meeting was kicked off by...

00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  I wrote about it in the Cardinal Marodiaga who is I think from El Salvador. He's one of the Pope's kind of posse.

00:58:34,114 --> 00:58:37,150
SPEAKER_0:  He gave one of the initial speeches and he said, nowadays.

00:58:38,018 --> 00:58:38,814
SPEAKER_0:  Mankind.

00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  looks like a technical giant.

00:58:41,794 --> 00:58:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  and an ethical child.

00:58:44,226 --> 00:58:44,862
SPEAKER_0:  Meaning art.

00:58:45,314 --> 00:58:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  Technological wizardry is unbelievable, but it's way out in front of our ability to step back and kind of like...

00:58:52,066 --> 00:58:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  consider in the full dimensions we need to.

00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:55,678
SPEAKER_0:  Is it helping everybody?

00:58:56,098 --> 00:58:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  uh

00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:59,774
SPEAKER_0:  what are the consequences of CRISPR?

00:59:00,034 --> 00:59:00,990
SPEAKER_0:  genetics technology.

00:59:01,218 --> 00:59:02,942
SPEAKER_0:  And there's no single answer to that.

00:59:03,522 --> 00:59:05,406
SPEAKER_0:  if I'm in the African Union.

00:59:06,402 --> 00:59:07,774
SPEAKER_0:  I'm just using this as an example.

00:59:08,546 --> 00:59:11,006
SPEAKER_0:  CRISPR has emerged so fast, it can do so much.

00:59:11,426 --> 00:59:13,150
SPEAKER_0:  by changing the nature of nature.

00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  in a kind of a programming way, you know, building genes.

00:59:18,338 --> 00:59:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  not just transferring them from one organism to another.

00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:23,102
SPEAKER_0:  We've only just begun to taste.

00:59:23,522 --> 00:59:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  The fruits of that literally.

00:59:26,018 --> 00:59:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:59:27,554 --> 00:59:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  and it can wipe out a mosquito species. We know how to do that now. You can like literally.

00:59:32,738 --> 00:59:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  take out the dengue-causing mosquito.

00:59:35,394 --> 00:59:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  The scientists have done the work.

00:59:37,538 --> 00:59:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  you think, okay, cool. Well, that's great. Now there's this big fight over whether that should happen.

00:59:43,298 --> 00:59:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  African Union and I'm with their.

00:59:46,498 --> 00:59:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  view.

00:59:47,714 --> 00:59:50,846
SPEAKER_0:  says, hey, if we can take out a mosquito species that's.

00:59:51,138 --> 00:59:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  causing.

00:59:52,258 --> 00:59:52,766
SPEAKER_0:  Horrific.

00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,294
SPEAKER_0:  chronic loss through dengue.

00:59:55,586 --> 00:59:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  which I had once in Indonesia, it's not fun.

00:59:58,274 --> 00:59:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  And.

00:59:59,682 --> 01:00:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  We should.

01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:00,766
SPEAKER_0:  Do it.

01:00:00,994 --> 01:00:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  you know, and.

01:00:02,114 --> 01:00:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  Europe. What's the other side of the argument? What's the other side of the argument?

01:00:04,546 --> 01:00:07,262
SPEAKER_0:  They're they're saying using their

01:00:08,194 --> 01:00:09,630
SPEAKER_0:  Capital P precautionary.

01:00:10,498 --> 01:00:11,070
SPEAKER_0:  principle.

01:00:11,714 --> 01:00:13,150
SPEAKER_0:  Says, no, we can't meddle with nature.

01:00:14,114 --> 01:00:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  And this is just like we were talking with climate, you know, there's the real-time question and the long-term question.

01:00:19,330 --> 01:00:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  And there's the.

01:00:21,026 --> 01:00:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  People who are just facing the need to get through the day and be healthy and survive and have enough food.

01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:29,854
SPEAKER_0:  which is not integrated sufficiently at all into the climate.

01:00:30,786 --> 01:00:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  Stop climate change debate.

01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:34,974
SPEAKER_0:  and those who like are trying to cut CO2.

01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:36,446
SPEAKER_0:  which will have a benefit.

01:00:37,218 --> 01:00:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  in the future by limiting the fat tail.

01:00:40,834 --> 01:00:41,886
SPEAKER_0:  outcomes of this.

01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  journey we're on.

01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:46,174
SPEAKER_0:  So when I think about the Anthropocene, I think about...

01:00:46,658 --> 01:00:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  this planet.

01:00:48,514 --> 01:00:49,246
SPEAKER_0:  I love.

01:00:49,602 --> 01:00:53,406
SPEAKER_0:  that we're here right now. I love that our species has these capacities.

01:00:54,018 --> 01:00:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  I would love.

01:00:55,074 --> 01:00:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  there to be a little bit more reflection.

01:00:57,826 --> 01:00:59,870
SPEAKER_0:  and where things come from and where they might go.

01:01:00,354 --> 01:01:02,494
SPEAKER_0:  whether you're a student, a kid.

01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:05,150
SPEAKER_0:  What's your role?

01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:08,926
SPEAKER_0:  The wonderful thing about the complexity of it is everyone can play.

01:01:09,346 --> 01:01:10,558
SPEAKER_0:  role if you're an artist.

01:01:11,394 --> 01:01:12,990
SPEAKER_0:  or a designer.

01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:14,334
SPEAKER_0:  or architect.

01:01:14,658 --> 01:01:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  or economist.

01:01:16,066 --> 01:01:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  or a podcaster.

01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:20,958
SPEAKER_0:  Whatever you do, just tweak a little bit toward.

01:01:22,114 --> 01:01:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  examining these questions, stepping back from the simplistic.

01:01:25,186 --> 01:01:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  Label throwing.

01:01:27,042 --> 01:01:27,486
SPEAKER_0:  toward.

01:01:27,906 --> 01:01:30,366
SPEAKER_0:  what actually is the problem in front of me.

01:01:30,946 --> 01:01:31,806
SPEAKER_0:  whether it's in...

01:01:32,418 --> 01:01:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  Pakistan.

01:01:33,378 --> 01:01:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  or.

01:01:34,146 --> 01:01:34,750
SPEAKER_0:  or in.

01:01:35,874 --> 01:01:37,630
SPEAKER_0:  Boston or wherever, you know, Florida.

01:01:37,922 --> 01:01:44,158
SPEAKER_1:  What do you find beautiful about this collective intelligence machine we have from an economics perspective? It's kind of

01:01:44,578 --> 01:01:46,238
SPEAKER_1:  fascinating they were able to

01:01:46,946 --> 01:01:49,534
SPEAKER_1:  There is a machine to it that we've built up.

01:01:50,434 --> 01:01:55,230
SPEAKER_1:  that's able to represent interests and desires and value.

01:01:55,906 --> 01:01:57,310
SPEAKER_1:  Hopes and dreams.

01:01:57,634 --> 01:01:59,582
SPEAKER_1:  in sort of monetary ways.

01:02:00,226 --> 01:02:01,406
SPEAKER_1:  uh... that we can

01:02:01,666 --> 01:02:05,758
SPEAKER_1:  trade with each other, we can make agreements with each other, we can represent our goals.

01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:08,158
SPEAKER_1:  build companies that actually help.

01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:09,246
SPEAKER_1:  and so on.

01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:12,350
SPEAKER_1:  Do you just step back every once in a while and marvel at the fact that

01:02:12,738 --> 01:02:14,206
SPEAKER_1:  A few billion of us are able to.

01:02:14,594 --> 01:02:15,358
SPEAKER_1:  Somehow not.

01:02:16,578 --> 01:02:19,198
SPEAKER_1:  create complete chaos and actually collaborate.

01:02:19,522 --> 01:02:23,070
SPEAKER_1:  and have collaborative disagreements that ultimately.

01:02:23,618 --> 01:02:24,734
SPEAKER_1:  or so far have left.

01:02:24,994 --> 01:02:26,238
SPEAKER_1:  led to progress.

01:02:27,106 --> 01:02:31,550
SPEAKER_1:  I think fundamentally the point, apart from the fact that we should just...

01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:33,726
SPEAKER_1:  being joyful of the fact that.

01:02:33,954 --> 01:02:38,046
SPEAKER_1:  humans live here. I think it's incredibly important to remember.

01:02:38,626 --> 01:02:40,766
SPEAKER_1:  how much progress we've had.

01:02:40,994 --> 01:02:48,574
SPEAKER_1:  Most people just don't stop to think about those stats. I get that in the normal bustle of day. But just, you know, uh-

01:02:49,026 --> 01:02:53,598
SPEAKER_1:  In 1900, the average person on the planet lived to be 32 years.

01:02:54,434 --> 01:02:59,390
SPEAKER_1:  32 years, that was our average life expectancy. Today it's about 74.

01:02:59,874 --> 01:03:00,414
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, so-

01:03:01,026 --> 01:03:05,022
SPEAKER_1:  We've literally got two lifetimes on this planet, each one of us.

01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:07,550
SPEAKER_1:  And every year you live.

01:03:07,810 --> 01:03:14,174
SPEAKER_1:  In the rich world, you get to live three months longer and the poor world is about four months longer.

01:03:14,658 --> 01:03:21,822
SPEAKER_1:  because of medical advances, because we get better at dealing both with cancer and especially right now with heart disease.

01:03:22,114 --> 01:03:29,950
SPEAKER_1:  These are amazing achievements. Of course, it's a very very small part of it. We're much better fed. We're much better educated We've gone from a world where

01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:31,518
SPEAKER_1:  virtually everyone or.

01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:34,366
SPEAKER_1:  90% were illiterate.

01:03:34,786 --> 01:03:41,022
SPEAKER_1:  to a world where more than 90% illiterate, this is an astounding opportunity. And 200 years ago...

01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:44,062
SPEAKER_1:  95%? 94%?

01:03:44,802 --> 01:03:45,374
SPEAKER_1:  of the world.

01:03:46,402 --> 01:03:48,830
SPEAKER_1:  extremely poor that is less than a dollar a day.

01:03:49,154 --> 01:03:53,438
SPEAKER_1:  today that for the first time in 2015, it was down below 10%.

01:03:53,858 --> 01:03:58,782
SPEAKER_1:  So there, and again, these are kind of boring statistics, but they're also astounding.

01:03:59,202 --> 01:04:04,766
SPEAKER_1:  testaments of how well humanity has done. So just on the point of.

01:04:05,122 --> 01:04:08,414
SPEAKER_1:  We've kind of just been focused on making our own world better.

01:04:08,738 --> 01:04:37,950
SPEAKER_1:  And in many ways, so we've hunted a lot of big animals, either to extinction or down to much, much smaller populations, it's much smaller populations, fish in the ocean. So there's a lot of things that sort of bear the brunt of our success. It's not because we're evil in that sense, it's just because we didn't care all that much about them. I think it is important as one funnel of that, I'm not gonna make a big deal out of it, but the fact that we're putting out more CO2 in the atmosphere.

01:04:38,306 --> 01:04:59,070
SPEAKER_1:  Because CO2, as you also mentioned before, it's actually plant food. If you're a greenhouse grower, you know if you put in CO2 in your greenhouse, you actually get bigger and plumper tomatoes. And that's essentially what we're doing in the world. This has overall bad consequences, and that's why we should be doing something about it. But one of the

01:04:59,330 --> 01:04:59,646
SPEAKER_1:  Good?

01:04:59,938 --> 01:05:02,654
SPEAKER_1:  side effects is actually that the world is getting greener.

01:05:03,138 --> 01:05:05,118
SPEAKER_1:  so we get much more green stuff.

01:05:05,858 --> 01:05:13,790
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know. And this is where I sort of show my economist roots, because if you just measure all living stuff.

01:05:14,146 --> 01:05:14,590
SPEAKER_1:  in.

01:05:15,074 --> 01:05:16,222
SPEAKER_1:  uh, in tons.

01:05:16,610 --> 01:05:17,726
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, so in wait.

01:05:18,178 --> 01:05:19,454
SPEAKER_1:  there's actually more.

01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:38,430
SPEAKER_1:  living stuff than there were 100 years ago, because elephants and all these other big fish and stuff are actually really, really small fraction of the world. So we have an enormous amount of life stuff, but that doesn't even measure it. It's mostly just wood.

01:05:38,818 --> 01:05:43,774
SPEAKER_1:  of the wooden green stuff that has dramatically increased in the world.

01:05:44,066 --> 01:05:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  We're still not there from what it was in 1500. So we've still cut down the world a lot, but we're actually making a much greener world. Again, not because we really cared or thought about it, but just sort of a side effect of what we're doing. I think the crucial bit to remember is

01:06:00,226 --> 01:06:01,278
SPEAKER_1:  When you're poor?

01:06:01,634 --> 01:06:04,510
SPEAKER_1:  and you worry about what's going to happen the next day.

01:06:05,218 --> 01:06:12,414
SPEAKER_1:  This is just not your main issue. Am I killing too many large animals in the world?

01:06:13,154 --> 01:06:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  when you're rich and you can actually sit in a podcast in a convenient place in Austin, you can also start thinking about this. So one of the-

01:06:21,282 --> 01:06:22,334
SPEAKER_1:  Crucial bits, I think.

01:06:22,818 --> 01:06:25,790
SPEAKER_1:  If we want to get the rest of the world to care about

01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:29,470
SPEAKER_1:  the environment, care about climate, care about all these other issues.

01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  We really need to get them out of poverty first.

01:06:32,258 --> 01:06:34,910
SPEAKER_1:  And it's a simple point that we often forget.

01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  and get them connected to all these gifts. Todd, thank you for being involved in this interview today and your shredded

01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:39,102
SPEAKER_0:  I-I-

01:06:39,426 --> 01:06:40,606
SPEAKER_0:  I have these memories of...

01:06:41,474 --> 01:06:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  I was reporting on the next big earthquake that's going to devastate Istanbul.

01:06:45,602 --> 01:06:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  in 2009.

01:06:48,578 --> 01:06:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  I was in a slum.

01:06:50,242 --> 01:06:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  immigrant.

01:06:52,802 --> 01:06:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  poor neighborhood.

01:06:54,530 --> 01:06:55,070
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:06:55,394 --> 01:06:58,686
SPEAKER_0:  walking around with an engineer pointing out to the buildings that were going to fall down.

01:06:58,978 --> 01:07:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  This is all known. There was an earthquake in 1999 and the next one's coming.

01:07:03,042 --> 01:07:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  One of my advantages in covering climate is I've covered other kinds of disasters too, so it keeps my context.

01:07:08,930 --> 01:07:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  Me in touch with other.

01:07:10,402 --> 01:07:18,174
SPEAKER_0:  things we could do. So I'm walking around and interviewing everybody. I went to the school that's being retrofit. They actually were getting ahead of it there. The World Bank provided some funding to.

01:07:18,402 --> 01:07:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  put in iron.

01:07:19,458 --> 01:07:20,830
SPEAKER_0:  bars in the brick building.

01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,966
SPEAKER_0:  And I met these kids.

01:07:24,354 --> 01:07:27,646
SPEAKER_0:  And they came, when you're a journalist with a camera and stuff in a pad.

01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  You get swarmed by kids.

01:07:30,594 --> 01:07:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  mostly in developing countries. These kids are running up to me.

01:07:33,762 --> 01:07:34,110
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:07:34,370 --> 01:07:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  They were going like...

01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:36,766
SPEAKER_0:  Are you American or just?

01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  They were saying Facebook.

01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:38,750
SPEAKER_0:  PISS M-

01:07:40,162 --> 01:07:40,542
SPEAKER_0:  And I went.

01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  That's interesting and they led me.

01:07:43,554 --> 01:07:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  there, a little community center that had a bank of eight or 10.

01:07:48,642 --> 01:07:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  flimsy computers.

01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  And they're all there playing a farm. There was a game that was hot at that time on Facebook farm.

01:07:55,426 --> 01:07:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  Farmville? Farmville, yeah. And my son back in the Hudson Valley.

01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  I remember him playing it and.

01:08:01,986 --> 01:08:03,038
SPEAKER_0:  And I thought, wow.

01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:04,958
SPEAKER_0:  That is so freaking cool.

01:08:05,922 --> 01:08:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  these kids and actually I became Facebook friends with a couple of them afterwards. we traded our gifts.

01:08:11,106 --> 01:08:13,310
SPEAKER_0:  And I thought back to my youth when...

01:08:14,082 --> 01:08:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  we had pen pals, I would write a letter to a kid in West Cameroon.

01:08:18,434 --> 01:08:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  and he would write back.

01:08:20,098 --> 01:08:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  and it took weeks.

01:08:22,274 --> 01:08:24,670
SPEAKER_0:  It was a crinkly letter and I never met him.

01:08:25,506 --> 01:08:27,486
SPEAKER_0:  And now you can kind of connect with people and.

01:08:27,938 --> 01:08:28,926
SPEAKER_0:  And that all...

01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:35,966
SPEAKER_0:  my blogging. At the New York Times, I was doing my regular reporting, but I launched a blog in 2007 called.earth.

01:08:37,058 --> 01:08:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  which was all about what you were just describing, the newosphere, the connected world. That's a term from these.

01:08:43,906 --> 01:08:46,014
SPEAKER_0:  to early 20s, a Russian guy in early.

01:08:47,010 --> 01:08:47,998
SPEAKER_0:  Farnadsky and.

01:08:48,898 --> 01:08:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  a French theologian and scientist, which is so interesting.

01:08:52,738 --> 01:08:54,878
SPEAKER_0:  Teard de Chardin.

01:08:55,586 --> 01:08:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  They had this idea.

01:08:56,994 --> 01:08:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  in the early 20th century that.

01:08:58,914 --> 01:09:00,702
SPEAKER_0:  We're creating a planet of the mind.

01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:03,518
SPEAKER_0:  that human intelligence.

01:09:04,194 --> 01:09:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  can foster.

01:09:06,178 --> 01:09:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  a better Earth.

01:09:08,386 --> 01:09:15,934
SPEAKER_0:  And I just became smitten with that, especially meeting kids in Istanbul slums who are on Facebook looking at connectedness. What can you do with these tools?

01:09:16,226 --> 01:09:18,302
SPEAKER_0:  which is what drives me with my work now.

01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:20,062
SPEAKER_0:  And, um...

01:09:20,674 --> 01:09:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  But then there are these counter weight, counter.

01:09:23,650 --> 01:09:24,286
SPEAKER_0:  currents that.

01:09:25,122 --> 01:09:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  if the connectedness can cut back, you know, it allowed.

01:09:29,026 --> 01:09:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  Al-Qaeda to recruit.

01:09:30,562 --> 01:09:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  Use decapitation videos to recruit.

01:09:33,634 --> 01:09:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  distributed, disaffected young people into extremism.

01:09:38,690 --> 01:09:40,446
SPEAKER_0:  And there's lots of-

01:09:41,058 --> 01:09:44,286
SPEAKER_0:  These systems are just like every other tool, right? They're just-

01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:45,662
SPEAKER_0:  for good or ill.

01:09:46,178 --> 01:09:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  and the efficiency thing.

01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  the economics.

01:09:50,242 --> 01:09:52,254
SPEAKER_0:  of the world, which I also wrote about a little bit.

01:09:53,122 --> 01:09:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  late 20th century it was so cool that

01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:57,406
SPEAKER_0:  everything became so efficient.

01:09:58,306 --> 01:09:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  that our supply chains.

01:10:00,066 --> 01:10:01,086
SPEAKER_0:  Just in time.

01:10:01,794 --> 01:10:03,006
SPEAKER_0:  manufacturing, you know.

01:10:03,842 --> 01:10:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  getting the stuff.

01:10:05,666 --> 01:10:11,262
SPEAKER_0:  from where the sources of the material are to the car factory and to get the car to the floor just in time for someone to buy it.

01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  And everyone got totally sucked in by that, including me. It's great, you know, super efficient, cheaper.

01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  And then COVID.

01:10:18,946 --> 01:10:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  and the whole supply chain.

01:10:20,994 --> 01:10:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  concept crumbled.

01:10:22,434 --> 01:10:24,478
SPEAKER_0:  And one of the big lessons there, hopefully.

01:10:24,898 --> 01:10:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  and this is relevant to sustainability generally.

01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  is.

01:10:28,866 --> 01:10:33,758
SPEAKER_0:  Efficiency matters, but resilience matters too, and resilience is inefficient.

01:10:34,402 --> 01:10:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  You need redundancy?

01:10:36,258 --> 01:10:36,766
SPEAKER_0:  or

01:10:38,082 --> 01:10:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  or a variety of.

01:10:39,746 --> 01:10:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  options, right? Which is not what corporate companies think about, which is not what...

01:10:44,034 --> 01:10:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  If you're only focused on a bottom line short term.

01:10:47,586 --> 01:10:48,190
SPEAKER_0:  Timeline.

01:10:49,314 --> 01:10:55,294
SPEAKER_0:  those disruptions are not what you're thinking about. You're still thinking about, can we get that widget here just in time for this thing to happen? And then on we go.

01:10:56,098 --> 01:10:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  So it's kind of...

01:10:57,346 --> 01:10:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  I love the no sphere.

01:10:58,978 --> 01:10:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  This new-esphere.

01:11:01,058 --> 01:11:04,126
SPEAKER_0:  idea of the connectedness is fantastic. Oh wait another thing like-

01:11:04,386 --> 01:11:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  in the early 90s.

01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:07,550
SPEAKER_0:  when I wrote my first book on global warming.

01:11:08,642 --> 01:11:14,686
SPEAKER_0:  It was for an exhibition at the Museum of Natural History. The Environmental Defense Fund was involved. They were like a partner.

01:11:15,586 --> 01:11:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  one of these longstanding environmental groups.

01:11:18,114 --> 01:11:24,030
SPEAKER_0:  And they're very old fashioned. It's mostly lawyers really, just using the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act to litigate against pollution.

01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  And now...

01:11:26,306 --> 01:11:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  EDF is vastly bigger.

01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:32,542
SPEAKER_0:  And they're actually, this coming year, they're launching a satellite, an environmental group.

01:11:33,506 --> 01:11:34,974
SPEAKER_0:  is launching MethaneSat.

01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:39,550
SPEAKER_0:  and it's providing a view, an independent view of where there's this gas.

01:11:40,194 --> 01:11:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  It's the same thing, natural gas is basically methane.

01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:45,630
SPEAKER_0:  you have a leak, whether it's in Siberia or in

01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:47,038
SPEAKER_0:  Oklahoma.

01:11:47,842 --> 01:11:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  You can cross-reference, you can ground, you can.

01:11:50,882 --> 01:11:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  identify the hotspot you can.

01:11:53,570 --> 01:11:57,790
SPEAKER_0:  know where the problem is to fix in so many ways. And that's just one example. I'm like-

01:11:58,114 --> 01:12:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  If someone had told me in 1993 that EDF was going to launch a methane satellite, I would have laughed out loud.

01:12:03,010 --> 01:12:04,542
SPEAKER_0:  So technology plays a huge role.

01:12:05,378 --> 01:12:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  if it's kind of.

01:12:06,946 --> 01:12:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  you know, employed.

01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:09,310
SPEAKER_0:  with these.

01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  the bigger vision and leadership.

01:12:11,234 --> 01:12:12,318
SPEAKER_0:  So Bjorn you wrote...

01:12:13,090 --> 01:12:16,062
SPEAKER_1:  One of the books you wrote, the most recent one called False Alarm.

01:12:16,386 --> 01:12:19,454
SPEAKER_1:  how climate change panic costs us trillions.

01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  hurts the poor.

01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:23,070
SPEAKER_1:  and fails to fix the planet.

01:12:24,002 --> 01:12:26,526
SPEAKER_1:  Good title by the way, very intense, makes me want to read it.

01:12:27,074 --> 01:12:27,710
SPEAKER_1:  What is?

01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:30,750
SPEAKER_1:  likely the worst effect of climate change.

01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:35,998
SPEAKER_1:  First, let me just, my editor actually hated the subtitle because it gives away the whole book.

01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:45,950
SPEAKER_1:  basically tells you what the book tries to make. I think that's exactly what it should be. It's about getting this conversation out in the public sphere.

01:12:47,106 --> 01:12:49,758
SPEAKER_1:  The worst thing that climate change can do...

01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:55,326
SPEAKER_1:  is like the worst thing that anything can do is that it wipes out everything and we all die.

01:12:55,778 --> 01:12:57,022
SPEAKER_1:  So it's not like.

01:12:58,018 --> 01:13:00,990
SPEAKER_1:  If you're just looking for worst case outcomes.

01:13:01,474 --> 01:13:02,430
SPEAKER_1:  Anything can get.

01:13:02,722 --> 01:13:03,998
SPEAKER_1:  to the worst case outcome.

01:13:04,386 --> 01:13:09,534
SPEAKER_1:  Imagine if we suggest what's the worst thing that could happen from HIV.

01:13:10,178 --> 01:13:12,990
SPEAKER_1:  It breaks down...

01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:17,566
SPEAKER_1:  one or more African states because we don't fix it. And then you get sort of.

01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:24,446
SPEAKER_1:  biological warfare and terrorism throw in that in the mix and then you get someone who makes a virus and kills the whole world.

01:13:24,738 --> 01:13:25,662
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, you can make-

01:13:26,082 --> 01:13:30,878
SPEAKER_1:  Worst case scenarios for everything. Well, let's just call it. I get the point. Sorry for any interruption.

01:13:31,106 --> 01:13:37,854
SPEAKER_1:  And I appreciate worst case analysis because I am a fundamental computer scientist and that was the thing that defined the discipline.

01:13:38,434 --> 01:13:44,062
SPEAKER_1:  of the measure the quality of the algorithm, when you measure what is its worst case performance.

01:13:44,386 --> 01:13:47,966
SPEAKER_1:  That's the big O notation. That's how you discuss algorithms. What is the worst?

01:13:48,354 --> 01:13:49,118
SPEAKER_1:  possible.

01:13:49,346 --> 01:13:49,822
SPEAKER_1:  thing.

01:13:50,274 --> 01:13:52,446
SPEAKER_1:  in terms of performance this thing can do.

01:13:53,474 --> 01:13:56,094
SPEAKER_1:  for climate change. Let's even go.

01:13:56,450 --> 01:13:56,894
SPEAKER_1:  Crazy.

01:13:57,410 --> 01:14:00,862
SPEAKER_1:  What is exactly the worst case scenario for climate change?

01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:02,302
SPEAKER_1:  because uh...

01:14:03,202 --> 01:14:05,118
SPEAKER_1:  I have to be honest and say I haven't.

01:14:05,922 --> 01:14:07,006
SPEAKER_1:  uh... really paid it

01:14:07,298 --> 01:14:10,558
SPEAKER_1:  deep attention, I just have a lot of colleagues who.

01:14:11,202 --> 01:14:12,670
SPEAKER_1:  think about climate and so on.

01:14:13,122 --> 01:14:18,814
SPEAKER_1:  And there's a kind of in the alarmism, there was a sense why this is, this is a very serious problem.

01:14:19,714 --> 01:14:20,190
SPEAKER_1:  and then.

01:14:20,578 --> 01:14:22,462
SPEAKER_1:  the sentence would never finish.

01:14:22,914 --> 01:14:26,654
SPEAKER_1:  What exactly is the problem with the extinction of the human species? Okay.

01:14:27,330 --> 01:14:30,366
SPEAKER_1:  with a virus, I understand how that can possibly happen.

01:14:30,754 --> 01:14:35,742
SPEAKER_1:  What is the mechanism by which the human species becomes extinct because of climate change?

01:14:36,386 --> 01:14:44,446
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not sure I would want to be able to argue that because it really requires you to have sort of very, very extreme parameter choices all down the line.

01:14:44,674 --> 01:14:50,398
SPEAKER_1:  So it's more, it's this kind of idea that we hit some of these unexpected outcomes.

01:14:50,658 --> 01:15:03,934
SPEAKER_1:  So for instance, the West Ind Arctic ice sheet melts really, really quickly. It doesn't look like that can happen really, really quickly, but let's just say that this could happen within a hundred years or something. So we basically get what...

01:15:04,322 --> 01:15:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  seven meters, what is that? 20 feet of sea level rise.

01:15:08,258 --> 01:15:11,998
SPEAKER_1:  That will be a real challenge to a lot of places around the world.

01:15:12,226 --> 01:15:26,750
SPEAKER_1:  This would have significant cost. It's likely. And there's actually been a study that's tried to estimate, could we deal with that? And the short answer is yes, if you're fairly well off. If you're a Holland, you can definitely deal with it.

01:15:27,074 --> 01:15:28,830
SPEAKER_1:  It's also likely that most

01:15:29,154 --> 01:15:31,998
SPEAKER_1:  developing countries are going to be much closer to Holland.

01:15:32,226 --> 01:15:40,606
SPEAKER_1:  towards the end of the century because they'll be much richer. So they can probably handle it, but it will be a real challenge. May I ask a dumb question? What happens when the sea...

01:15:41,058 --> 01:15:45,150
SPEAKER_1:  level rises exactly, what is the painful aspect of that?

01:15:45,794 --> 01:15:47,198
SPEAKER_1:  It is that all of your

01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:56,382
SPEAKER_1:  current infrastructure in a lot of coastal cities around the world that are literally built on, you know, Jakarta is a good example, that are literally built on the...

01:15:56,642 --> 01:16:03,486
SPEAKER_1:  of inches above the sea level. If you then get a sea level rise, so let us say

01:16:03,842 --> 01:16:08,638
SPEAKER_1:  What would 20 feet of that would be like a third or a fourth of a foot every year.

01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I see no evidence that that's even.

01:16:11,970 --> 01:16:21,406
SPEAKER_1:  Hold on a second. Let's, we're not talking about evidence. No talking about worst case analysis and algorithm. And so, so basically you would see your infrastructure, all your stuff.

01:16:21,794 --> 01:16:24,222
SPEAKER_1:  very quickly being very, very challenged.

01:16:24,482 --> 01:16:25,758
SPEAKER_1:  and you basically have to put up.

01:16:26,146 --> 01:16:27,166
SPEAKER_1:  Huge seawalls.

01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:30,622
SPEAKER_1:  Or migrate out of that area. Very quickly.

01:16:30,850 --> 01:16:34,558
SPEAKER_1:  Well, very quickly as in 50 years or something. Right like-

01:16:34,946 --> 01:16:36,414
SPEAKER_1:  I is that.

01:16:37,058 --> 01:16:38,494
SPEAKER_1:  as a human species.

01:16:39,202 --> 01:16:41,054
SPEAKER_1:  were not able to respond.

01:16:41,442 --> 01:16:42,622
SPEAKER_1:  to that kind of story. Of course we are.

01:16:42,978 --> 01:16:44,350
SPEAKER_1:  And, and look again, the.

01:16:44,642 --> 01:16:45,246
SPEAKER_1:  point here is

01:16:45,506 --> 01:16:57,022
SPEAKER_1:  then there's a lot of other arguments. And I should just put the disclaimer, this is not what I think is correct, but you're asking me what's the worst case outcome that you have a

01:16:57,986 --> 01:16:59,870
SPEAKER_1:  So most of global warming is really about

01:17:00,194 --> 01:17:00,894
SPEAKER_1:  that we.

01:17:01,122 --> 01:17:11,966
SPEAKER_1:  We're used to one way of doing things. So, you know, we live in Jakarta because it's right next to the sea. We're used to the sea being at this level. We grow our crops.

01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:22,046
SPEAKER_1:  because we're used to, you grow corn here, you grow wheat here, because we're used to that's where the precipitation and the temperature is the right for this kind of crop.

01:17:22,466 --> 01:17:22,814
SPEAKER_1:  If

01:17:23,074 --> 01:17:41,854
SPEAKER_1:  This changes and this is the same thing with, with, you know, with houses, if it gets colder, if it gets warmer, it's suddenly uncomfortable because you've built your house wrong. So our infrastructure will be wrong if the world changes. And that's what climate change does. At a large scale. Yes. And so this is a problem in most of these sentences.

01:17:42,146 --> 01:18:07,646
SPEAKER_1:  But if you then sort of take it to the extreme and say, well, imagine that you're going to get a huge sea level rise. Imagine that you're going to get a very different sort of precipitation. For instance, the rain season, monsoon in the Indian subcontinent changes dramatically. That could affect a lot of agriculture and make it really hard to imagine that you could feed India well.

01:18:07,906 --> 01:18:14,654
SPEAKER_1:  There are these kinds of things where you can imagine and then that this would be very difficult to deal with.

01:18:14,882 --> 01:18:16,542
SPEAKER_1:  And then if you add all of it up.

01:18:16,802 --> 01:18:23,742
SPEAKER_1:  You could possibly get sort of a system collapse because you know, you just have too many problems and it's impossible to model those kinds of things. So...

01:18:24,034 --> 01:18:25,630
SPEAKER_1:  What I understand.

01:18:26,146 --> 01:18:29,054
SPEAKER_1:  is the sea of Arise itself.

01:18:29,794 --> 01:18:30,558
SPEAKER_1:  isn't.

01:18:30,914 --> 01:18:38,142
SPEAKER_1:  the destructive thing. It's the fact that it creates migration patterns and human tension, battle over resources.

01:18:38,466 --> 01:18:39,902
SPEAKER_1:  and see start to get these.

01:18:40,514 --> 01:18:41,278
SPEAKER_1:  These

01:18:41,986 --> 01:18:44,350
SPEAKER_1:  human things, human conflict.

01:18:44,738 --> 01:18:48,606
SPEAKER_1:  So the big negative impact won't be necessarily from the fact that you have to move your house.

01:18:48,930 --> 01:18:55,134
SPEAKER_1:  It's the fact that once you move your house, that means something else down the line, and this is secondary tertiary effects.

01:18:55,490 --> 01:18:58,718
SPEAKER_1:  that can have potentially to wars, military conflict.

01:18:59,266 --> 01:19:00,318
SPEAKER_1:  can have dist...

01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:06,654
SPEAKER_1:  destabilize entire economies all that kind of stuff because of the migration is it possible tomorrow those kind of things

01:19:07,106 --> 01:19:52,350
SPEAKER_1:  So there are people who looked at this and surprisingly, again, most people will move within their country for a lot of different reasons, but mainly language and political structure. You have your money, you have your relationships there. So it's not like we're gonna see these big moves from southern Mexico and Central America up to the US or from Africa up to the EU. That's not predominantly because of climate. That's because there's a lot of welfare opportunity. You can make your life much, much better and you can become much more productive if you move into a richer country. So yes, there are these issues. Again, you're asking me for sort of what is it that could really sort of break down the world.

01:19:52,642 --> 01:19:53,310
SPEAKER_1:  I think the-

01:19:53,602 --> 01:19:55,390
SPEAKER_1:  fundamental point is to recognize

01:19:55,746 --> 01:20:00,126
SPEAKER_1:  that it's not like we haven't dealt with huge challenges in the past.

01:20:00,514 --> 01:20:09,150
SPEAKER_1:  And we've dealt with them really well. So just one fun thing, I encourage everyone to just look that up on, on Wikipedia, the rising of Chicago.

01:20:09,762 --> 01:20:12,158
SPEAKER_1:  So in the 1850s.

01:20:12,418 --> 01:20:17,950
SPEAKER_1:  Chicago is a terribly dirty place and they didn't have good sewers.

01:20:18,402 --> 01:20:23,294
SPEAKER_1:  And so they decided and we can't really make up all my, they decided to raise.

01:20:23,586 --> 01:20:25,662
SPEAKER_1:  Chicago one to two feet.

01:20:26,434 --> 01:20:35,838
SPEAKER_1:  And so they simply took one block at a time. They put like 50,000 jacks underneath a building and they would just raise the building and then they'd go on to the next building. They raised all of Chicago.

01:20:36,258 --> 01:20:37,086
SPEAKER_1:  One or two feet.

01:20:37,410 --> 01:20:45,214
SPEAKER_1:  This is almost 200 years ago. Of course we will be able to deal with these things. I'm not saying it will be fun or that it will be cheap.

01:20:45,538 --> 01:20:47,902
SPEAKER_1:  Of course, we would rather not have to deal with this.

01:20:48,194 --> 01:20:57,022
SPEAKER_1:  but we're a very inventive species. And so it's very unlikely that we'll not be able to. What about COVID pandemic just said hold my beer.

01:20:58,370 --> 01:21:00,158
SPEAKER_1:  uh... other responsive

01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:01,566
SPEAKER_1:  human civilization to the

01:21:01,986 --> 01:21:03,038
SPEAKER_1:  COVID pandemic.

01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:04,734
SPEAKER_1:  seems to have not.

01:21:05,826 --> 01:21:11,774
SPEAKER_1:  They didn't find the carjacks. It seems to have not been as effective as I would have.

01:21:13,346 --> 01:21:14,206
SPEAKER_1:  of four.

01:21:14,722 --> 01:21:20,638
SPEAKER_1:  as a human that believes in the basic competence of leadership and all that kind of stuff.

01:21:20,962 --> 01:21:23,454
SPEAKER_1:  It seems that given the COVID pandemic.

01:21:24,066 --> 01:21:25,854
SPEAKER_1:  luckily did not turn out to be.

01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:32,318
SPEAKER_1:  a pandemic that would eradicate most of the human species, which is something you always have to consider.

01:21:32,642 --> 01:21:33,502
SPEAKER_1:  and worry about.

01:21:34,722 --> 01:21:37,502
SPEAKER_1:  I would have hoped we would have less economic impact and

01:21:37,922 --> 01:21:39,870
SPEAKER_1:  would respond more effectively.

01:21:40,450 --> 01:21:40,958
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:21:41,218 --> 01:21:43,934
SPEAKER_1:  in terms of policy, in terms of socially.

01:21:44,290 --> 01:21:45,982
SPEAKER_1:  medically all that kind of stuff.

01:21:46,562 --> 01:21:50,942
SPEAKER_1:  If the COVID pandemic brought the world to its knees, then what does?

01:21:51,874 --> 01:21:57,726
SPEAKER_1:  a sea level rise. I think there's a different kind of thing that happened in the COVID.

01:21:58,146 --> 01:22:00,350
SPEAKER_1:  politicians and a lot of politicians, I think.

01:22:00,610 --> 01:22:00,990
SPEAKER_1:  Made.

01:22:01,698 --> 01:22:03,678
SPEAKER_1:  certainly suboptimal decisions.

01:22:04,034 --> 01:22:07,390
SPEAKER_1:  but I also find the fact that we actually managed to get a vaccine.

01:22:07,618 --> 01:22:08,190
SPEAKER_1:  in a year.

01:22:08,514 --> 01:22:15,838
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, we should not be, uh, you know, sort of unaware of the fact that yes, we did a lot of stupid stuff and a lot of people were really, really annoyed.

01:22:16,066 --> 01:22:17,726
SPEAKER_1:  Fundamentally, we fixed this.

01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:19,166
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, we could have done it.

01:22:19,426 --> 01:22:25,310
SPEAKER_1:  better and prettier. I mean, I rode through the COVID pandemic in southern Sweden.

01:22:25,634 --> 01:22:27,582
SPEAKER_1:  So and

01:22:27,842 --> 01:22:35,998
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, we can have that whole conversation. It was certainly much easier to live there than, than many other places. But the fundamental point was...

01:22:36,482 --> 01:22:43,294
SPEAKER_1:  We actually fixed it. So yes, we'll do, and we'll do that with climate. We'll make a lot of bad decisions and we'll waste a lot of money.

01:22:43,586 --> 01:22:45,214
SPEAKER_1:  like we do with all other problems.

01:22:45,474 --> 01:22:47,166
SPEAKER_1:  But are we going to fix this?

01:22:47,426 --> 01:22:47,870
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:22:48,578 --> 01:22:53,950
SPEAKER_1:  Can you add on to that uncomfortable discussion of what's the worst thing that could possibly happen?

01:22:54,050 --> 01:23:01,790
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not worried about the sea level rise component, certainly not nearly as much as the heat and disruption of agriculture patterns and...

01:23:02,274 --> 01:23:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  water supplies and a lot of it relates to

01:23:05,122 --> 01:23:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  Again, path dependency in history.

01:23:08,066 --> 01:23:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  farmers are the heroes of humanity all through history because they're incredibly adaptable.

01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  if you give them.

01:23:15,938 --> 01:23:17,758
SPEAKER_0:  access to resources.

01:23:18,242 --> 01:23:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  In some cases, it's just crop insurance.

01:23:20,802 --> 01:23:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  which is really basically still impossible to get in big chunks of Africa.

01:23:25,026 --> 01:23:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  to get you through those hard spots.

01:23:26,594 --> 01:23:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  But the heat issue is the one that's most

01:23:29,442 --> 01:23:33,854
SPEAKER_0:  The most basic element related to global warming from CO2.

01:23:34,370 --> 01:23:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  build up.

01:23:35,362 --> 01:23:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  is hotter.

01:23:37,218 --> 01:23:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  Heatwaves.

01:23:38,050 --> 01:23:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  There's still some.

01:23:39,362 --> 01:23:40,606
SPEAKER_0:  lack of evidence of.

01:23:41,506 --> 01:23:43,134
SPEAKER_0:  the intensification, but the.

01:23:43,618 --> 01:23:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  duration and.

01:23:45,090 --> 01:23:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:23:46,146 --> 01:23:48,510
SPEAKER_0:  That's what really matters for heat, is how many days.

01:23:49,666 --> 01:23:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  seems to be very powerfully linked to global warming.

01:23:52,578 --> 01:23:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  And so how many people die as a result of that is.

01:23:55,234 --> 01:23:56,359
SPEAKER_0:  important.

01:23:56,359 --> 01:23:57,182
SPEAKER_1:  talking about.

01:23:58,722 --> 01:24:02,462
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe you can also educate me. What's the average projection for the next?

01:24:03,138 --> 01:24:05,598
SPEAKER_1:  100 years of the temperature rises at two.

01:24:05,794 --> 01:24:11,742
SPEAKER_0:  two degrees Celsius. Well, yeah. Although this gets us into the modeling realm.

01:24:12,258 --> 01:24:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  You're assuming, you have to assume different emissions.

01:24:15,234 --> 01:24:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  possibilities.

01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  You have to assume.

01:24:18,402 --> 01:24:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  We still don't know the.

01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  basic physics like how many clouds form.

01:24:22,946 --> 01:24:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  in a warming climate and how that relates to limiting warming.

01:24:26,882 --> 01:24:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  aspects of the fundamental warming question.

01:24:30,114 --> 01:24:31,239
SPEAKER_0:  DeepLand's hurt, but the dip.

01:24:31,239 --> 01:24:33,489
SPEAKER_1:  The debate is like two, three or four sub-

01:24:33,489 --> 01:24:34,989
SPEAKER_0:  I'll see you. It's in that range.

01:24:34,989 --> 01:24:35,710
SPEAKER_1:  thing is.

01:24:36,386 --> 01:24:38,462
SPEAKER_1:  All of those are bad for...

01:24:38,850 --> 01:24:41,214
SPEAKER_1:  This is an educational question. Sure.

01:24:41,538 --> 01:24:44,446
SPEAKER_1:  It doesn't seem like that much.

01:24:44,674 --> 01:24:46,174
SPEAKER_1:  from a weather perspective.

01:24:46,466 --> 01:24:49,854
SPEAKER_1:  if you just turn up the AC and so on in your own personal home

01:24:50,338 --> 01:24:53,713
SPEAKER_1:  But it is, from a global perspective, a huge impact on it.

01:24:53,713 --> 01:24:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  agriculture.

01:24:55,010 --> 01:24:57,886
SPEAKER_0:  Well, yeah, and getting back to sea level and glaciers.

01:24:58,466 --> 01:25:00,606
SPEAKER_0:  The melting point of ice is a...

01:25:01,058 --> 01:25:01,662
SPEAKER_0:  is a number.

01:25:02,786 --> 01:25:05,694
SPEAKER_0:  And so if you pass that number, things start to change.

01:25:06,050 --> 01:25:09,918
SPEAKER_0:  What became known about Antarctica and Greenland more is that it's ocean.

01:25:10,146 --> 01:25:10,718
SPEAKER_0:  temperature.

01:25:11,906 --> 01:25:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  the seawater in and around and under these ice sheets.

01:25:15,234 --> 01:25:16,350
SPEAKER_0:  because it kind of gets under.

01:25:16,898 --> 01:25:17,694
SPEAKER_0:  parts of Antarctica.

01:25:18,146 --> 01:25:19,134
SPEAKER_0:  is what's driving.

01:25:19,490 --> 01:25:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  the

01:25:20,354 --> 01:25:21,694
SPEAKER_0:  dynamics that could lead to.

01:25:22,114 --> 01:25:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  more abrupt change.

01:25:23,298 --> 01:25:24,862
SPEAKER_0:  more than air temperature.

01:25:25,442 --> 01:25:27,998
SPEAKER_0:  Glaciers, these big ice sheets live or die based on...

01:25:28,674 --> 01:25:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  how much snow falls and how much.

01:25:30,818 --> 01:25:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  leaves every year.

01:25:32,226 --> 01:25:32,542
SPEAKER_0:  and.

01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  I was up on the greenlit ice sheet.

01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  2004.

01:25:37,538 --> 01:25:39,230
SPEAKER_0:  written about it forever since then.

01:25:39,554 --> 01:25:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  It's the same amount of water that's in the Gulf of Mexico.

01:25:43,554 --> 01:25:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  you know, God or some great force came down and flash flows the Gulf of Mexico and plunked it up on land. That's the ocean. It's a lot of water.

01:25:51,618 --> 01:25:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  That's 23 feet.

01:25:53,058 --> 01:25:54,046
SPEAKER_0:  See you level rise if you.

01:25:54,818 --> 01:25:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  but you were not gonna melt it all.

01:25:56,706 --> 01:25:57,246
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:25:57,762 --> 01:25:59,326
SPEAKER_0:  the pace at which that.

01:26:00,322 --> 01:26:01,886
SPEAKER_0:  Erosion begins.

01:26:02,914 --> 01:26:05,022
SPEAKER_0:  and becomes sort of a runaway train.

01:26:05,794 --> 01:26:06,622
SPEAKER_0:  is still.

01:26:07,362 --> 01:26:08,190
SPEAKER_0:  Not well understood.

01:26:09,186 --> 01:26:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  that changed from like.

01:26:11,138 --> 01:26:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  Hey.

01:26:12,034 --> 01:26:13,374
SPEAKER_0:  manageable level of.

01:26:13,986 --> 01:26:15,646
SPEAKER_0:  sea level rise from these ice sheets.

01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  to something that becomes truly unstoppable or that has these discontinuities where you get a lot more all of a sudden.

01:26:22,146 --> 01:26:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  To me, it's in the realm of

01:26:25,314 --> 01:26:28,734
SPEAKER_0:  what I've taken to calling known unknowables. Like don't count on another.

01:26:29,506 --> 01:26:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  IPCC report magically including science that says, aha, now we know it's going to be five feet by 2100.

01:26:37,602 --> 01:26:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  Because there's a lot of negative learning in science. This may be true in your body of science too.

01:26:43,682 --> 01:26:44,062
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:26:44,482 --> 01:26:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  There's a guy named Jeremy Bassas, B-A-S-S-I-S.

01:26:48,418 --> 01:26:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  who wrote a paper about the...

01:26:50,018 --> 01:26:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  this Westantic.

01:26:51,362 --> 01:26:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  the idea that you could get this.

01:26:53,634 --> 01:26:54,686
SPEAKER_0:  sudden cliff.

01:26:56,386 --> 01:27:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  breakdown of these ice shelves around Antarctica leading to rapid sea level rise.

01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:04,606
SPEAKER_0:  He did more modeling and physics and it turns out that you end up with

01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:07,838
SPEAKER_0:  It's a much more progressive and self-limiting phenomenon.

01:27:08,962 --> 01:27:10,686
SPEAKER_0:  But those papers don't get any attention in the media.

01:27:11,010 --> 01:27:14,366
SPEAKER_0:  because they're not scary and they're sort of after the fact.

01:27:14,594 --> 01:27:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

01:27:15,426 --> 01:27:17,982
SPEAKER_0:  Just this past year, there's been this cycle around.

01:27:18,274 --> 01:27:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  The word collapse.

01:27:20,386 --> 01:27:22,878
SPEAKER_0:  and Antarctic ice.

01:27:23,618 --> 01:27:24,990
SPEAKER_0:  It started.

01:27:25,570 --> 01:27:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  actually several years ago with the idea that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is particularly vulnerable.

01:27:31,074 --> 01:27:35,838
SPEAKER_0:  and some paper, everyone, the science community, like the birds we were talking about flocks to it.

01:27:36,386 --> 01:27:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  Some high-profile papers are written.

01:27:39,042 --> 01:27:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  And then a deeper inquiry reveals, eh, you know, it's more complicated than that.

01:27:43,074 --> 01:27:45,214
SPEAKER_0:  and we, the journalists, the media.

01:27:45,506 --> 01:27:47,422
SPEAKER_0:  So pundits don't pay attention to.

01:27:47,682 --> 01:27:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  That.

01:27:50,210 --> 01:27:51,166
SPEAKER_0:  And actually.

01:27:52,674 --> 01:27:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  which is why I started to develop kind of a dictionary. I call it watch words, like words if you're out there.

01:27:59,458 --> 01:28:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  You're just a public person. You're a person. You want to know what's really going on.

01:28:04,290 --> 01:28:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  You hear these words like collapse.

01:28:06,882 --> 01:28:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  in the context of ice.

01:28:08,514 --> 01:28:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  What do you do with that?

01:28:09,890 --> 01:28:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  And so I've created conversations around these words.

01:28:12,578 --> 01:28:15,230
SPEAKER_0:  Geologists and ice scientists use the word collapse.

01:28:15,714 --> 01:28:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  They're talking about a centuries long process.

01:28:18,946 --> 01:28:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  They're not talking about the World Trade Center.

01:28:20,898 --> 01:28:21,246
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:28:22,754 --> 01:28:23,262
SPEAKER_0:  scientists.

01:28:23,490 --> 01:28:25,694
SPEAKER_0:  would do well to be more careful with words like that.

01:28:26,018 --> 01:28:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  unless your focus is what we were saying earlier.

01:28:29,506 --> 01:28:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  your idea that alarming people will.

01:28:31,906 --> 01:28:32,798
SPEAKER_0:  spur them to act.

01:28:33,346 --> 01:28:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  then you use that word carelessly.

01:28:35,714 --> 01:28:43,326
SPEAKER_1:  Can I just follow up on the other point that you said, you know, two, three, four degrees, you know, that doesn't sound like much. I can just crank up the air.

01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:47,422
SPEAKER_1:  air conditioning. I think that sort of touches on a really, really important point.

01:28:47,778 --> 01:28:49,310
SPEAKER_1:  that for most rich people.

01:28:50,018 --> 01:28:51,230
SPEAKER_1:  much of climate change.

01:28:51,522 --> 01:28:52,638
SPEAKER_1:  is not really gonna be.

01:28:53,058 --> 01:28:55,390
SPEAKER_1:  all that impactful, it still will have an impact.

01:28:55,810 --> 01:28:57,726
SPEAKER_1:  But fundamentally, if you're well off.

01:28:58,274 --> 01:29:00,542
SPEAKER_1:  you can mitigate a lot of these impacts.

01:29:00,674 --> 01:29:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  there's a young scientist at Carnegie Mellon, Destiny Nock.

01:29:04,802 --> 01:29:06,846
SPEAKER_0:  She just was the lead author on a study.

01:29:08,354 --> 01:29:09,054
SPEAKER_0:  with poor.

01:29:09,698 --> 01:29:11,742
SPEAKER_0:  and prosperous households do in a heat wave.

01:29:12,162 --> 01:29:13,694
SPEAKER_0:  when they have access to air conditioning.

01:29:14,370 --> 01:29:15,390
SPEAKER_0:  in a poor household.

01:29:16,034 --> 01:29:16,670
SPEAKER_0:  You wait.

01:29:17,058 --> 01:29:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  they found through science.

01:29:19,586 --> 01:29:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  They delay turning on the air conditioner.

01:29:22,018 --> 01:29:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  four to seven degrees more of heating before they start to use the air conditioner.

01:29:25,506 --> 01:29:29,310
SPEAKER_0:  And that create adverse outcomes if you have an asthmatic in the house, an old person.

01:29:29,922 --> 01:29:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  you're endangering their lives. And that's just a little tiny microscopic.

01:29:35,106 --> 01:29:40,798
SPEAKER_0:  fractal example of this powerful real phenomenon that there's a divide.

01:29:41,410 --> 01:29:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  and vulnerability and it's not just.

01:29:43,458 --> 01:29:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  based on where you live.

01:29:44,770 --> 01:29:46,302
SPEAKER_0:  This is families in Pittsburgh.

01:29:47,074 --> 01:29:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  We're not talking about, you know, Botswana.

01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:52,926
SPEAKER_0:  So that divide in capacity to deal with.

01:29:53,442 --> 01:29:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  environmental stress is.

01:29:55,458 --> 01:29:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  something you can really work on and it gets hidden.

01:29:58,850 --> 01:30:00,871
SPEAKER_0:  in all this talk of climate crisis.

01:30:00,871 --> 01:30:04,830
SPEAKER_1:  And that's one of the important parts is both to say, look.

01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:05,630
SPEAKER_1:  If.

01:30:05,954 --> 01:30:06,558
SPEAKER_1:  Seven.

01:30:06,914 --> 01:30:08,830
SPEAKER_1:  billion people sorry 8 billion people

01:30:09,250 --> 01:30:23,166
SPEAKER_1:  will now have all experienced this, even though for each one of them, it's manageable, it's still a big problem because it's, you know, eight billion people living through this. And the second- And the air conditioning eight billion people. And then it's the point of getting-

01:30:23,394 --> 01:30:27,582
SPEAKER_1:  to realize it's very, very much about how do you help the world's poor.

01:30:27,906 --> 01:30:44,382
SPEAKER_1:  And that's very much about making it more affordable, basically getting them out of poverty. And remember, getting out of poverty doesn't just mean that they can now afford to air condition themselves, but they get better education, they get better opportunities, they get better lives in so many other ways.

01:30:44,898 --> 01:30:45,694
SPEAKER_1:  And then...

01:30:46,114 --> 01:30:51,326
SPEAKER_1:  at the end of it, it's not just about making sure that we focus on this one problem.

01:30:51,554 --> 01:30:58,206
SPEAKER_1:  But it's recognizing that these families and have lots of different issues that they would like us to focus on.

01:30:58,498 --> 01:31:01,150
SPEAKER_1:  climate and heat waves just being one of them.

01:31:01,538 --> 01:31:06,622
SPEAKER_1:  So it's sort of taking progressive steps back and realizing, all right, okay, this is a problem.

01:31:07,426 --> 01:31:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  not the end of the world. And one tiny little last example, we mentioned Jakarta at the beginning.

01:31:12,290 --> 01:31:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  It's really valuable to look around the world places that are sort of leading indicator places.

01:31:16,642 --> 01:31:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  whether it's sea level rise or heat.

01:31:18,722 --> 01:31:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  And you can do that.

01:31:20,226 --> 01:31:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  Jakarta is sinking. Hmm.

01:31:22,274 --> 01:31:26,334
SPEAKER_0:  Like a foot a year, literally a foot a year. It's some insane number.

01:31:27,010 --> 01:31:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  from withdrawing groundwater from.

01:31:29,666 --> 01:31:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  gas withdrawal from, it's a delta, it's sediment, it's built on sediment.

01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  I wrote a piece ages ago at the New York Times calling it Delta Blues, you know, the musicians..

01:31:39,586 --> 01:31:43,422
SPEAKER_0:  So what are they doing? They're moving. They're moving the capital to another country. So, what are they doing? They're moving.

01:31:43,906 --> 01:31:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  area

01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:46,878
SPEAKER_0:  And so that says to me.

01:31:47,778 --> 01:31:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  There's a lot of plasticity too. It's a city that's going through this.

01:31:51,682 --> 01:31:52,798
SPEAKER_0:  That rate of sea level.

01:31:53,634 --> 01:31:55,070
SPEAKER_0:  of their relationship with the sea level.

01:31:55,426 --> 01:31:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  through sinking is way faster than what's happening with global warming.

01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  So look there, look to those kinds of places and you can start to build.

01:32:02,594 --> 01:32:06,750
SPEAKER_1:  Tokyo had the same thing in the 1930s, so we're also withdrawing.

01:32:06,978 --> 01:32:13,566
SPEAKER_1:  a lot to water way too fast. And so, you know, one of the obvious things is maybe you should stop withdrawing water so fast.

01:32:13,858 --> 01:32:21,790
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, and again, we seem to almost be intent on finding the most politically correct way to fix a problem or the most...

01:32:22,242 --> 01:32:26,910
SPEAKER_1:  the thing that sort of gets the most clicks instead of the thing that actually works the best

01:32:27,202 --> 01:32:39,070
SPEAKER_1:  So a lot of these things are really not rocket science solutions. Well, we'll get there. Let me add one more on top of the pile of the worst case analysis. So what people talk about which is hurricanes and earthquakes.

01:32:39,746 --> 01:32:41,630
SPEAKER_1:  does is their connection.

01:32:42,082 --> 01:32:44,798
SPEAKER_1:  that's well understood between climate change.

01:32:46,050 --> 01:32:48,350
SPEAKER_1:  and the increased

01:32:48,994 --> 01:32:52,574
SPEAKER_1:  frequency and intensity of hurricanes and earthquakes.

01:32:52,738 --> 01:32:54,366
SPEAKER_0:  I've dug in on both a lot.

01:32:54,626 --> 01:32:55,358
SPEAKER_0:  The earthquake.

01:32:55,586 --> 01:33:00,926
SPEAKER_0:  connection to climate change I'm not worried about compared to just the earthquake risk that we live with in many parts of the world already.

01:33:01,378 --> 01:33:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  The Himalayas.

01:33:02,946 --> 01:33:05,886
SPEAKER_0:  even with that earthquake in 2015 in Kathmandu.

01:33:06,914 --> 01:33:08,350
SPEAKER_0:  that whole range.

01:33:08,578 --> 01:33:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  is overdue.

01:33:10,082 --> 01:33:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  IV

01:33:10,626 --> 01:33:13,566
SPEAKER_0:  major earthquakes and what has happened in the last 50 years.

01:33:14,178 --> 01:33:17,598
SPEAKER_0:  since they last had big earthquakes, huge development, big cities.

01:33:17,954 --> 01:33:19,454
SPEAKER_0:  a lot of informal construction.

01:33:19,874 --> 01:33:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  like the stuff I wrote about in Istanbul.

01:33:22,082 --> 01:33:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  where the family.

01:33:23,298 --> 01:33:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  builds another layer and another, they put a floor on every time someone gets married has kids, you put another floor in the house. And unfortunately that's, you know.

01:33:31,522 --> 01:33:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  What was the term?

01:33:33,442 --> 01:33:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  Turkish.

01:33:34,914 --> 01:33:35,870
SPEAKER_0:  engineer.

01:33:36,354 --> 01:33:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  Rubble in waiting.

01:33:38,626 --> 01:33:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  It's rubble and waiting and we're looking at it, you know, videotaping it.

01:33:43,138 --> 01:33:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  There are people playing there. So don't worry about the Earthquake connection or climate change.

01:33:46,978 --> 01:33:49,758
SPEAKER_0:  The Hurricanes I've written about for decades.

01:33:51,266 --> 01:33:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  and the most illuminating body of science.

01:33:54,722 --> 01:33:55,134
SPEAKER_0:  Drive.

01:33:55,490 --> 01:33:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  dug in on literally.

01:33:57,698 --> 01:34:02,398
SPEAKER_0:  Related to hurricanes is this field that's emerged gets a tiny bit of money compared to like climate modeling.

01:34:02,882 --> 01:34:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  called Paleo-Tempestology.

01:34:05,570 --> 01:34:06,814
SPEAKER_0:  It's like paleontology, you know?

01:34:07,490 --> 01:34:11,166
SPEAKER_0:  They look for evidence of past hurricanes along coasts.

01:34:11,394 --> 01:34:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  that we care about.

01:34:13,250 --> 01:34:15,678
SPEAKER_0:  and they dig down into the lagoons.

01:34:16,226 --> 01:34:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  behind the barrier beaches along Florida or the Carolinas or in Puerto Rico.

01:34:22,178 --> 01:34:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  And what you have is a history book of past hurricanes.

01:34:24,770 --> 01:34:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  So there's mud, mud, mud, mud, mud, mud, mud, mud, you know, accumulating over centuries. And then there's

01:34:29,858 --> 01:34:30,750
SPEAKER_0:  layer of sand.

01:34:31,714 --> 01:34:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  and seashells. And what that indicates is that there was a great storm.

01:34:35,842 --> 01:34:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  came across the beach, pushed a lot of sediment into the mud.

01:34:39,330 --> 01:34:40,894
SPEAKER_0:  And then there's mutt, mutt, mutt, mutt, mutt, mutt.

01:34:41,410 --> 01:34:42,686
SPEAKER_0:  And when you look at that work...

01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:46,206
SPEAKER_0:  I first wrote about this in 2001 in the Times, a long...

01:34:46,434 --> 01:34:47,102
SPEAKER_0:  Story in then.

01:34:47,906 --> 01:34:48,734
SPEAKER_0:  kept track of these.

01:34:49,538 --> 01:34:51,358
SPEAKER_0:  Intrepid scientists.

01:34:51,842 --> 01:34:53,214
SPEAKER_0:  putting these core tubes down.

01:34:54,178 --> 01:34:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  It shows you that we're in a landscape where...

01:34:56,578 --> 01:34:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  big bad hurricanes are.

01:34:59,842 --> 01:35:01,086
SPEAKER_0:  They're the norm.

01:35:02,690 --> 01:35:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  Something that's rare and big is.

01:35:04,738 --> 01:35:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  Something that's extreme, when you think about the word extreme, right, it means it's at the end of the spectrum of what's possible.

01:35:10,594 --> 01:35:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  They're rare.

01:35:12,354 --> 01:35:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  rare in human time scales.

01:35:14,050 --> 01:35:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:35:15,202 --> 01:35:19,326
SPEAKER_0:  Hurricane Michael four years ago devastated, category five came ashore.

01:35:19,938 --> 01:35:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  in the Panhandle of Florida.

01:35:21,794 --> 01:35:23,166
SPEAKER_0:  level that much photograph.

01:35:23,394 --> 01:35:24,446
SPEAKER_0:  Mexico Beach.

01:35:25,794 --> 01:35:26,526
SPEAKER_0:  And um...

01:35:27,010 --> 01:35:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  People.

01:35:27,714 --> 01:35:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  actually the Tallahassee National Weather Service said unprecedented.

01:35:31,970 --> 01:35:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  hurricane.

01:35:33,698 --> 01:35:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  The damage was unprecedented.

01:35:35,714 --> 01:35:37,374
SPEAKER_0:  because there hadn't been a community there before.

01:35:38,306 --> 01:35:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  But the hurricane was not unprecedented at all. If you look at the history, and this is published research, just that no one bothers to-

01:35:44,866 --> 01:35:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  We have this blind spot.

01:35:46,466 --> 01:35:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  for a.

01:35:48,290 --> 01:35:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  the longer time scale you need to examine if you're thinking about big bad things that are rare.

01:35:52,482 --> 01:35:53,246
SPEAKER_0:  and hurricanes.

01:35:53,474 --> 01:35:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  are still.

01:35:54,498 --> 01:35:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  Rare, I-

01:35:55,458 --> 01:35:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  was recently covering Fort Myers, the awful devastation.

01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:01,886
SPEAKER_0:  There's a young climate scientist at.

01:36:02,242 --> 01:36:02,878
SPEAKER_0:  Florida.

01:36:03,362 --> 01:36:05,598
SPEAKER_0:  Gulf Coast University, Joe Muller.

01:36:06,370 --> 01:36:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  who's done that paleotempastology work there, right in Fort Myers. She lives there and she was away in London at a meeting of reinsurance companies that reinsure all the world's big bad risks.

01:36:15,586 --> 01:36:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  when this was happening.

01:36:17,506 --> 01:36:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  but she has done the work that shows it's a thousand year record of past hurricanes and it's super sobering.

01:36:23,874 --> 01:36:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  when you consider how fast.

01:36:25,858 --> 01:36:26,782
SPEAKER_0:  people have moved into.

01:36:27,682 --> 01:36:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  Florida.

01:36:28,450 --> 01:36:30,622
SPEAKER_0:  and built vulnerably in an area.

01:36:31,490 --> 01:36:33,342
SPEAKER_0:  that hurricanes will hammer.

01:36:33,922 --> 01:36:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  that part of the fundamental dynamics of the Gulf of Mexico and the storms come off of Africa.

01:36:39,106 --> 01:36:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  It's a place where they would come.

01:36:40,898 --> 01:36:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  Now the question of global warming impact is.

01:36:43,874 --> 01:36:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  subtle. There are aspects of hurricanes.

01:36:46,018 --> 01:36:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  that haven't changed.

01:36:47,522 --> 01:36:48,926
SPEAKER_0:  there's aspects like rainfall.

01:36:49,346 --> 01:36:50,110
SPEAKER_0:  that seem pretty.

01:36:51,074 --> 01:36:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  powerfully linked to global warming.

01:36:53,378 --> 01:36:56,990
SPEAKER_0:  warmer atmosphere holds more moisture. So when you have a big disturbance like a...

01:36:57,666 --> 01:36:59,230
SPEAKER_0:  the heat engine of a hurricane comes through it.

01:36:59,682 --> 01:37:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  get more rain.

01:37:00,866 --> 01:37:01,214
SPEAKER_0:

01:37:01,474 --> 01:37:05,150
SPEAKER_0:  this rapid intensification, you know, how quickly these storms.

01:37:06,178 --> 01:37:07,774
SPEAKER_0:  jump from like, you know.

01:37:08,514 --> 01:37:10,238
SPEAKER_0:  Category one to five or four.

01:37:10,594 --> 01:37:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  before they hit.

01:37:12,034 --> 01:37:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  is a new area of science. So I think it's still.

01:37:15,266 --> 01:37:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  early days in knowing.

01:37:16,834 --> 01:37:18,366
SPEAKER_0:  because no one was looking for that.

01:37:19,106 --> 01:37:20,094
SPEAKER_0:  There were no data back-

01:37:20,354 --> 01:37:21,246
SPEAKER_0:  300 years ago.

01:37:21,506 --> 01:37:22,270
SPEAKER_0:  you know, when these...

01:37:22,594 --> 01:37:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  big bad previous hurricanes came to know whether they were rapidly intensified or not.

01:37:27,074 --> 01:37:28,734
SPEAKER_0:  So as a journalist, I try to.

01:37:29,890 --> 01:37:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  you know, keep track of what we don't know, not be too...

01:37:32,930 --> 01:37:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  constrained and

01:37:34,658 --> 01:37:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  Think about new science as being.

01:37:37,474 --> 01:37:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

01:37:38,594 --> 01:37:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  robust unless it's considering and actually actively.

01:37:41,890 --> 01:37:42,686
SPEAKER_0:  stating that

01:37:43,650 --> 01:37:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  We don't really know what's going on with earlier hurricanes.

01:37:46,818 --> 01:37:48,158
SPEAKER_0:  And all of that is swamped.

01:37:48,706 --> 01:37:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  Ultimately, literally.

01:37:50,882 --> 01:37:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  by the vulnerability, building vulnerability.

01:37:53,122 --> 01:37:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  in these areas. If there's a marginal change in a storm...

01:37:58,114 --> 01:38:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  and you've quadrupled or sextupled.

01:38:01,058 --> 01:38:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  how much stuff and how many people are in the way.

01:38:03,810 --> 01:38:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  And if some of those people are poor and vulnerable.

01:38:06,434 --> 01:38:07,134
SPEAKER_0:  or elderly and

01:38:07,426 --> 01:38:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  Can't swim.

01:38:08,994 --> 01:38:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  you're creating a landscape of destruction.

01:38:11,362 --> 01:38:11,742
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:38:12,386 --> 01:38:16,574
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of the human suffering that has to do with storms is about

01:38:17,218 --> 01:38:18,750
SPEAKER_1:  where and how you build.

01:38:19,970 --> 01:38:26,398
SPEAKER_1:  versus the frequency and the intensity of storms. So you didn't quite answer the question.

01:38:27,106 --> 01:38:35,838
SPEAKER_1:  You know, when I'm having a beer with people at a bar and they say, Hey, why are you having a beer? We're all going to die because of climate change. Usually what they bring up.

01:38:36,738 --> 01:38:38,613
SPEAKER_1:  And I'm just trying to add some levi-

01:38:38,613 --> 01:38:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  This is good.

01:38:39,458 --> 01:38:50,462
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, usually what they bring up is, you know, the hurricanes and the recent, most recent hurricanes saying like this, they're, they're getting crazy hurricanes all the time. They're getting.

01:38:50,850 --> 01:38:53,278
SPEAKER_1:  more intense, more frequent and so on.

01:38:53,762 --> 01:38:55,198
SPEAKER_1:  That's is there.

01:38:55,650 --> 01:38:58,942
SPEAKER_1:  I'm sure there's incredible science going on trying to look at this.

01:38:59,362 --> 01:39:01,438
SPEAKER_1:  Is there, is it possible?

01:39:01,698 --> 01:39:04,062
SPEAKER_1:  Is there evidence and is it possible to have evidence?

01:39:04,322 --> 01:39:05,534
SPEAKER_1:  that there's a connection.

01:39:06,338 --> 01:39:07,198
SPEAKER_1:  between.

01:39:07,778 --> 01:39:14,110
SPEAKER_1:  what we can call global warming and the increased frequency and intensity of storms. the

01:39:14,242 --> 01:39:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  No, thank you.

01:39:15,842 --> 01:39:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  Well, you added intensity, you know.

01:39:19,330 --> 01:39:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  It's, it's...

01:39:20,642 --> 01:39:22,942
SPEAKER_0:  Let me just get into this a tiny bit more.1509

01:39:23,970 --> 01:39:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  I grew up with them in Rhode Island in my youth and there was a very active period of hurricanes in New England.

01:39:30,466 --> 01:39:32,190
SPEAKER_0:  in the 50s and 60s, 70s.

01:39:32,930 --> 01:39:33,470
SPEAKER_0:  And then.

01:39:33,858 --> 01:39:37,374
SPEAKER_0:  in the North Atlantic generally was very, very active.

01:39:37,698 --> 01:39:38,814
SPEAKER_0:  50 when I was a kid.

01:39:39,362 --> 01:39:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:39:40,610 --> 01:39:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  dynamics of them forming off of Africa and coming here circling up the coast was just primetime.

01:39:47,234 --> 01:39:47,902
SPEAKER_0:  Then there was like

01:39:48,226 --> 01:39:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  what Kerry Emanuel, who's the.

01:39:50,146 --> 01:39:50,494
SPEAKER_0:  must

01:39:51,170 --> 01:39:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  experienced hurricane climate scientists around at MIT.

01:39:55,810 --> 01:39:59,774
SPEAKER_0:  He was in, he's in this story. He's in my 1988 article.

01:40:01,154 --> 01:40:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  He-

01:40:02,018 --> 01:40:04,638
SPEAKER_0:  and colleagues have found and others that.

01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:07,134
SPEAKER_0:  There's what they call the hurricane drought.

01:40:07,778 --> 01:40:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  from like the 70s through about 1994.

01:40:10,914 --> 01:40:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  in the Atlantic, specifically the Atlantic basin.

01:40:13,570 --> 01:40:14,046
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:40:14,466 --> 01:40:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  been a lot of questions about that. People thought it was ocean circulation, something about the the currents.

01:40:18,914 --> 01:40:20,286
SPEAKER_0:  This is multi-decade old.

01:40:21,154 --> 01:40:22,878
SPEAKER_0:  variabilities in the oceans, right?

01:40:23,810 --> 01:40:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  And then now it looks.

01:40:26,562 --> 01:40:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  Robustly, I can't find a climate scientist who disagrees.

01:40:30,370 --> 01:40:32,350
SPEAKER_0:  that the thing that caused the drought.

01:40:32,898 --> 01:40:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  was pollution, smog.

01:40:36,194 --> 01:40:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:40:36,994 --> 01:40:41,246
SPEAKER_0:  significantly in Europe. And you're saying, well, how does smog in Europe relate to hurricanes?

01:40:42,082 --> 01:40:43,582
SPEAKER_0:  crossing the Atlantic and getting to.

01:40:44,546 --> 01:40:46,334
SPEAKER_0:  the United States. It's because of

01:40:46,914 --> 01:40:48,638
SPEAKER_0:  The smog was changing.

01:40:48,994 --> 01:40:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  the behavior of the Sahara Desert, which is just south of Europe.

01:40:53,186 --> 01:40:56,286
SPEAKER_0:  And the Sahara Desert kills hurricanes.

01:40:56,898 --> 01:41:00,734
SPEAKER_0:  sand and dust coming off the Sahara. You can see this every year when that's active.

01:41:01,570 --> 01:41:05,694
SPEAKER_0:  stifles these big storms at the point right in their nursery. They all form.

01:41:06,050 --> 01:41:08,542
SPEAKER_0:  there's this area for hurricanes off of West Africa.

01:41:09,058 --> 01:41:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  That's like the nursery zone.

01:41:10,658 --> 01:41:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  And so if you're stifling those heart gains because of pollution,

01:41:13,602 --> 01:41:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  in Europe.

01:41:15,426 --> 01:41:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  before the Clean Air Act's kind of cleanups.

01:41:19,202 --> 01:41:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:41:19,938 --> 01:41:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  And then that goes away.

01:41:21,762 --> 01:41:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  None of that has anything to do with global warming.

01:41:23,938 --> 01:41:28,030
SPEAKER_0:  That's another kind of forcing in the climate system, a local one that created a regional dynamic.

01:41:28,770 --> 01:41:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  that created a quiet period.

01:41:30,754 --> 01:41:32,126
SPEAKER_0:  when all these friends in the bar...

01:41:33,186 --> 01:41:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe they were born.

01:41:35,586 --> 01:41:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  in the 90s or whatever.

01:41:37,410 --> 01:41:38,814
SPEAKER_0:  They grew up in an area of like.

01:41:39,266 --> 01:41:39,614
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

01:41:39,970 --> 01:41:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  No, hurricanes weren't a big deal.

01:41:43,394 --> 01:41:46,814
SPEAKER_0:  And now we have an end to that drought because we cleaned up the air pollution.

01:41:47,074 --> 01:41:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  the sooty kind of air pollution, sulfury.

01:41:49,986 --> 01:41:50,494
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:41:51,426 --> 01:41:56,382
SPEAKER_0:  Anyone who says global warming, global warming without saying, well, that's in there too, is kind of missing.

01:41:57,154 --> 01:41:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  And when you look globally...

01:41:59,522 --> 01:42:04,798
SPEAKER_0:  You know, there's still, I think it was at 90 or so hurricanes a year, cyclones, hurricanes, typhoons.

01:42:05,378 --> 01:42:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  globally. That hasn't changed. The number of

01:42:07,874 --> 01:42:09,598
SPEAKER_0:  these tropical storms that reach.

01:42:10,274 --> 01:42:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  that ferocity has not changed.

01:42:12,386 --> 01:42:14,014
SPEAKER_0:  It's just a fundamental dynamic of.

01:42:14,626 --> 01:42:17,406
SPEAKER_0:  And by the way, on the long time scale, the models.

01:42:18,658 --> 01:42:19,678
SPEAKER_0:  still indicate.

01:42:20,290 --> 01:42:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  as you warm the planet. And remember the Arctic warms quicker.

01:42:23,874 --> 01:42:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  This is something people probably understand.

01:42:27,330 --> 01:42:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  you're actually evening out the imbalance between the heat at the equator

01:42:31,682 --> 01:42:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  and the cold at the...

01:42:32,834 --> 01:42:34,558
SPEAKER_0:  in the northern part of the hemisphere.

01:42:35,298 --> 01:42:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  and that calms the whole system down. So there could be fewer hurricanes.

01:42:39,266 --> 01:42:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  later in the century because of global warming.

01:42:42,594 --> 01:42:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  And for me, that's a lot of information, but if I'm in a bar...

01:42:46,722 --> 01:42:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  I start with, what do you care about?

01:42:49,378 --> 01:42:50,142
SPEAKER_0:  about safety.

01:42:50,434 --> 01:42:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  care about security, you care about.

01:42:53,378 --> 01:42:57,694
SPEAKER_0:  having everybody safe, not just you. You get in your car and you can evacuate. What about the old person?

01:42:58,434 --> 01:43:00,030
SPEAKER_0:  you know, or the poor family.

01:43:00,770 --> 01:43:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  who can't do that, they're not gonna leave their house.

01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  What are we doing to limit vulnerability now?

01:43:06,882 --> 01:43:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  I circle back to that over and over again. I have like a pocket card.

01:43:11,106 --> 01:43:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  graphic card I created about risk.

01:43:14,882 --> 01:43:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  What we really care about is climate risk.

01:43:16,962 --> 01:43:17,758
SPEAKER_0:  Like who's at risk?

01:43:18,434 --> 01:43:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  What's driving the risk?

01:43:19,682 --> 01:43:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  How do you reduce that? It's a card, you can almost pull it out in a bar. I should print them. You should do that. A risk is the hazard.

01:43:27,490 --> 01:43:30,974
SPEAKER_0:  Risk is the hazard, like, you know, the hazard is.

01:43:32,002 --> 01:43:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  is a storm.

01:43:34,242 --> 01:43:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  times exposure.

01:43:35,842 --> 01:43:36,478
SPEAKER_0:  how many people.

01:43:36,706 --> 01:43:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  how much stuff.

01:43:38,818 --> 01:43:40,030
SPEAKER_0:  Factoring in.

01:43:40,738 --> 01:43:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  Vulnerability.

01:43:42,178 --> 01:43:42,846
SPEAKER_0:  or resilience.

01:43:43,746 --> 01:43:44,190
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:43:45,378 --> 01:43:46,814
SPEAKER_0:  Climate change is changing the hazard.

01:43:47,970 --> 01:43:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  for some things, not for tornadoes, not for everything.

01:43:51,714 --> 01:43:52,638
SPEAKER_0:  Exposure?

01:43:52,994 --> 01:43:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  is this expanding bullseye. This is another hashtag, expanding bullseye.

01:43:57,570 --> 01:44:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  out there and look for that and you'll see.

01:44:00,866 --> 01:44:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  pushing these two geographers.

01:44:02,594 --> 01:44:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  Do this for every hazard. wildlife

01:44:05,890 --> 01:44:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  Earthquake.

01:44:06,978 --> 01:44:07,390
SPEAKER_0:  flood.

01:44:08,002 --> 01:44:08,798
SPEAKER_0:  Coastal Storm.

01:44:09,570 --> 01:44:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  and we're building and expanding bullseye in an area where nature is throwing darts.

01:44:14,050 --> 01:44:16,926
SPEAKER_0:  Some of the darts are getting bigger because of global warming. Some of the darts we don't know.

01:44:17,762 --> 01:44:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  What do you do?

01:44:19,106 --> 01:44:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  What do you do? Well, you get out of the way. You don't want to be on the dartboard.

01:44:23,010 --> 01:44:25,566
SPEAKER_0:  And that, it just simplifies the whole formula.

01:44:26,434 --> 01:44:29,278
SPEAKER_0:  To me, it's kind of a transformational.

01:44:30,178 --> 01:44:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  potential.

01:44:32,770 --> 01:44:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  to go into a bar. Maybe I should print these things. 100%.

01:44:36,226 --> 01:44:37,351
SPEAKER_1:  as you go to the with you

01:44:37,351 --> 01:44:39,601
SPEAKER_0:  They should be coasters in bars.

01:44:39,601 --> 01:44:42,110
SPEAKER_1:  fascinating about smog and I mean just

01:44:42,370 --> 01:44:52,926
SPEAKER_1:  It's nice to be reminded about how complicated and fascinating the weather system is. Let me try to answer the questions slightly quicker before your friends have drunk too much.

01:44:53,282 --> 01:44:56,414
SPEAKER_1:  Never enough. Or not enough.

01:44:56,866 --> 01:44:57,342
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:44:57,922 --> 01:44:58,974
SPEAKER_1:  So if you look at.

01:44:59,202 --> 01:45:05,214
SPEAKER_1:  the amount of the number of hurricanes, as Andy rightly pointed out.

01:45:05,506 --> 01:45:06,014
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:45:06,306 --> 01:45:13,854
SPEAKER_1:  It doesn't look like it's changing. So we see more because we have now much better detection systems with satellites.

01:45:14,114 --> 01:45:20,702
SPEAKER_1:  But if you look since 1980, when we have good satellite coverage, for instance last year,

01:45:21,730 --> 01:45:24,926
SPEAKER_1:  was the year that had the lowest number of hurricanes in the world.

01:45:25,986 --> 01:45:32,382
SPEAKER_1:  And you're sort of like, that's odd because it's probably the year where I heard the most about hurricanes.

01:45:32,642 --> 01:45:36,446
SPEAKER_1:  And what that tells you is that just because you hear a lot about hurricanes doesn't actually mean

01:45:36,674 --> 01:45:43,294
SPEAKER_1:  that there is a lot of hurricanes. You can't just go that way. If you remember in the 1990s and 2000s,

01:45:43,618 --> 01:45:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  There was an enormous amount of talk about how violence, how crime was getting worse in the US, while all the objective indicators showed that it was going down.

01:45:53,346 --> 01:45:55,550
SPEAKER_1:  There's sufficient amount of violence.

01:45:55,842 --> 01:46:00,062
SPEAKER_1:  that you can fill every radio and TV show with a new crime.

01:46:00,642 --> 01:46:04,222
SPEAKER_1:  And so if you get more and more TV shows that talk about crime,

01:46:04,706 --> 01:46:09,406
SPEAKER_1:  Actually, most people end up thinking that there's more crime while the real number is going down.

01:46:10,338 --> 01:46:11,326
SPEAKER_1:  The reality here is...

01:46:12,066 --> 01:46:12,606
SPEAKER_1:  Yes.

01:46:13,282 --> 01:46:14,110
SPEAKER_1:  climate change.

01:46:14,434 --> 01:46:15,678
SPEAKER_1:  will probably affect.

01:46:16,066 --> 01:46:18,046
SPEAKER_1:  hurricanes in the sense that they'll

01:46:18,466 --> 01:46:21,534
SPEAKER_1:  be the same number, slightly fewer as Andy was mentioning.

01:46:21,794 --> 01:46:24,318
SPEAKER_1:  but they will likely be somewhat stronger.

01:46:24,610 --> 01:46:26,238
SPEAKER_1:  This seems to be...

01:46:26,978 --> 01:46:31,582
SPEAKER_1:  the best outcome. We're not sure, but this seems to be the outcome. And it's important to remember

01:46:32,130 --> 01:46:33,374
SPEAKER_1:  Stronger is worse.

01:46:33,762 --> 01:46:34,942
SPEAKER_1:  then fewer is better.

01:46:35,746 --> 01:46:36,702
SPEAKER_1:  So overall.

01:46:37,378 --> 01:46:38,398
SPEAKER_1:  Climate will make...

01:46:38,722 --> 01:46:40,318
SPEAKER_1:  the world a little bit worse.

01:46:40,962 --> 01:46:45,630
SPEAKER_1:  So that's the sort of bottom line, and that's the real issue here.

01:46:45,954 --> 01:46:54,398
SPEAKER_1:  all the other things, the fact that people are much more vulnerable is just vastly outweigh this, which is why if you look at the impact...

01:46:54,850 --> 01:46:57,566
SPEAKER_1:  of hurricanes and impact of pretty much everything.

01:46:57,826 --> 01:46:59,742
SPEAKER_1:  It is typically going down.

01:47:00,066 --> 01:47:08,318
SPEAKER_1:  If you look, for instance, in percent of GDP, you have to look at percent of GDP because if you have twice as many houses, obviously the same kind of impact will have twice.

01:47:08,546 --> 01:47:11,358
SPEAKER_1:  the impact or if they're worth twice as much.

01:47:12,002 --> 01:47:16,990
SPEAKER_1:  If you do that in percent of GDP and even the UN says that's how you should measure it, it's going down.

01:47:17,282 --> 01:47:17,854
SPEAKER_1:  Why is that?

01:47:18,178 --> 01:47:26,814
SPEAKER_1:  It's because we're becoming more resilient. Yeah. Just simply we, you know, if you look at what happens with when hurricanes come in, we have much better prediction in the long run.

01:47:27,106 --> 01:47:30,110
SPEAKER_1:  That means you now know two or three days out.

01:47:30,402 --> 01:47:34,398
SPEAKER_1:  that there's a big hurricane that's likely to come here? What does that mean? All the-

01:47:34,754 --> 01:47:38,718
SPEAKER_1:  things that can be moved. So typically all buses, all trucks.

01:47:38,978 --> 01:47:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  Everything that's not bolted down will leave this area. And so you'll get less damage from that. You will have more people knowing, oh, this is gonna be a big one. They moved to their relatives somewhere else. So you'll have fewer people being vulnerable.

01:47:52,162 --> 01:47:54,787
SPEAKER_0:  There's a lot of- If people are responsive and aware. Yeah.

01:47:54,787 --> 01:47:56,190
SPEAKER_1:  There's a lot of ways you can do this.

01:47:57,026 --> 01:48:00,670
SPEAKER_1:  The outcome, and this is important for the whole conversation, the outcome is...

01:48:00,930 --> 01:48:03,198
SPEAKER_1:  that we're actually becoming less vulnerable.

01:48:03,618 --> 01:48:04,222
SPEAKER_1:  and the

01:48:04,482 --> 01:48:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  Damages are-

01:48:05,794 --> 01:48:08,222
SPEAKER_1:  becoming smaller, not bigger, but...

01:48:08,930 --> 01:48:10,462
SPEAKER_1:  had there not been global warming.

01:48:10,850 --> 01:48:13,214
SPEAKER_1:  it would probably have gone down even faster.

01:48:13,570 --> 01:48:15,742
SPEAKER_1:  So we would have become even better off.

01:48:16,130 --> 01:48:16,670
SPEAKER_1:  quicker.

01:48:16,962 --> 01:48:18,206
SPEAKER_1:  had there been no global warming.

01:48:18,434 --> 01:48:22,846
SPEAKER_1:  But this is a crucial difference, and this is what I find really hard to communicate.

01:48:23,170 --> 01:48:24,542
SPEAKER_1:  Climate change is not this.

01:48:24,770 --> 01:48:29,630
SPEAKER_1:  Oh my God, everything is going off the charts and we're all going to be doomed kind of thing.

01:48:30,050 --> 01:48:34,334
SPEAKER_1:  Climate change is a thing that means we're going to get better.

01:48:34,690 --> 01:48:35,998
SPEAKER_1:  slightly slower.

01:48:36,610 --> 01:48:43,550
SPEAKER_1:  And that's a very, very different kind of attitude. It's one of the many problems rather than, this is the end of all of us.

01:48:43,810 --> 01:48:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  And by the way, if you look at what's happening in the world.

01:48:46,626 --> 01:48:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:48:47,618 --> 01:48:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  The data also show...

01:48:49,474 --> 01:48:55,102
SPEAKER_0:  in rich places and poor places, we still are moving into zones of hazard faster than climate is changing.

01:48:55,650 --> 01:48:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  Beth Tellman.

01:48:57,378 --> 01:48:59,358
SPEAKER_0:  was at Columbia and she moved to Arizona.

01:48:59,746 --> 01:49:02,942
SPEAKER_0:  She and colleagues at this outfit called Cloud to Street.

01:49:03,394 --> 01:49:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  did an amazing study showing.

01:49:05,346 --> 01:49:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  This is a year or so ago I wrote about showing.

01:49:08,098 --> 01:49:11,678
SPEAKER_0:  Again, we're moving into zones of hazard, which it applies to me.

01:49:12,610 --> 01:49:13,822
SPEAKER_0:  Just what Bjorn was saying that.

01:49:14,626 --> 01:49:16,606
SPEAKER_0:  We wouldn't be, people wouldn't be doing that if.

01:49:17,090 --> 01:49:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  They thought that was going to lead to devastation. And this is today.

01:49:21,314 --> 01:49:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  We're doing this now and it's flood.

01:49:23,298 --> 01:49:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  Flood zones, wildfire zones.

01:49:25,890 --> 01:49:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  So that means there's these things to do.

01:49:29,762 --> 01:49:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  There's so much plasticity in human behavior and how we build and...

01:49:33,826 --> 01:49:37,054
SPEAKER_0:  where we build. You can make a big, big change in the outcomes.

01:49:37,634 --> 01:49:40,254
SPEAKER_1:  Wait, one of the things to remember is, you know, people move...

01:49:40,642 --> 01:49:51,870
SPEAKER_1:  to where hurricanes hit because when they're not there, it's a really beautiful place to be. Yeah, yeah. Right, so in many ways, we make the trade-offs and say, look, I'm happy to live.

01:49:52,194 --> 01:49:59,742
SPEAKER_1:  have an ocean view and then maybe a hurricane is going to hit. Of course, it becomes a lot easier than when the federal government is actually subsidizing your risk.

01:49:59,970 --> 01:50:04,926
SPEAKER_1:  By saying, we'll ensure you're really cheaply. Uh, and that's one of the things that we should stop doing.

01:50:05,762 --> 01:50:10,942
SPEAKER_1:  We should actually tell people, look, if you want to live where hurricanes hit, maybe you should be more careful.

01:50:11,170 --> 01:50:12,862
SPEAKER_0:  By the way, what I was saying about...

01:50:13,410 --> 01:50:15,518
SPEAKER_0:  past storms, the paleotempestology.

01:50:16,066 --> 01:50:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  past fires, it's the same thing. We've suppressed fire.

01:50:20,066 --> 01:50:22,558
SPEAKER_0:  in the United States for 100 years through much of the West.

01:50:23,170 --> 01:50:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  through.

01:50:24,226 --> 01:50:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:50:24,930 --> 01:50:27,646
SPEAKER_0:  wanting to save the forests, you know, the whole smokey the bear thing.

01:50:28,226 --> 01:50:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  Don't stop.

01:50:28,994 --> 01:50:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  when these are landscapes that evolved to burn.

01:50:32,546 --> 01:50:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  And what happened in the last 100 years?

01:50:34,498 --> 01:50:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  people love the West. We love these environments. We love to live with the trees.

01:50:39,170 --> 01:50:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  the Boulder County area.

01:50:40,674 --> 01:50:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  explosive development in zones of implicit hazard.

01:50:44,258 --> 01:50:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  leads to big bad outcomes when conditions align and climate change is worsening some of those conditions and sometimes it's really counterintuitive.

01:50:52,098 --> 01:50:54,302
SPEAKER_0:  wet season builds more grass.

01:50:55,010 --> 01:50:57,278
SPEAKER_0:  Dry season comes along, parches the grass.

01:50:57,794 --> 01:51:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  Then comes a human ignition. It's almost always human ignitions.

01:51:01,794 --> 01:51:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  And then you have this disaster where a thousand homes burn in Boulder County.

01:51:05,314 --> 01:51:05,918
SPEAKER_0:  And it's like.

01:51:06,754 --> 01:51:08,702
SPEAKER_0:  There's so many elements there that can be worked on.

01:51:10,498 --> 01:51:11,486
SPEAKER_0:  Give me confidence.

01:51:12,450 --> 01:51:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  that we can.

01:51:14,466 --> 01:51:18,526
SPEAKER_0:  change these outcomes. Natural disasters are not natural disasters.

01:51:19,170 --> 01:51:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  designed really, some people say.

01:51:21,090 --> 01:51:23,678
SPEAKER_1:  Can I take a quick aside and ask about-

01:51:24,194 --> 01:51:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  terminology of climate change and global warming. Yeah, you use it.

01:51:28,386 --> 01:51:29,374
SPEAKER_1:  interchangeably.

01:51:29,794 --> 01:51:30,846
SPEAKER_1:  It isn't a side, but.

01:51:31,330 --> 01:51:32,958
SPEAKER_1:  That's one that's worthy of taking.

01:51:33,474 --> 01:51:35,742
SPEAKER_1:  Do those carry different meanings?

01:51:36,034 --> 01:51:38,622
SPEAKER_1:  And has that meaning changed over the years?

01:51:39,362 --> 01:51:42,782
SPEAKER_1:  Between those two terms, are they really equivalent?

01:51:43,170 --> 01:51:45,854
SPEAKER_0:  Well, some people say there was this industry or...

01:51:46,306 --> 01:51:48,222
SPEAKER_0:  propagandistic shift from.

01:51:50,338 --> 01:51:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  Let's see, what was it? Which came first? Oh no, they're going to climate change now. Like it's a new thing. We're just

01:51:55,170 --> 01:51:56,254
SPEAKER_0:  It's ridiculous.

01:51:56,930 --> 01:51:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

01:52:00,258 --> 01:52:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  In 1988, it wasn't the Intergovernmental Panel on Global Warming.

01:52:04,002 --> 01:52:04,894
SPEAKER_0:  It was on climate change.

01:52:05,474 --> 01:52:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  So this...

01:52:07,042 --> 01:52:11,198
SPEAKER_0:  These terms have been there, they've been sort of evolving. When I wrote this cover story, it was the greenhouse effect.

01:52:11,810 --> 01:52:12,935
SPEAKER_0:  So green and that's fall.

01:52:12,935 --> 01:52:14,435
SPEAKER_1:  on a favorite greenhouse effect is not

01:52:14,435 --> 01:52:22,357
SPEAKER_0:  often talked about. Well, it's really that's the physical effect that's holding in the heat. But see, it's not a good there's terms that mean.

01:52:22,357 --> 01:52:26,206
SPEAKER_1:  stuff and there's terms that actually used in public discourse.

01:52:26,658 --> 01:52:28,190
SPEAKER_1:  to designate what your.

01:52:28,706 --> 01:52:29,438
SPEAKER_1:  A whole.

01:52:29,922 --> 01:52:32,222
SPEAKER_1:  umbrella of opinions you have.

01:52:32,482 --> 01:52:35,774
SPEAKER_1:  And I guess it's somebody, me, who doesn't pay attention.

01:52:36,322 --> 01:52:37,886
SPEAKER_1:  uh... to this carefully

01:52:38,498 --> 01:52:42,526
SPEAKER_1:  You have to use terms carefully. Sure. Because people will-

01:52:43,234 --> 01:52:43,582
SPEAKER_1:  You know.

01:52:44,066 --> 01:52:47,550
SPEAKER_1:  and and new that rose into the topic will often use terms

01:52:47,810 --> 01:52:49,918
SPEAKER_1:  to mean exactly what they mean, like literally.

01:52:50,338 --> 01:52:55,326
SPEAKER_1:  but they actually have political implications and all that kind of stuff. I guess I'm asking, is there like...

01:52:55,746 --> 01:52:59,966
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, is, is there, uh, are you signaling something by using

01:53:00,226 --> 01:53:04,085
SPEAKER_1:  global warming versus climate change, are people have calmed down in terms of

01:53:04,085 --> 01:53:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  of the use of these. You've got an

01:53:06,594 --> 01:53:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  newspapers made it worse.

01:53:08,578 --> 01:53:11,198
SPEAKER_0:  Now they have their style book, you know, every newspaper has a.

01:53:12,002 --> 01:53:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  They they

01:53:12,962 --> 01:53:17,758
SPEAKER_0:  prescribed, they don't want their reporters to use any of those terms anymore. They call it climate crisis.

01:53:18,050 --> 01:53:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  Oh no.

01:53:19,650 --> 01:53:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  Oh yeah. Global heating. It's literally in their rule book.

01:53:22,338 --> 01:53:23,463
SPEAKER_0:  global heating that's all

01:53:23,463 --> 01:53:25,566
SPEAKER_1:  more intense. And that was the point.

01:53:25,762 --> 01:53:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I wrote about the global heating.

01:53:28,386 --> 01:53:31,294
SPEAKER_0:  more than a decade ago, that's been around. But you know, so they're

01:53:31,906 --> 01:53:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  They're doing the...

01:53:33,410 --> 01:53:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  What was the movie where the?

01:53:35,426 --> 01:53:45,054
SPEAKER_0:  the comedy, the rock and roll comedy where he sets his, his amplifier goes to 11. You know, the idea that you turn up the rhetorical volume that's going to change people's.

01:53:45,154 --> 01:54:16,318
SPEAKER_1:  It's ridiculous. So for me, I use global warming and climate change interchangeably. And I think it's fair. There's some technical ways that you can differentiate them. But the reality is global warming is probably a better way to describe a lot of it, because this is really what is the main driver of what we worry about. Climate change seems a little diffuse, but it's convenient to, when you talk about climate all the time, that you can call both of them. But I think the climate crisis and the climate catastrophe

01:54:16,546 --> 01:54:18,782
SPEAKER_1:  is really sort of the amping up.

01:54:19,170 --> 01:54:22,686
SPEAKER_1:  of a catastrophe and again as we've talked about before.

01:54:22,946 --> 01:54:24,766
SPEAKER_1:  If it really were true, we should

01:54:25,186 --> 01:54:25,758
SPEAKER_1:  help people.

01:54:26,146 --> 01:54:40,446
SPEAKER_1:  But if it's not true, and I think there's a lot of reasons why this is not a, you know, a climate catastrophe, this is a problem. Uh, we're actually doing everyone a disservice because we end up making people so worried that they say, we got to fix this in 12 years or whatever the number is.

01:54:40,706 --> 01:54:51,934
SPEAKER_1:  And also that it makes it almost impossible to have a conversation of, well, maybe we should be focusing on vulnerability first. And a lot of people, and I think a lot of well-meaning.

01:54:52,322 --> 01:54:53,758
SPEAKER_1:  uh... and well-intentioned people

01:54:54,050 --> 01:55:01,854
SPEAKER_1:  feel that it's almost sacrilegious to say it's about vulnerability because you're taking away

01:55:02,082 --> 01:55:13,389
SPEAKER_1:  You, the guilt of climate change, you're taking away our focus on, on, on dealing with climate change, whereas I think we would say it's about stuff that actually works and doing that for.

01:55:13,389 --> 01:55:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  By and by making it about

01:55:16,482 --> 01:55:20,062
SPEAKER_0:  carbon dioxide, you're implicitly making it about fossil fuels.

01:55:20,706 --> 01:55:24,446
SPEAKER_0:  which implicitly gives you another great narrative, good guy, bad guy.

01:55:25,602 --> 01:55:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  It's these big companies.

01:55:27,362 --> 01:55:28,487
SPEAKER_0:  Where's the source of-

01:55:28,487 --> 01:55:29,182
SPEAKER_1:  alarmism.

01:55:30,082 --> 01:55:30,686
SPEAKER_1:  So...

01:55:31,106 --> 01:55:37,150
SPEAKER_1:  Is it the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change? There's a chain here.

01:55:37,762 --> 01:55:44,318
SPEAKER_1:  Is there somebody to blame along the chain or is this some kind of weird complex system where everybody encourages each other?

01:55:44,546 --> 01:55:46,718
SPEAKER_1:  Can you point to one place? Is it the media?

01:55:46,946 --> 01:55:53,790
SPEAKER_1:  Is it the scientists? I think the UN climate panel is fundamentally a really good climate research group.

01:55:54,082 --> 01:56:02,782
SPEAKER_1:  You can have some quibbles with the way that they summarize it in politically coordinated documents and stuff. But fundamentally, I think they do a good job.

01:56:03,106 --> 01:56:05,566
SPEAKER_1:  of putting together all the research.

01:56:05,922 --> 01:56:13,342
SPEAKER_1:  This also means it's incredibly boring to read, which is why virtually nobody does. I'm sure you have, but I'm pretty sure a lot of-

01:56:13,570 --> 01:56:29,182
SPEAKER_1:  climate journalists have never sort of looked past the, at least the summary for policymakers. So they- You're on a climate panel, they do like a, they do predictions as well? No, well, they pull together all the stuff that people have published in the period literature.

01:56:29,602 --> 01:56:34,846
SPEAKER_1:  and then try to summarize it and basically tell you what's up and down with climate change.

01:56:35,202 --> 01:56:36,286
SPEAKER_1:  They do that in four.

01:56:36,738 --> 01:56:40,830
SPEAKER_1:  four large volumes every four to five, six, seven years or something.

01:56:41,314 --> 01:56:48,990
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, and, um, and yes, it's, it's, you know, I think it's the gold plated version of what we know. Uh, there tends to be a lot of.

01:56:49,346 --> 01:56:50,174
SPEAKER_1:  Umm...

01:56:50,498 --> 01:57:05,758
SPEAKER_1:  Well, this is what they say. Actually, they say so many different places with so many different people that it's not quite clear exactly what they're saying often. You can find contradictions between one volume with one set of authors and another. But, yeah.

01:57:06,210 --> 01:57:08,830
SPEAKER_1:  I think this is fundamentally the right.

01:57:09,506 --> 01:57:10,718
SPEAKER_1:  way that we know about.

01:57:11,394 --> 01:57:11,710
SPEAKER_1:  climate.

01:57:12,706 --> 01:57:15,166
SPEAKER_1:  but then it gets translated into

01:57:15,490 --> 01:57:21,310
SPEAKER_1:  How do you know about this? When most people don't read these 4,000 pages, you read a new story.

01:57:21,570 --> 01:57:22,718
SPEAKER_1:  in a newspaper.

01:57:23,106 --> 01:57:32,254
SPEAKER_1:  And that new story will be very, very heavily slanted towards, you know, if, if you say, so sea levels could rise somewhere between one and three foot.

01:57:32,866 --> 01:57:33,630
SPEAKER_1:  What do you hear?

01:57:34,146 --> 01:57:40,126
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, you obviously hear the three foot. Three foot is just more fun, more scary, more interesting than one foot.

01:57:40,514 --> 01:57:53,630
SPEAKER_1:  And it's that way with all of these, you know, so what was the prediction for temperature rises? It's somewhere from not very scary to pretty damn scary. And again, you hear the pretty damn scary all the time.

01:57:53,922 --> 01:58:00,734
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, and, and then there's, there's obviously always researchers who are saying, well, but actually could be a little more scary than that.

01:58:01,026 --> 01:58:05,566
SPEAKER_1:  And then there are likewise research who say, well, it's probably not going to be as scary as that.

01:58:05,858 --> 01:58:08,350
SPEAKER_1:  And most of the journalists will.

01:58:08,642 --> 01:58:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  you know, interview. Do you really put the blame fundamentally on the journalist? I put it on the media setup. Look, media is simply trying to get.

01:58:18,018 --> 01:58:19,454
SPEAKER_1:  clicks or sell newspapers.

01:58:19,682 --> 01:58:22,014
SPEAKER_1:  And if you were just going to say.

01:58:22,274 --> 01:58:27,390
SPEAKER_1:  This is not a big issue. It just doesn't sell anything. But I think you're probably much better able to.

01:58:27,618 --> 01:58:28,670
SPEAKER_1:  address this.

01:58:30,018 --> 01:58:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  Folks can Google for my name Revkin and.

01:58:33,154 --> 01:58:34,814
SPEAKER_0:  the words front page thought.

01:58:35,810 --> 01:58:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  in the newsroom.

01:58:37,730 --> 01:58:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  every afternoon.

01:58:38,914 --> 01:58:41,662
SPEAKER_0:  Now we have a 24-7 news cycle, so it's different.

01:58:43,010 --> 01:58:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  back in the day, the New York Times, when it was flourishing.

01:58:46,082 --> 01:58:48,734
SPEAKER_0:  print institution. Every afternoon there was a front page meeting.

01:58:49,346 --> 01:58:51,006
SPEAKER_0:  and the big PoohBah editors go in there.

01:58:51,362 --> 01:58:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  and the desk editors come in with their pitches for the day.

01:58:54,658 --> 01:58:58,046
SPEAKER_0:  and my friend Corey Dean, who is the science editor for a chunk of my time.

01:58:59,266 --> 01:59:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I remember having a conversation with her about.

01:59:02,178 --> 01:59:05,598
SPEAKER_0:  some new study of, I think it was Greenland, the ice sheet.

01:59:06,146 --> 01:59:08,958
SPEAKER_0:  I laid it out for her and she said, where's the front page thought in that?

01:59:10,626 --> 01:59:11,774
SPEAKER_0:  So we're all set up.

01:59:12,674 --> 01:59:13,854
SPEAKER_0:  Look for the...

01:59:14,754 --> 01:59:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  That's scary, but you know.

01:59:16,994 --> 01:59:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  The news environment has gotten so much worse than.

01:59:19,842 --> 01:59:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  than 10 or 20 years ago.

01:59:21,922 --> 01:59:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  least you had filters and...

01:59:24,450 --> 01:59:27,710
SPEAKER_0:  limited number of outlets and there was some sense you could

01:59:28,034 --> 01:59:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  track was.

01:59:28,994 --> 01:59:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  or bad. There's lots of problems with that system too. But now you have an information buffet.

01:59:34,018 --> 01:59:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  So if you want to be alarmed or you want to be...

01:59:38,114 --> 01:59:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  stay in the tribe of those who think this is utter bull, you can find your

01:59:42,178 --> 01:59:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  flow.

01:59:43,394 --> 01:59:43,806
SPEAKER_0:  and.

01:59:44,194 --> 01:59:45,182
SPEAKER_0:  That is Lid.

01:59:46,178 --> 01:59:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  But getting back to this specific question, the 2018 IPCC report, which was a special report commissioned

01:59:53,570 --> 01:59:56,702
SPEAKER_0:  learn about the difference between 1.5 degrees of warming and 2.

01:59:57,314 --> 01:59:59,326
SPEAKER_0:  which sounds so weird and technocratic and

01:59:59,714 --> 02:00:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  Complicated.

02:00:00,802 --> 02:00:02,494
SPEAKER_0:  That's the one that generated the whole.

02:00:02,722 --> 02:00:04,597
SPEAKER_0:  meme about eight years left.

02:00:04,597 --> 02:00:06,142
SPEAKER_1:  12 years. Till doomsday.

02:00:06,466 --> 02:00:07,838
SPEAKER_0:  23rd and that's the one.

02:00:08,130 --> 02:00:11,102
SPEAKER_0:  This was the idea that there's a point we're going to.

02:00:11,490 --> 02:00:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  If we don't.

02:00:13,154 --> 02:00:16,510
SPEAKER_0:  cut emissions in half by whatever it was, 2050, we're doomed.

02:00:17,122 --> 02:00:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  that emerged from that specific report.

02:00:19,298 --> 02:00:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  And it wasn't something that was in the report. It was in the spin around the report.

02:00:22,978 --> 02:00:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  And that's what.

02:00:23,714 --> 02:00:27,198
SPEAKER_0:  captivated Greta appropriately as a young person going, you know.

02:00:27,650 --> 02:00:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  and with her unique vantage point and stuff.

02:00:30,370 --> 02:00:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:00:31,266 --> 02:00:34,526
SPEAKER_0:  That rep, I still need to dig in and write something deeper about.

02:00:35,490 --> 02:00:36,926
SPEAKER_0:  what happened with that particular dynamics.

02:00:37,506 --> 02:00:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  created this recent burst of

02:00:39,714 --> 02:00:40,318
SPEAKER_0:  We're doomed.

02:00:40,834 --> 02:00:41,278
SPEAKER_0:  Rhetoric.

02:00:42,242 --> 02:00:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  I think you're.

02:00:43,106 --> 02:00:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  focusing on.

02:00:44,322 --> 02:00:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:00:45,218 --> 02:00:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  It's all in the external.

02:00:46,978 --> 02:00:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  interpretations, which journalism laps up.

02:00:50,786 --> 02:00:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  because we're looking for the front page thought.

02:00:53,218 --> 02:00:55,358
SPEAKER_0:  But it's not just the journalists, it's the whole system.

02:00:55,778 --> 02:00:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  NGOs, environmental groups.

02:00:58,082 --> 02:00:58,718
SPEAKER_0:  If you're, if.

02:00:59,106 --> 02:01:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  and developing country.

02:01:00,610 --> 02:01:02,878
SPEAKER_0:  well-meaning leaders in developing countries.

02:01:03,618 --> 02:01:07,742
SPEAKER_0:  because of the structure of this treaty that goes back to 1992.

02:01:08,098 --> 02:01:09,342
SPEAKER_0:  Paris Agreement as part of.

02:01:11,170 --> 02:01:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  There now.

02:01:13,922 --> 02:01:17,246
SPEAKER_0:  really looking for a way to portray this as a CO2 problem.

02:01:17,922 --> 02:01:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  Not a vulnerability.

02:01:19,714 --> 02:01:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  Well, there's a vulnerability aspect, but in Pakistan, they're…

02:01:24,610 --> 02:01:27,582
SPEAKER_0:  climate minister, which they didn't even have a climate minister five years ago.

02:01:28,802 --> 02:01:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  is blaming everything that happened in Pakistan on carbon dioxide warming the climate creating this.

02:01:33,378 --> 02:01:35,806
SPEAKER_0:  when a lot of what was going on was also on the ground.

02:01:36,386 --> 02:01:39,518
SPEAKER_0:  and you can blame colonialism, Pakistan's history, and all kinds of things.

02:01:40,386 --> 02:01:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  but under the treaty, you want it to be about CO2.

02:01:43,586 --> 02:01:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  because that puts the onus on rich countries.

02:01:46,210 --> 02:01:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  You're not paying us.

02:01:47,842 --> 02:01:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  Where's our money? And they're right.

02:01:49,890 --> 02:01:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  you know, in the context of what everyone agreed to.

02:01:52,706 --> 02:01:54,718
SPEAKER_0:  There was supposed to be $100 billion a year.

02:01:55,394 --> 02:01:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  from rich countries to poor countries. Starting in 2020, it didn't happen. It's like.

02:01:59,330 --> 02:01:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  Basically.

02:02:01,026 --> 02:02:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  Some money is flowing, but it's not really made up money. Yeah, and so that whole dynamic.

02:02:06,178 --> 02:02:09,918
SPEAKER_0:  latch onto the climate science and they, you know, so they're there.

02:02:10,562 --> 02:02:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  and they're very handy, quotable people.

02:02:12,930 --> 02:02:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  you have a justice angle, you have bad guys and good guys.

02:02:16,290 --> 02:02:19,006
SPEAKER_0:  which fits all of these narrative threads to come together into.

02:02:19,650 --> 02:02:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  this information storm we're still living with.

02:02:22,050 --> 02:02:30,430
SPEAKER_1:  And then of course, it's not Pakistan's fault either. I mean, it also actually almost all leaders now say it's because of climate, because then it's not.

02:02:30,786 --> 02:02:32,286
SPEAKER_1:  You know, we didn't do anything wrong.

02:02:32,578 --> 02:02:36,094
SPEAKER_1:  In Germany, for instance, when we had that flood last year.

02:02:36,386 --> 02:02:40,222
SPEAKER_1:  It's not impossible that climate had a part in that.

02:02:40,610 --> 02:02:44,958
SPEAKER_1:  But it's very, very clear that the main reason why so many people died in Germany and Belgium.

02:02:45,314 --> 02:02:47,934
SPEAKER_1:  was because the alarm systems didn't work.

02:02:48,290 --> 02:02:48,830
SPEAKER_1:  And this was.

02:02:49,058 --> 02:02:56,766
SPEAKER_1:  plainly the local leaders in Germany. Now, if I'm stuck here and basically have caused the death of 200 people,

02:02:57,122 --> 02:02:59,646
SPEAKER_1:  Would I rather say, yeah, that's on me or would I?

02:02:59,970 --> 02:03:07,774
SPEAKER_1:  climate. It's just such an easy scapegoat. I don't want to place it all on the journalists, I think, because there's a lot of

02:03:08,226 --> 02:03:10,462
SPEAKER_1:  If I were to think about, what did you call it? Front.

02:03:10,754 --> 02:03:11,486
SPEAKER_1:  pitch dot.

02:03:12,002 --> 02:03:14,142
SPEAKER_1:  There's a lot of really...

02:03:14,914 --> 02:03:15,358
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:03:16,738 --> 02:03:17,630
SPEAKER_1:  narratives.

02:03:18,050 --> 02:03:19,454
SPEAKER_1:  that's a

02:03:19,810 --> 02:03:23,198
SPEAKER_1:  result in destruction of the human species. So nuclear war.

02:03:23,458 --> 02:03:26,750
SPEAKER_1:  pandemics, all that kind of stuff. It seems that climate is a sticky one.

02:03:27,138 --> 02:03:31,710
SPEAKER_1:  So the fact that it's sticky means there's other interests that play like you guys are talking about.

02:03:31,970 --> 02:03:35,198
SPEAKER_1:  in terms of politics, all that kind of stuff. So it's not just a journalist.

02:03:35,522 --> 02:03:39,070
SPEAKER_1:  I feel like journalists will try anything for the front page.

02:03:39,330 --> 02:03:41,662
SPEAKER_1:  You won't stick unless there's...

02:03:42,018 --> 02:03:45,342
SPEAKER_1:  bigger interests at play for which these narratives are useful.

02:03:45,762 --> 02:03:48,254
SPEAKER_1:  So journalists will just throw stuff out there and see if it.

02:03:48,482 --> 02:03:50,814
SPEAKER_1:  get clicks and.

02:03:51,106 --> 02:03:53,758
SPEAKER_1:  It's like a first spark maybe.

02:03:54,178 --> 02:04:02,814
SPEAKER_1:  It's maybe a tiny catalyst of the initial stuffs, but it has to be picked up by the politicians, by interest groups and all that kind of stuff.

02:04:03,266 --> 02:04:05,630
SPEAKER_1:  Let me ask you, if you want to about the...

02:04:06,658 --> 02:04:07,838
SPEAKER_1:  First part of the subtitle.

02:04:08,290 --> 02:04:11,326
SPEAKER_1:  How climate change panic costs us trillions.

02:04:12,386 --> 02:04:14,494
SPEAKER_1:  How does climate change panic cost Australians?

02:04:14,914 --> 02:04:17,982
SPEAKER_1:  So we're basically deciding to make policies that'll have.

02:04:18,210 --> 02:04:19,326
SPEAKER_1:  Fairly little impact.

02:04:19,682 --> 02:04:21,150
SPEAKER_1:  even in 50 or 100 years.

02:04:21,442 --> 02:04:23,806
SPEAKER_1:  that literally cost trillions of dollars.

02:04:24,130 --> 02:04:24,606
SPEAKER_1:  So, yeah.

02:04:24,898 --> 02:04:29,310
SPEAKER_1:  give you two examples. So the European Union is trying to go to

02:04:29,698 --> 02:04:30,558
SPEAKER_1:  Net zero.

02:04:31,074 --> 02:04:34,206
SPEAKER_1:  So our attempt to go halfway there by 2030.

02:04:34,594 --> 02:04:37,502
SPEAKER_1:  uh... will cost about a trillion dollars a year

02:04:38,146 --> 02:04:42,430
SPEAKER_1:  And yet the net impact will be almost unmeasurable by the end of the century.

02:04:42,786 --> 02:04:43,358
SPEAKER_1:  Why is that?

02:04:43,842 --> 02:04:59,006
SPEAKER_1:  That's because the EU and the rich countries is a fairly small part of the emissions that are gonna come out in the 21st century. Now, we used to be a big part of it, but that's mainly because nobody else, it was just the US and Europe and a few others put out CO2 in the 20th century.

02:04:59,266 --> 02:05:00,542
SPEAKER_1:  So we used to be big.

02:05:01,250 --> 02:05:04,030
SPEAKER_1:  but in the 21st century will be a small bit player.

02:05:04,546 --> 02:05:06,686
SPEAKER_1:  And so we're basically spending a lot of money.

02:05:07,042 --> 02:05:14,238
SPEAKER_1:  And remember a trillion dollars is a lot of money that could have been spent on a lot of things that could have made humanity better.

02:05:14,594 --> 02:05:15,326
SPEAKER_1:  on something.

02:05:15,650 --> 02:05:16,766
SPEAKER_1:  that will only make us

02:05:17,250 --> 02:05:18,334
SPEAKER_1:  tiny bit better.

02:05:18,626 --> 02:05:19,774
SPEAKER_1:  It will do some good.

02:05:20,418 --> 02:05:24,382
SPEAKER_1:  But the reasonable estimates is if you do a cost benefit analysis and again

02:05:25,026 --> 02:05:32,286
SPEAKER_1:  Technically, it's really, really complicated, but the basic idea is very, very simple. You just simply say, what are all the costs?

02:05:32,802 --> 02:05:33,502
SPEAKER_1:  on one side.

02:05:33,730 --> 02:05:39,774
SPEAKER_1:  And what are all the benefits? So the costs are mainly that we have to live with more expensive energy. You have to.

02:05:40,034 --> 02:05:52,542
SPEAKER_1:  You have to have more complicated services, that kind of thing. The benefit is that you cut carbon emissions and that eventually means that you'll have less climate damage, you'll have lower temperature rises and so on.

02:05:53,250 --> 02:05:55,230
SPEAKER_1:  if you try to weigh up all of those.

02:05:55,682 --> 02:05:57,534
SPEAKER_1:  it's reasonable to assume.

02:05:58,242 --> 02:06:02,078
SPEAKER_1:  that the EU policies will deliver for every dollar you spend.

02:06:02,658 --> 02:06:05,662
SPEAKER_1:  It'll deliver less than a dollar, probably about 30 cents.

02:06:05,890 --> 02:06:12,478
SPEAKER_1:  back on the dollar, which is a really bad way to spend dollars because there's lots of other things out in the world where you could do, you know.

02:06:12,770 --> 02:06:27,230
SPEAKER_1:  multiple, you know, so for instance, if you think about tuberculosis or, uh, education of, of, of small kids or nutrition for small kids and that, those kinds of things, every dollar you spend will do like 30 to a hundred dollars worth of good. So they're much, much better places where you could spend this money.

02:06:27,650 --> 02:06:31,486
SPEAKER_1:  Likewise, the US is thinking of going net zero by 20.

02:06:31,746 --> 02:06:37,726
SPEAKER_1:  50. It's not actually going to happen, but it's sort of a thing that everybody talks about Biden is talking a lot about it.

02:06:37,954 --> 02:06:42,590
SPEAKER_1:  If you look at the models that indicate how much will that cost?

02:06:42,946 --> 02:06:46,558
SPEAKER_1:  It's not impossible that this will cost somewhere between 2 and 4.

02:06:46,882 --> 02:06:47,678
SPEAKER_1:  trillion dollars.

02:06:48,002 --> 02:06:49,374
SPEAKER_1:  per year by mid-century.

02:06:49,954 --> 02:06:53,246
SPEAKER_1:  And remember, if the US went carbon neutral.

02:06:53,794 --> 02:06:54,334
SPEAKER_1:  today.

02:06:55,394 --> 02:06:59,870
SPEAKER_1:  by the end of the century that would reduce temperatures by about 0.3°F.

02:07:01,602 --> 02:07:05,118
SPEAKER_1:  just be able to measure it. You probably wouldn't in real life, but you know.

02:07:05,602 --> 02:07:06,846
SPEAKER_1:  just be able to measure it.

02:07:07,074 --> 02:07:07,550
SPEAKER_1:  again.

02:07:07,906 --> 02:07:14,526
SPEAKER_1:  This is not saying that there's not some good coming out of it, but you're basically spending an enormous amount of money on fairly small benefits.

02:07:14,786 --> 02:07:16,094
SPEAKER_1:  So that's my main point.

02:07:16,578 --> 02:07:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, this reminds me of what we were saying earlier about...

02:07:20,386 --> 02:07:25,694
SPEAKER_0:  the things that models don't integrate and the things that cost benefit leave out because you really can't go there.

02:07:26,658 --> 02:07:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  One of the issues facing the world right now is the reality that we're reminded of.

02:07:30,818 --> 02:07:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  that energy availability is a geopolitical.

02:07:33,858 --> 02:07:35,422
SPEAKER_0:  destabilizer if you

02:07:35,810 --> 02:07:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  Have.

02:07:36,642 --> 02:07:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  Uneven.

02:07:37,538 --> 02:07:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  Access to energy.

02:07:39,234 --> 02:07:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  and you have Vladimir Putin coming into office or something else happening.

02:07:43,618 --> 02:07:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  disrupts that system, you're.

02:07:45,410 --> 02:07:46,814
SPEAKER_0:  vastly increasing poverty.

02:07:47,234 --> 02:07:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  This is playing out across the world.

02:07:49,922 --> 02:07:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  Fertilizer process, fertilizer comes from gas.

02:07:52,674 --> 02:07:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:07:53,378 --> 02:07:53,950
SPEAKER_0:  National gas.

02:07:54,690 --> 02:07:55,166
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:07:55,682 --> 02:07:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  If you can envision a world.

02:07:58,274 --> 02:07:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  later in the century.

02:07:59,970 --> 02:08:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  where we no longer beholden on this material in the ground, at least.

02:08:03,394 --> 02:08:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  fossil fuels, you know, cobalt and lithium for batteries.

02:08:07,490 --> 02:08:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  That's pretty cool.

02:08:08,482 --> 02:08:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  because you're taking away geopolitical instability.

02:08:13,442 --> 02:08:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  But that's not factored in, right? That's like way outside of what you would factor in. But it does feel like to me, if I was going to make the case for

02:08:22,082 --> 02:08:24,030
SPEAKER_0:  You can choose your trillions, whatever that.

02:08:24,450 --> 02:08:25,566
SPEAKER_0:  Investing big.

02:08:26,466 --> 02:08:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  isn't for these marginal things, it's for...

02:08:29,666 --> 02:08:32,382
SPEAKER_0:  looking at the big picture, a world of abundant energy.

02:08:32,962 --> 02:08:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  that doesn't come from a black rock.

02:08:35,586 --> 02:08:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  or a gooey liquid when you burn it.

02:08:37,762 --> 02:08:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  Great.

02:08:38,338 --> 02:08:41,438
SPEAKER_1:  But isn't that what the proposals are is investing.

02:08:42,114 --> 02:08:44,739
SPEAKER_1:  in different kinds of energy, renewable energy.

02:08:44,739 --> 02:08:47,739
SPEAKER_0:  But I don't think most people are making that case.

02:08:47,739 --> 02:08:48,350
SPEAKER_1:  in the...

02:08:48,770 --> 02:08:52,958
SPEAKER_1:  In the trillion and the T costs, what's in corporate? What are the big costs there?

02:08:53,378 --> 02:08:55,326
SPEAKER_1:  So the big cost is that you have.

02:08:55,778 --> 02:09:02,910
SPEAKER_1:  slightly lower productivity gains. So basically again, yeah, and this is sort of the opposite of what we just talked about about climate change.

02:09:03,522 --> 02:09:09,502
SPEAKER_1:  We're going to get richer and richer in the world. This is all models, also the UN. This is really the only way that you can get big.

02:09:09,730 --> 02:09:15,838
SPEAKER_1:  climate change is because everybody gets a lot richer, so also the developing world gets a lot richer. So we're likely to get richer.

02:09:16,354 --> 02:09:19,262
SPEAKER_1:  But one of the things that drive our wealth production.

02:09:19,522 --> 02:09:23,326
SPEAKER_1:  is the fact that we have ample and cheap and available energy.

02:09:23,874 --> 02:09:33,534
SPEAKER_1:  If you make that slightly harder, which is what you do with climate legislation, because you're basically telling people you have to use a source of energy that you'd rather not have used had-

02:09:34,114 --> 02:09:43,262
SPEAKER_1:  because if people wanted to do it, we'd already have solved the problem. So you basically tell them, you got to use this wind turbine instead of this, natural gas plant or you know.

02:09:43,522 --> 02:09:44,446
SPEAKER_1:  That kind of thing.

02:09:44,706 --> 02:09:54,750
SPEAKER_1:  It makes, it's not that you suddenly become poor or anything. It simply makes production slightly harder. What do you do when the wind is not blowing kind of thing? And of course we have lots of ways to...

02:09:54,978 --> 02:10:02,206
SPEAKER_1:  somewhat mitigate that, but it's a little more costly, a little more complicated, a little less convenient. And that means you grow a little less.

02:10:02,594 --> 02:10:10,366
SPEAKER_1:  That's the main problem with these policies, that it simply makes you somewhat less well-off. So energy becomes more inefficient.

02:10:11,522 --> 02:10:11,838
SPEAKER_1:  So.

02:10:12,098 --> 02:10:12,766
SPEAKER_1:  Lemme...

02:10:13,154 --> 02:10:13,950
SPEAKER_1:  challenge you here.

02:10:14,754 --> 02:10:17,278
SPEAKER_1:  uh... try to steal man some critics

02:10:17,730 --> 02:10:19,422
SPEAKER_1:  So you have critics.

02:10:20,066 --> 02:10:21,278
SPEAKER_0:

02:10:21,922 --> 02:10:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  uh

02:10:23,106 --> 02:10:26,334
SPEAKER_1:  I would love you to take it seriously and sort of consider this.

02:10:26,626 --> 02:10:29,246
SPEAKER_1:  criticism and trying to steal man their their case

02:10:29,538 --> 02:10:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  There's a bunch.

02:10:31,106 --> 02:10:32,862
SPEAKER_1:  I could mention.

02:10:33,378 --> 02:10:34,110
SPEAKER_1:  This this

02:10:34,434 --> 02:10:36,158
SPEAKER_1:  list of criticisms.

02:10:36,514 --> 02:10:41,790
SPEAKER_1:  from Bob Ward in London School of Economics. I don't know if you're familiar with him, but just on this point...

02:10:42,242 --> 02:10:44,926
SPEAKER_1:  in terms of one of the big costs being an energy.

02:10:46,210 --> 02:10:49,662
SPEAKER_1:  He criticizes your recent book in saying

02:10:50,306 --> 02:10:55,774
SPEAKER_1:  You consider the $143 billion in annual support for renewable energy, but ignore

02:10:56,194 --> 02:10:59,166
SPEAKER_1:  the $300 billion in fossil fuel subsidies.

02:10:59,714 --> 02:11:02,302
SPEAKER_1:  So a lot of the criticism has to do...

02:11:03,170 --> 02:11:06,014
SPEAKER_1:  with while you're cherry picking the models.

02:11:06,242 --> 02:11:11,006
SPEAKER_1:  which the models are always cherry picking anyway.

02:11:11,298 --> 02:11:13,214
SPEAKER_1:  You know, you want to take those seriously, so...

02:11:13,506 --> 02:11:15,806
SPEAKER_1:  uh... he claims that you ignore

02:11:16,674 --> 02:11:18,334
SPEAKER_1:  you're not.

02:11:18,722 --> 02:11:20,766
SPEAKER_1:  Fully modeling the cost.

02:11:21,762 --> 02:11:24,190
SPEAKER_1:  the trade off here, how expensive.

02:11:24,642 --> 02:11:29,438
SPEAKER_1:  is the renewable energy and how expensive is the fossil fuel? Can you steal man's case?

02:11:30,146 --> 02:11:33,886
SPEAKER_1:  So two things. The first, the quote.

02:11:34,178 --> 02:11:42,718
SPEAKER_1:  It's absolutely true that the world spends a large chunk of money on fossil fuels. And that's just stupid. And we should stop doing it.

02:11:43,042 --> 02:12:06,014
SPEAKER_1:  We should also recognize that this is not rich countries. This is not the countries where we're talking about climate change. This is poor countries. This is Saudi Arabia. No, that's actually not a terribly poor country. It's China, it's Indonesia, it's Russia. It's places where you're basically paying off your population, just like that you subsidize bread, you make sure that they don't rebel by making

02:12:06,242 --> 02:12:08,990
SPEAKER_1:  cheap fuels available. That's dumb.

02:12:09,314 --> 02:12:27,454
SPEAKER_1:  But it's not like they, you know, they don't know what they're doing. They're mostly doing this for things that have nothing to do with climate. So I totally agree. We should get rid of it. It's hard to do. Indonesia is actually somewhat managed to, you know, to get rid of it. Because remember if you spend a lot of money on fossil fuel subsidies, you're basically subsidising the rich because

02:12:28,034 --> 02:12:33,598
SPEAKER_1:  Poor people don't have a car. It's the rich people who can now buy very cheap gasoline. That's, you know, that's

02:12:33,890 --> 02:12:40,670
SPEAKER_1:  unjust as well. So it's dumb in so many different ways. I would never argue that you shouldn't overturn assholes.

02:12:41,218 --> 02:12:43,166
SPEAKER_1:  Plenty of time said we should stop that.

02:12:43,394 --> 02:12:53,214
SPEAKER_1:  But we should also recognize these are mostly regimes that are not going to be taken over by either by my argument or Bob Ward's or anyone else's. They're doing this for totally different reasons.

02:12:54,242 --> 02:12:55,486
SPEAKER_1:  On the model side.

02:12:56,130 --> 02:12:58,078
SPEAKER_1:  There is virtually no model.

02:12:58,658 --> 02:13:02,046
SPEAKER_1:  that don't show economic model, that don't show this has a cost.

02:13:02,274 --> 02:13:03,966
SPEAKER_1:  And that's the fundamental point is.

02:13:04,898 --> 02:13:13,886
SPEAKER_1:  This is a basic point from economics. The system is already working most effectively because if it wasn't, you could actually make money.

02:13:14,178 --> 02:13:14,878
SPEAKER_1:  changing over.

02:13:15,138 --> 02:13:30,270
SPEAKER_1:  So if you want to have a change outside of what the system is already doing, it's because you're saying you have to do something that you rather not want to do, namely use an energy source that is less convenient or less cost effective and so on, and that will incur a cost.

02:13:30,594 --> 02:13:35,998
SPEAKER_1:  Now, there's huge discussion about just exactly how much cost is that. So there's definitely cost.

02:13:36,258 --> 02:13:43,102
SPEAKER_1:  is the cost going to be one or five trillion? That's absolutely a discussion about where do you take your models from? I try to do...

02:13:43,330 --> 02:13:46,910
SPEAKER_1:  And again, this is not possible everywhere. I try to actually take

02:13:47,138 --> 02:13:53,406
SPEAKER_1:  the average of all of the economic models. So there's a group called the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum, which

02:13:53,634 --> 02:13:58,302
SPEAKER_1:  tries to pull together all these different groups that do the modelling. So some models.

02:13:58,562 --> 02:14:00,606
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of this cost actually comes down to...

02:14:00,834 --> 02:14:10,238
SPEAKER_1:  the fact that we don't quite know how much more fossil fuels you're going to need in the future. And so if your projections are you're not going to use that much.

02:14:10,562 --> 02:14:19,006
SPEAKER_1:  The cost of reducing it is going to be very small. If you think you're going to use a ton of extra fossil fuels and you have to reduce it, the cost is going to be bigger.

02:14:19,266 --> 02:14:24,190
SPEAKER_1:  So I think that's just one of the variables that's oh yeah. And there's many, many, many more.

02:14:24,706 --> 02:14:26,558
SPEAKER_1:  I think the point here is to say.

02:14:26,818 --> 02:14:33,982
SPEAKER_1:  that if you take the average of all the best models that's sort of aggregated, for instance at the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum,

02:14:34,690 --> 02:14:36,350
SPEAKER_1:  Pretty secure ground.

02:14:37,122 --> 02:14:41,310
SPEAKER_1:  And so again, I would argue that Bob Ward.

02:14:41,538 --> 02:14:49,214
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, I've had a lot of run ins with Bob Bord and he has a very different set of views on things.

02:14:49,474 --> 02:14:59,774
SPEAKER_1:  But I just don't think he's right in saying that I'm cherry picking. Well, yes. And I mean, he also has similar criticism about the estimate of the EU cost of climate action.

02:15:00,386 --> 02:15:03,710
SPEAKER_1:  based on the NOP 2013 model.

02:15:04,418 --> 02:15:08,958
SPEAKER_1:  But ultimately these criticisms have to do with what are the sources for the different models.

02:15:09,634 --> 02:15:21,438
SPEAKER_1:  And just very briefly, I mean, I'm laying it out very transparently where I get these models, where I get these estimates from in the book. I've really tried to document this. And yes, I mean, look, there's nobody who sort of

02:15:21,730 --> 02:15:31,198
SPEAKER_1:  has all the information and gets everything right in all of these areas. I think most of Pogport's argument is not a...

02:15:31,554 --> 02:15:32,094
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, uh-

02:15:32,418 --> 02:15:32,798
SPEAKER_1:  Good.

02:15:33,282 --> 02:15:35,774
SPEAKER_1:  faith effort to sort of

02:15:36,034 --> 02:15:42,590
SPEAKER_1:  improve on these estimates. He's right in saying some of these estimates, we only have a few estimates.

02:15:42,914 --> 02:15:55,134
SPEAKER_1:  And yeah, I'd like to have more of them. One thing I should mention is that there is very little interest in general and there's very little funding in finding out how much do our climate policies cost.

02:15:55,426 --> 02:16:00,990
SPEAKER_1:  because that's just inconvenient to everyone in the whole game. Who wants to know that?

02:16:01,250 --> 02:16:04,990
SPEAKER_1:  that, you know, for instance, would you want to fund?

02:16:05,218 --> 02:16:17,374
SPEAKER_1:  something that says that the Inflation Reduction Act is not going to be very effective. Of course, you don't want to do that. Again, it's a little bit the flock of birds will look at something else.

02:16:17,602 --> 02:16:19,070
SPEAKER_1:  And what I think is...

02:16:19,554 --> 02:16:35,390
SPEAKER_1:  given that we're paying for it at the end. This is public money. We're deciding we're gonna spend money here rather than there. Let's at least look at what are the best estimates out there. I would love to have more estimates. More estimates is always better. And just a quick comment on the good faith part.

02:16:35,842 --> 02:16:40,094
SPEAKER_1:  Me as a consumer, looking for truth is hard to find who's good faith and not.

02:16:40,514 --> 02:16:42,366
SPEAKER_1:  So it's not only are you looking for.

02:16:43,394 --> 02:16:45,374
SPEAKER_1:  sort of accurate information.

02:16:46,402 --> 02:16:50,494
SPEAKER_1:  You're also trying to infer about the communicator of that information.

02:16:50,946 --> 02:16:56,830
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. It's very difficult. It's, it's, um. And you know, you put me on the, on the podcast. Of course I'm going to say it.

02:16:57,090 --> 02:17:03,294
SPEAKER_1:  I'm a trustworthy guy. Well, I mean, but we believe we're trustworthy too, but.

02:17:03,938 --> 02:17:04,606
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:17:05,250 --> 02:17:06,782
SPEAKER_1:  you know, I've been reading.

02:17:07,330 --> 02:17:12,382
SPEAKER_1:  for various reasons, but mostly because I've been traveling to Ukraine and thinking just about the peoples.

02:17:13,218 --> 02:17:13,758
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:17:14,274 --> 02:17:18,910
SPEAKER_1:  suffering through war. I've been reading a lot about World War II and Stalin and Hitler.

02:17:19,266 --> 02:17:21,630
SPEAKER_1:  And, you know, from the perspective of Hitler...

02:17:22,498 --> 02:17:23,166
SPEAKER_1:  uh

02:17:23,618 --> 02:17:24,414
SPEAKER_1:  He...

02:17:24,738 --> 02:17:27,006
SPEAKER_1:  really believed he's doing good.

02:17:27,618 --> 02:17:28,798
SPEAKER_1:  for the world than...

02:17:29,282 --> 02:17:29,854
SPEAKER_1:  He was...

02:17:30,658 --> 02:17:33,182
SPEAKER_1:  communicating from his perspective in good faith.

02:17:33,538 --> 02:17:33,982
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:17:34,370 --> 02:17:37,854
SPEAKER_1:  He started to believe, I think, early on his own propaganda.

02:17:38,082 --> 02:17:42,238
SPEAKER_1:  Even your understanding and perception of the world completely shifted.

02:17:42,498 --> 02:17:43,934
SPEAKER_1:  It's very, very, very, too.

02:17:44,802 --> 02:17:46,366
SPEAKER_1:  to understand who to trust.

02:17:46,882 --> 02:17:47,198
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

02:17:48,706 --> 02:17:52,350
SPEAKER_1:  And just because it's a consensus in a particular community.

02:17:52,578 --> 02:17:55,166
SPEAKER_1:  doesn't necessarily mean it's a source of trust.

02:17:55,394 --> 02:17:55,742
SPEAKER_1:  It's a.

02:17:56,098 --> 02:17:57,854
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, basically...

02:17:59,106 --> 02:18:00,862
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know how to operate in this world.

02:18:01,250 --> 02:18:05,022
SPEAKER_1:  except to have a humility and constantly questioning your assumptions.

02:18:05,634 --> 02:18:11,934
SPEAKER_1:  but not so much that you're completely out in the ocean not knowing what is true and not.

02:18:12,418 --> 02:18:14,526
SPEAKER_1:  weird world because I ultimately

02:18:15,266 --> 02:18:16,382
SPEAKER_1:  bigger than climate.

02:18:17,442 --> 02:18:19,198
SPEAKER_1:  My hope is to have...

02:18:19,714 --> 02:18:21,630
SPEAKER_1:  institutions that can be trusted.

02:18:22,498 --> 02:18:25,022
SPEAKER_1:  and that's been very much under attack.

02:18:26,306 --> 02:18:29,822
SPEAKER_1:  in as part of the climate debate as part of the

02:18:30,370 --> 02:18:32,862
SPEAKER_1:  COVID debate as part of all these discussions.

02:18:33,250 --> 02:18:34,462
SPEAKER_1:  and science.

02:18:34,882 --> 02:18:36,478
SPEAKER_1:  to me is one of the sources.

02:18:37,186 --> 02:18:42,718
SPEAKER_1:  of truth and the fact that that's under question now is something that hurts me on many levels.

02:18:43,074 --> 02:18:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  deeply.

02:18:44,098 --> 02:18:51,006
SPEAKER_0:  You said something earlier that I took a note down here and I can't find it about cooperation. It was like collaborative cooperation or something like that.

02:18:52,034 --> 02:18:53,278
SPEAKER_0:  To me...

02:18:53,602 --> 02:18:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  There was a point like in 2013.

02:18:56,226 --> 02:18:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  after just dealing with everything you've been grappling with.

02:19:00,322 --> 02:19:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  And what it...

02:19:01,954 --> 02:19:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  you know you don't know how this is going to work out.

02:19:05,410 --> 02:19:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  What do you work on?

02:19:07,778 --> 02:19:11,262
SPEAKER_0:  And one morning I made a list of words that kind of summarized.

02:19:12,354 --> 02:19:15,134
SPEAKER_0:  Basically system properties that give you confidence.

02:19:15,586 --> 02:19:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  in the system.

02:19:16,578 --> 02:19:17,438
SPEAKER_0:  Trust or?

02:19:17,986 --> 02:19:19,966
SPEAKER_0:  And there are transparency is one.

02:19:20,578 --> 02:19:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  as you were saying earlier.

02:19:22,242 --> 02:19:22,718
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:19:24,162 --> 02:19:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  Connectivity is another.

02:19:25,890 --> 02:19:27,454
SPEAKER_0:  so that everyone's connected.

02:19:28,450 --> 02:19:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:19:29,474 --> 02:19:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  On the subsidy issue, for example.

02:19:32,386 --> 02:19:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  their young entrepreneurs in Nairobi.

02:19:35,618 --> 02:19:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  who are selling.

02:19:37,090 --> 02:19:39,710
SPEAKER_0:  ingeniously using Nairobi's digital currency.

02:19:40,322 --> 02:19:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  Propane, the fuel that's in our...

02:19:42,690 --> 02:19:44,062
SPEAKER_0:  Backyard BBQ grills.

02:19:44,770 --> 02:19:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  which comes out of a gas wells, but it's a separate fuel.

02:19:48,162 --> 02:19:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  in little to increments that poor people can use instead of charcoal.

02:19:52,866 --> 02:19:55,710
SPEAKER_0:  and LPG subsidies are helping them.

02:19:56,770 --> 02:19:59,422
SPEAKER_0:  get people off of charcoal, which is horrific.

02:19:59,842 --> 02:20:00,574
SPEAKER_0:  TRAGE

02:20:01,250 --> 02:20:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  from the source through the.

02:20:03,074 --> 02:20:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  warlords in Somalia and elsewhere who are.

02:20:06,274 --> 02:20:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  getting the money.

02:20:07,490 --> 02:20:08,766
SPEAKER_0:  to the pollution in houses.

02:20:09,634 --> 02:20:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  So having.

02:20:12,066 --> 02:20:16,670
SPEAKER_0:  Be sure, being sure when we're having these big debates about who the World Bank is going to give loans to.

02:20:17,186 --> 02:20:20,734
SPEAKER_0:  I'm drawing a simple line, no more fossil fuel subsidies.

02:20:21,890 --> 02:20:22,334
SPEAKER_0:  hurts.

02:20:22,722 --> 02:20:24,254
SPEAKER_0:  a really good valuable.

02:20:26,178 --> 02:20:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  Small scale but...

02:20:27,714 --> 02:20:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  Scalable.

02:20:28,994 --> 02:20:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  way to have people not die from cooking smoke in their houses and take down for us.

02:20:33,634 --> 02:20:36,670
SPEAKER_0:  But that only is considered if they're in the conversation.

02:20:37,058 --> 02:20:39,422
SPEAKER_0:  So connectivity, full connectivity, digital access.

02:20:40,130 --> 02:20:46,430
SPEAKER_0:  So those entrepreneurs are in the mix of people. When you're thinking about subsidies, you're not just thinking about big bad Exxon, you're thinking about this.

02:20:46,978 --> 02:20:50,590
SPEAKER_0:  little company in Nairobi, Pago LPG, I think is the name.

02:20:51,298 --> 02:20:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  In India, the same thing.

02:20:52,546 --> 02:20:55,230
SPEAKER_0:  So you can list those properties of systems.

02:20:56,226 --> 02:20:59,006
SPEAKER_0:  And the IPCC wasn't originally transparent.

02:21:00,162 --> 02:21:03,102
SPEAKER_0:  when I started writing about it in 1988, 1990.

02:21:03,842 --> 02:21:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  And now it's way more transparent. A more public review.

02:21:07,714 --> 02:21:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  So it's even better than it was. It's like a really good example of a science process of assessing the science.

02:21:14,050 --> 02:21:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  providing periodic output to the world.

02:21:16,802 --> 02:21:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  and iteratively improving the model going forward because of critique, because of...

02:21:21,762 --> 02:21:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  because of scrutiny.

02:21:24,098 --> 02:21:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  and finding better ways for that to interface with people so they have information they can use from that big thing.

02:21:28,898 --> 02:21:31,102
SPEAKER_0:  and the media are not doing a good job.

02:21:31,810 --> 02:21:32,190
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:21:32,866 --> 02:21:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  because of this.

02:21:34,114 --> 02:21:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  Front page thoughtism.

02:21:35,810 --> 02:21:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  Um

02:21:36,546 --> 02:21:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  But we can all, you know, I work partially in academia, Columbia.

02:21:40,450 --> 02:21:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  on an initiative partially in communication innovation. How can we?

02:21:44,738 --> 02:21:48,030
SPEAKER_0:  have an open landscape of access to information matters. How can you...

02:21:48,482 --> 02:21:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  What can you do to foster better conversations?

02:21:51,234 --> 02:21:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  so that words like collapse aren't just thrown around like.

02:21:53,922 --> 02:21:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  ambulance.

02:21:54,658 --> 02:21:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  And so system properties give you confidence, I think.

02:21:58,114 --> 02:22:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  And then you don't have to be flailing around for...

02:22:01,922 --> 02:22:04,190
SPEAKER_0:  Bjorn or Tom Friedman or

02:22:04,610 --> 02:22:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  That wasves, thank you very much.

02:22:06,626 --> 02:22:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  You can always right now find your.

02:22:09,090 --> 02:22:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  You're...

02:22:10,562 --> 02:22:11,742
SPEAKER_0:  your character to follow.

02:22:12,354 --> 02:22:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  But I think what would be better is if you actually develop some skills to just have a basic ability.

02:22:18,146 --> 02:22:19,294
SPEAKER_0:  know how to cut to the chase.

02:22:20,674 --> 02:22:21,982
SPEAKER_1:  Can I just follow up on that because...

02:22:22,370 --> 02:22:29,182
SPEAKER_1:  One of the things that I try to do and so my day job is actually something else I work with I think called the Copenhagen consensus.

02:22:29,442 --> 02:22:34,974
SPEAKER_1:  where we work with more than 300 of the world's top economists and we work with seven Nobel laureates in economics.

02:22:35,298 --> 02:22:39,518
SPEAKER_1:  And the point there is really to talk about Where can you spend a dollar?

02:22:40,162 --> 02:22:40,862
SPEAKER_1:  and do.

02:22:41,090 --> 02:22:42,270
SPEAKER_1:  The most good for the world.

02:22:42,754 --> 02:22:44,190
SPEAKER_1:  That's basically.

02:22:44,834 --> 02:22:58,750
SPEAKER_1:  thing that we try to do. And as you rightly point out, look, there are lots of different estimates of what can you do, for instance, on climate, what can you do on tuberculosis, what can you do for vulnerability in all kinds of different ways.

02:22:59,010 --> 02:23:08,030
SPEAKER_1:  And if these were all sort of, well, you can spend a dollar here and do 2.36, but you can spend a dollar here and do 2.34 over here.

02:23:08,418 --> 02:23:13,502
SPEAKER_1:  I would worry a lot, but that's not how the world works because we're terribly inefficient.

02:23:13,890 --> 02:23:15,358
SPEAKER_1:  So they're literally.

02:23:15,682 --> 02:23:22,334
SPEAKER_1:  Lots and lots of amazing things you can do out there. There's a lot of low hanging fruit. And there's a lot of not terribly great.

02:23:22,562 --> 02:23:23,774
SPEAKER_1:  things that you can do.

02:23:24,034 --> 02:23:34,302
SPEAKER_1:  And unfortunately, one of the things that I try to sort of battle is that, you know, we get a lot of things, right? That's why, you know, the world is a lot better than what it used to be. The things that are sort of left.

02:23:34,626 --> 02:23:36,094
SPEAKER_1:  left over are often.

02:23:36,354 --> 02:23:42,494
SPEAKER_1:  You know, the boring things that happen to be incredibly effective and the exciting things that are often not that terribly effective.

02:23:43,202 --> 02:23:44,926
SPEAKER_1:  And so I think

02:23:45,378 --> 02:23:56,574
SPEAKER_1:  One way to look at this is basically to have people do cost benefit across a wide range of areas. And we try to get a lot of different economists to do this, and they come up with different numbers and different models and different results.

02:23:56,834 --> 02:23:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  But if you sort of consistently get that some things.

02:23:59,746 --> 02:24:03,838
SPEAKER_1:  give you in tens or maybe even hundreds of dollars back per dollar.

02:24:04,130 --> 02:24:07,550
SPEAKER_1:  Remember, this is not actually you getting rich, it's the world getting rich.

02:24:07,778 --> 02:24:09,214
SPEAKER_1:  that the world gets better.

02:24:09,570 --> 02:24:10,654
SPEAKER_1:  worth $100.

02:24:11,042 --> 02:24:17,374
SPEAKER_1:  for every dollar you spend. And over here, you can spend a dollar and do somewhere between 30 cents and maybe a couple of dollars.

02:24:17,858 --> 02:24:23,230
SPEAKER_1:  you should probably be focused on the other opportunity first. And that's really the point that I try to make with climate.

02:24:23,554 --> 02:24:26,750
SPEAKER_1:  There are some smart things we can do and I hope we get to talk about them.

02:24:27,042 --> 02:24:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  in climate.

02:24:28,610 --> 02:24:32,286
SPEAKER_1:  but there's also a lot of sort of the standard approaches to fixing climate.

02:24:33,122 --> 02:24:33,982
SPEAKER_1:  turns out to be.

02:24:34,434 --> 02:24:37,694
SPEAKER_1:  very likely below $1 back in the dollar and certainly not.

02:24:37,922 --> 02:24:41,406
SPEAKER_1:  even if you're very optimistic, it'll be like two or three.

02:24:41,666 --> 02:24:45,246
SPEAKER_1:  whereas many other things are just fantastically.

02:24:45,474 --> 02:24:53,118
SPEAKER_1:  better investment. Like the thing I've been advocating, a modest proposal to eat the children of the poor in england.

02:24:53,442 --> 02:24:58,686
SPEAKER_1:  Was that in Jonathan Swift modest proposal from a few centuries ago?

02:24:59,170 --> 02:24:59,966
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:25:00,418 --> 02:25:08,309
SPEAKER_1:  So it's not just cost benefit, it's also in the context of what is moral and not and all that. The full complexity of it.

02:25:08,309 --> 02:25:14,270
SPEAKER_0:  You just hit on something really important. You know, having been on this beat for so long, and again on the disaster beat as well, earthquakes.

02:25:15,362 --> 02:25:17,246
SPEAKER_0:  I can't tell you how many disasters science.

02:25:17,602 --> 02:25:18,974
SPEAKER_0:  Experts keep telling me.

02:25:19,298 --> 02:25:22,142
SPEAKER_0:  Like everyone says, preparedness, invest for preparedness.

02:25:22,530 --> 02:25:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  A strict cost benefit analysis will always tell you a dollar.

02:25:25,730 --> 02:25:26,526
SPEAKER_0:  invested in.

02:25:26,978 --> 02:25:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  resilience before a community gets hit by whatever.

02:25:30,594 --> 02:25:31,614
SPEAKER_0:  is worth 10.

02:25:32,002 --> 02:25:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  You'll always have to spend 10 after.

02:25:34,274 --> 02:25:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  So it's fine to do the cost benefit stuff, but it's just the baseline.

02:25:38,146 --> 02:25:40,862
SPEAKER_0:  Then you have to look at the social science, which shows...

02:25:41,122 --> 02:25:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  or history, which shows you how few times we do it.

02:25:44,866 --> 02:25:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  It's like we just don't do it, therefore.

02:25:47,426 --> 02:25:48,414
SPEAKER_0:  You can bang that drum.

02:25:48,962 --> 02:25:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  Your work is valuable, but it's really constrained.

02:25:52,290 --> 02:25:54,366
SPEAKER_0:  because show me in the world.

02:25:55,234 --> 02:25:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  where that does happen and then...

02:25:57,954 --> 02:26:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  how you turn that success, which is basically something not happening.

02:26:02,210 --> 02:26:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  into the story.

02:26:03,362 --> 02:26:10,238
SPEAKER_1:  Just very briefly, we try to, so we do this for a lot of countries. So we did it for Haiti, for instance.

02:26:10,466 --> 02:26:27,070
SPEAKER_1:  funded by the Canadian Development Ministry because they're basically saying, we spent a billion dollars in Haiti since the earthquake and we really can't tell the difference. So they want it to find, I mean, they actually say that, right? And so they said, we want to find out what are the really smart things you can do in Haiti.

02:26:27,458 --> 02:26:37,726
SPEAKER_1:  And so we, we, uh, together with lots of people in Haiti and all the, you know, the business community and the political community and the religious community and labor community and everybody else.

02:26:37,954 --> 02:26:44,926
SPEAKER_1:  what are the smart things to do? And then we had economists evaluate it. And there are a lot of these things that everybody wanted that were not all that smart.

02:26:45,474 --> 02:26:48,030
SPEAKER_1:  There's actually a lot of smart things and yes.

02:26:48,290 --> 02:26:50,014
SPEAKER_1:  The politicians didn't pick most of them.

02:26:50,370 --> 02:26:51,678
SPEAKER_1:  So our senses.

02:26:52,066 --> 02:26:55,486
SPEAKER_1:  We try to give people, you're thinking about these 70 things.

02:26:56,194 --> 02:27:07,806
SPEAKER_1:  you should actually just think about these 20 things. And then we consider ourselves incredibly lucky if they actually do one of them. So you wrote the book, how to spend $75 billion to make the world a better place.

02:27:08,194 --> 02:27:11,006
SPEAKER_1:  So, can we just list some of the things?

02:27:11,458 --> 02:27:15,326
SPEAKER_1:  If you got $75 billion, how do you spend them?

02:27:16,194 --> 02:27:23,038
SPEAKER_1:  All right, so there's some incredibly good and very, very well-documented things that you could spend money on. So we have two.

02:27:23,554 --> 02:27:26,494
SPEAKER_1:  big infectious diseases that almost nobody think about.

02:27:26,754 --> 02:27:29,438
SPEAKER_1:  because we only think about COVID.

02:27:29,666 --> 02:27:30,302
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, but-

02:27:30,594 --> 02:27:34,014
SPEAKER_1:  tuberculosis used to be the world's biggest infectious disease killer.

02:27:34,402 --> 02:27:38,046
SPEAKER_1:  It still kills about one and a half million people every year

02:27:38,466 --> 02:27:39,934
SPEAKER_1:  The reason why we don't

02:27:40,386 --> 02:27:42,110
SPEAKER_1:  you know, really worry about it is because

02:27:42,338 --> 02:27:44,414
SPEAKER_1:  We fixed it a hundred years ago.

02:27:44,642 --> 02:27:51,806
SPEAKER_1:  we know how to fix it. It's just basically getting medication to people. It's also about getting them to take it while, when they're-

02:27:52,162 --> 02:28:01,630
SPEAKER_1:  sort of been cured because you need to take it for four to six months. And that's actually hard to do. So you also need to incentivize that in some kind of way. It turns out it's incredibly cheap.

02:28:01,890 --> 02:28:05,246
SPEAKER_1:  to basically save almost all of the 1.5 million people.

02:28:05,506 --> 02:28:07,198
SPEAKER_1:  These are people that die in the

02:28:07,874 --> 02:28:11,838
SPEAKER_1:  of their lives. They're typically parents, so you would also have a lot of knock-on effects.

02:28:12,098 --> 02:28:14,462
SPEAKER_1:  And basically we find for a couple billion dollars.

02:28:14,946 --> 02:28:20,094
SPEAKER_1:  you could save the vast number of these, not all of them, but you could save the vast number of them, it would also improve.

02:28:20,386 --> 02:28:38,942
SPEAKER_1:  you know, outcomes in all kinds of other ways. Likewise with malaria, another, it has some somewhat better PR. It's funny to think of malaria as PR and tuberculosis, they need to improve their PR department. Well, but yeah. Those mosquitoes or the good PR. By far the biggest infectious disease.

02:28:39,298 --> 02:28:47,006
SPEAKER_1:  that got good PR, if you will, was HIV. And I'm not trying to compare it and say, oh, it's.

02:28:47,362 --> 02:28:57,438
SPEAKER_1:  worse or better to have HIV than tuberculosis or anything. But I'm simply saying we are underfunding because it doesn't really get the public attention.

02:28:57,730 --> 02:29:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  We just, yeah, we don't really care. But spending money on that has, in terms of benefit, a much bigger impact. So every dollar you spend on TP.

02:29:05,922 --> 02:29:08,734
SPEAKER_1:  will probably do about $43 worth of good.

02:29:09,026 --> 02:29:19,934
SPEAKER_1:  So it'll do an amazing amount of good, basically because it'll save lives. It'll make sure parents stay with their kids and be more productive in their communities and it'll have a lot of knock-on effects.

02:29:20,290 --> 02:29:21,598
SPEAKER_1:  It's incredibly cheap to do.

02:29:22,050 --> 02:29:30,686
SPEAKER_1:  Same thing with malaria, it's mostly mosquito nets that we need to get out. And you're saying just to contrast with climate change, the dollar you spend on...

02:29:31,170 --> 02:29:33,630
SPEAKER_1:  No, not climate change, but decreasing emissions.

02:29:34,498 --> 02:29:37,854
SPEAKER_1:  does not come close to the $43 benefit.

02:29:38,082 --> 02:29:43,422
SPEAKER_1:  No, nobody would ever argue that. So very, very enthusiastic climate.

02:29:43,714 --> 02:29:58,814
SPEAKER_1:  advocates would probably say it'll do two or three dollars worth of good for every dollar. So it's still worthwhile to do, that's what they would say. I would argue, and I think a lot of the evidence seems to side that way, that a lot of the things that we're doing deliver actually less than a dollar back.

02:29:59,202 --> 02:30:02,878
SPEAKER_1:  But it's certainly not nearly the same kind of place.

02:30:03,202 --> 02:30:13,054
SPEAKER_1:  But there's many, many other things. And just if you'll allow me to. It's crazy, I love this. But yeah, there are lots of other things, for instance, e-procurement.

02:30:13,474 --> 02:30:23,742
SPEAKER_1:  So, you know, it's incredibly boring. So most developing countries, well, actually most governments spend most of their money on procurement as typically incredibly corrupt.

02:30:24,162 --> 02:30:26,270
SPEAKER_1:  So we did this project for Bangladesh.

02:30:26,658 --> 02:30:31,198
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, where can you explain procurement? Yes. So that's what governance buying stuff.

02:30:31,682 --> 02:30:38,142
SPEAKER_1:  So a large part of the government revenue is spent on buying anything from Post-it notes.

02:30:38,370 --> 02:30:38,974
SPEAKER_1:  to roads.

02:30:39,362 --> 02:30:44,254
SPEAKER_1:  And obviously, roads are much, much more expensive. It's mostly infrastructure stuff.

02:30:44,610 --> 02:30:45,566
SPEAKER_1:  hugely corrupt.

02:30:45,826 --> 02:30:47,390
SPEAKER_1:  For instance in Bangladesh

02:30:47,650 --> 02:30:48,382
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:30:48,674 --> 02:30:59,806
SPEAKER_1:  It would already have been decided among the ruling elite in that local area, who's going to get this. So they'll have this bidding competition where you have to hand in an envelope, a seal envelope with your bid on it.

02:31:01,122 --> 02:31:07,742
SPEAKER_1:  You put a goon outside the office. So you literally physically can't get in with your bid.

02:31:08,482 --> 02:31:11,518
SPEAKER_1:  Now what we found in this is, you know, I'm not.

02:31:11,874 --> 02:31:17,182
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not claiming any sort of ownership to this. A lot of smart people have done this way before. We're just simply-

02:31:17,570 --> 02:31:18,846
SPEAKER_1:  proving that it's a good idea.

02:31:19,074 --> 02:31:26,686
SPEAKER_1:  It turns out that if you put this on eBay essentially, so if you do an e-procurement system where bidders can come in,

02:31:26,914 --> 02:31:31,614
SPEAKER_1:  Suddenly it becomes harder to put up the goon. You can still do it, but it's harder to do it.

02:31:32,130 --> 02:31:35,166
SPEAKER_1:  It also means you get bids from all over Bang'llit Ashley

02:31:35,522 --> 02:31:42,622
SPEAKER_1:  And in general, you'll get bits from all over. Actually, turns out you get better quality. But most important is

02:31:42,882 --> 02:31:44,030
SPEAKER_1:  you get it much cheaper.

02:31:44,322 --> 02:31:56,894
SPEAKER_1:  So basically, you can simply save money. So we did a scaled experiment in Bangladesh where we had about 4% go to be e-procurement. And you could compare what it would have cost and then what it did cost.

02:31:57,186 --> 02:32:00,542
SPEAKER_1:  And the average reduction was, as I remember, it's 7%.

02:32:01,154 --> 02:32:02,974
SPEAKER_1:  And the finance minister loved it.

02:32:03,586 --> 02:32:09,822
SPEAKER_1:  because that basically gives him a lot more money or you can buy more stuff at the same cost. No, this is corruption.

02:32:10,626 --> 02:32:25,086
SPEAKER_1:  So it's basically you get rid of some corruption. There'll still be corruption, but less corruption. Ukraine has actually been big on this. Yeah, I've talked to them. I talked to the digital transformation minister. It's kind of incredible. I mean, this is before the war, but still.

02:32:25,570 --> 02:32:26,174
SPEAKER_1:  working.

02:32:26,594 --> 02:32:27,006
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

02:32:27,330 --> 02:32:29,950
SPEAKER_1:  It's like the entirety of the government is in an app.

02:32:30,562 --> 02:32:31,326
SPEAKER_1:  And that...

02:32:31,746 --> 02:32:33,054
SPEAKER_1:  one of the big effects.

02:32:33,826 --> 02:32:35,870
SPEAKER_1:  is the reduction of corruption.

02:32:36,194 --> 02:32:43,614
SPEAKER_1:  And not like from a, this was a politician say to say, we've reduced, we've taken these actions through this court. No, literally is just.

02:32:44,130 --> 02:32:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  much more difficult to be corrupt. Yeah.

02:32:46,850 --> 02:32:49,950
SPEAKER_1:  The incentives aren't quite there and there's friction.

02:32:50,274 --> 02:32:55,166
SPEAKER_1:  for corruption. Yeah. Oh yeah. You can spend a little bit of money.

02:32:55,586 --> 02:32:59,806
SPEAKER_1:  and you can make a huge benefit. There's still about 70 countries that haven't gotten e-procurement.

02:33:00,578 --> 02:33:01,726
SPEAKER_1:  Obviously they should do that.

02:33:02,242 --> 02:33:03,966
SPEAKER_1:  Food for small kids, another thing.

02:33:04,226 --> 02:33:08,318
SPEAKER_1:  So, you know, basically, yeah, it's morally wrong that people are starving.

02:33:08,642 --> 02:33:12,318
SPEAKER_1:  But it also turns out that it's a really, really

02:33:12,546 --> 02:33:16,734
SPEAKER_1:  dumb thing not to get kids good food. If you get them good food.

02:33:17,026 --> 02:33:18,270
SPEAKER_1:  that brains develop more.

02:33:18,626 --> 02:33:21,086
SPEAKER_1:  so that when they get into school, they learn more.

02:33:21,442 --> 02:33:23,486
SPEAKER_1:  And so when they come out in adult lives.

02:33:23,778 --> 02:33:24,894
SPEAKER_1:  been much more productive.

02:33:25,250 --> 02:33:26,558
SPEAKER_1:  So we can actually make.

02:33:26,946 --> 02:33:31,422
SPEAKER_1:  every kid in especially in developing countries much more productive.

02:33:31,714 --> 02:33:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  by making sure they get good food. So getting good food is not cost free. So it probably cost about $100, both in you need some directed advertisement, you need to make sure that you actually get some of the food out there, that you help the families, and you also make sure you don't just give it to everyone, because then it becomes a lot more expensive.

02:33:50,434 --> 02:33:53,374
SPEAKER_1:  If you do that right, it costs about $100 per kid.

02:33:53,762 --> 02:33:58,494
SPEAKER_1:  But per kid or per two years. So it's for their first two years of life.

02:33:59,170 --> 02:33:59,806
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:34:00,098 --> 02:34:01,214
SPEAKER_1:  And if you do that...

02:34:02,082 --> 02:34:23,166
SPEAKER_1:  you then get a benefit in that they become smarter and go longer to school and they actually learn more and become more productive of $4,500. Remember, this is far into the future. So this is discounted. The benefit is actually much higher. And this is one of the things that we also have a conversation about in climate change because all, and when you talk about climate change.

02:34:23,618 --> 02:34:30,238
SPEAKER_1:  Cost and benefits, all the costs are now, and all the benefits are in the future. But it's just like that in education. You know all the costs are now.

02:34:30,786 --> 02:34:32,894
SPEAKER_1:  all the benefits are far into the future.

02:34:33,218 --> 02:34:40,222
SPEAKER_1:  And if you try to do that right, and that's a whole other conversation that we could have, then it turns out that for every dollar spent.

02:34:40,674 --> 02:34:42,462
SPEAKER_1:  you do $45 worth of good.

02:34:42,754 --> 02:34:47,582
SPEAKER_1:  Again, remember about a third of all kids that go to school right now.

02:34:47,970 --> 02:34:48,862
SPEAKER_1:  Just don't learn.

02:34:49,282 --> 02:34:50,302
SPEAKER_1:  Pretty much anything?

02:34:51,298 --> 02:35:02,270
SPEAKER_1:  And if we could make them more productive in the school system, we have another proposal on how to do that in the, in the school system. But, you know, by just simply making sure that they're, that they're smarter when they get into school.

02:35:02,498 --> 02:35:05,790
SPEAKER_1:  We've been focusing so much on making the education system.

02:35:06,082 --> 02:35:07,198
SPEAKER_1:  better which is really hard.

02:35:07,618 --> 02:35:10,014
SPEAKER_1:  but it's actually really easy to make the kids.

02:35:10,338 --> 02:35:14,878
SPEAKER_1:  smarter than we say the education system is not working well that's what talking about that

02:35:15,298 --> 02:35:22,302
SPEAKER_1:  the American education system we're talking about globally. Yes, we're talking about globally. So about a third of the teachers in developing countries.

02:35:22,562 --> 02:35:35,966
SPEAKER_1:  have a hard time passing the tests of the things they have to teach their students. All these students have lots of other issues. They need to do farm work.

02:35:36,290 --> 02:35:48,734
SPEAKER_1:  constantly considering, should I just go out and start working instead? Uh, you know, there's, there's constant disruption. There's a lot of teachers that don't show up in India. You know, you have, uh, you have this absurd situation where all the teachers are

02:35:48,962 --> 02:35:49,662
SPEAKER_1:  basically.

02:35:50,146 --> 02:35:53,342
SPEAKER_1:  paid and hired for eternity for the rest of their lives.

02:35:53,602 --> 02:35:57,918
SPEAKER_1:  And so not surprisingly, a lot of them decide not to show up. So now they've hired.

02:35:58,658 --> 02:35:59,806
SPEAKER_1:  Assistant teachers.

02:36:00,226 --> 02:36:04,862
SPEAKER_1:  that basically have taken over. So they're paying, you know, for, I think it's 7 million teachers.

02:36:05,762 --> 02:36:28,094
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not saying they're not all not working, but a lot of them are not working as much as they should. We now hired another 7 million teachers that will eventually stop working as well. They're working much better right now because they're not on permanent contracts, but eventually they'll get on permanent contracts and then you have the same problem again. There's lots of these issues. And it's just simply about saying...

02:36:28,386 --> 02:36:29,598
SPEAKER_1:  We can't fix all problems.

02:36:29,954 --> 02:36:38,526
SPEAKER_1:  but there are some problems that are incredibly easy to solve and there are some that are incredibly hard to solve. Why don't we start with solving the easy and effective ones?

02:36:38,818 --> 02:36:52,446
SPEAKER_1:  And this of course bears on that whole conversation on climate change, because in some ways, you know, that's also Andy's point of saying, look, if you want to save people from the impacts of hurricanes, let's fix this simple, easy things about vulnerability first.

02:36:52,706 --> 02:36:57,342
SPEAKER_1:  Whereas we have somehow latched onto this. Let's fix the hardest thing to do.

02:36:57,634 --> 02:37:04,830
SPEAKER_1:  which is to get everyone to stop using fossil fuels, which is basically what's driven the last 200 years of development.

02:37:05,090 --> 02:37:05,758
SPEAKER_1:  That's gonna be.

02:37:06,018 --> 02:37:08,286
SPEAKER_1:  That's a tall order, no matter how you look at it.

02:37:08,962 --> 02:37:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  There's some really cool elements that.

02:37:11,106 --> 02:37:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  You guys just brought up.

02:37:12,802 --> 02:37:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  You mentioned that word moral before? I wasn't-

02:37:15,394 --> 02:37:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  I latched on to it because it relates to...

02:37:19,010 --> 02:37:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  these timescales that really are immeasurable. If you know it's going to take decades to-

02:37:23,906 --> 02:37:24,702
SPEAKER_0:  confirm.

02:37:25,090 --> 02:37:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  the benefit of some investment now.

02:37:27,970 --> 02:37:29,886
SPEAKER_0:  That implies you're doing the investment.

02:37:30,914 --> 02:37:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  with some moral imperative.

02:37:33,058 --> 02:37:34,110
SPEAKER_0:  not because you can.

02:37:34,562 --> 02:37:34,974
SPEAKER_0:  Do it.

02:37:35,714 --> 02:37:36,446
SPEAKER_0:  spreadsheet.

02:37:36,770 --> 02:37:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  and come out with a number.

02:37:38,594 --> 02:37:42,494
SPEAKER_0:  And that process, letting go of the need.

02:37:43,650 --> 02:37:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  for kind of a mechanistic cost benefit.

02:37:46,402 --> 02:37:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  thinking about kids' education in poor countries.

02:37:49,282 --> 02:37:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  or...

02:37:50,082 --> 02:37:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  several things we talked about.

02:37:51,906 --> 02:37:54,622
SPEAKER_0:  seems to be really important and it's very hard for all of us to do.

02:37:55,074 --> 02:37:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  Philanthropists suck at it.

02:37:57,090 --> 02:38:01,822
SPEAKER_0:  I worked at National Geographic Society for a year, building some new programs when they got a big infusion of money.

02:38:02,434 --> 02:38:06,270
SPEAKER_0:  They have a whole department that's called M&E. It's measurement and evaluation.

02:38:07,458 --> 02:38:08,670
SPEAKER_0:  which is if you don't prove it.

02:38:08,994 --> 02:38:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  It goes away.

02:38:10,210 --> 02:38:13,374
SPEAKER_0:  I mentioned Spotify earlier, Spotify killing a climate podcast.

02:38:13,762 --> 02:38:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  because that podcast didn't measure.

02:38:15,938 --> 02:38:17,342
SPEAKER_0:  measure out for their.

02:38:18,114 --> 02:38:19,998
SPEAKER_0:  impact what they want to do.

02:38:20,258 --> 02:38:25,086
SPEAKER_0:  And if we're always making the judgments based on strict cost benefit, we're going to miss.

02:38:25,922 --> 02:38:27,454
SPEAKER_0:  larger realities.

02:38:28,002 --> 02:38:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  Another thing is, a really exciting example of what you're talking about.

02:38:32,290 --> 02:38:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of.

02:38:33,314 --> 02:38:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  Ukraine with the trust and lack of less corruption and stuff was in India.

02:38:39,202 --> 02:38:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  for all of his issues. Moaty.

02:38:42,850 --> 02:38:43,646
SPEAKER_0:  recognized.

02:38:44,322 --> 02:38:50,366
SPEAKER_0:  that middle class people in India cook on LPG, propane, or on piped gas, natural gas if they're in cities.

02:38:51,266 --> 02:38:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  Much cleaner, much.

02:38:53,250 --> 02:38:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  Healthier.

02:38:54,722 --> 02:38:56,190
SPEAKER_0:  in so many ways and actually.

02:38:56,674 --> 02:39:02,014
SPEAKER_0:  compared to like chopping down trees and cooking on wood, it's actually better for the climate, even though it's a fossil fuel.

02:39:02,754 --> 02:39:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  So he-

02:39:04,066 --> 02:39:07,422
SPEAKER_0:  He and others, there was an American scientist, Kirk Smith, who worked this all out.

02:39:08,386 --> 02:39:08,830
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:39:09,570 --> 02:39:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  If you find a way, they were getting a subsidy. They had that energy subsidy. You were talking about many poor countries.

02:39:15,970 --> 02:39:18,110
SPEAKER_0:  subsidize energy just to stay in office, you know.

02:39:18,754 --> 02:39:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  to make something cheap that everyone wants.

02:39:20,674 --> 02:39:21,022
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:39:21,570 --> 02:39:24,158
SPEAKER_0:  but they wanted to shift the subsidy away from the middle class.

02:39:24,418 --> 02:39:25,598
SPEAKER_0:  See the poor people.

02:39:26,210 --> 02:39:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  or cooking on firewood and...

02:39:27,874 --> 02:39:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  dying young from pneumonia.

02:39:31,170 --> 02:39:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  And the critical factor was India's digital currency.

02:39:35,042 --> 02:39:36,094
SPEAKER_0:  India went through digital.

02:39:36,354 --> 02:39:36,830
SPEAKER_0:  economy.

02:39:37,762 --> 02:39:41,278
SPEAKER_0:  Very poor families there now. If you have a phone, basically that's your bank.

02:39:42,210 --> 02:39:42,686
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:39:43,042 --> 02:39:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  you could make the case to the public that we're going to be starting to shift your.

02:39:48,066 --> 02:39:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  LPG your propane subsidy to poor people.

02:39:51,682 --> 02:39:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  But we know they're poor.

02:39:53,954 --> 02:39:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  we know they're not just gonna be using it behind their restaurant.

02:39:56,962 --> 02:39:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  which was when it was a general subsidy.

02:39:59,906 --> 02:40:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  people were hoarding the LPG.

02:40:02,722 --> 02:40:03,966
SPEAKER_0:  and the system has worked.

02:40:04,482 --> 02:40:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  They've shifted a lot of

02:40:06,818 --> 02:40:10,558
SPEAKER_0:  capacity to cook on a clean blue flame that turns off and on.

02:40:11,138 --> 02:40:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  in homes that previously where the woman would spend hours collecting firewood.

02:40:15,458 --> 02:40:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  Smokey fire, cooking, clean the pots and start all over again.

02:40:19,170 --> 02:40:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  But it's all built on trust, built on the digital economy and the same thing in Nairobi.

02:40:24,226 --> 02:40:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  So that excites me every day with all the doomism.

02:40:28,162 --> 02:40:30,462
SPEAKER_0:  I just hope people can literally.

02:40:31,586 --> 02:40:32,350
SPEAKER_0:  Take a breath.

02:40:33,346 --> 02:40:35,390
SPEAKER_0:  Look for these examples.

02:40:35,810 --> 02:40:37,566
SPEAKER_0:  that show the potential when you have.

02:40:37,858 --> 02:40:38,942
SPEAKER_0:  a trustworthy system.

02:40:39,586 --> 02:40:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  when you have a clear path to making lives better.

02:40:42,658 --> 02:40:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  And then knowing, you know.

02:40:44,322 --> 02:40:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  That kid.

02:40:45,922 --> 02:40:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  having electric light as opposed to a kerosene lamp.

02:40:49,314 --> 02:40:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  We don't know how much that's gonna improve his homework.

02:40:52,770 --> 02:40:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  and lead to a better outcome.

02:40:54,466 --> 02:40:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  but we know from history that sometimes it does.

02:40:56,994 --> 02:41:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  Ban Ki-moon, former secretary general. The most powerful story I ever heard from a UN.

02:41:01,922 --> 02:41:02,686
SPEAKER_0:  Secretary General.

02:41:02,978 --> 02:41:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  It was like 2012 when they were rolling out.

02:41:05,954 --> 02:41:08,702
SPEAKER_0:  this sustainable energy for all initiative, which is not just.

02:41:09,026 --> 02:41:11,518
SPEAKER_0:  It's just like getting people energy they need to.

02:41:12,514 --> 02:41:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  Survive and thrive.

02:41:14,722 --> 02:41:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  He was growing up in post-war Korea.

02:41:17,698 --> 02:41:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  Everyone was poor. Everything was broken, destroyed.

02:41:20,642 --> 02:41:21,214
SPEAKER_0:  Sadly.

02:41:21,986 --> 02:41:23,934
SPEAKER_0:  like so much of many parts of Ukraine.

02:41:24,546 --> 02:41:25,086
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:41:25,666 --> 02:41:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  he would do his homework by kerosene lamp.

02:41:29,058 --> 02:41:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  He said when he was studying for his finals, his mom would give him a candle.

02:41:33,890 --> 02:41:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  This was a brighter flame.

02:41:36,514 --> 02:41:37,374
SPEAKER_0:  Better grades maybe.

02:41:37,762 --> 02:41:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  and he became Secretary of State.

02:41:40,866 --> 02:41:41,790
SPEAKER_1:  the hell of a story.

02:41:44,962 --> 02:41:46,462
SPEAKER_1:  So which...

02:41:49,218 --> 02:41:51,838
SPEAKER_1:  Climate change, which policies work, which don't?

02:41:53,346 --> 02:41:57,150
SPEAKER_1:  which are when we look at this formula of $1 in.

02:41:57,666 --> 02:41:58,878
SPEAKER_1:  $45 out.

02:41:59,682 --> 02:42:00,862
SPEAKER_1:  for climate change.

02:42:01,442 --> 02:42:02,078
SPEAKER_1:  What?

02:42:02,306 --> 02:42:05,342
SPEAKER_1:  dollar in what policies for dollar in.

02:42:06,050 --> 02:42:07,262
SPEAKER_1:  and dollar out are good.

02:42:09,250 --> 02:42:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  So we actually did a whole project back in 2009 when

02:42:13,794 --> 02:42:16,734
SPEAKER_1:  when the whole world circus was coming to Copenhagen.

02:42:17,026 --> 02:42:18,654
SPEAKER_1:  And we were going to save the world there.

02:42:19,394 --> 02:42:26,270
SPEAKER_1:  We brought together about 50 climate economists and three Nobel laureates to look at where can you spend a dollar and do the most good for climate.

02:42:27,042 --> 02:42:35,230
SPEAKER_1:  And what they found was a lot of these things as we've been talking about before, that basically investing in the current sort of technology that we're talking about.

02:42:35,522 --> 02:42:36,414
SPEAKER_1:  trying very hard.

02:42:36,802 --> 02:42:37,278
SPEAKER_1:  is.

02:42:37,762 --> 02:42:38,430
SPEAKER_1:  Best app.

02:42:39,010 --> 02:42:39,454
SPEAKER_1:  Pretty.

02:42:39,714 --> 02:42:44,094
SPEAKER_1:  dicey outcome, much of it is probably less than a dollar back in the dollar.

02:42:44,610 --> 02:42:53,438
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, there's some, uh, investments on, on, uh, adaptation for instance, that's pretty good, but it's sort of two, $3 back on the dollar.

02:42:53,762 --> 02:42:55,550
SPEAKER_1:  The obvious thing is that you built a dyke.

02:42:55,810 --> 02:42:56,990
SPEAKER_1:  for a sea level rise.

02:42:57,218 --> 02:43:11,614
SPEAKER_1:  or that you get some apps that people know that there's a hurricane coming. So you can adapt to- The data infrastructure, right? Yes. The physical and the digital infrastructure. Yes. The fact is that people are really good at doing this already.

02:43:12,258 --> 02:43:18,142
SPEAKER_1:  because they have a strong incentive to do it. So the extra thing that governments can do outside is somewhat good, but it's not.

02:43:18,370 --> 02:43:22,782
SPEAKER_1:  amazing or anything. What we found by far the best investment.

02:43:23,074 --> 02:43:24,510
SPEAKER_1:  in the long run.

02:43:24,898 --> 02:43:27,486
SPEAKER_1:  was on investment in energy innovation.

02:43:28,066 --> 02:43:31,710
SPEAKER_1:  So, and I think this also sort of corresponds with what we would.

02:43:32,258 --> 02:43:33,086
SPEAKER_1:  think in general.

02:43:33,378 --> 02:43:39,454
SPEAKER_1:  If we could innovate, for instance, Bill Gates is arguing we should have fourth generation nuclear. So the next

02:43:39,778 --> 02:43:51,710
SPEAKER_1:  more advanced than what we currently have in third generation nuclear, which would be an industrial scale process. Just building these modular nuclear power plants.

02:43:51,970 --> 02:44:11,550
SPEAKER_1:  they would be, instead of being this artwork that we design once for every different plant, which is one of the reasons why they're so expensive, they would just be mass produced and you would have one, you know, they all be recognized in one go. So it'd be much cheaper. They would also be passively safe. So if all the power goes.

02:44:11,778 --> 02:44:13,982
SPEAKER_1:  They'll shut down, rather than go boom.

02:44:14,338 --> 02:44:21,438
SPEAKER_1:  So that's another very good thing. And then they'll also be very hard to transform into nuclear weapons.

02:44:21,826 --> 02:44:39,518
SPEAKER_1:  So you can actually imagine them being out in a lot of different places where we'd perhaps be a little worried about having plutonium lying around. Now, this is all still being worked out, but imagine if that actually comes out. And again, remember, the other three generations, we were also told that it will be incredibly safe and it will be incredibly cheap.

02:44:39,842 --> 02:44:43,326
SPEAKER_1:  and it didn't turn out that way. So let's wait, but it could be.

02:44:44,098 --> 02:44:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  And so the argument is...

02:44:45,570 --> 02:44:47,710
SPEAKER_1:  invest in these ideas.

02:44:48,034 --> 02:44:49,566
SPEAKER_1:  for instance, fourth generation nuclear.

02:44:49,826 --> 02:44:53,118
SPEAKER_1:  and if forced generation nuclear becomes cheaper than fossil fuels.

02:44:53,602 --> 02:44:54,206
SPEAKER_1:  We're done.

02:44:54,690 --> 02:44:59,070
SPEAKER_1:  everyone will just switch, not just rich, well-meaning Americans or Europeans.

02:44:59,618 --> 02:45:04,766
SPEAKER_1:  but also the Chinese, the Indians, everybody in Africa, the rest is Indian subcontinent.

02:45:05,218 --> 02:45:08,958
SPEAKER_1:  That's how you fix these issues, right? So the idea here is to say...

02:45:09,602 --> 02:45:10,622
SPEAKER_1:  Instead of.

02:45:11,074 --> 02:45:12,318
SPEAKER_1:  thinking that we can sort of.

02:45:12,642 --> 02:45:15,902
SPEAKER_1:  push people to do stuff they really don't want to do.

02:45:16,610 --> 02:45:23,326
SPEAKER_1:  which is basically saying let's use more of the solar and wind that you would otherwise have invested in.

02:45:23,618 --> 02:45:27,710
SPEAKER_1:  force people to buy an electric car by giving huge subsidies because otherwise they're.

02:45:28,002 --> 02:45:28,734
SPEAKER_1:  Clearly not.

02:45:29,058 --> 02:45:31,230
SPEAKER_1:  all that interest in buying it and so on.

02:45:31,938 --> 02:45:33,886
SPEAKER_1:  Get the innovation such that.

02:45:34,114 --> 02:45:35,134
SPEAKER_1:  they become cheaper.

02:45:35,458 --> 02:45:37,406
SPEAKER_1:  then fossil fuels and everyone will switch.

02:45:37,794 --> 02:45:46,046
SPEAKER_1:  This is how we've solved problems in the past, if you think. In Los Angeles in the 1950s, it was a hugely polluted place, mostly because of cars.

02:45:46,466 --> 02:46:04,350
SPEAKER_1:  The standard climate approach today would be to tell everyone in Los Angeles, I'm sorry, could you just walk instead? And of course, that just doesn't work. That doesn't pay off. You never get politicians voted in office, or at least staying in office, if you make that kind of policy. What did solve the problem?

02:46:04,866 --> 02:46:07,070
SPEAKER_1:  was the innovation of the catalytic converter.

02:46:07,426 --> 02:46:12,222
SPEAKER_1:  You basically get the Zalib Gizmo and it cost a couple hundred dollars and you put it on your tailpipe.

02:46:12,578 --> 02:46:15,166
SPEAKER_1:  and then you can drive around basically almost not pollute.

02:46:15,906 --> 02:46:18,846
SPEAKER_1:  And that's how you fix the air pollution in Los Angeles.

02:46:19,266 --> 02:46:20,190
SPEAKER_1:  Basically we've.

02:46:20,514 --> 02:46:23,262
SPEAKER_1:  solved all problems in humanity. Amanda let here some big class

02:46:24,002 --> 02:46:32,478
SPEAKER_1:  difficult problems with innovation. We haven't solved it by telling everyone, I'm sorry, could you be a little less comfortable and a little more cold and a little poor?

02:46:32,898 --> 02:46:36,190
SPEAKER_1:  and believing that that can go on for decades.

02:46:36,610 --> 02:46:37,758
SPEAKER_1:  And while it-

02:46:38,050 --> 02:46:58,718
SPEAKER_1:  possibly works in some pockets of the US, and I think actually in large parts of Europe at least, it used to, the war in Ukraine is definitely sort of changing that whole perspective. But yeah, there's a willingness to say, we're gonna suffer a little, but then we'll fix this problem. But the point is, we're gonna be willing to suffer a little. And so-

02:46:59,010 --> 02:47:00,926
SPEAKER_1:  Fix a tiny bit of the...

02:47:01,250 --> 02:47:07,614
SPEAKER_1:  climate problem instead of actually focusing on innovation. So what we found was if you spend a dollar on innovation,

02:47:07,970 --> 02:47:12,094
SPEAKER_1:  you will probably avoid about $11 of climate damage in the long run.

02:47:12,418 --> 02:47:13,918
SPEAKER_1:  which is a great investment.

02:47:14,338 --> 02:47:15,838
SPEAKER_1:  And the terrible thing is...

02:47:16,578 --> 02:47:22,846
SPEAKER_1:  We have not been doing this. So because everybody is focused on saying, we need this solution within the next 12 years.

02:47:23,458 --> 02:47:32,030
SPEAKER_1:  It means you're not thinking about the innovation. We're actually spending less money, not more money on innovation globally. So everyone is focusing on...

02:47:32,290 --> 02:47:41,278
SPEAKER_1:  of reducing carbon emission versus innovating on alternate energy. You're basically focusing on putting the existing solar panels or wind turbines which are either.

02:47:41,730 --> 02:47:43,678
SPEAKER_1:  just about inefficient or inefficient.

02:47:44,226 --> 02:47:50,622
SPEAKER_1:  instead of making the next generation or it's more likely the 10th generation after that.

02:47:50,914 --> 02:48:10,974
SPEAKER_1:  that comes with lots of battery backup power or fourth generation nuclear, or Craig Venter has this great idea, Craig Venter, the guy who cracked the human genome back in 2000, he has this idea of growing algae out on the ocean surface. These algae, they'd be genetically modified and they would basically soak up sunlight and CO2.

02:48:11,458 --> 02:48:12,190
SPEAKER_1:  and produce oil.

02:48:12,770 --> 02:48:17,342
SPEAKER_1:  then we could basically just grow our own Saudi Arabia out on the ocean surface and we'd harvest it

02:48:17,666 --> 02:48:19,678
SPEAKER_1:  We'd keep our entire fossil fuel economy.

02:48:20,002 --> 02:48:21,950
SPEAKER_1:  but it not be net zero because.

02:48:22,210 --> 02:48:27,998
SPEAKER_1:  We just soaked up the CO2 out there. $1 invested in the portfolio of different ideas.

02:48:28,418 --> 02:48:29,470
SPEAKER_1:  Gives $11 back.

02:48:29,922 --> 02:48:33,854
SPEAKER_0:  I first wrote about that in the New York Times. It was one of my actual page one stories.

02:48:34,562 --> 02:48:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:48:35,554 --> 02:48:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  In 2006, it was declining R&D.

02:48:38,722 --> 02:48:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  in energy.

02:48:40,194 --> 02:48:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  at a time of global warming.

02:48:41,986 --> 02:48:42,494
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:48:43,074 --> 02:48:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  The baseline is so low for this that it's a super bargain.

02:48:47,938 --> 02:48:48,382
SPEAKER_0:  We were.

02:48:50,018 --> 02:48:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  during the energy crisis, the first energy crisis in the 70s.

02:48:55,458 --> 02:48:56,958
SPEAKER_0:  before the current one.

02:48:57,858 --> 02:48:58,334
SPEAKER_0:  are.

02:48:59,202 --> 02:49:02,366
SPEAKER_0:  annual spending in the United States and constant dollars on.

02:49:02,626 --> 02:49:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  R&Ds, research and development for energy.

02:49:05,762 --> 02:49:07,390
SPEAKER_0:  was about $5 billion.

02:49:07,970 --> 02:49:09,694
SPEAKER_0:  and then it's just dribbled away.

02:49:10,466 --> 02:49:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  since then and recently now there's a big burst of new money coming through these new bills that got passed.

02:49:16,066 --> 02:49:18,782
SPEAKER_0:  But what I was told over and over again by people in that arena.

02:49:19,778 --> 02:49:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  is you.

02:49:21,026 --> 02:49:22,846
SPEAKER_0:  Can't just have these little bubbles of...

02:49:23,074 --> 02:49:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  investment. You don't get young people.

02:49:26,754 --> 02:49:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  away from thinking about Wall Street for jobs towards thinking about energy innovation.

02:49:30,850 --> 02:49:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  If there isn't like a.

02:49:31,970 --> 02:49:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  future there.

02:49:33,218 --> 02:49:35,262
SPEAKER_0:  and a lot of the in the United States and Europe.

02:49:35,682 --> 02:49:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  The presumption was the way to that future was.

02:49:37,922 --> 02:49:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  Taxing.

02:49:39,554 --> 02:49:39,902
SPEAKER_0:  carpet.

02:49:41,378 --> 02:49:42,110
SPEAKER_0:  Make that.

02:49:42,370 --> 02:49:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  so punitive that

02:49:44,130 --> 02:49:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  You're basically leveling even in the landscape for cleaner stuff that's more expensive.

02:49:49,442 --> 02:49:51,134
SPEAKER_0:  That has failed completely.

02:49:51,778 --> 02:49:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  They're little examples in Europe where.

02:49:53,314 --> 02:49:53,662
SPEAKER_0:  Working.

02:49:54,498 --> 02:49:55,710
SPEAKER_0:  And what's happened now is...

02:49:56,258 --> 02:49:58,078
SPEAKER_0:  well, the United States, this big chunk of money.

02:49:59,778 --> 02:50:02,366
SPEAKER_0:  designed to take us over a finish line.

02:50:03,202 --> 02:50:04,286
SPEAKER_0:  that was started with

02:50:04,706 --> 02:50:12,318
SPEAKER_0:  not just innovation, but with the production efficiency too. This is one thing I got wrong, I think, a little bit in my reporting. I was so fixated on the innovation part.

02:50:12,994 --> 02:50:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  just because.

02:50:13,858 --> 02:50:14,942
SPEAKER_0:  I love science too.

02:50:15,298 --> 02:50:17,598
SPEAKER_0:  I saw this untapped possibility.

02:50:18,498 --> 02:50:21,854
SPEAKER_0:  that others were saying, no, no, production efficiency, the more people are.

02:50:22,306 --> 02:50:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  producing batteries the cheapest I'll get.

02:50:24,162 --> 02:50:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  This is Elon Musk.

02:50:26,274 --> 02:50:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  you know, path.

02:50:27,458 --> 02:50:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  and many others.

02:50:28,994 --> 02:50:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  And it really is both. So when you were talking about purchasing power for governments, for example.

02:50:33,602 --> 02:50:34,686
SPEAKER_0:  that can stimulate.

02:50:34,946 --> 02:50:35,550
SPEAKER_0:  Production.

02:50:36,450 --> 02:50:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  capacity for batteries or whatever the good thing is.

02:50:39,426 --> 02:50:40,670
SPEAKER_0:  and take you down faster.

02:50:41,410 --> 02:50:43,134
SPEAKER_0:  And it's all about getting that margin.

02:50:43,682 --> 02:50:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  of the new thing.

02:50:44,930 --> 02:50:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  out competing the old.

02:50:47,074 --> 02:50:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  And it's not just innovation. It has so many parts of the pipeline that need to be nurtured.

02:50:51,906 --> 02:50:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  So, so.

02:50:53,474 --> 02:50:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  And the other thing is relative cost.

02:50:55,906 --> 02:50:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  The United States.

02:50:57,058 --> 02:50:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  When I was writing about this in 2006.

02:50:59,970 --> 02:51:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  our budget for

02:51:01,442 --> 02:51:05,726
SPEAKER_0:  DARPA, the Advanced Research Project Agency for the Defense Department.

02:51:06,626 --> 02:51:09,150
SPEAKER_0:  just for science, was 80 billion a year.

02:51:10,178 --> 02:51:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  for health, for medical.

02:51:11,842 --> 02:51:14,366
SPEAKER_0:  frontier research on cancers of 40 billion.

02:51:14,818 --> 02:51:15,934
SPEAKER_0:  Energy was two or three.

02:51:17,346 --> 02:51:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  So we weren't taking this remotely seriously. So now that if we get that.

02:51:21,986 --> 02:51:23,550
SPEAKER_0:  To me, there's like this level.

02:51:24,706 --> 02:51:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  You know we're taking something seriously when it's like in the tens of billions.

02:51:27,746 --> 02:51:30,910
SPEAKER_0:  for R&D. It's not that R&D will solve the problem, but...

02:51:31,170 --> 02:51:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  It's a proxy for what we really care about.

02:51:33,506 --> 02:51:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  We care a shitload about defense.

02:51:35,682 --> 02:51:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  What's their defense budget in the United States now? Like 800 billion?

02:51:38,850 --> 02:51:43,518
SPEAKER_0:  It's some insane number. Who's counting when you're having fun? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so, um.

02:51:43,842 --> 02:51:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  Innovation is not just like for the better.

02:51:46,818 --> 02:51:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

02:51:47,522 --> 02:51:47,998
SPEAKER_0:  Camera.

02:51:48,610 --> 02:51:50,558
SPEAKER_0:  better solar panel, the better battery.

02:51:51,042 --> 02:51:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  Social innovation actually matters hugely, like the guy in Nairobi I mentioned.

02:51:55,682 --> 02:51:57,598
SPEAKER_0:  with a company doing micropayment.

02:51:58,178 --> 02:51:59,710
SPEAKER_0:  gas to get people off charcoal.

02:52:00,514 --> 02:52:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  We need that.

02:52:01,698 --> 02:52:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  as much as this.

02:52:03,650 --> 02:52:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  And I actually, I interviewed Bill Gates. We had to spend an hour with him in Seattle.

02:52:08,642 --> 02:52:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  in 2016.

02:52:11,490 --> 02:52:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  when he was rolling out his breakthrough energy thing. I got to spend...

02:52:15,170 --> 02:52:20,542
SPEAKER_0:  It was 45 minutes, me and Bill Gates, which was pretty fun. But I brought this up, I said, you know, because he's all about

02:52:20,866 --> 02:52:27,409
SPEAKER_0:  the new nuclear thing that will solve the world's problems. And I, yes, yes, yes, but we also- He brought up nuclear, sorry to interrupt. Oh, he did, oh sure, yes.

02:52:27,409 --> 02:52:28,909
SPEAKER_1:  So he's interested in the new.

02:52:28,909 --> 02:52:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, he's investing heavily in nuclear, but he invests in everything. He's got a big portfolio.

02:52:34,242 --> 02:52:34,654
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:52:35,650 --> 02:52:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  But I brought up a guy I met in India.

02:52:39,426 --> 02:52:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  who runs a little outfit called Selco, that they do really interesting, cool.

02:52:43,394 --> 02:52:44,478
SPEAKER_0:  Village to village.

02:52:45,634 --> 02:52:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  They're like.

02:52:46,242 --> 02:52:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  An energy analyst will come to your house here in the States.

02:52:49,506 --> 02:52:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  tell you how to weatherize your house, so they do it at the village scale.

02:52:52,898 --> 02:52:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  and in a village that has...

02:52:55,554 --> 02:52:56,478
SPEAKER_0:  Brother Milling Wheat.

02:52:57,058 --> 02:52:58,398
SPEAKER_0:  He'll put in a solar powered wheat.

02:52:58,658 --> 02:52:59,166
SPEAKER_0:  Wheat milk.

02:53:00,098 --> 02:53:00,510
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:53:01,314 --> 02:53:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  that's not going to solve the world's problems, but it gives them a way to control their energy.

02:53:05,762 --> 02:53:07,454
SPEAKER_0:  They don't have to buy something to grind their wheat.

02:53:08,066 --> 02:53:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  and that needs just as much attention as the.

02:53:11,426 --> 02:53:13,854
SPEAKER_0:  the things I really like too, the cool technologies.

02:53:14,370 --> 02:53:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  And I thought I cornered Bill Gates. I was like.

02:53:18,658 --> 02:53:20,542
SPEAKER_0:  Because he really does focus on these big wins.

02:53:20,930 --> 02:53:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  big, you know.

02:53:21,794 --> 02:53:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  Like, too clear.

02:53:22,850 --> 02:53:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  that will make.

02:53:24,034 --> 02:53:26,686
SPEAKER_0:  net zero completely doable. And I said, well, you know,

02:53:27,554 --> 02:53:31,198
SPEAKER_0:  What about New York City where I was still living at the time?

02:53:32,418 --> 02:53:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  I said, it's got a million buildings.

02:53:35,362 --> 02:53:39,230
SPEAKER_0:  New York City has one million buildings. And in 2013, the Bloomberg government.

02:53:39,746 --> 02:53:40,606
SPEAKER_0:  analyzed this.

02:53:41,090 --> 02:53:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  Looking ahead to 2050.

02:53:43,330 --> 02:53:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  75% of the buildings in New York City.

02:53:45,666 --> 02:53:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  that will exist in 2050.

02:53:47,650 --> 02:53:48,574
SPEAKER_0:  already exist.

02:53:49,698 --> 02:53:51,710
SPEAKER_0:  Think about these brave new futures, right?

02:53:52,194 --> 02:53:53,214
SPEAKER_0:  We're just going to come in.

02:53:53,570 --> 02:53:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  have these shiny cool passive house cities.

02:53:56,386 --> 02:53:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  And I put this to Bill and I said, so.

02:53:59,458 --> 02:54:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  How do you do that? How do you retrofit all those?

02:54:02,786 --> 02:54:06,078
SPEAKER_0:  boilers, many of which were coal fired like 20 years ago.

02:54:07,074 --> 02:54:08,830
SPEAKER_0:  to get a zero energy in New York City.

02:54:09,250 --> 02:54:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  I kind of thought I had him. He kind of sat back and went, well.

02:54:15,138 --> 02:54:18,878
SPEAKER_0:  But if you have unlimited clean power coming into that city, it doesn't really matter.

02:54:20,130 --> 02:54:29,054
SPEAKER_0:  It's a pretty good Bill Gates impression. It was a good answer. I mean, it was a good answer. He said, oh yeah, it's a leaky bucket, but pour in zero carbon energy, then it doesn't matter.

02:54:29,954 --> 02:54:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  But I still think we have to figure out the other part too. That end, how do you, how do you?

02:54:34,050 --> 02:54:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  innovate at the household level, at the village level.

02:54:37,442 --> 02:54:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  It's much more of a distributed problem, we used to think.

02:54:40,290 --> 02:54:43,038
SPEAKER_0:  The one big change I've had in my own thinking too is...

02:54:44,162 --> 02:54:44,542
SPEAKER_0:  is.

02:54:45,186 --> 02:54:46,110
SPEAKER_0:  from top down.

02:54:46,466 --> 02:54:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  to distribute it.

02:54:48,194 --> 02:54:49,470
SPEAKER_0:  Everything about the climate problem.

02:54:50,594 --> 02:54:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  True.

02:54:51,746 --> 02:54:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  The first three decades of my reporting was that the

02:54:55,394 --> 02:54:59,742
SPEAKER_0:  The IPCC will come out a new report, the framework convention, the treaty will.

02:55:00,418 --> 02:55:01,502
SPEAKER_0:  Get us on board.

02:55:02,274 --> 02:55:04,318
SPEAKER_0:  we'll all behave better. It has this like.

02:55:04,578 --> 02:55:06,814
SPEAKER_0:  top down, parent to child.

02:55:08,258 --> 02:55:08,894
SPEAKER_0:  architecture.

02:55:09,666 --> 02:55:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:55:10,658 --> 02:55:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  Everything I've learned has gone the other way. It's distributed capacity.

02:55:15,842 --> 02:55:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  for improved.

02:55:16,834 --> 02:55:19,006
SPEAKER_0:  lives, you know, kids getting through school.

02:55:20,002 --> 02:55:20,926
SPEAKER_0:  Women not having to.

02:55:21,474 --> 02:55:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  spend three hours collecting firewood. And if it means propane for that household in that context, that's a good thing.

02:55:26,530 --> 02:55:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  So stop with all your yammering about any oil, fossil fuel subsidies.

02:55:30,146 --> 02:55:30,622
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:55:31,618 --> 02:55:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  You know, what's an America look like?

02:55:34,050 --> 02:55:35,390
SPEAKER_0:  has some claims.

02:55:36,098 --> 02:55:37,310
SPEAKER_0:  climate safe energy future.

02:55:38,050 --> 02:55:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  Find your part in that.

02:55:39,842 --> 02:55:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  Don't get disempowered by the scale of it. There's just like a thousand things to do. When you start to cut it into pieces.

02:55:45,474 --> 02:55:47,646
SPEAKER_0:  So it's very different, it's not a top-down thing.

02:55:48,450 --> 02:55:50,325
SPEAKER_0:  No one's going to magically come in and...

02:55:50,325 --> 02:55:54,814
SPEAKER_1:  and that's where I think, so I agree that everyone should try to play their

02:55:55,170 --> 02:55:57,086
SPEAKER_1:  their part and do.

02:55:57,794 --> 02:56:00,990
SPEAKER_1:  whatever they can. But I also think, you know, just

02:56:01,346 --> 02:56:06,366
SPEAKER_1:  the sheer incentives, what we saw happening with shale gas.

02:56:06,626 --> 02:56:07,678
SPEAKER_1:  is a great example. Yeah.

02:56:07,906 --> 02:56:11,550
SPEAKER_1:  when shale gas becomes so cheap that you just stop using coal.

02:56:12,258 --> 02:56:14,270
SPEAKER_1:  that then you don't really have to convince.

02:56:14,530 --> 02:56:18,655
SPEAKER_1:  You know, lots and lots of people, you know, coal is really bad. It wasn't labeled a climate.

02:56:18,655 --> 02:56:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  No, it wasn't a climate thing. It was an energy thing.

02:56:20,610 --> 02:56:25,502
SPEAKER_1:  It was totally, and the point is just, you know, the power of an innovation.

02:56:25,730 --> 02:56:26,974
SPEAKER_1:  is that you're almost.

02:56:27,234 --> 02:56:29,694
SPEAKER_1:  don't see it anymore, it just happens.

02:56:30,018 --> 02:56:33,534
SPEAKER_1:  And I think that's really the only way we're going to fix.

02:56:33,826 --> 02:56:42,302
SPEAKER_1:  You know, these big problems, if you think about, you know, the nutrition problem back in the 60s, 70s, we worried a lot about India and other places.

02:56:43,010 --> 02:56:53,214
SPEAKER_1:  The solution is not worrying or the solution was not us eating a little bit less and sending it down to India or wherever. The solution was the Green Revolution, right? It was the fact that some scientists made...

02:56:53,570 --> 02:56:55,006
SPEAKER_1:  ways to make every seed.

02:56:55,234 --> 02:57:04,446
SPEAKER_1:  produce three times as much. So you could grow three times as much food on an acre. And that's what basically made it possible for India to go from a basket case to what.

02:57:04,706 --> 02:57:06,462
SPEAKER_1:  the world's leading rice exporter.

02:57:06,754 --> 02:57:11,614
SPEAKER_1:  And that's how you do these things. You solve these big problems.

02:57:12,066 --> 02:57:12,830
SPEAKER_1:  through innovation.

02:57:13,282 --> 02:57:21,278
SPEAKER_1:  And again, I'm not saying that we're actually arcing a carbon tax is a smart thing to do. That's what any economist would tell you to do.

02:57:21,570 --> 02:57:22,846
SPEAKER_1:  But it also turns out...

02:57:23,106 --> 02:57:23,550
SPEAKER_1:  that it's.

02:57:23,906 --> 02:57:26,686
SPEAKER_1:  partly is not going to solve most of the problem and

02:57:27,298 --> 02:57:35,198
SPEAKER_1:  it's incredibly politically hard to do. So it may also just be the wrong sort of tree to bark up against. If you can do it, please do.

02:57:35,778 --> 02:57:45,310
SPEAKER_1:  But this is not the main thing that's going to solve climate. The main thing is that we get these innovations that basically make greened-ish so cheap everyone will just want.

02:57:46,210 --> 02:57:48,446
SPEAKER_1:  We mentioned nuclear quite a few times.

02:57:48,738 --> 02:57:50,526
SPEAKER_1:  You know, there was a for a long time.

02:57:50,946 --> 02:57:53,022
SPEAKER_1:  It seems to have shifted recently. Maybe you can-

02:57:53,442 --> 02:57:55,294
SPEAKER_1:  clarify and educate me on this, but they're-

02:57:55,842 --> 02:57:58,750
SPEAKER_1:  For the longest time people thought that nuclear is...

02:57:59,746 --> 02:58:00,094
SPEAKER_1:  is.

02:58:00,866 --> 02:58:02,462
SPEAKER_1:  almost unclean energy.

02:58:02,722 --> 02:58:03,134
SPEAKER_1:  or

02:58:03,362 --> 02:58:06,590
SPEAKER_1:  dangerous energy or all that kind of stuff. When did that shift?

02:58:07,330 --> 02:58:09,310
SPEAKER_1:  What was the source of that alarmism?

02:58:09,986 --> 02:58:10,878
SPEAKER_1:  I am woke.

02:58:11,234 --> 02:58:13,918
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe is that a case study of how?

02:58:14,306 --> 02:58:16,702
SPEAKER_1:  alarmism can turn into

02:58:17,506 --> 02:58:19,902
SPEAKER_1:  a productive constructive policy.

02:58:20,226 --> 02:58:20,606
SPEAKER_0:  Haha.

02:58:21,154 --> 02:58:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  Productive from whose standpoint?

02:58:24,322 --> 02:58:25,854
SPEAKER_1:  I live- Is it not? Is it not?

02:58:25,986 --> 02:58:30,861
SPEAKER_0:  like nuclear. We're not trying to be, do you mean productive in terms of yay we banned it or protective because

02:58:30,861 --> 02:58:33,694
SPEAKER_1:  I see, I see what you mean, yes. I meant productive for human.

02:58:33,826 --> 02:58:36,670
SPEAKER_0:  No, the alarmism over nuclear power.

02:58:37,026 --> 02:58:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  dominated.

02:58:38,114 --> 02:58:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  any alarmism over global warming.

02:58:40,898 --> 02:58:41,598
SPEAKER_0:  Absolutely.

02:58:41,986 --> 02:58:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  Oh really?

02:58:43,330 --> 02:58:48,254
SPEAKER_0:  Oh yeah, this in the United States, three mile island, then you turn over there.

02:58:49,666 --> 02:58:50,142
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:58:50,786 --> 02:58:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  the traditional environmental movement.

02:58:52,770 --> 02:58:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  won't.

02:58:53,666 --> 02:58:55,230
SPEAKER_0:  still won't go there. Is that a a

02:58:56,514 --> 02:59:00,382
SPEAKER_0:  the big groups, NRDC, EDF, that whole alphabet soup of–

02:59:01,058 --> 02:59:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  the big greens are reluctant to.

02:59:03,682 --> 02:59:04,702
SPEAKER_0:  put forward the nuclear.

02:59:05,538 --> 02:59:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  option because they know a lot of their aging donors.

02:59:09,730 --> 02:59:13,854
SPEAKER_0:  basically grew up in the thinking about nuclear is the problem, not the solution.

02:59:14,242 --> 02:59:17,246
SPEAKER_0:  I lived for the last 30 years. I moved to Maine recently.

02:59:18,306 --> 02:59:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  But I lived in the Hudson Valley, 10 miles from the Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant.

02:59:21,986 --> 02:59:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  which was built in the 60s, 70s.

02:59:25,026 --> 02:59:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  and had some problems.

02:59:26,850 --> 02:59:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  None of them were.

02:59:28,258 --> 02:59:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  to the point of.

02:59:30,018 --> 02:59:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  meltdown or the threat of it or even the theoretical possibility of one.

02:59:35,426 --> 02:59:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  I was in it twice as a reporter, looking down in the cooling pool. I can send you a fun video.

02:59:41,378 --> 02:59:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  bubbles in the cooling pool with the rods.

02:59:44,738 --> 02:59:45,790
SPEAKER_0:  Progressively they-

02:59:46,050 --> 02:59:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  demonstrated how to handle waste in the United States. Now the waste is.

02:59:49,602 --> 02:59:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  because we haven't figured out how to move it across state lines.

02:59:53,058 --> 02:59:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  It's a.

02:59:55,234 --> 02:59:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  glassified it's put into kind of containers that sit there at the plant.

02:59:59,010 --> 03:00:01,086
SPEAKER_0:  We just simply don't have a long term.

03:00:01,762 --> 03:00:02,398
SPEAKER_0:  solution.

03:00:03,042 --> 03:00:03,358
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

03:00:04,738 --> 03:00:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  the Nevada.

03:00:07,426 --> 03:00:07,774
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:00:08,066 --> 03:00:11,934
SPEAKER_0:  politicians were successful in saying not here, not here, not Yucca Mountain.

03:00:12,706 --> 03:00:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:00:14,818 --> 03:00:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  About my wife?

03:00:15,874 --> 03:00:20,702
SPEAKER_0:  I've been married to, well, I met 30 years ago and she lives with me. She's an environmental educator.

03:00:21,602 --> 03:00:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  She was very happy when Cuomo...

03:00:23,714 --> 03:00:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  Shut it down.

03:00:25,186 --> 03:00:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  Said we're going to shut it down.

03:00:26,946 --> 03:00:28,798
SPEAKER_0:  three or four years ago, which just happened a year.

03:00:29,058 --> 03:00:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  It actually is shut down now.

03:00:30,626 --> 03:00:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  I speak Muffball and I was like, that sucks.

03:00:33,154 --> 03:00:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  We need... She's happy.

03:00:34,882 --> 03:00:36,757
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, and we still love each other.

03:00:36,757 --> 03:00:38,590
SPEAKER_1:  environmentalist so that that just

03:00:38,850 --> 03:00:39,742
SPEAKER_1:  speaks to.

03:00:40,258 --> 03:00:43,326
SPEAKER_1:  a lot of environmentalists still see nuclear as bad.

03:00:43,810 --> 03:00:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  Oh totally.

03:00:45,154 --> 03:00:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  and you bring in the weapons proliferation issues and...

03:00:50,466 --> 03:00:55,486
SPEAKER_0:  But it's a safety thing, it's a generational thing. I think young people are different, I hope.

03:00:56,322 --> 03:00:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  these small modular reactor designs.

03:00:59,746 --> 03:01:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  several of which

03:01:01,154 --> 03:01:02,334
SPEAKER_0:  There's a couple of.

03:01:02,594 --> 03:01:03,582
SPEAKER_0:  PhDs from

03:01:04,354 --> 03:01:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  MIT, who did transatomic power.

03:01:07,426 --> 03:01:09,022
SPEAKER_0:  They're both like in their early 30s.

03:01:09,698 --> 03:01:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  We need so much more of them.

03:01:11,554 --> 03:01:13,630
SPEAKER_0:  And just briefly, the one thing I say about nuclear is...

03:01:14,242 --> 03:01:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  Like with so many of these things, like subsidies.

03:01:17,282 --> 03:01:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  Don't talk to me about.

03:01:18,850 --> 03:01:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, no, nuclear.

03:01:20,482 --> 03:01:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  Talk to me about what do you want to do with existing nuclear power plants?

03:01:24,354 --> 03:01:24,670
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:01:24,930 --> 03:01:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  What do you want to do about the possibility of new ones?

03:01:28,034 --> 03:01:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  Let's parse this out in chunks that we can.

03:01:30,690 --> 03:01:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  have constructive conversations about the idea of no nuclear.

03:01:34,210 --> 03:01:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  drives me crazy.

03:01:35,234 --> 03:01:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  just like no fossil fuel subsidies.

03:01:37,826 --> 03:01:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  is silly in the world we inhabit that has these pockets of no energy.

03:01:41,826 --> 03:01:42,206
SPEAKER_0:  So that.

03:01:42,914 --> 03:01:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  That's just my, you know, my sustained what?

03:01:45,282 --> 03:01:46,014
SPEAKER_0:  Mantras.

03:01:46,978 --> 03:01:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  start with some dividing it and divide and conquer.

03:01:50,594 --> 03:01:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  to conquer the dispute.

03:01:52,162 --> 03:01:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  over by saying, let's at least get real.

03:01:54,882 --> 03:01:57,118
SPEAKER_0:  This power plant has been in the Hudson Valley for 30 years.

03:01:57,794 --> 03:02:01,342
SPEAKER_0:  It was the baseload. It was baseload. Baseload is a real thing.

03:02:02,402 --> 03:02:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:02:03,906 --> 03:02:06,558
SPEAKER_0:  Guesswork has filled the gap since that power plant is turned off.

03:02:07,362 --> 03:02:08,286
SPEAKER_0:  Natural gas.

03:02:08,578 --> 03:02:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  Natural gas, but.

03:02:10,114 --> 03:02:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  And.

03:02:11,074 --> 03:02:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  You don't hear that.

03:02:12,450 --> 03:02:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  from the environmental community that was so eager to turn off.

03:02:15,490 --> 03:02:16,446
SPEAKER_0:  the Indian Point.

03:02:17,122 --> 03:02:19,166
SPEAKER_1:  I think both the point of saying.

03:02:19,618 --> 03:02:30,302
SPEAKER_1:  People are saying it's the end of the world, but no, I don't want a new clip how it just doesn't make sense. Right. And Andy is absolutely right to talk about so existing nuclear power plants.

03:02:30,850 --> 03:02:32,094
SPEAKER_1:  You already paid for them.

03:02:32,706 --> 03:02:37,566
SPEAKER_1:  We already have them. We already committed to decommissioning them eventually.

03:02:37,826 --> 03:02:39,006
SPEAKER_1:  while they're running.

03:02:39,650 --> 03:02:44,702
SPEAKER_1:  pretty much the cheapest power you can possibly have on the planet, because it costs almost nothing.

03:02:44,930 --> 03:02:45,534
SPEAKER_1:  to run them.

03:02:45,794 --> 03:02:46,398
SPEAKER_1:  day to day.

03:02:46,946 --> 03:02:48,126
SPEAKER_1:  You know, it's basically.

03:02:48,418 --> 03:02:50,782
SPEAKER_1:  cheap or almost free CO2.

03:02:51,042 --> 03:02:53,982
SPEAKER_1:  baseload power. There's just nothing there that is

03:02:54,306 --> 03:02:56,862
SPEAKER_1:  that you should embrace.

03:02:57,954 --> 03:02:59,422
SPEAKER_1:  New nuclear power plants.

03:03:00,002 --> 03:03:18,910
SPEAKER_1:  turn out to be very expensive currently. So the one they built in Finland, some in the UK and France and several other places turn out to be incredibly expensive. So they're much more expensive than the costliest renewables you can imagine. So they're actually not a solution right now.

03:03:19,746 --> 03:03:27,102
SPEAKER_1:  And that's why we need the innovation. That's why we need the potentially fourth generation nuclear power. It's just simply, it's a bad deal.

03:03:27,458 --> 03:03:33,342
SPEAKER_1:  And that's why nuclear is never going to win on its third generation. Now it may never.

03:03:33,794 --> 03:03:35,230
SPEAKER_1:  Get there. Who knows?

03:03:35,586 --> 03:03:36,350
SPEAKER_1:  but it's certainly a-

03:03:36,578 --> 03:03:41,470
SPEAKER_1:  a possibility and we should be looking into it. And there are, there are, you know.

03:03:41,762 --> 03:03:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  wonky.

03:03:42,786 --> 03:03:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  realities.

03:03:44,066 --> 03:03:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  that need to be.

03:03:44,994 --> 03:03:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  dealt with. I'm the chair of the regulatory commission in the United States.

03:03:48,130 --> 03:03:49,246
SPEAKER_0:  their approval process.

03:03:49,570 --> 03:03:51,166
SPEAKER_0:  is still locked and designed.

03:03:51,778 --> 03:03:54,846
SPEAKER_0:  on this 50-year-old model of big, giant power plants.

03:03:55,298 --> 03:03:57,406
SPEAKER_0:  There's an intense discussion right now about.

03:03:58,786 --> 03:04:03,678
SPEAKER_0:  evolving a new regulatory scheme for small modular ones because of all these

03:04:04,002 --> 03:04:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  implicit advantages they offer.

03:04:06,306 --> 03:04:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  And that's so weird.

03:04:08,034 --> 03:04:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  along with the innovation, you need to have this.

03:04:11,298 --> 03:04:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  get out of the way or you're never going to have the investment.

03:04:14,178 --> 03:04:16,670
SPEAKER_0:  So it really is an all of the above thing.

03:04:17,090 --> 03:04:21,214
SPEAKER_0:  Looking at these as systems solutions is really important.

03:04:22,114 --> 03:04:23,198
SPEAKER_1:  Let me ask you about it.

03:04:23,874 --> 03:04:24,862
SPEAKER_1:  Alex Epstein.

03:04:25,954 --> 03:04:31,038
SPEAKER_1:  So he wrote, I'm not sure if you're familiar who he is, but he wrote a couple of books.

03:04:31,618 --> 03:04:35,774
SPEAKER_1:  It's just interesting to ask a question about fossil fuels because we're talking about reality.

03:04:36,034 --> 03:04:39,646
SPEAKER_1:  and he's somebody that doesn't just talk about the reality of fossil fuels, but

03:04:40,194 --> 03:04:44,702
SPEAKER_1:  He wrote a book, Moral Case for Fossil Fuels and Fossil Future.

03:04:45,154 --> 03:04:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  or he makes the case.

03:04:47,682 --> 03:04:54,174
SPEAKER_1:  that as his subtitle says, global human flourishing requires oil, coal and natural gas.

03:04:54,626 --> 03:04:55,006
SPEAKER_1:  or.

03:04:55,234 --> 03:04:55,838
SPEAKER_1:  More.

03:04:56,162 --> 03:04:58,782
SPEAKER_1:  oil, coal, and natural gas, not less.

03:05:00,130 --> 03:05:04,062
SPEAKER_1:  what do you think about the argument he makes? so he pushes

03:05:04,418 --> 03:05:06,654
SPEAKER_1:  We've had this kind of speaking of the center.

03:05:07,298 --> 03:05:11,550
SPEAKER_1:  of this balanced discussion of the reality of fossil fuels but also investing a lot.

03:05:11,874 --> 03:05:14,590
SPEAKER_1:  into renewable energy and then having

03:05:15,074 --> 03:05:16,958
SPEAKER_1:  the $1 to $11 return.

03:05:17,186 --> 03:05:18,174
SPEAKER_1:  He says like

03:05:19,234 --> 03:05:20,670
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not sure exactly how to

03:05:21,410 --> 03:05:22,430
SPEAKER_1:  I'll frame it but...

03:05:24,258 --> 03:05:27,518
SPEAKER_1:  investing and maintaining investment of fossil fuels.

03:05:27,874 --> 03:05:31,742
SPEAKER_1:  also has a positive return because of how efficient the energy is.

03:05:32,130 --> 03:05:33,438
SPEAKER_0:  I've read the first book.

03:05:33,666 --> 03:05:35,646
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I haven't got a second one.

03:05:35,906 --> 03:05:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  I've been planning to have them on my webcast, my tiny webcast.

03:05:39,714 --> 03:05:46,110
SPEAKER_0:  What's the name of the webcast? Sustain what? Everything I do is sustain what? Cause it's like, don't talk to me about sustainability.

03:05:46,690 --> 03:05:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  Sustain what?

03:05:47,682 --> 03:05:50,238
SPEAKER_0:  For whom? How? Then we're talking, you know?

03:05:50,594 --> 03:05:51,006
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:05:51,394 --> 03:05:52,926
SPEAKER_0:  interrogatory approach to things.

03:05:53,186 --> 03:05:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  So, um.

03:05:55,138 --> 03:05:55,486
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

03:05:55,778 --> 03:05:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  The valuable part of what he has done is to remind people.

03:06:00,322 --> 03:06:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  particularly in the West or North of what everyone.

03:06:02,946 --> 03:06:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  the developed world.

03:06:04,482 --> 03:06:06,686
SPEAKER_0:  that everything we take for granted.

03:06:07,842 --> 03:06:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  Low fertilizer, from low fertilizer.

03:06:10,466 --> 03:06:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  prices too.

03:06:11,778 --> 03:06:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  air conditioning to everything else exists because we had this bounty.

03:06:16,386 --> 03:06:18,142
SPEAKER_0:  that we dug out of the ground or pumped out of the ground.

03:06:18,914 --> 03:06:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  It's a boon, it's been an amazing boon to society.

03:06:21,730 --> 03:06:22,814
SPEAKER_0:  period. So start there.

03:06:23,522 --> 03:06:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  which means...

03:06:24,898 --> 03:06:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  going forward, what we're talking about is a substitution.

03:06:28,066 --> 03:06:28,702
SPEAKER_0:  Or...

03:06:29,986 --> 03:06:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  Having your fossil fuels and eating it too, meaning getting rid of the carbon dioxide. If you focus on the carbon dioxide.

03:06:36,194 --> 03:06:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  which is the thing warming the planet, not the burning of the fuels.

03:06:40,354 --> 03:06:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  then that's another way forward that could sustain fossil fuels.

03:06:44,034 --> 03:06:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  As far as I can tell from at least the first book, he makes the moral case.

03:06:48,066 --> 03:06:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  fossil fuels are.

03:06:49,346 --> 03:06:50,462
SPEAKER_0:  essentially a good.

03:06:51,330 --> 03:06:51,838
SPEAKER_0:  overall.

03:06:52,226 --> 03:06:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think he adequately.

03:06:54,306 --> 03:06:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  accounts for the need.

03:06:56,706 --> 03:06:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  to stop global warming. You know, I think that...

03:07:00,002 --> 03:07:05,534
SPEAKER_0:  We have to slow, slowing global warming is a fundamental need in this coming, in this century we're in.

03:07:06,402 --> 03:07:09,511
SPEAKER_0:  that's just not factored into his math.

03:07:09,511 --> 03:07:09,982
SPEAKER_1:  where?

03:07:10,562 --> 03:07:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  I've had a few sort of offline conversations with him. I think he said, because I mentioned I'm talking to the two of you, he said that.

03:07:17,410 --> 03:07:22,238
SPEAKER_1:  That's probably where he disagrees about the level of threat.

03:07:22,882 --> 03:07:24,286
SPEAKER_1:  um, global warming.

03:07:24,450 --> 03:07:27,838
SPEAKER_0:  causes.

03:07:28,418 --> 03:07:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  Brilliant guy. He lived right close to me in the Hudson Valley.

03:07:31,906 --> 03:07:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  He was in the Obama administration energy department.

03:07:34,402 --> 03:07:35,422
SPEAKER_0:  It's K-O-O-N-I-N.

03:07:35,906 --> 03:07:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  He wrote a bestseller that came out recently on.

03:07:38,882 --> 03:07:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  skepticism about climate.

03:07:40,738 --> 03:07:41,278
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:07:41,730 --> 03:07:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  And, um...

03:07:44,034 --> 03:07:45,534
SPEAKER_0:  There are other smart people who-

03:07:47,042 --> 03:07:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  somehow feel we can literally adapt our way forward without any constraint.

03:07:51,970 --> 03:07:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  on the gases changing the climate.

03:07:54,626 --> 03:07:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

03:07:56,034 --> 03:08:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  spent enough time on this. I think I'm a pretty level-headed reporter when it comes to this issue.

03:08:00,514 --> 03:08:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  I think having some sense that.

03:08:02,818 --> 03:08:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  We can.

03:08:03,842 --> 03:08:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  adapt our way into the world we're building through.

03:08:07,490 --> 03:08:10,206
SPEAKER_0:  relentless climate change with no new normal. обhong imager

03:08:11,042 --> 03:08:11,774
SPEAKER_0:  More guests.

03:08:12,194 --> 03:08:13,918
SPEAKER_0:  accumulating in the air every year.

03:08:15,106 --> 03:08:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  This was not static.

03:08:16,610 --> 03:08:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  moments.

03:08:18,082 --> 03:08:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  that that's a good thing to do.

03:08:21,730 --> 03:08:22,078
SPEAKER_0:  That's it.

03:08:22,530 --> 03:08:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  strike me as...

03:08:26,338 --> 03:08:31,422
SPEAKER_1:  I'd probably say that I think it's more sort of a, at least the thing that I take away from Alex.

03:08:31,714 --> 03:08:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  it's uh i'm

03:08:32,898 --> 03:08:35,070
SPEAKER_1:  is the fact as you point out.

03:08:35,874 --> 03:08:43,038
SPEAKER_1:  We need to recognise that fossil fuels are basically the backbone of our society today. We get 80% of our energy.

03:08:43,266 --> 03:08:45,141
SPEAKER_1:  from fossil fuels to day.

03:08:45,141 --> 03:08:45,891
SPEAKER_0:  50 years. Yeah.

03:08:45,891 --> 03:09:05,886
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. And people have no sense of this, right? So they have the idea because you see so many wind turbines and solar panels and everybody's talking about it, that this is huge big things. But the reality is remember only about a fifth of all energy uses, electricity, the rest is, you know, in processes and heating, industrial processes and so on.

03:09:06,402 --> 03:09:09,470
SPEAKER_1:  So actually, solar and wind right now.

03:09:09,794 --> 03:09:14,846
SPEAKER_1:  produces 1% of energy from wind and 0.8% from solar.

03:09:15,138 --> 03:09:18,513
SPEAKER_1:  This is not a huge thing. It's a fairly tiny bit.

03:09:18,513 --> 03:09:20,013
SPEAKER_0:  growing explosively but

03:09:20,013 --> 03:09:27,454
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, it's absolutely growing. But actually, it's growing slower than what nuclear was growing in the 70s and 80s, which I thought was a f-

03:09:27,778 --> 03:09:30,910
SPEAKER_1:  a fun point not by a little amount, but like two or three times.

03:09:31,298 --> 03:09:36,862
SPEAKER_1:  So we're still talking about something which is somewhat boutique, at least.

03:09:37,314 --> 03:09:42,782
SPEAKER_1:  And when you then look out into the future, and I think this is the interesting part of it.

03:09:43,074 --> 03:09:49,086
SPEAKER_1:  when you look out into the future, if you look at the Biden administration's own estimate of what will happen by 2050.

03:09:50,530 --> 03:09:51,646
SPEAKER_1:  We will be at.

03:09:52,034 --> 03:09:59,806
SPEAKER_1:  You know, if all countries do all the stuff that they promised and everything, we will be at 70% fossil fuels by 2015.

03:10:00,258 --> 03:10:00,798
SPEAKER_1:  Globally.

03:10:01,474 --> 03:10:08,958
SPEAKER_1:  This is just, yes, it's a better world. I think it's good that we're now down to 70 instead of 80.

03:10:09,282 --> 03:10:09,694
SPEAKER_1:  But...

03:10:10,082 --> 03:10:17,182
SPEAKER_1:  It is still a world that's fundamentally dependent on fossil fuels for almost everything that we really like about the world.

03:10:17,506 --> 03:10:20,254
SPEAKER_1:  and forgetting that, and I think we are doing that.

03:10:20,930 --> 03:10:39,262
SPEAKER_1:  in the sense as you also mentioned that people say no fossil fuels and we're in all development organizations, we're now telling the poor countries you can't get any funding for anything that has to do with fossil fuels. We have literally reduced our investment in...

03:10:39,490 --> 03:10:43,358
SPEAKER_1:  oil and gas by more than half since 2014.

03:10:43,618 --> 03:10:46,430
SPEAKER_1:  And much of this is because of climate concerns.

03:10:46,754 --> 03:10:49,598
SPEAKER_1:  This has real world consequences. This is why.

03:10:49,954 --> 03:10:52,670
SPEAKER_1:  and that your prices have gone up. It's not the only reason.

03:10:53,026 --> 03:10:57,118
SPEAKER_1:  COVID also, certainly the war in Ukraine, but this is an underlying system.

03:10:57,410 --> 03:11:02,558
SPEAKER_1:  systemic reason why fossil fuel costs will go up dramatically. Now a lot of greens.

03:11:02,850 --> 03:11:10,558
SPEAKER_1:  will sort of tend to say, well, that's great. We want fossil fuels to be expensive. We want people to be forced over to renewables.

03:11:10,786 --> 03:11:12,510
SPEAKER_1:  But that's very easy to say.

03:11:12,834 --> 03:11:13,758
SPEAKER_1:  if you're rich.

03:11:14,146 --> 03:11:20,798
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's the kind of thing that New Yorkers will say, you know, when you, when you go to rich, well-meaning, green New Yorkers and say,

03:11:21,026 --> 03:11:23,710
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, gasoline should cost $20 a gallon.

03:11:24,130 --> 03:11:29,086
SPEAKER_1:  Well, you don't have a car. You just ride the Metro. It's very easy for you to say that.

03:11:29,538 --> 03:11:33,790
SPEAKER_1:  lots of people both in the rich world but in poor parts of the US.

03:11:34,306 --> 03:11:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  all around the world, their lives have basically depended on fossil fuels. And so the idea that we're going to get people off by making it so expensive that it becomes impossible for them to live good lives.

03:11:45,666 --> 03:11:48,254
SPEAKER_1:  is almost morally reprehensible. And I think

03:11:48,674 --> 03:11:50,334
SPEAKER_1:  Alex has the right point there.

03:11:50,786 --> 03:11:52,990
SPEAKER_1:  We need to get people to realize.

03:11:53,378 --> 03:11:56,734
SPEAKER_1:  We're not going to get off fossil fuels anytime soon, so we need

03:11:57,250 --> 03:12:00,222
SPEAKER_1:  reasonably affordable fossil fuels for most of the world?

03:12:00,674 --> 03:12:15,230
SPEAKER_1:  And that's of course why we need to focus so much more on the innovation so that we can get to the point where we no longer need fossil fuels as soon as possible. But to say to everyone, look, we're going to make fossil fuels expensive way before we have the solution is just terrible.

03:12:15,426 --> 03:12:19,038
SPEAKER_0:  And so much is on the rich countries of the world.

03:12:19,522 --> 03:12:20,094
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:12:20,738 --> 03:12:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  I did a conversation recently with Johann Rockstrom who's

03:12:25,090 --> 03:12:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  a famed

03:12:26,434 --> 03:12:28,990
SPEAKER_0:  sustainability scientist in Stockholm.

03:12:29,698 --> 03:12:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  actually potstamp now.

03:12:32,066 --> 03:12:34,750
SPEAKER_0:  and he's come up with the idea of planetary boundaries.

03:12:35,266 --> 03:12:36,222
SPEAKER_0:  There's lots of things he...

03:12:36,450 --> 03:12:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  I said that I.

03:12:37,922 --> 03:12:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  As a journalist, I'm still looking into about that. Planetary boundaries. Yeah, that there are limits to what Earth can absorb in human...

03:12:44,290 --> 03:12:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  our use of water, phosphorus, our carbon dioxide loading in the atmosphere. There are these tipping

03:12:50,210 --> 03:12:52,254
SPEAKER_0:  there are these boundaries if we cross them.

03:12:52,642 --> 03:12:53,950
SPEAKER_0:  A hot zone, a danger zone.

03:12:54,178 --> 03:12:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  He's an interesting thinker.

03:12:55,970 --> 03:12:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  But on this point...

03:12:58,178 --> 03:13:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  last year at the Glasgow Climate Talks.

03:13:01,282 --> 03:13:03,518
SPEAKER_0:  He gave a very important talk about.

03:13:04,514 --> 03:13:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  The equity thing here.

03:13:05,890 --> 03:13:06,558
SPEAKER_0:  That you.

03:13:07,618 --> 03:13:09,310
SPEAKER_0:  He basically laid out a landscape.

03:13:10,338 --> 03:13:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  saying the rich nations of the world.

03:13:13,122 --> 03:13:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  need to greatly ramp up their reduction of emissions or what they're going to pay poor countries to do.

03:13:18,338 --> 03:13:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:13:18,978 --> 03:13:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  to allow poor countries

03:13:21,698 --> 03:13:23,902
SPEAKER_0:  some of which have fossil resources like in Africa.

03:13:25,122 --> 03:13:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  to have the carbon space.

03:13:27,522 --> 03:13:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  to own whatever space or time is left.

03:13:30,434 --> 03:13:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  to be able to develop their

03:13:33,186 --> 03:13:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  Fossil fuels.

03:13:35,106 --> 03:13:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  as a fundamental right because also they're starting from this little baseline, Ghana.

03:13:40,450 --> 03:13:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  hasn't contributed squat to the global warming problem in terms of emissions.

03:13:44,354 --> 03:13:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  Ghana has natural gas.

03:13:46,018 --> 03:13:46,430
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:13:46,690 --> 03:13:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  Right now, this month, environmental groups are

03:13:50,370 --> 03:13:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  Outside.

03:13:51,394 --> 03:13:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  the World Bank.

03:13:52,642 --> 03:13:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  Today, actually tonight.

03:13:54,914 --> 03:13:55,582
SPEAKER_0:  saying

03:13:55,906 --> 03:14:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  This was on their list of dirty projects. World Bank should stop financing Ghana's right to get gas out of the ground.

03:14:01,474 --> 03:14:02,526
SPEAKER_0:  to develop its economy.

03:14:02,978 --> 03:14:04,190
SPEAKER_0:  Again, it's people less poor.

03:14:04,482 --> 03:14:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  make them more productive, innovative parts of humanity.

03:14:07,586 --> 03:14:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  to me that's really reprehensible.

03:14:10,274 --> 03:14:11,678
SPEAKER_0:  One of the other projects on their list?

03:14:12,322 --> 03:14:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  as a World Bank kind of gotcha.

03:14:14,338 --> 03:14:15,806
SPEAKER_0:  Like how dare they give money?

03:14:16,514 --> 03:14:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  was for a new fertilizer factory in Bangladesh.

03:14:20,738 --> 03:14:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  that is designed to get three times as much fertilizer from the same amount of natural gas as the old plants that are not dormant.

03:14:27,586 --> 03:14:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  That's...

03:14:28,674 --> 03:14:30,942
SPEAKER_0:  This is in a time when we're facing.

03:14:31,554 --> 03:14:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  High energy prices, high gas prices, high...

03:14:34,146 --> 03:14:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  food prices when food insecurity is spreading rapidly.

03:14:37,634 --> 03:14:40,478
SPEAKER_0:  when a country like Bangladesh has millions of rice farmers who need

03:14:40,866 --> 03:14:41,438
SPEAKER_0:  Urea.

03:14:42,242 --> 03:14:43,614
SPEAKER_0:  tablets to put in their rice fields.

03:14:44,322 --> 03:14:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  to say how dare they finance that because there's a fossil fuel involved is immoral. So yes on that point from Alex.

03:14:52,738 --> 03:14:53,863
SPEAKER_0:  So this is...

03:14:53,863 --> 03:14:54,494
SPEAKER_1:

03:14:55,650 --> 03:14:56,766
SPEAKER_1:  2022 poll.

03:14:58,210 --> 03:14:58,750
SPEAKER_1:  pulse.

03:14:59,650 --> 03:15:02,654
SPEAKER_1:  Just this is a bunch of different ways to look at the same

03:15:03,266 --> 03:15:05,662
SPEAKER_1:  basic effect in the United States.

03:15:07,266 --> 03:15:11,038
SPEAKER_1:  Democrats, younger Americans identify dealing with climate change as a top.

03:15:11,586 --> 03:15:13,310
SPEAKER_1:  priority us adults.

03:15:14,306 --> 03:15:15,742
SPEAKER_1:  42% say...

03:15:16,322 --> 03:15:20,478
SPEAKER_1:  42% say that dealing with climate change should be a top priority.

03:15:21,186 --> 03:15:22,942
SPEAKER_1:  11% of Republicans.

03:15:23,426 --> 03:15:25,182
SPEAKER_1:  65% of Democrats.

03:15:25,890 --> 03:15:27,358
SPEAKER_1:  and we could see this effect.

03:15:28,130 --> 03:15:28,670
SPEAKER_1:  throughout.

03:15:29,314 --> 03:15:29,758
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

03:15:32,226 --> 03:15:36,862
SPEAKER_1:  46% of Americans say human activity contributes a great deal to climate change.

03:15:37,186 --> 03:15:37,790
SPEAKER_1:  By the way.

03:15:38,018 --> 03:15:41,854
SPEAKER_1:  This is a little bit different than what we're discussing. How was uh.

03:15:42,178 --> 03:15:43,902
SPEAKER_1:  just look at the different polls.

03:15:45,442 --> 03:15:52,030
SPEAKER_1:  In the public, there seems to still be uncertainty about how much humans contribute to climate change.

03:15:52,898 --> 03:15:53,758
SPEAKER_1:  More than.

03:15:54,498 --> 03:15:58,942
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I mean, it would only be 24% that disagree with the UN climate panel, right?

03:15:59,458 --> 03:16:02,718
SPEAKER_1:  Three-quarters would agree. Are you uncomfortable about the 29?

03:16:03,298 --> 03:16:10,910
SPEAKER_1:  I know 29 is actually, it's exactly right. I mean, the UN doesn't say it's all, well, they say that could be the border case.

03:16:11,298 --> 03:16:15,294
SPEAKER_1:  But anyway, this is interesting, but to me, across all these poles, if you look.

03:16:15,618 --> 03:16:16,862
SPEAKER_1:  Republican versus

03:16:17,410 --> 03:16:18,046
SPEAKER_1:  Democrat.

03:16:18,274 --> 03:16:19,358
SPEAKER_1:  Republican.

03:16:20,098 --> 03:16:23,198
SPEAKER_1:  uh... it's say that seventy percent say

03:16:23,586 --> 03:16:29,022
SPEAKER_1:  It's a great deal. Democrats say 71% says it's a great deal. And you just see this.

03:16:29,314 --> 03:16:30,398
SPEAKER_1:  complete division.

03:16:31,650 --> 03:16:33,054
SPEAKER_1:  I think you probably.

03:16:34,146 --> 03:16:35,390
SPEAKER_1:  or COVID pandemic.

03:16:37,410 --> 03:16:42,718
SPEAKER_1:  You can ask a lot of questions like this. Do masks work? Are they an effective method?

03:16:43,074 --> 03:16:48,286
SPEAKER_1:  the slow transmission of a pandemic. You'll probably have the same kind of polls about.

03:16:48,546 --> 03:16:49,790
SPEAKER_1:  Republicans and Democrats.

03:16:50,178 --> 03:16:50,974
SPEAKER_1:  And um...

03:16:52,322 --> 03:16:56,222
SPEAKER_1:  while the effectiveness of masks to me is a scientific question.

03:16:56,770 --> 03:16:57,694
SPEAKER_1:  but...

03:16:58,082 --> 03:17:00,286
SPEAKER_1:  So there's different truths here apparently.

03:17:00,578 --> 03:17:01,982
SPEAKER_1:  One is a scientific truth.

03:17:03,138 --> 03:17:04,734
SPEAKER_1:  One is the truth.

03:17:05,826 --> 03:17:13,438
SPEAKER_1:  which seems to be also different than the scientific truth sometimes. And the other is the public perception that has...

03:17:13,666 --> 03:17:14,814
SPEAKER_1:  that's...

03:17:15,298 --> 03:17:17,214
SPEAKER_1:  polluted or affected by

03:17:17,666 --> 03:17:19,006
SPEAKER_1:  political affiliation.

03:17:19,298 --> 03:17:21,182
SPEAKER_1:  And then there's whatever is the.

03:17:22,178 --> 03:17:25,438
SPEAKER_1:  narrative that's communicated by the media.

03:17:26,018 --> 03:17:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  They will also have a question, the answer to the question of whether masks work or not. And they will also have an answer to the question about.

03:17:32,866 --> 03:17:34,430
SPEAKER_1:  all these climate related things.

03:17:34,850 --> 03:17:37,694
SPEAKER_1:  That's a long way of asking the question.

03:17:38,530 --> 03:17:38,974
SPEAKER_1:  What?

03:17:39,618 --> 03:17:42,622
SPEAKER_1:  How is politics mixed into all of this?

03:17:43,170 --> 03:17:48,126
SPEAKER_1:  on the communication front on the figuring out what the right policy is front.

03:17:48,418 --> 03:17:49,438
SPEAKER_1:  on the friction.

03:17:49,794 --> 03:17:50,590
SPEAKER_1:  humanity.

03:17:50,946 --> 03:17:53,571
SPEAKER_1:  in the face of the right policies.

03:17:53,571 --> 03:17:57,982
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I've written a ton on this after I had that conversion about the social science.

03:17:58,210 --> 03:17:59,486
SPEAKER_0:  2006.

03:17:59,778 --> 03:18:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  I'll begin.

03:18:00,674 --> 03:18:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  digging in a lot more on how people hold beliefs.

03:18:04,258 --> 03:18:07,358
SPEAKER_0:  what they do as opposed to what they think.

03:18:08,770 --> 03:18:09,694
SPEAKER_0:  questions about polling.

03:18:10,242 --> 03:18:16,030
SPEAKER_0:  And there's two things that come to me that make me not worry about the basic literacy.

03:18:16,674 --> 03:18:19,006
SPEAKER_0:  Is climate change X percent of whatever?

03:18:19,266 --> 03:18:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  I don't.

03:18:19,906 --> 03:18:21,022
SPEAKER_0:  really care about that.

03:18:21,346 --> 03:18:22,398
SPEAKER_0:  and I'll explain why.

03:18:22,818 --> 03:18:23,326
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:18:23,682 --> 03:18:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  For one thing.

03:18:25,346 --> 03:18:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  More.

03:18:26,050 --> 03:18:30,206
SPEAKER_0:  science literacy, more basic literacy, like what is a greenhouse gas?

03:18:31,010 --> 03:18:31,678
SPEAKER_0:  All that stuff.

03:18:32,386 --> 03:18:35,326
SPEAKER_0:  Dan Kahane, K-A-H-A-N at Yale.

03:18:35,618 --> 03:18:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  He's actually at Yale Law School.

03:18:37,922 --> 03:18:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  The last.

03:18:38,754 --> 03:18:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  decade he did all this work in what he calls cultural cognition.

03:18:43,170 --> 03:18:44,574
SPEAKER_0:  which is, and he did.

03:18:44,994 --> 03:18:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

03:18:45,794 --> 03:18:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  Studies that showed.

03:18:48,162 --> 03:18:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  you know, how, what you believe.

03:18:50,498 --> 03:18:51,134
SPEAKER_0:  emerges.

03:18:51,426 --> 03:18:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  based on.

03:18:52,642 --> 03:18:55,550
SPEAKER_0:  culture based on your background, your red blue.

03:18:56,290 --> 03:18:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  or where you are in the country.

03:18:58,370 --> 03:19:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  And one of the really disturbing findings was—

03:19:02,082 --> 03:19:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  that the people who have the most basic science literacy, like who know the most about.

03:19:07,682 --> 03:19:08,894
SPEAKER_0:  greenhouse effect or whatever.

03:19:10,018 --> 03:19:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  They're at both ends of the spectrum.

03:19:12,098 --> 03:19:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  of views on climate, dismissives and alarmed.

03:19:15,330 --> 03:19:18,526
SPEAKER_0:  Steve Kuhnen, as I mentioned, is a good example. He's brilliant physicist.

03:19:19,458 --> 03:19:23,262
SPEAKER_0:  and he knows all the science and he's completely at the end of skepticism.

03:19:23,842 --> 03:19:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:19:24,898 --> 03:19:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  Will Happer.

03:19:26,146 --> 03:19:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  who was.

03:19:27,362 --> 03:19:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  close to being Trump's science advisor.

03:19:29,474 --> 03:19:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  There's even more out there.

03:19:31,170 --> 03:19:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  And he's on, they're both on the.

03:19:33,762 --> 03:19:36,670
SPEAKER_0:  Jason committee that advises the government on big strategic things.

03:19:37,378 --> 03:19:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:19:38,370 --> 03:19:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  And people at the...

03:19:39,586 --> 03:19:45,438
SPEAKER_0:  who are really alarmed about it also have the same belief. So as a journalist, I was thinking, do I just spend my time writing more explanatory?

03:19:46,498 --> 03:19:48,510
SPEAKER_0:  Stories that explain the science better?

03:19:49,826 --> 03:19:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  No.

03:19:51,074 --> 03:19:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  Do I dig in on this work to understand?

03:19:53,122 --> 03:19:55,582
SPEAKER_0:  what brings people together. And then the same.

03:19:56,130 --> 03:19:58,046
SPEAKER_0:  Surveys, the same science shows you.

03:19:59,106 --> 03:20:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  If you don't make it about climate, among other things, this becomes.

03:20:02,626 --> 03:20:03,870
SPEAKER_0:  You don't have to worry about this anymore.

03:20:04,130 --> 03:20:05,118
SPEAKER_0:  If you could Google for.

03:20:05,698 --> 03:20:07,710
SPEAKER_0:  Google for no red-blue divide.

03:20:08,194 --> 03:20:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  climate revkin.

03:20:09,410 --> 03:20:11,518
SPEAKER_0:  You'll find a piece I did with some really good graphs.

03:20:11,906 --> 03:20:12,926
SPEAKER_0:  Essentially it shows.

03:20:13,986 --> 03:20:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  that in America, this is the Yale group again.

03:20:17,346 --> 03:20:18,398
SPEAKER_0:  They're a climate communication group.

03:20:19,234 --> 03:20:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  There's no red-blue divide on energy innovation.

03:20:22,274 --> 03:20:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  None.

03:20:23,202 --> 03:20:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  We need more climate, energy, clean energy innovation. There wasn't even a divide.

03:20:28,290 --> 03:20:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  country by state by state on.

03:20:31,138 --> 03:20:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  whether CO2 should be regulated as a pollutant.

03:20:34,978 --> 03:20:37,854
SPEAKER_0:  But it's all like, what are the questions you ask if you ask about-

03:20:39,426 --> 03:20:44,190
SPEAKER_0:  innovation if you ask about more incentives for renewable power.

03:20:45,250 --> 03:20:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  Oklahoma.

03:20:46,370 --> 03:20:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  Iowa.

03:20:47,266 --> 03:20:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  you know?

03:20:48,354 --> 03:20:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  I did a piece when I was at ProPublica showing that...

03:20:51,330 --> 03:20:54,302
SPEAKER_0:  The 17 states that were fighting Obama.

03:20:55,394 --> 03:20:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  in court over his.

03:20:57,250 --> 03:20:58,078
SPEAKER_0:  Clean Power Plan.

03:20:59,074 --> 03:20:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  We're actually.

03:21:00,226 --> 03:21:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  The majority of them were actually meeting the targets that the Clean Power Plan had.

03:21:04,770 --> 03:21:06,846
SPEAKER_0:  because they're expanding wind power.

03:21:07,298 --> 03:21:07,710
SPEAKER_0:  already.

03:21:07,938 --> 03:21:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  Not because of the climate, because it...

03:21:09,986 --> 03:21:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  Mix.

03:21:10,626 --> 03:21:20,446
SPEAKER_0:  money sense and energy sense. So you don't think there's a political divide in this? There is on climate, if you call it climate. If you say it's a climate, do you believe in the climate crisis? You're not asking.

03:21:21,474 --> 03:21:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  What kind of energy future do you want?

03:21:24,834 --> 03:21:26,942
SPEAKER_0:  And so if you ask that question.

03:21:27,490 --> 03:21:28,702
SPEAKER_0:  the polarization goes away.

03:21:29,826 --> 03:21:32,862
SPEAKER_1:  I guess what I'm asking is their polarization on policy.

03:21:33,282 --> 03:21:34,526
SPEAKER_0:  No, well, well, they're-

03:21:35,170 --> 03:21:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  Again.

03:21:37,474 --> 03:21:39,614
SPEAKER_0:  bipartisan infrastructure law.

03:21:39,970 --> 03:21:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  that was passed last November. That was bipartisan.

03:21:43,138 --> 03:21:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  Congress said yes, and that's a trillion dollars.

03:21:46,754 --> 03:21:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  several hundred billion of which are for cleaner energy and resilience.

03:21:51,170 --> 03:21:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, but that's...

03:21:52,962 --> 03:21:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  But it's not a climate pill.

03:21:55,202 --> 03:21:56,286
SPEAKER_0:  and it wasn't a tax.

03:21:56,962 --> 03:21:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  It's a, it's a.

03:21:58,530 --> 03:21:59,966
SPEAKER_0:  It's incentives.

03:22:00,226 --> 03:22:06,238
SPEAKER_1:  So the word climate and similar words are just used as part of the signaling, like masks.

03:22:06,690 --> 03:22:07,815
SPEAKER_1:  It's, it's- Absolutely.

03:22:07,815 --> 03:22:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  It's not.

03:22:08,962 --> 03:22:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  As Dan Cahan's work, that guy at Yale.

03:22:11,522 --> 03:22:12,862
SPEAKER_0:  he really demonstrated powerfully.

03:22:13,474 --> 03:22:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  abortion gun rights.

03:22:15,554 --> 03:22:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  climate.

03:22:16,706 --> 03:22:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  and a more parsed level of nuclear power.

03:22:19,810 --> 03:22:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  has given the answer.

03:22:20,418 --> 03:22:24,286
SPEAKER_0:  enduring camps that for and against. What, what, what are the camps for?

03:22:25,698 --> 03:22:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  some of its

03:22:27,042 --> 03:22:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  cultural cognition. It's how you grew up. It's what you fear.

03:22:30,722 --> 03:22:33,347
SPEAKER_0:  There's no common human frame for...

03:22:33,347 --> 03:22:36,158
SPEAKER_1:  like folks like certain individuals like Al Gore.

03:22:37,410 --> 03:22:39,582
SPEAKER_1:  Ah, like he would make a film.

03:22:40,002 --> 03:22:41,246
SPEAKER_1:  He cares about this thing.

03:22:41,570 --> 03:22:42,526
SPEAKER_1:  He's a Democrat.

03:22:42,818 --> 03:22:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  Therefore I hate this thing. Therefore I don't like this thing, yeah. I'm sure.

03:22:46,658 --> 03:22:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  when people get attached to an issue. If that's what pops into your head.

03:22:50,850 --> 03:22:54,462
SPEAKER_0:  when you hear climate then. And it got politicized. It became.

03:22:55,362 --> 03:22:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  Emblematic

03:22:57,186 --> 03:22:59,550
SPEAKER_0:  and the whole vaccine thing.

03:23:00,386 --> 03:23:05,918
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I'm not American, so I should stay a little bit out of this, but I think it seems to me.

03:23:06,178 --> 03:23:09,598
SPEAKER_1:  that a lot of the thing that people believe and talk about.

03:23:10,050 --> 03:23:12,222
SPEAKER_1:  is really about what they worried that that.

03:23:12,450 --> 03:23:23,166
SPEAKER_1:  will lead to in terms of policy down the line. So a little bit like, do masks work? I'm sort of imagining, I don't know whether this is true, but I think part of it is.

03:23:23,394 --> 03:23:25,534
SPEAKER_1:  If I say masks work, they're going to

03:23:25,762 --> 03:23:27,358
SPEAKER_1:  forced me to wear it for the next year.

03:23:27,906 --> 03:23:39,838
SPEAKER_1:  So it doesn't work because then I don't have to wear it kind of thing. That it's really, you're looking much further down the line. And certainly on climate, it seems to me that a lot of the people who say it's not real.

03:23:40,354 --> 03:23:43,358
SPEAKER_1:  It's not because they don't know it's... Of course it's real.

03:23:43,618 --> 03:23:47,390
SPEAKER_1:  but it's that they don't want you to then come and regulate it heavily.

03:23:47,650 --> 03:23:49,246
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. Because they don't like.

03:23:49,410 --> 03:23:51,838
SPEAKER_1:  top-down government. Yeah, and also because they don't.

03:23:52,162 --> 03:24:01,214
SPEAKER_1:  want another tax and you know that there's lots of other so it's it's really it's not a science it's not a straight science question it really is a question

03:24:01,698 --> 03:24:08,734
SPEAKER_1:  what do you want to do? And that's where I think Andy, you're much, much more right in saying we should have that discussion.

03:24:09,314 --> 03:24:10,110
SPEAKER_1:  What do you want to do?

03:24:10,498 --> 03:24:23,326
SPEAKER_1:  because that will be a much easier conversation to say, do you wanna do really smart, cheap stuff, or do you wanna do pretty dumb, expensive stuff? When you put it that way, you can get most people on board. Of course, it's not as simple as that, I know.

03:24:23,458 --> 03:24:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  And it gets back to what you said earlier, that again, you talked about collaborative cooperation or whatever.

03:24:29,474 --> 03:24:34,558
SPEAKER_0:  There's a guy at Columbia, Peter Coleman, who runs this thing called Difficult Conversations Laboratory.

03:24:35,618 --> 03:24:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. Yeah, that's awesome. And when I first heard about it, I was like, oh man, we need that.

03:24:40,354 --> 03:24:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  And his background is psychology and...

03:24:43,682 --> 03:24:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  Conflict resolution.

03:24:45,346 --> 03:24:47,390
SPEAKER_0:  Mostly at the global scale related to it.

03:24:48,194 --> 03:24:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  atrocities that countries are trying to get over.

03:24:50,818 --> 03:24:51,262
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:24:51,586 --> 03:24:57,406
SPEAKER_0:  And there's a science to how to hold a better conversation, either through experience or whatever.

03:24:57,698 --> 03:24:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  No.

03:24:58,530 --> 03:25:00,766
SPEAKER_0:  If you hold a debate, like...

03:25:01,186 --> 03:25:04,798
SPEAKER_0:  I wouldn't want to be in a debate with Bjorn. We could find lots of things we disagree on.

03:25:05,218 --> 03:25:07,838
SPEAKER_0:  but that takes it back to the win-lose model, right?

03:25:08,482 --> 03:25:10,654
SPEAKER_0:  That's not how you make progress.

03:25:11,394 --> 03:25:12,414
SPEAKER_0:  And what Peter...

03:25:13,602 --> 03:25:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  what I learned absorbed from him, Peter Coleman.

03:25:17,154 --> 03:25:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  because I was thinking like.

03:25:18,754 --> 03:25:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  We need room for agreement. I need to build a room for agreement. My blog at the Times and then.

03:25:23,714 --> 03:25:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  the stuff I do now, you know, it's like, how can we talk?

03:25:26,722 --> 03:25:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  and come to agreement. He says, no, no, you don't want agreement. You want cooperation.

03:25:31,170 --> 03:25:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  That allows you to hold onto your.

03:25:33,378 --> 03:25:33,854
SPEAKER_0:  beliefs.

03:25:34,946 --> 03:25:35,454
SPEAKER_0:  But to...

03:25:35,746 --> 03:25:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  burger, you know, we.

03:25:36,930 --> 03:25:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  We can disagree on all these things, but let's cooperate on that.

03:25:41,154 --> 03:25:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  And that's a really valuable.

03:25:43,490 --> 03:25:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  Distinction.

03:25:44,578 --> 03:25:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  that's needed so much in this arena because...

03:25:48,514 --> 03:25:50,782
SPEAKER_0:  As I said earlier, you can parse it right down to.

03:25:51,586 --> 03:25:54,174
SPEAKER_0:  the whole menu of things Joe Manchin wanted.

03:25:54,754 --> 03:26:00,830
SPEAKER_0:  transmission lines, now we're going to have big fights over transmission lines. We've got billions of dollars to expand expanding America's grid.

03:26:01,570 --> 03:26:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  And every community in America is going to say, not here. So how do you?

03:26:06,146 --> 03:26:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  Foster a federal local.

03:26:08,354 --> 03:26:09,118
SPEAKER_0:  I just dialogued it.

03:26:09,506 --> 03:26:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  allows that to happen if you want to have any hope of a better.

03:26:12,386 --> 03:26:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  grid.

03:26:13,346 --> 03:26:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:26:14,018 --> 03:26:14,814
SPEAKER_0:  So that's like.

03:26:16,034 --> 03:26:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  Those insights come from behavioral sciences that I think are completely under.

03:26:20,834 --> 03:26:21,854
SPEAKER_0:  undervalued.

03:26:22,242 --> 03:26:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  in this.

03:26:23,042 --> 03:26:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  area.

03:26:23,682 --> 03:26:30,782
SPEAKER_1:  Pilke loves to quote, I think it's Lippert. Oh, Walter Lippman. Yes, that democracy is not about.

03:26:31,010 --> 03:26:32,190
SPEAKER_1:  You know, everybody agree?

03:26:32,578 --> 03:26:35,038
SPEAKER_1:  but it's about different people disagreeing.

03:26:35,714 --> 03:26:44,286
SPEAKER_1:  doing the same thing. Doing one thing together. Yes. I mean, agreeing that we're going to do this thing. So you can disagree, but still do a thing, you know, possibly for very different.

03:26:44,642 --> 03:26:46,215
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. Red to

03:26:46,215 --> 03:26:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  And there's an amazing video clip.

03:26:48,354 --> 03:26:50,718
SPEAKER_0:  that shows this so powerfully.

03:26:51,618 --> 03:26:56,990
SPEAKER_0:  2015 was the buildup to the Paris talks that led to the Paris agreement.

03:26:57,826 --> 03:27:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  and a really talented journalist at CNN at the time, John Sutter.

03:27:02,466 --> 03:27:04,286
SPEAKER_0:  who's from Oklahoma originally, he...

03:27:05,666 --> 03:27:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  He saw another Yale study that.

03:27:07,522 --> 03:27:11,614
SPEAKER_0:  There's a county by county study of American attitudes on global warming.

03:27:12,098 --> 03:27:13,854
SPEAKER_0:  right down to the county level. And

03:27:14,466 --> 03:27:15,230
SPEAKER_0:  There's this little.

03:27:15,650 --> 03:27:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  Glowing.

03:27:17,122 --> 03:27:24,862
SPEAKER_0:  data point in Woodward County, West Oklahoma. Woodward County, Oklahoma was ground zero for climate skepticism, climate denial, whatever you want to call it.

03:27:25,922 --> 03:27:28,670
SPEAKER_0:  And he thought, oh, I'm going to go there. He went there just as a-

03:27:29,282 --> 03:27:32,190
SPEAKER_0:  just to meet people on the street, talk to them about energy and weather.

03:27:33,250 --> 03:27:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  And he did these little interviews. And there's this one with this guy who's like, um,

03:27:37,474 --> 03:27:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  middle-aged oil company employee.

03:27:40,194 --> 03:27:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  like a business, like a administrator, Thai, Thai kind of guy.

03:27:44,418 --> 03:27:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  and it's

03:27:45,186 --> 03:27:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  He starts out the interview and the guy is saying like, you know, God controls the environment.

03:27:50,690 --> 03:27:53,246
SPEAKER_0:  And if you're watching this, you're just going, okay, this is going to be interesting.

03:27:53,986 --> 03:27:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  And the backstory, by the way, is the guy, he paid for the local.

03:27:57,986 --> 03:27:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  playground.

03:27:59,522 --> 03:28:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  to have dinosaurs and people.

03:28:01,986 --> 03:28:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  toy dinosaurs and people all the way around because he believes in creation.

03:28:06,018 --> 03:28:09,502
SPEAKER_0:  you know, 6,000 year creation. So that's the guy, right?

03:28:09,986 --> 03:28:12,318
SPEAKER_0:  And then he gets to energy and the guy says, you know.

03:28:13,154 --> 03:28:15,582
SPEAKER_0:  The same guy who believes God controls the environment.

03:28:16,386 --> 03:28:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  says, you know, we have half of our roof covered with solar panels and we want to get off the grid entirely.

03:28:21,666 --> 03:28:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  And when I show this to audiences, I say, just pause and think about that for a second.

03:28:27,650 --> 03:28:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  If you went.

03:28:28,834 --> 03:28:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  Why do you think that's happening? And it's because he's independent. He wants to have his own source of power. He's libertarian. He doesn't want the government telling him what to do. He would never vote for Hillary, I guarantee you.

03:28:37,538 --> 03:28:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  This is the run 15.

03:28:39,522 --> 03:28:42,110
SPEAKER_0:  But he wanted to get off the grid entirely to be his own.

03:28:42,978 --> 03:28:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  to be himself.

03:28:44,322 --> 03:28:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:28:45,026 --> 03:28:48,926
SPEAKER_0:  So then I say, okay, so if you were going around the country with your climate crisis...

03:28:49,442 --> 03:28:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  placard and you go to Woodward County.

03:28:51,938 --> 03:28:52,382
SPEAKER_0:  What do you think?

03:28:52,642 --> 03:28:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  That would be a productive way.

03:28:54,434 --> 03:28:56,382
SPEAKER_0:  to go to that place and make your case.

03:28:57,154 --> 03:28:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:28:58,178 --> 03:29:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  The answer is pretty obvious, no.

03:29:00,482 --> 03:29:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  If you go in there and you listen.

03:29:02,210 --> 03:29:03,902
SPEAKER_0:  Like listening is such an important.

03:29:04,130 --> 03:29:06,078
SPEAKER_0:  property that we all forget, including journalists.

03:29:07,074 --> 03:29:07,550
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:29:07,938 --> 03:29:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  you much more apt to find a path to cooperation.

03:29:11,714 --> 03:29:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  you could talk to him about.

03:29:13,506 --> 03:29:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  I guarantee if I went there today, maybe I should go.

03:29:15,970 --> 03:29:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  to talk about this new bill, $370 billion. How do we make that work at the local level?

03:29:22,050 --> 03:29:26,046
SPEAKER_0:  How do we answer that guy at the energy department, Jigar Shah? So how do we put this to work?

03:29:26,850 --> 03:29:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  to get our buses off.

03:29:28,354 --> 03:29:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  electricity to get electrified or.

03:29:30,914 --> 03:29:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  transition our street lamps and stuff.

03:29:33,090 --> 03:29:35,422
SPEAKER_0:  You could have a good chat with him. If you go in there and say.

03:29:35,874 --> 03:29:38,270
SPEAKER_0:  I'm here to debate you to death on global warming.

03:29:38,946 --> 03:29:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  forget about.

03:29:40,738 --> 03:29:44,958
SPEAKER_1:  Actually, let me ask you a question, given your roots as a journalist.

03:29:45,858 --> 03:29:46,430
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:29:47,138 --> 03:29:50,270
SPEAKER_1:  So yeah, talking to a guy you disagree with, that's one thing.

03:29:51,106 --> 03:29:52,766
SPEAKER_1:  What about talking to people?

03:29:53,986 --> 03:29:54,590
SPEAKER_1:  that

03:29:54,850 --> 03:29:57,758
SPEAKER_1:  might be, society might consider.

03:29:59,362 --> 03:30:01,726
SPEAKER_1:  bad, unethical, even evil.

03:30:02,626 --> 03:30:04,926
SPEAKER_1:  What's the role of a journalist in that context?

03:30:06,338 --> 03:30:07,710
SPEAKER_1:  So climate changes.

03:30:08,098 --> 03:30:12,286
SPEAKER_1:  large number of people that believe one thing, large number of people that believe another thing.

03:30:13,058 --> 03:30:16,030
SPEAKER_1:  uh... it turns out you know people the society deems evil

03:30:16,386 --> 03:30:18,366
SPEAKER_1:  there's a large number of people that support them.

03:30:19,426 --> 03:30:21,310
SPEAKER_1:  What's your role as a journalist?

03:30:22,914 --> 03:30:23,966
SPEAKER_1:  to talk to them.

03:30:24,642 --> 03:30:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I have talked to really bad people. When I wrote about the murder of Chico Mendes, a Brazilian...

03:30:31,586 --> 03:30:33,214
SPEAKER_0:  Amazon rainforest activist.

03:30:33,442 --> 03:30:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  1989, I revealed it.

03:30:35,522 --> 03:30:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  The Killers?

03:30:36,962 --> 03:30:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:30:37,794 --> 03:30:40,190
SPEAKER_0:  One was in jail, several of them were.

03:30:40,450 --> 03:30:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  ranchers who

03:30:42,594 --> 03:30:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

03:30:43,650 --> 03:30:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  They had their point of view. They were there in the Amazon rainforest to-

03:30:49,058 --> 03:30:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  The word in Brazil and Portuguese is limpar, to clean the land. They're the bandarantes, the pioneers of...

03:30:55,970 --> 03:30:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  Brazil, they go into these frontiers and tame them.

03:30:58,722 --> 03:31:00,414
SPEAKER_0:  like we had in our West.

03:31:01,122 --> 03:31:04,030
SPEAKER_0:  And they would bring that up too. They would say to me.

03:31:04,578 --> 03:31:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  Well, you did this out, you know. Didn't say you murdered your-

03:31:07,618 --> 03:31:12,158
SPEAKER_0:  Native Americans and stuff, but they could easily have said that too, and you deforested all your landscapes.

03:31:12,802 --> 03:31:14,078
SPEAKER_0:  So who are you to come down here to?

03:31:14,530 --> 03:31:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  But if I didn't.

03:31:15,554 --> 03:31:16,222
SPEAKER_0:  Talk to them.

03:31:16,610 --> 03:31:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  That would be

03:31:18,882 --> 03:31:20,757
SPEAKER_0:  Not a way to do journalism.

03:31:20,757 --> 03:31:23,422
SPEAKER_1:  But when you talked to them, did you empathize with them?

03:31:23,906 --> 03:31:25,534
SPEAKER_1:  Or did you push back?

03:31:26,178 --> 03:31:27,710
SPEAKER_1:  That's the ultimate question.

03:31:28,066 --> 03:31:29,726
SPEAKER_1:  Like if you want to understand...

03:31:31,522 --> 03:31:34,206
SPEAKER_1:  like if you talk to Hitler in 1941.

03:31:35,202 --> 03:31:36,574
SPEAKER_1:  Do you empathize with him?

03:31:37,026 --> 03:31:38,206
SPEAKER_1:  Or do you push back?

03:31:39,106 --> 03:31:40,734
SPEAKER_1:  because most journalists

03:31:41,154 --> 03:31:41,598
SPEAKER_1:  Push.

03:31:42,786 --> 03:31:47,006
SPEAKER_1:  because they're trying to signal to fellow journalists and to people back home.

03:31:47,874 --> 03:31:50,686
SPEAKER_1:  that this me, the journalist, is on the right side.

03:31:51,810 --> 03:31:54,238
SPEAKER_1:  but if you actually want to understand the person.

03:31:54,818 --> 03:31:55,902
SPEAKER_1:  You should empathize.

03:31:57,026 --> 03:32:01,438
SPEAKER_1:  If you want to be the kind of person that actually understands

03:32:01,698 --> 03:32:02,110
SPEAKER_1:  in the-

03:32:02,594 --> 03:32:03,134
SPEAKER_1:  fool.

03:32:04,034 --> 03:32:05,214
SPEAKER_1:  Arc of History.

03:32:05,986 --> 03:32:08,382
SPEAKER_1:  you need to empathize. I find that journalists

03:32:09,090 --> 03:32:11,806
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of times, perhaps they're protecting their job.

03:32:12,450 --> 03:32:14,398
SPEAKER_1:  their reputation, their sanity.

03:32:14,722 --> 03:32:16,286
SPEAKER_1:  are not willing to empathize.

03:32:16,610 --> 03:32:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, well, I think this happened with Joe Manchin. I'm not doing any kind of equation here related to Hitler and Joe Manchin. Or Trump, I mean Trump. I interviewed the guy, Will Happer, I mentioned, who was

03:32:26,274 --> 03:32:29,278
SPEAKER_0:  physicist at Princeton who thinks carbon dioxide is the greatest thing.

03:32:29,826 --> 03:32:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  in the world and we should have more of it in the atmosphere.

03:32:33,186 --> 03:32:35,262
SPEAKER_0:  I profoundly disagree on that point.

03:32:35,746 --> 03:32:38,078
SPEAKER_0:  But I interviewed him for an hour and...

03:32:39,234 --> 03:32:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  And it was so interesting because he was trying to kind of rope-a-dope me.

03:32:44,450 --> 03:32:45,246
SPEAKER_0:  into

03:32:45,890 --> 03:32:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  making it about CO2 and climate, because he's a super-

03:32:49,762 --> 03:32:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  Smart physicist.

03:32:51,522 --> 03:32:55,070
SPEAKER_0:  And I kind of said, let's talk about some other things.

03:32:55,714 --> 03:32:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  we start talking about education and science education. He went on for like 20 minutes.

03:32:59,746 --> 03:33:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  about the vital importance of better.

03:33:02,786 --> 03:33:05,406
SPEAKER_0:  science education for Americans he drew on.

03:33:05,826 --> 03:33:07,838
SPEAKER_0:  people he knew from Europe, Hungary.

03:33:08,546 --> 03:33:12,446
SPEAKER_0:  A bunch of Nobel Prize winners came from some town in Hungary, at least a couple.

03:33:12,994 --> 03:33:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  he said that he learned their teachers.

03:33:15,170 --> 03:33:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  At any rate, we human did a long exposition on that.

03:33:18,754 --> 03:33:23,678
SPEAKER_0:  He then defended climate science. He said, we need more climate science. He says, I love this stuff. I love...

03:33:24,002 --> 03:33:27,070
SPEAKER_0:  ocean buoys, there are now thousands of them in the oceans charting.

03:33:27,714 --> 03:33:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  clear pictures of ocean circulation.

03:33:30,018 --> 03:33:30,622
SPEAKER_0:  Satellites.

03:33:30,946 --> 03:33:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  And he said something really important that made people discount, which is

03:33:34,626 --> 03:33:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  We need sustained investment in monitoring this planet.

03:33:38,018 --> 03:33:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

03:33:38,722 --> 03:33:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  we neglect our systems.

03:33:42,274 --> 03:33:43,966
SPEAKER_0:  Just tell us what's happening in the world.

03:33:44,450 --> 03:33:45,790
SPEAKER_0:  And that's happened over and over again.

03:33:46,050 --> 03:33:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:33:47,202 --> 03:33:48,190
SPEAKER_0:  So if I had left it.

03:33:48,546 --> 03:33:49,086
SPEAKER_0:  Define d-

03:33:49,314 --> 03:33:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  gone into the terrain of the fight over CO2.

03:33:53,602 --> 03:33:54,270
SPEAKER_0:  some

03:33:54,690 --> 03:33:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  journalist friends might say, oh, that was good.

03:33:57,570 --> 03:33:59,102
SPEAKER_0:  mashup, you know, matchup and.

03:33:59,938 --> 03:34:02,558
SPEAKER_0:  but I found these really profound and important things.

03:34:02,786 --> 03:34:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  that I wanted the world to know about.

03:34:05,218 --> 03:34:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  in the context of whether Trump was going to have him as a science advisor.

03:34:08,962 --> 03:34:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  And so if I hadn't gone there.

03:34:11,650 --> 03:34:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  And a lot of people, if you look back.

03:34:13,506 --> 03:34:14,270
SPEAKER_0:  I got hammered.

03:34:15,106 --> 03:34:15,646
SPEAKER_0:  for doing that.

03:34:16,898 --> 03:34:17,854
SPEAKER_0:  even from friends.

03:34:19,138 --> 03:34:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  and.

03:34:19,874 --> 03:34:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  Then later, John Holdren, who had been Obama's

03:34:22,882 --> 03:34:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  science advisor for eight years.

03:34:25,378 --> 03:34:26,110
SPEAKER_0:  He said.

03:34:26,402 --> 03:34:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  I would rather have

03:34:28,130 --> 03:34:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  Will Haper.

03:34:29,186 --> 03:34:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  as Trump's science advisor than no science advisor. In other words, there's a landscape of things that are important.

03:34:35,330 --> 03:34:38,750
SPEAKER_0:  He recognized that Happer is really smart about defense and all kinds of things too.

03:34:39,074 --> 03:34:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  So it's like you do have to sort of screw up your.

03:34:42,434 --> 03:34:46,814
SPEAKER_0:  Ideally, you screw up your courage, but then not necessarily get into the-

03:34:47,778 --> 03:34:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  It's like with the guy in Oklahoma.

03:34:49,730 --> 03:34:50,142
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

03:34:51,138 --> 03:34:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  If you go in looking for the differences, you'll find them.

03:34:56,290 --> 03:34:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  with us.

03:34:58,178 --> 03:34:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  paralyzed sense of.

03:35:00,834 --> 03:35:06,014
SPEAKER_0:  nothing having happened that was useful. Or you can find these nuggets, everyone is a human being.

03:35:06,978 --> 03:35:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  I can't play the mind game of what I would have said as to Hitler.

03:35:11,426 --> 03:35:12,158
SPEAKER_0:  But...

03:35:13,410 --> 03:35:16,785
SPEAKER_1:  I play that mind game all the time, but that's that's for another conversation.

03:35:16,785 --> 03:35:18,285
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

03:35:18,285 --> 03:35:19,614
SPEAKER_1:  and my family.

03:35:20,450 --> 03:35:20,958
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhhh

03:35:21,218 --> 03:35:22,462
SPEAKER_1:  that have suffered under him.

03:35:22,914 --> 03:35:25,150
SPEAKER_1:  Nevertheless, he is a human being.

03:35:26,274 --> 03:35:29,150
SPEAKER_1:  And people sometimes caricature.

03:35:29,442 --> 03:35:33,214
SPEAKER_1:  Hitler is saying like that's when you mention Hitler is a conversation.

03:35:33,762 --> 03:35:35,806
SPEAKER_1:  All right, you've had a certain point, but.

03:35:36,034 --> 03:35:44,254
SPEAKER_1:  I don't agree. I think sort of these extremes are useful thought experiments to understand because you're not willing to take your ideals to that extreme.

03:35:44,834 --> 03:35:45,694
SPEAKER_1:  Then...

03:35:46,082 --> 03:35:48,862
SPEAKER_1:  then maybe your ideals need some rethinking.

03:35:49,282 --> 03:35:51,157
SPEAKER_1:  and from a journalist's perspective.

03:35:51,157 --> 03:35:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  that kind of stuff.

03:35:52,418 --> 03:35:56,190
SPEAKER_0:  A number of years ago, my wife and I were with our veterinarian who was German born.

03:35:56,994 --> 03:35:57,598
SPEAKER_0:  Dr. Bach.

03:35:58,114 --> 03:35:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  PSH.

03:35:59,426 --> 03:36:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  We were talking about the dog and stuff, and then we were talking about Trump and-

03:36:02,850 --> 03:36:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  And he just mentioned in passing, he said, my mother voted for Hitler.

03:36:08,034 --> 03:36:09,374
SPEAKER_0:  That hit me like a brick. Yeah.

03:36:09,890 --> 03:36:10,558
SPEAKER_0:  Cause it was so.

03:36:10,850 --> 03:36:11,166
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

03:36:11,778 --> 03:36:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  This-

03:36:12,546 --> 03:36:14,558
SPEAKER_0:  at the very least understanding how.

03:36:15,522 --> 03:36:16,926
SPEAKER_0:  Pathways lead to...

03:36:18,722 --> 03:36:20,926
SPEAKER_0:  people doing things like he did in order.

03:36:21,506 --> 03:36:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  is essential and the only way to understand that is to.

03:36:25,378 --> 03:36:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  dig in and ask questions.

03:36:27,522 --> 03:36:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  yet uncomfortable.

03:36:28,642 --> 03:36:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  That still makes my hair prickle when I think back to him saying.

03:36:31,842 --> 03:36:33,717
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, my mom voted for Hitler.

03:36:33,717 --> 03:36:36,510
SPEAKER_1:  That somehow makes it super real. Like, oh, yeah.

03:36:37,090 --> 03:36:38,526
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, there's elections, there's...

03:36:38,850 --> 03:36:40,725
SPEAKER_1:  real people living their lives.

03:36:40,725 --> 03:36:43,582
SPEAKER_0:  Exactly, struggling with a broken economy.

03:36:44,290 --> 03:36:45,598
SPEAKER_0:  All kinds of stuff. I hope it will help online.

03:36:45,730 --> 03:36:46,366
SPEAKER_1:  littles.

03:36:46,818 --> 03:36:52,190
SPEAKER_1:  personal resentments and all that kind of stuff. Let me ask you about presidents, American presidents.

03:36:54,402 --> 03:36:55,422
SPEAKER_1:  Um, what?

03:36:55,714 --> 03:37:00,158
SPEAKER_1:  Who had a positive or negative impact on climate change efforts?

03:37:00,706 --> 03:37:03,518
SPEAKER_1:  in your view, Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden.

03:37:03,842 --> 03:37:07,006
SPEAKER_1:  Or maybe you could say that they don't have much of an impact. So like they...

03:37:07,650 --> 03:37:08,990
SPEAKER_1:  in public discourse.

03:37:09,250 --> 03:37:11,838
SPEAKER_1:  presidents have a kind of

03:37:13,442 --> 03:37:13,854
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe.

03:37:14,306 --> 03:37:19,710
SPEAKER_1:  Disproportional like we imagine they have a huge amount of impact. How much impact do they actually have?

03:37:20,098 --> 03:37:22,878
SPEAKER_1:  on climate policy.

03:37:24,098 --> 03:37:25,973
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if you have comments on this.

03:37:25,973 --> 03:37:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  There is a background decarbonization rate that's happened for 150 years.

03:37:31,618 --> 03:37:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  We moved from wood to...

03:37:33,410 --> 03:37:33,758
SPEAKER_0:  uh

03:37:34,114 --> 03:37:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  charcoal too.

03:37:35,394 --> 03:37:36,958
SPEAKER_0:  coal to oil and

03:37:37,250 --> 03:37:40,606
SPEAKER_0:  gas is cleaner, it's more hydrogen, less carbon.

03:37:41,474 --> 03:37:43,166
SPEAKER_0:  I asked recently, I asked-

03:37:43,490 --> 03:37:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  some really smart scientists who study these long trajectories of energy.

03:37:47,746 --> 03:37:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  When you look at those curves, is there anything in that curve that says, oh,

03:37:51,138 --> 03:37:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  Climate Treaty, 1992. World diameter一起 within the next decades ofräge

03:37:53,858 --> 03:37:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. Oh, Paris.

03:37:55,778 --> 03:37:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:37:56,610 --> 03:38:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  It's really hard. Or China, I mean when China came in.

03:38:01,026 --> 03:38:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  with his huge growth in emissions that created a.

03:38:05,122 --> 03:38:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  bit of a recarbonization.

03:38:06,754 --> 03:38:09,982
SPEAKER_0:  blip, but that was this huge growth in their economy that pulled a bunch of people out out group.

03:38:10,626 --> 03:38:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  out of poverty.

03:38:12,130 --> 03:38:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  So yeah, no, precedents don't really change anything on time scales that we would measure.

03:38:17,410 --> 03:38:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  as meaning where you could parse it out.

03:38:19,618 --> 03:38:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  I think that's not to say that.

03:38:22,722 --> 03:38:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  Obama's and the current focus on.

03:38:25,538 --> 03:38:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  on the stimulus that's happening.

03:38:27,970 --> 03:38:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  which includes a lot more money for research, et cetera, and innovation.

03:38:32,386 --> 03:38:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  I do think that will be beneficial in a very, very long run.

03:38:35,778 --> 03:38:36,734
SPEAKER_0:  But I have to say...

03:38:37,570 --> 03:38:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  You know, when Obama stood up and...

03:38:39,810 --> 03:38:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  made credit, took credit for reductions from moving from coal to gas.

03:38:45,090 --> 03:38:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  Because of fracking?

03:38:47,234 --> 03:38:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  That was actually chainy.

03:38:48,674 --> 03:38:51,550
SPEAKER_1:  Who set that in motion? I was thinking, I would say Bush.

03:38:51,810 --> 03:38:55,326
SPEAKER_1:  Not because I like him or anything, but he's the guy who inadvertently.

03:38:55,810 --> 03:38:56,638
SPEAKER_1:  Start it fracking.

03:38:56,898 --> 03:39:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  It goes further back than that. It was a federal investment in fracking in the 60s and 70s, and then this one guy in Texas right here in Texas.

03:39:03,714 --> 03:39:04,894
SPEAKER_0:  George Mitchell who

03:39:05,602 --> 03:39:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

03:39:06,338 --> 03:39:07,710
SPEAKER_0:  to get the technology.

03:39:08,386 --> 03:39:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  And that led to this.

03:39:10,274 --> 03:39:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  Real dramatic.

03:39:11,618 --> 03:39:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  change from gas to coal.

03:39:13,826 --> 03:39:18,526
SPEAKER_0:  that mostly played out in the Obama years, but that really was stimulated by Cheney's early.

03:39:18,946 --> 03:39:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  Energy Task Force 2001.

03:39:22,114 --> 03:39:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  when they were getting in office.

03:39:23,586 --> 03:39:25,566
SPEAKER_0:  And also Bush did something interesting.

03:39:26,530 --> 03:39:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  in the whole wonky climate.

03:39:28,578 --> 03:39:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  3D.

03:39:29,346 --> 03:39:29,918
SPEAKER_0:  process.

03:39:30,850 --> 03:39:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  It was under Bush that they started to focus on sectors.

03:39:34,658 --> 03:39:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  Let's do a, they did a, oh, and also on big emitters. This isn't about 200 countries.

03:39:40,418 --> 03:39:42,846
SPEAKER_0:  It's about basically eight or 10 countries.

03:39:43,362 --> 03:39:45,150
SPEAKER_0:  Let's get them into a room and let's.

03:39:45,794 --> 03:39:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  have these little sub rooms on.

03:39:48,386 --> 03:39:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  like electrification on mining on whatever.

03:39:52,066 --> 03:39:53,470
SPEAKER_0:  and by parsing it out.

03:39:54,146 --> 03:40:00,030
SPEAKER_0:  And Obama picked up the same model. They had different names for it because presidents always name something different than the last president.

03:40:00,514 --> 03:40:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  One was the major economies forum and then it was the.

03:40:03,618 --> 03:40:05,182
SPEAKER_0:  Major emitters, something or other.

03:40:05,858 --> 03:40:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  And that's

03:40:06,626 --> 03:40:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  getting away from the treaty dots and dashes toward just sectoral.

03:40:12,226 --> 03:40:13,758
SPEAKER_0:  big sectors that matter, you know.

03:40:14,018 --> 03:40:15,646
SPEAKER_0:  gas electrification.

03:40:16,738 --> 03:40:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  makes a difference. But again, you couldn't ever measure enough.

03:40:20,130 --> 03:40:21,630
SPEAKER_0:  It's always the lag time.

03:40:22,242 --> 03:40:24,094
SPEAKER_1:  And also, I think...

03:40:24,354 --> 03:40:25,566
SPEAKER_1:  One very under.

03:40:25,826 --> 03:40:26,366
SPEAKER_1:  Report it.

03:40:26,754 --> 03:40:30,430
SPEAKER_1:  fact, so the UNEP, the environment program.

03:40:30,722 --> 03:40:41,694
SPEAKER_1:  They come out with what they call a gap report every year where they estimate how much is the world doing compared to what should it or has it promised to do. Emissions gap..

03:40:41,986 --> 03:40:45,662
SPEAKER_1:  And in 2019, so just before COVID hit.

03:40:45,986 --> 03:40:49,054
SPEAKER_1:  They actually did a survey of the 2010s.

03:40:49,346 --> 03:40:52,414
SPEAKER_1:  So the last big sort of report on how well are we doing.

03:40:52,834 --> 03:40:57,662
SPEAKER_1:  and their takeaway quote, and I'm not gonna get this right, but it's pretty much what they said was.

03:40:58,978 --> 03:41:00,190
SPEAKER_1:  If you take the world...

03:41:00,418 --> 03:41:02,782
SPEAKER_1:  as if we hadn't cared about climate change.

03:41:03,010 --> 03:41:04,318
SPEAKER_1:  since 2005.

03:41:05,026 --> 03:41:07,518
SPEAKER_1:  we can't tell the difference between.

03:41:07,746 --> 03:41:08,382
SPEAKER_1:  That world.

03:41:09,122 --> 03:41:10,782
SPEAKER_1:  and the world that we're actually living in.

03:41:11,746 --> 03:41:24,062
SPEAKER_1:  So despite the fact that we've had 10 years of immense focus on climate and everybody talks about it and the Paris agreement, which is perhaps the biggest global sort of agreement and what we're going to be doing.

03:41:24,482 --> 03:41:25,726
SPEAKER_1:  You can't actually tell.

03:41:26,914 --> 03:41:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  That, I think, is incredibly important because what it tells you is...

03:41:30,882 --> 03:41:46,974
SPEAKER_1:  All that we're doing is not even on the margin, it's sort of smaller than that, and I'm not sure what that is. But yeah, we're basically dealing in, you know, so for instance, the UK loves to point out that they have dramatically reduced their carbon emissions, and they have. They've really dramatically lowered their emissions.

03:41:47,394 --> 03:41:49,662
SPEAKER_1:  Mostly because they've deindustrialized.

03:41:50,082 --> 03:41:55,934
SPEAKER_1:  They basically said, look, we're just going to be bankers for all of you guys. And then everybody else is going to produce our stuff.

03:41:56,258 --> 03:42:00,350
SPEAKER_1:  Which of course is great for Britain, or I don't know if it's great for Britain, but...

03:42:00,578 --> 03:42:01,822
SPEAKER_1:  We can't all do that.

03:42:02,370 --> 03:42:07,038
SPEAKER_1:  And so most of what we're trying to do right now is sort of.

03:42:07,330 --> 03:42:16,798
SPEAKER_1:  this virtue signaling, it makes us feel good. It's sort of, yeah, on the margin or in the very tiny margin. But you know, what we basically, that was Andy, your point with China.

03:42:17,538 --> 03:42:22,558
SPEAKER_1:  The reason why we can't tell the difference of course is because China basically became the workshop for everyone.

03:42:22,786 --> 03:42:30,942
SPEAKER_1:  And so not only did they lift more than half a billion people out of poverty,

03:42:31,170 --> 03:42:31,518
SPEAKER_1:  BUT

03:42:31,906 --> 03:42:32,542
SPEAKER_1:  They also.

03:42:32,802 --> 03:42:35,422
SPEAKER_1:  You know, basically took over most production in the world.

03:42:35,778 --> 03:42:43,934
SPEAKER_1:  And so of course, you know, many rich countries could decarbonize or at least reduce their carbon emissions and feel very virtuous about it.

03:42:44,194 --> 03:42:47,678
SPEAKER_1:  But fundamentally, we haven't solved how does the world do this.

03:42:48,002 --> 03:42:52,606
SPEAKER_1:  And that's why I think we're also left with this sense of not only are we being told this is a

03:42:52,930 --> 03:43:14,238
SPEAKER_1:  unmitigated catastrophe, and that's why this is the only thing we should be focusing on, but also somehow, and we can all fix it. I don't think we have any sense of how hard this is actually going to be. That's of course why I would go back and say, look, the only way you're going to fix this is through innovation, because if you have something that's cheaper than fossil fuels, you fixed it. You have something that's harder and-

03:43:14,850 --> 03:43:17,086
SPEAKER_1:  you know, costlier and more inconvenient.

03:43:17,314 --> 03:43:18,494
SPEAKER_1:  No, you're just not gonna...

03:43:18,754 --> 03:43:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  Make it.

03:43:19,714 --> 03:43:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  and getting more.

03:43:20,834 --> 03:43:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  time.

03:43:21,570 --> 03:43:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

03:43:22,370 --> 03:43:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  cutting vulnerability. Yes. Vulnerability on the planet.

03:43:25,634 --> 03:43:27,806
SPEAKER_0:  are huge and they're identifiable and you know what to do.

03:43:28,258 --> 03:43:29,383
SPEAKER_0:  What are the biggest

03:43:29,383 --> 03:43:30,883
SPEAKER_1:  pockets of vulnerability. Well,

03:43:30,883 --> 03:43:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  Infrastructure of cities? No, it's where people are living and what their capacities are.

03:43:36,162 --> 03:43:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  So moving people, how do you...

03:43:37,730 --> 03:43:40,355
SPEAKER_1:  How do you decrease the vulnerability in the world?

03:43:40,355 --> 03:43:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  of the big affordable housing. One reason so many people moved out of San Francisco and

03:43:45,666 --> 03:43:48,926
SPEAKER_0:  adjacent cities into the countryside and then had their houses burned down.

03:43:50,050 --> 03:43:51,806
SPEAKER_0:  It's because they can't afford to live in the city anymore.

03:43:53,026 --> 03:43:58,110
SPEAKER_0:  So affordable housing in cities can limit exposure to, in that case, wildfire.

03:43:58,722 --> 03:43:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  Durban, South Africa that.

03:44:00,322 --> 03:44:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  terrible devastating flood they had this year, this year.

03:44:03,842 --> 03:44:09,150
SPEAKER_0:  who was washed away, poor people who don't have any place to live, so they settle in a floodplain.

03:44:09,698 --> 03:44:12,158
SPEAKER_0:  along the stream bed that's...

03:44:12,674 --> 03:44:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  livable when it's not raining buckets and.

03:44:16,194 --> 03:44:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  Those are vulnerabilities that are there because of...

03:44:18,850 --> 03:44:20,542
SPEAKER_0:  dislocation, housing.

03:44:21,122 --> 03:44:24,318
SPEAKER_0:  Tacloban, this typhoon that hit the Philippines terribly.

03:44:24,770 --> 03:44:26,645
SPEAKER_0:  ahead of the Paris talks or was it the...

03:44:26,645 --> 03:44:29,342
SPEAKER_1:  No, it was in 2013, I believe.

03:44:29,474 --> 03:44:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:44:30,786 --> 03:44:32,126
SPEAKER_0:  Thousands died.

03:44:32,898 --> 03:44:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  Most of the stories that were written were framed around climate change because the Pope made a deal about it. It was just before the climate talks of that year.

03:44:41,314 --> 03:44:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:44:42,306 --> 03:44:45,854
SPEAKER_0:  What happened, partially why there were so many losses was...

03:44:46,466 --> 03:44:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  Takleban city had quadrupled in population in the last 30 years, and most of the people coming into the city were poor, looking for work and settling in.

03:44:54,818 --> 03:44:57,598
SPEAKER_0:  marginal places where a surge, storm surge killed them.

03:44:58,178 --> 03:44:59,646
SPEAKER_0:  So those are things we.

03:45:00,514 --> 03:45:03,102
SPEAKER_0:  we, whatever the we is in the different places.

03:45:03,938 --> 03:45:08,062
SPEAKER_0:  really can work on and that gives more flex for sure and thinking about how...

03:45:08,738 --> 03:45:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  this long trajectory that seems so immovable and so hard, the decarbonization part.

03:45:13,474 --> 03:45:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  There's no excuse. I wrote a piece.

03:45:15,970 --> 03:45:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  not long, I guess a year ago.

03:45:18,178 --> 03:45:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  I said there's a vulnerability emergency hiding behind this.

03:45:21,506 --> 03:45:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  this climate emergency label.

03:45:24,322 --> 03:45:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  That's

03:45:25,634 --> 03:45:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  really what needs work.

03:45:27,138 --> 03:45:29,438
SPEAKER_1:  And also on the taklaban, I mean the...

03:45:29,858 --> 03:45:37,086
SPEAKER_1:  the hurricane that hit in 2013, there was almost a similar hurricane in the early part of 1900s.

03:45:37,442 --> 03:45:38,110
SPEAKER_1:  that hit

03:45:38,370 --> 03:45:40,446
SPEAKER_1:  Pretty much the same strength.

03:45:40,802 --> 03:45:43,710
SPEAKER_1:  And it eradicated half the city. It killed half the city.

03:45:44,066 --> 03:45:46,110
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, and so what's happened since then is

03:45:46,658 --> 03:45:51,678
SPEAKER_1:  People just got much, much richer. You know, from early 1900 to 2013.

03:45:52,002 --> 03:45:56,049
SPEAKER_1:  We've just moved a lot of people out of poverty. Now it's a lot bigger. Well, Bangladesh.

03:45:56,049 --> 03:46:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  And yeah. Bangladesh is even a bigger example of that. And in the 1970s, they had horrible cyclones, one of which was the Beatles, George Harrison's concert for Bangladesh.

03:46:04,962 --> 03:46:05,534
SPEAKER_0:  Great album.

03:46:06,370 --> 03:46:07,390
SPEAKER_0:  that I still have somewhere.

03:46:07,938 --> 03:46:15,646
SPEAKER_0:  He did a fundraising concert for Bangladesh after this terrible cyclone tragedy.

03:46:15,938 --> 03:46:19,294
SPEAKER_0:  hit Bangladesh and I think there were several hundred thousand who were killed.

03:46:19,970 --> 03:46:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  and a couple like that around that time.

03:46:22,306 --> 03:46:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  Bangladesh has been hit by comparable storms recently.

03:46:25,474 --> 03:46:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  and it's terrible. Every death is terrible, but it's like 123 deaths.

03:46:30,018 --> 03:46:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  And it's not just because of wealth, it's because people.

03:46:32,738 --> 03:46:34,686
SPEAKER_0:  know what to do because there are cell phones.

03:46:35,106 --> 03:46:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  because they have elevated platforms in many communities.

03:46:39,682 --> 03:46:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  and the floodplains there that you know to get to.

03:46:41,922 --> 03:46:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  So they went from hundreds of thousands of deaths.

03:46:44,674 --> 03:46:46,814
SPEAKER_0:  in a cyclone to 123.

03:46:47,394 --> 03:46:49,054
SPEAKER_1:  When we were working with Bangladesh.

03:46:49,282 --> 03:46:51,966
SPEAKER_1:  It's no longer the problem of people dying.

03:46:52,194 --> 03:46:55,262
SPEAKER_1:  It's the fact that their cattle die. So they want it. They want it.

03:46:55,490 --> 03:47:06,083
SPEAKER_1:  cattle places where you could herd your calf. This, this is their capital and it's not to make fun of it, but you know, it's an amazing progress that you've stopped worrying about your, you know, your parents dying and you worry about your cows dying.

03:47:06,083 --> 03:47:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  And when I was talking about social innovation.

03:47:08,034 --> 03:47:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  The other hour.

03:47:09,026 --> 03:47:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  There's a model emerging in Bangladesh for farmers to move from raising chickens, poultry, to ducks.

03:47:16,066 --> 03:47:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  And it's working.

03:47:17,282 --> 03:47:19,134
SPEAKER_0:  and ducks actually fetch a higher price at the market.

03:47:19,906 --> 03:47:25,214
SPEAKER_0:  And guess what? When you get flooded, you survive. You can still have your income and your future.

03:47:27,458 --> 03:47:28,606
SPEAKER_1:  Let me ask you...

03:47:29,186 --> 03:47:30,270
SPEAKER_1:  to give advice.

03:47:30,626 --> 03:47:31,934
SPEAKER_1:  Put on your sage.

03:47:32,642 --> 03:47:36,638
SPEAKER_1:  wise hat and give advice to young people that are looking into this.

03:47:37,026 --> 03:47:41,278
SPEAKER_1:  into this world and see how they can do the most good we talked about.

03:47:42,626 --> 03:47:46,078
SPEAKER_1:  What is the one dollar that can do the most positive?

03:47:46,466 --> 03:47:47,166
SPEAKER_1:  Improvement

03:47:47,842 --> 03:47:51,134
SPEAKER_1:  to lead to $40, $45 and so on.

03:47:51,650 --> 03:47:55,390
SPEAKER_1:  What advice would you give to young people in high school and college?

03:47:56,194 --> 03:47:56,958
SPEAKER_1:  how to have.

03:47:57,410 --> 03:48:00,830
SPEAKER_1:  positive impact on the world. How to have a career they can be proud of.

03:48:01,250 --> 03:48:03,582
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe ask Bjorn first and how to have a life.

03:48:03,874 --> 03:48:05,342
SPEAKER_1:  to be, they can be proud of.

03:48:06,178 --> 03:48:07,614
SPEAKER_1:  So I think, and this really.

03:48:08,226 --> 03:48:22,110
SPEAKER_1:  pretty well reflects the whole conversation we've had. We've got to sort of take the catastrophism out of the climate conversation. And this really matters because a lot of kids literally think...

03:48:22,786 --> 03:48:27,198
SPEAKER_1:  the world is going to end pretty soon. That obviously makes any other kind of plan.

03:48:27,458 --> 03:48:29,758
SPEAKER_1:  meaningless.

03:48:30,018 --> 03:48:30,814
SPEAKER_1:  So first of all,

03:48:31,458 --> 03:48:32,638
SPEAKER_1:  You're not going to die.

03:48:33,026 --> 03:48:36,670
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, you know, that, that poster that people, that a lot of kids have.

03:48:37,058 --> 03:48:46,526
SPEAKER_1:  you're gonna die from old age, but I'm gonna die from climate. No, you're not. You're gonna die from old age and you're gonna die much older, very likely. So the reality is.

03:48:46,850 --> 03:48:51,934
SPEAKER_1:  The world has improved dramatically and it's very likely to improve even more.

03:48:52,706 --> 03:48:54,110
SPEAKER_1:  Bassline is good.

03:48:54,594 --> 03:48:56,382
SPEAKER_1:  This is just, you know, the facts.

03:48:57,634 --> 03:49:03,742
SPEAKER_1:  then there's still lots and lots of problems. And what you should do as a young person is stop being.

03:49:04,738 --> 03:49:05,758
SPEAKER_1:  paralyzed by fear?

03:49:06,242 --> 03:49:09,406
SPEAKER_1:  and then realize what you can do is basically help.

03:49:09,698 --> 03:49:11,614
SPEAKER_1:  humanity become even smarter.

03:49:12,354 --> 03:49:16,894
SPEAKER_1:  There's a lot of different places you can do. I mean, the obvious thing when you're talking about climate is-

03:49:17,346 --> 03:49:23,614
SPEAKER_1:  What if you could become the guy that develops fourth generation nuclear? It's very likely something that-

03:49:23,906 --> 03:49:31,710
SPEAKER_1:  neither of us know anything about right now, but develop the energy source that will basically power the rest of humanity, how cool would that be?

03:49:32,162 --> 03:49:39,742
SPEAKER_1:  That's one of the many things you could do. But again, also remember there are lots and lots of other things that need solutions. So-

03:49:40,098 --> 03:49:49,758
SPEAKER_1:  What about you become the girl that makes the social innovation in Tanzania or in Kenya?

03:49:50,242 --> 03:50:18,878
SPEAKER_1:  Or what about if you become the person who finds a way that is a much cheaper, more effective way to tackle tuberculosis right now? It needs four to six months of medication. One of the big problems is once you pop the pills and you're fresh, it's really hard to get people to do it for the other five and a half months, right? And you need that, otherwise you actually have a big risk of getting multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, which is a real scourge on the earth. So, yeah.

03:50:19,170 --> 03:50:19,678
SPEAKER_1:  What if you-

03:50:19,906 --> 03:50:20,542
SPEAKER_1:  Develop that.

03:50:20,834 --> 03:50:22,110
SPEAKER_1:  So the truth is...

03:50:22,466 --> 03:50:25,374
SPEAKER_1:  Not only can your life be much better when you sort of-

03:50:25,730 --> 03:50:27,934
SPEAKER_1:  ditch that, uh, that doomerism.

03:50:28,322 --> 03:50:31,934
SPEAKER_1:  but it also becomes much more possible for you to be a positive part.

03:50:32,354 --> 03:50:36,062
SPEAKER_1:  of making sure that you do that progress. Why has the world improved so much?

03:50:36,546 --> 03:50:39,358
SPEAKER_1:  because our parents and great grandparents.

03:50:39,650 --> 03:50:42,814
SPEAKER_1:  They made all this work. This was all their innovations.

03:50:43,106 --> 03:50:44,318
SPEAKER_1:  and a lot of hard work.

03:50:44,610 --> 03:50:47,166
SPEAKER_1:  and I'm incredibly grateful that they've done it.

03:50:47,682 --> 03:50:53,150
SPEAKER_1:  now it's kind of time to pay back. So you got to do this for our grandkids.

03:50:53,442 --> 03:51:00,094
SPEAKER_1:  You've got to make those innovations, make those policy opportunities. They'll make the world an even better place.

03:51:01,058 --> 03:51:02,590
SPEAKER_0:  Totally. And to me.

03:51:03,586 --> 03:51:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  There's never been a

03:51:04,994 --> 03:51:05,982
SPEAKER_0:  Better time.

03:51:06,242 --> 03:51:07,006
SPEAKER_0:  be effective.

03:51:07,522 --> 03:51:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  as a young person, because the internet.

03:51:11,010 --> 03:51:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  connectedness. Neverchcover

03:51:13,186 --> 03:51:18,142
SPEAKER_0:  brainstorm with someone in another country just as easily as you can brainstorm with someone down the block when we were kids.

03:51:18,690 --> 03:51:20,606
SPEAKER_0:  As I said earlier with my

03:51:21,154 --> 03:51:24,254
SPEAKER_0:  My pen pal was letters taking weeks to come.

03:51:24,898 --> 03:51:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  And um.

03:51:26,786 --> 03:51:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  So the key properties.

03:51:29,090 --> 03:51:30,654
SPEAKER_0:  Ideally, that young people.

03:51:32,642 --> 03:51:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  would do well to cultivate our...

03:51:35,234 --> 03:51:36,958
SPEAKER_0:  Well, certainly adaptability.

03:51:37,698 --> 03:51:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  because.

03:51:38,466 --> 03:51:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  change is changing.

03:51:39,842 --> 03:51:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  Not just, you know.

03:51:41,282 --> 03:51:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  The rate of change is changing. These layers of change are all piling up on each other.

03:51:46,946 --> 03:51:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  having an ability to understand.

03:51:49,570 --> 03:51:50,750
SPEAKER_0:  the information environment.

03:51:51,650 --> 03:51:54,846
SPEAKER_0:  is a fundamental need now that wasn't a need when we were growing up.

03:51:55,426 --> 03:51:58,398
SPEAKER_0:  We read a few newspapers. My dad would turn on the nightly news.

03:51:58,946 --> 03:52:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  And Walter Cronkite would say that's the way it is.

03:52:01,890 --> 03:52:03,262
SPEAKER_0:  So I said, that's the way it is.

03:52:03,874 --> 03:52:04,350
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:52:04,994 --> 03:52:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  That's so not the way the media environment is now.

03:52:07,682 --> 03:52:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  So courses in media literacy should be kind of fundamental.

03:52:12,066 --> 03:52:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  parts of curricula from like kindergarten on, or parents can do the same thing.

03:52:16,354 --> 03:52:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  There's a woman at URI, University of Rhode Island, Renee Hobbs, who teaches a course in propaganda literacy.

03:52:22,434 --> 03:52:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  And she said, you know, the history of the word is-

03:52:25,442 --> 03:52:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  Not bad, propaganda could be good. It's pro, it's for the-

03:52:28,898 --> 03:52:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  for the church.

03:52:29,954 --> 03:52:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  She did a wonderful chat with me.

03:52:32,642 --> 03:52:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  She laid this out and.

03:52:34,178 --> 03:52:35,294
SPEAKER_0:  But understanding...

03:52:35,586 --> 03:52:38,270
SPEAKER_0:  when it is propaganda, like the tobacco, you know.

03:52:38,786 --> 03:52:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  There is hopefully a difference between that and...

03:52:42,242 --> 03:52:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  and that, right, cigarette ads and...

03:52:45,730 --> 03:52:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  journalistically acquired.

03:52:47,490 --> 03:52:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  information.

03:52:48,994 --> 03:52:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  So, Kira, everything Bjorn was talking about too is just understanding how to not be.

03:52:53,730 --> 03:52:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  sucked into this information environment and spit out as a paralyzed.

03:52:58,370 --> 03:52:59,422
SPEAKER_0:  Dumest Entity.

03:53:00,258 --> 03:53:03,262
SPEAKER_0:  Because once you have an ability to step back,

03:53:04,546 --> 03:53:06,686
SPEAKER_0:  Then you can use Twitter or whatever you're on.

03:53:07,362 --> 03:53:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  to find people who might have a skill set you don't have that.

03:53:10,850 --> 03:53:12,190
SPEAKER_0:  is something you need to do.

03:53:12,578 --> 03:53:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  to

03:53:13,506 --> 03:53:14,846
SPEAKER_0:  incorporate to harness.

03:53:15,362 --> 03:53:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  to do the thing you want to do in the world.

03:53:17,186 --> 03:53:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:53:17,794 --> 03:53:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  finding your way to make the world better.

03:53:19,714 --> 03:53:20,958
SPEAKER_0:  and it can have nothing to do with climate.

03:53:21,826 --> 03:53:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  But if it makes.

03:53:22,786 --> 03:53:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  few more people's lives better, then overall you're leading toward better capacity for all this stuff.

03:53:27,554 --> 03:53:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  So that, and then the climate problem, the prismatic.

03:53:30,146 --> 03:53:31,070
SPEAKER_0:  giant nature of it.

03:53:32,514 --> 03:53:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  is.

03:53:33,154 --> 03:53:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  What they said.

03:53:34,658 --> 03:53:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  So daunting, but it's also what gives everybody an opportunity.

03:53:37,922 --> 03:53:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  Like there's something for artists, scientists.

03:53:40,546 --> 03:53:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  Poets, everybody.

03:53:42,146 --> 03:53:43,070
SPEAKER_0:  needs to get into the game.

03:53:43,842 --> 03:53:44,190
SPEAKER_0:  I just.

03:53:44,578 --> 03:53:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  spent some time with Kim Stanley Robinson who wrote that book Ministry of the Future, which is this sprawling novel that

03:53:50,434 --> 03:53:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  a worst case outcome where everyone in India is dying.

03:53:54,562 --> 03:53:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  and uh...

03:53:56,642 --> 03:53:57,118
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

03:53:57,634 --> 03:53:58,878
SPEAKER_0:  So fiction can help.

03:53:59,842 --> 03:54:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  experiment, different kinds of fiction, different kinds of arts can help us sort of.

03:54:04,034 --> 03:54:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  experiment with what the future might look like different ways.

03:54:07,074 --> 03:54:10,238
SPEAKER_0:  Just get started. And the other thing, unfortunately, that's needed.

03:54:12,386 --> 03:54:16,030
SPEAKER_0:  I think I first said this in 2008 when someone asked me something about climate. I said—

03:54:17,218 --> 03:54:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  Weirdly, you have to sort of...

03:54:18,946 --> 03:54:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  Have a sense of urgency, but a sense of patience at the same time.

03:54:22,562 --> 03:54:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  Like just roll those words around in your mind. Like what does that mean?

03:54:25,602 --> 03:54:27,742
SPEAKER_0:  urgent and patient. How could that possibly be?

03:54:29,154 --> 03:54:31,806
SPEAKER_0:  but actually it really is the reality.

03:54:32,450 --> 03:54:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  There is an urgency with this building gas that's cumulative, it doesn't go away like smoke when it rains.

03:54:39,170 --> 03:54:41,150
SPEAKER_0:  And every year that happens, it's.

03:54:41,442 --> 03:54:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  adding to risco.

03:54:42,978 --> 03:54:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  and you can kind of wake up completely freaked out urgent.

03:54:46,434 --> 03:54:52,510
SPEAKER_0:  But when you realize energy transitions take time, then you have to sort of find patience or whatever your word is for that.

03:54:53,250 --> 03:54:56,094
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I think you have to oscillate back and forth throughout the day.

03:54:56,674 --> 03:54:58,846
SPEAKER_1:  having a sense of urgency when you're trying to...

03:54:59,202 --> 03:55:01,694
SPEAKER_1:  actually be productive and have patience.

03:55:02,114 --> 03:55:08,126
SPEAKER_1:  so you can have a calm head about you in terms of putting everything into perspective. Yeah and like you said with information.

03:55:09,410 --> 03:55:13,502
SPEAKER_1:  That is interesting, especially in the scientific community. I think you've spoken about this before.

03:55:14,594 --> 03:55:18,686
SPEAKER_1:  you know that there is some responsibility or at least an opportunity for scientists.

03:55:19,362 --> 03:55:22,526
SPEAKER_1:  not just through science, but to understand the dynamics of

03:55:23,298 --> 03:55:26,846
SPEAKER_1:  the different mediums in which information is exchanged. So it could be Twitter.

03:55:27,234 --> 03:55:29,214
SPEAKER_1:  for a few years, then it could be TikTok.

03:55:29,698 --> 03:55:30,526
SPEAKER_1:  that it could be.

03:55:30,786 --> 03:55:33,406
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I'm a huge believer in the power of YouTube.

03:55:35,234 --> 03:55:36,158
SPEAKER_1:  over the next.

03:55:37,282 --> 03:55:41,886
SPEAKER_1:  several years, perhaps decades. I mean, it's a very interesting medium for education.

03:55:42,402 --> 03:55:43,838
SPEAKER_1:  and communication for.

03:55:44,130 --> 03:55:45,086
SPEAKER_1:  debate and

03:55:45,698 --> 03:55:47,902
SPEAKER_1:  That's grassroots, that's from like the bottom up.

03:55:48,322 --> 03:55:51,134
SPEAKER_1:  you know, that every scientist is able to.

03:55:51,426 --> 03:55:56,190
SPEAKER_1:  communicate their work and I personally believe have the responsibility to communicate their work

03:55:57,314 --> 03:55:59,486
SPEAKER_1:  If anything, the internet made me realize.

03:56:00,450 --> 03:56:02,494
SPEAKER_1:  that science is not just about.

03:56:03,682 --> 03:56:06,238
SPEAKER_1:  doing the science, it's about communicating it.

03:56:07,394 --> 03:56:07,870
SPEAKER_1:  Like that.

03:56:08,162 --> 03:56:11,230
SPEAKER_1:  This is not some kind of virtue signaling on my part.

03:56:11,458 --> 03:56:13,470
SPEAKER_1:  No, no, no. Like I feel like.

03:56:13,698 --> 03:56:17,214
SPEAKER_1:  If the tree falls in the forest and nobody's around to hear it.

03:56:17,634 --> 03:56:18,750
SPEAKER_1:  It really didn't fall.

03:56:19,458 --> 03:56:20,350
SPEAKER_1:  Like that's not...

03:56:20,642 --> 03:56:22,398
SPEAKER_1:  There should be a culture of.

03:56:23,234 --> 03:56:25,246
SPEAKER_1:  We have an MIT.

03:56:26,146 --> 03:56:27,646
SPEAKER_1:  is a place called the Media Lab.

03:56:27,938 --> 03:56:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, sir.

03:56:28,770 --> 03:56:31,038
SPEAKER_1:  where they really emphasize.

03:56:32,546 --> 03:56:37,438
SPEAKER_1:  Like you always be able to demo something to show off your work. They really emphasize showing off their work

03:56:37,794 --> 03:56:39,102
SPEAKER_1:  And I think that was.

03:56:39,362 --> 03:56:42,622
SPEAKER_1:  in some part criticized in the big MIT culture that.

03:56:43,554 --> 03:56:44,286
SPEAKER_1:  You know, that's.

03:56:44,610 --> 03:56:48,510
SPEAKER_1:  That's like being focusing too much on the PR versus doing the science.

03:56:49,058 --> 03:56:52,062
SPEAKER_1:  but I really disagree with that. Of course there's a balance to strike.

03:56:52,610 --> 03:56:57,502
SPEAKER_1:  You don't want to be all smoke and mirrors, but there really is a lot of value to communication.

03:56:57,890 --> 03:56:58,846
SPEAKER_1:  and not just.

03:56:59,394 --> 03:56:59,838
SPEAKER_1:  sort of.

03:57:00,482 --> 03:57:01,502
SPEAKER_1:  some broad.

03:57:01,858 --> 03:57:08,158
SPEAKER_1:  You almost don't want to teach a course on communication because by the time you teach the course, it's already too late. It's always being on top.

03:57:08,386 --> 03:57:08,894
SPEAKER_1:  of.

03:57:09,730 --> 03:57:10,750
SPEAKER_1:  how, uh...

03:57:10,978 --> 03:57:17,246
SPEAKER_1:  What is the language? What is the culture and the etiquette? What is the technology of communication that is effective?

03:57:18,178 --> 03:57:19,230
SPEAKER_1:  I actually had.

03:57:19,778 --> 03:57:41,918
SPEAKER_1:  conversation about that in my university because I think, and this is perhaps especially true for social sciences, but I think it's probably true for everyone, just simply communicating what it is you've done in research makes it possible for you to sort of get an outsider's perspective and see, did I just go into an incredibly deep hole that just three other people really care about in the world?

03:57:42,242 --> 03:57:47,518
SPEAKER_1:  Or is this actually something that matters to the world and being able to explain what it is that you've done?

03:57:47,746 --> 03:57:48,638
SPEAKER_1:  to everyone else.

03:57:49,154 --> 03:57:53,310
SPEAKER_1:  makes my sort of senses if you can't say it in a couple of minutes.

03:57:54,082 --> 03:57:58,878
SPEAKER_1:  Probably. It's not necessarily true, but it's probably because it wasn't all that important.

03:57:59,042 --> 03:58:00,254
SPEAKER_0:  There was a hashtag.

03:58:01,122 --> 03:58:04,094
SPEAKER_0:  generated maybe seven years ago by a Caltech.

03:58:04,706 --> 03:58:06,654
SPEAKER_0:  PhD candidate, woman.

03:58:07,970 --> 03:58:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  And it was fantastic. The hashtag was I am a scientist because.

03:58:12,994 --> 03:58:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  And she posted it with a picture of herself with her answer.

03:58:16,930 --> 03:58:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  And that, when I talk to scientists, or basically anybody about communicating,

03:58:21,666 --> 03:58:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  So start, don't start with I.

03:58:23,938 --> 03:58:25,214
SPEAKER_0:  Emma, I'm a.

03:58:25,794 --> 03:58:29,918
SPEAKER_0:  phytologist and I use a spectrophotometer to do X.

03:58:30,786 --> 03:58:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  Start with.

03:58:32,002 --> 03:58:33,438
SPEAKER_0:  I'm a scientist because...

03:58:34,082 --> 03:58:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  The world is endlessly interesting and I just found these salamanders.

03:58:39,426 --> 03:58:40,894
SPEAKER_0:  which are gonna vanish.

03:58:41,346 --> 03:58:46,910
SPEAKER_0:  if we don't stop this fungus from coming to the United States. Utterly interesting. And then you're then you're got people hooked.

03:58:47,682 --> 03:58:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  but it's the motivation part, because everyone grew up as a kid.

03:58:50,690 --> 03:58:54,046
SPEAKER_0:  And a kid is basically like a scientist. Wow, what the hell is this? How does this work?

03:58:54,594 --> 03:58:56,254
SPEAKER_0:  So you can connect with people that way.

03:58:56,642 --> 03:59:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  But this other issue you approached is really important. And what I love about MIT particularly.

03:59:02,050 --> 03:59:03,678
SPEAKER_0:  I spent a lot of time there over the decades.

03:59:04,066 --> 03:59:05,886
SPEAKER_0:  not just talking to the hurricane guy.

03:59:06,562 --> 03:59:10,695
SPEAKER_0:  Amy Smith, who's the development lab in the basement there somewhere. Most of them, it looks like.

03:59:10,695 --> 03:59:11,445
SPEAKER_1:  it's the basement.

03:59:11,445 --> 03:59:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it's sort of like your... It's part of the charm....things here. But it's a usability function as part of...

03:59:17,538 --> 03:59:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  a lot of that goes on there. It's engineering and science.

03:59:20,322 --> 03:59:20,702
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:59:20,962 --> 03:59:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  It reminds me of 1997.

03:59:23,778 --> 03:59:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  these two very different scientists, Dan Kamen at Berkeley and Michael Dove at Yale.

03:59:29,730 --> 03:59:32,062
SPEAKER_0:  wrote a manifesto. It was, um...

03:59:32,514 --> 03:59:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  the virtues of mundane science.

03:59:35,170 --> 03:59:35,966
SPEAKER_0:  That's what they called it.

03:59:36,194 --> 03:59:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  It was a prod to the scientific community to.

03:59:38,498 --> 03:59:40,542
SPEAKER_0:  Actually, it's about useful utility.

03:59:41,026 --> 03:59:44,926
SPEAKER_0:  because the whole arena is set up to advance your career through.

03:59:45,762 --> 03:59:47,358
SPEAKER_0:  revealing new knowledge.

03:59:47,618 --> 03:59:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  that will get you tenure someday.

03:59:50,626 --> 03:59:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  actually doing useful science is disincentivized. Having a conversation, especially if it involves

03:59:57,026 --> 03:59:57,982
SPEAKER_0:  more than one discipline.

03:59:58,818 --> 04:00:00,734
SPEAKER_0:  Because as a young scientist...

04:00:01,666 --> 04:00:05,982
SPEAKER_0:  There were some post-docs at Columbia who wrote this other manifesto paper saying...

04:00:06,498 --> 04:00:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  Here are the things universities need to do.

04:00:09,410 --> 04:00:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  to foster the collaborative capacity we need to have sustainable development.

04:00:14,242 --> 04:00:16,798
SPEAKER_0:  And it was like four or five things that universities don't do.

04:00:17,890 --> 04:00:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  give you time to become fluent in.

04:00:21,250 --> 04:00:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  for a physicist to talk to an anthropologist.

04:00:25,026 --> 04:00:27,582
SPEAKER_0:  and understand how anthropology works for sociology.

04:00:28,194 --> 04:00:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  takes time and then building a relationship with a community that has a problem that you want to fix.

04:00:32,578 --> 04:00:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  time.

04:00:34,018 --> 04:00:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  And so you do these quick turnaround papers.

04:00:37,474 --> 04:00:39,102
SPEAKER_0:  that get you toward your little.

04:00:39,426 --> 04:00:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  micro career goal, but they're not actually.

04:00:41,570 --> 04:00:42,814
SPEAKER_0:  getting you what you want in the world.

04:00:43,714 --> 04:00:45,246
SPEAKER_0:  Those are really hard problems going forward.

04:00:45,506 --> 04:00:47,422
SPEAKER_0:  But starting with that idea of usability.

04:00:48,546 --> 04:00:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  What can I do with my skill sets? There are a lot of great physicists I know are.

04:00:51,810 --> 04:00:52,382
SPEAKER_0:  dug in on.

04:00:52,802 --> 04:00:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  string theory and stuff. Someone has to dig in on that too, but I'd like to have them pull a little bit of their brain power weight.

04:00:58,722 --> 04:00:59,422
SPEAKER_0:  to think about.

04:00:59,682 --> 04:01:01,790
SPEAKER_0:  Some of the practical things beyond things about too.

04:01:03,010 --> 04:01:04,135
SPEAKER_0:  the two of you.

04:01:04,135 --> 04:01:04,894
SPEAKER_1:  have been.

04:01:05,762 --> 04:01:08,030
SPEAKER_1:  thinking about some of the biggest questions.

04:01:08,674 --> 04:01:09,310
SPEAKER_1:  which is.

04:01:09,570 --> 04:01:11,134
SPEAKER_1:  life here on Earth.

04:01:11,394 --> 04:01:14,206
SPEAKER_1:  The history of life here, the future of life here on Earth.

04:01:15,010 --> 04:01:16,126
SPEAKER_1:  of Earth itself.

04:01:17,218 --> 04:01:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  and how to...

04:01:19,618 --> 04:01:22,878
SPEAKER_1:  allocate our resources to alleviate suffering in the world.

04:01:23,330 --> 04:01:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  So let me ask the big question. What do you think is the why of it all?

04:01:27,970 --> 04:01:29,150
SPEAKER_1:  What's the meaning of it?

04:01:29,378 --> 04:01:31,358
SPEAKER_1:  the meaning of our life here on Earth.

04:01:32,706 --> 04:01:39,678
SPEAKER_1:  You waited till the last moment to ask us that question. Yes, in case there's...

04:01:40,162 --> 04:01:40,926
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhhh...

04:01:41,346 --> 04:01:44,798
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, in case in case I can trick you into finding an answer.

04:01:46,274 --> 04:01:50,142
SPEAKER_1:  Well, so I mean, again, I'm just going to take a stab in this because

04:01:50,402 --> 04:01:52,926
SPEAKER_1:  I think in some ways it's...

04:01:53,410 --> 04:01:58,238
SPEAKER_1:  It's the same thing that you were talking about before. It's not about getting everybody sort of in the same track.

04:01:58,594 --> 04:02:00,222
SPEAKER_1:  and all agree on something?

04:02:00,514 --> 04:02:03,198
SPEAKER_1:  but it's about getting a lot of people with very different.

04:02:03,426 --> 04:02:05,694
SPEAKER_1:  you know, goals and targets and

04:02:05,922 --> 04:02:07,358
SPEAKER_1:  ways of thinking about the world.

04:02:08,322 --> 04:02:10,622
SPEAKER_1:  go in the same direction. So for me,

04:02:10,978 --> 04:02:12,126
SPEAKER_1:  The goal of...

04:02:12,450 --> 04:02:12,958
SPEAKER_1:  Life.

04:02:13,282 --> 04:02:16,318
SPEAKER_1:  certainly my goal, but I think for most people.

04:02:16,642 --> 04:02:18,398
SPEAKER_1:  is to make the world a better place.

04:02:18,626 --> 04:02:24,862
SPEAKER_1:  It sounds incredibly pedestrian because it's become so overused, but that really and literally is the point.

04:02:25,538 --> 04:02:45,918
SPEAKER_1:  You know, your point of your life is to, you know, when, when one of your friends is, is a sad to make sure that they sort of get out of that and, and find out why they're sad and maybe move them a little bit in the right direction. And, you know, and, and all the things that we've talked about, you know, stop people from dying from tuberculosis and live longer lives and fix climate change.

04:02:46,178 --> 04:02:47,774
SPEAKER_1:  but fix it in such a way

04:02:48,546 --> 04:02:58,942
SPEAKER_1:  that we actually use resources smartest because there are lots of problems. So let's make sure we deal with them adequately. This is very unsexy in some sense.

04:02:59,266 --> 04:03:02,078
SPEAKER_1:  But I think it's also very basic and really what.

04:03:02,434 --> 04:03:03,006
SPEAKER_1:  It matters.

04:03:03,426 --> 04:03:05,246
SPEAKER_0:  Well, you know, biologically.

04:03:06,402 --> 04:03:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  Evolution.

04:03:07,970 --> 04:03:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  has demanded that life is about.

04:03:10,850 --> 04:03:12,190
SPEAKER_0:  finding sources of energy.

04:03:12,834 --> 04:03:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  and perpetuating yourself, right? So that's the baseline.

04:03:17,154 --> 04:03:17,598
SPEAKER_0:  and

04:03:17,858 --> 04:03:20,190
SPEAKER_0:  that's led us into a bit of a bollocks because

04:03:21,026 --> 04:03:24,222
SPEAKER_0:  we have this easy energy that's come from the ground so far.

04:03:24,706 --> 04:03:25,150
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

04:03:25,698 --> 04:03:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  but our brilliance.

04:03:27,298 --> 04:03:27,902
SPEAKER_0:  has

04:03:28,578 --> 04:03:31,198
SPEAKER_0:  given this larger awareness of.

04:03:32,482 --> 04:03:34,558
SPEAKER_0:  Everything about the planet is transitory.

04:03:35,330 --> 04:03:35,742
SPEAKER_0:  and.

04:03:36,322 --> 04:03:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  So, well, how do you work with that?

04:03:38,402 --> 04:03:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  productively is really an important question.

04:03:41,090 --> 04:03:42,078
SPEAKER_0:  I could just sort of.

04:03:42,946 --> 04:03:46,910
SPEAKER_0:  try to be as rich as possible and use as much energy as possible.

04:03:47,330 --> 04:03:48,254
SPEAKER_0:  Have other people.

04:03:49,218 --> 04:03:53,470
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, Alex Epstein, I think, again, this is one of the constraints on my support for what he says is.

04:03:53,986 --> 04:03:54,846
SPEAKER_0:  He's just talking about.

04:03:55,714 --> 04:03:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  growth and

04:03:56,642 --> 04:03:58,078
SPEAKER_0:  progress in that sense.

04:03:58,498 --> 04:03:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  But there are.

04:03:59,554 --> 04:04:03,582
SPEAKER_0:  consequences, and there are long-term trajectories here that have to be taken into account too.

04:04:04,098 --> 04:04:05,342
SPEAKER_0:  So what do you wake up?

04:04:06,210 --> 04:04:06,686
SPEAKER_0:  to do?

04:04:07,106 --> 04:04:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  To me, it's finding your-

04:04:08,834 --> 04:04:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  part of this.

04:04:10,338 --> 04:04:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  And as Bjorn said.

04:04:12,546 --> 04:04:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  finding a way to...

04:04:14,050 --> 04:04:15,838
SPEAKER_0:  pursue and expand betterment.

04:04:16,610 --> 04:04:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  when I taught, I was at Pace University.

04:04:18,690 --> 04:04:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  for six years.

04:04:20,514 --> 04:04:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  And one of the courses I launched there was called Blogging a Better Planet.

04:04:25,154 --> 04:04:28,414
SPEAKER_0:  and it was for grad students mostly in communication. It wasn't an environment.

04:04:28,770 --> 04:04:31,102
SPEAKER_0:  It wasn't like better planet, like save the climate.

04:04:31,874 --> 04:04:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  But my task for the students was to blog about something they're passionate about.

04:04:35,586 --> 04:04:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  First of all, because you can't do this just like you can't do your conversations.

04:04:38,626 --> 04:04:41,054
SPEAKER_0:  if you don't wake up in the morning wanting to do what you're doing, right?

04:04:41,282 --> 04:04:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  You're doing this.

04:04:42,690 --> 04:04:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  I used to call myself a selfish blogger because I was learning every day. I still am.

04:04:46,850 --> 04:04:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  I love this. My wife laughs.

04:04:49,826 --> 04:04:50,718
SPEAKER_0:  she thinks I work too much.

04:04:51,458 --> 04:04:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  But I'm always like asking those questions, like, sustain what? So my charge to the students was-

04:04:57,922 --> 04:05:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  harness a passion, build a blog.

04:05:00,482 --> 04:05:01,790
SPEAKER_0:  either alone or with others.

04:05:03,842 --> 04:05:06,814
SPEAKER_0:  not just the world a little bit towards some better outcome.

04:05:07,202 --> 04:05:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  And so there was a musician who did a thing on music, musicians who use their art for...

04:05:12,290 --> 04:05:13,022
SPEAKER_0:  their work for.

04:05:13,314 --> 04:05:14,078
SPEAKER_0:  making the world better.

04:05:14,434 --> 04:05:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  Some of it was like music therapy, you know.

04:05:16,738 --> 04:05:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  bands contributing money, whatever.

04:05:18,594 --> 04:05:19,294
SPEAKER_0:  Another one did.

04:05:19,650 --> 04:05:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  Her blog was on comfort- comfort food.

04:05:22,018 --> 04:05:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  all around the world. And I thought it was my favorite. It was a video.

04:05:25,218 --> 04:05:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  I think it should be viral actually.

04:05:27,874 --> 04:05:31,166
SPEAKER_0:  It was like looking at the world, every different cultures.

04:05:32,002 --> 04:05:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  She was in Queens. So every culture, every cuisine is there in Queens, 200 countries.

04:05:37,922 --> 04:05:42,206
SPEAKER_0:  But she would go and talk to people's moms and have them cook the food of that country that's their common food.

04:05:42,466 --> 04:05:45,598
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I just love this because we all need to eat.

04:05:45,954 --> 04:05:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  you're getting this expanded sense of what comfort is.

04:05:49,122 --> 04:05:51,614
SPEAKER_0:  by thinking about what other cultures choose.

04:05:52,130 --> 04:05:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  and

04:05:52,962 --> 04:05:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  That felt like a great course because it was not directive. It was just...

04:05:57,218 --> 04:06:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  it gave them this potential to go forward. I'd love to think they've all gone on to become superstar.

04:06:02,210 --> 04:06:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  Whatever is, I don't know. That's the giving, that's the letting go part.

04:06:06,370 --> 04:06:07,422
SPEAKER_0:  Even if one did.

04:06:08,034 --> 04:06:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  something special then that makes me feel job done.

04:06:11,362 --> 04:06:12,350
SPEAKER_0:  And you know...

04:06:13,154 --> 04:06:15,294
SPEAKER_0:  After I'd been writing about climate for 30 years.

04:06:15,618 --> 04:06:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  2016ish.

04:06:18,690 --> 04:06:19,742
SPEAKER_0:  Did a lot of writing about.

04:06:20,162 --> 04:06:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  What did I learn? Unlearn and stuff.

04:06:22,210 --> 04:06:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  and I had had a stroke in 2011.

04:06:25,346 --> 04:06:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  which was interesting.

04:06:26,242 --> 04:06:27,454
SPEAKER_0:  This is the first time I really.

04:06:27,970 --> 04:06:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  thought about my brain.

04:06:30,018 --> 04:06:32,286
SPEAKER_0:  You don't think about your brain on a day-to-day basis.

04:06:32,866 --> 04:06:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  But this is my brain telling me, you know, ding, ding, ding, ding, some weird shit's happening.

04:06:37,986 --> 04:06:39,102
SPEAKER_0:  And when I was thinking about...

04:06:39,554 --> 04:06:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  climate or confronting climate change, it felt like some of the things I learned about my own.

04:06:43,490 --> 04:06:44,574
SPEAKER_0:  existence, you know.

04:06:44,866 --> 04:06:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  I'm gonna die.

04:06:45,826 --> 04:06:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  but you don't really.

04:06:46,946 --> 04:06:48,071
SPEAKER_0:  absorbs out of it.

04:06:48,071 --> 04:06:49,566
SPEAKER_1:  Is that the first time you kind of?

04:06:49,666 --> 04:06:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  That was like my first like, yeah, this is really the shit, you know, or at least deep disability, if not death.

04:06:56,322 --> 04:06:56,702
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

04:06:56,962 --> 04:06:59,230
SPEAKER_0:  that ability is transitory.

04:06:59,810 --> 04:07:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  And I thought about the climate problem. We're not gonna solve the global warming problem, at least not in our lifetimes.

04:07:05,538 --> 04:07:07,774
SPEAKER_0:  but you work on making.

04:07:08,674 --> 04:07:09,886
SPEAKER_0:  those trajectories.

04:07:10,402 --> 04:07:14,142
SPEAKER_0:  sustainable, you know, the end of life particularly. You work on

04:07:14,594 --> 04:07:17,886
SPEAKER_0:  making sure other people don't get strokes if they can avoid it. In my case.

04:07:18,370 --> 04:07:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  I wrote about it, I was blogging about my stroke while I was having it.

04:07:21,762 --> 04:07:24,702
SPEAKER_0:  I was tweeting about it. There's a funny tweet that's kind of mistyped.

04:07:25,442 --> 04:07:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  because...

04:07:26,786 --> 04:07:27,262
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

04:07:27,490 --> 04:07:28,190
SPEAKER_1:  Co-F 650....

04:07:28,642 --> 04:07:37,054
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right, right, right. So that's like share your knowledge, share your learning. And everyone can do this now, like on whatever platform.

04:07:37,602 --> 04:07:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  And then, um...

04:07:39,330 --> 04:07:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  There's also this like giving up part.

04:07:41,666 --> 04:07:43,582
SPEAKER_0:  but not in a depressing well.

04:07:44,258 --> 04:07:45,150
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe you can call it depressing.

04:07:45,762 --> 04:07:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  I started to zoom in.

04:07:47,362 --> 04:07:51,262
SPEAKER_0:  years ago and the idea of the serenity prayer, the sobriety thing, you know, it's like

04:07:51,906 --> 04:07:53,662
SPEAKER_0:  know what you can change, know what you can't.

04:07:54,146 --> 04:07:59,806
SPEAKER_1:  Grant me the serenity to accept the things that cannot change, the courage to change the things that can.

04:08:00,162 --> 04:08:02,037
SPEAKER_1:  and the wisdom to know the difference.

04:08:02,037 --> 04:08:05,598
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, see those three properties are really important right now.

04:08:06,626 --> 04:08:09,630
SPEAKER_0:  Some aspects of this we know absolutely what we can work on.

04:08:09,922 --> 04:08:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  cutting vulnerability.

04:08:11,522 --> 04:08:12,894
SPEAKER_0:  Energy transitions take time.

04:08:13,602 --> 04:08:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  Science can help.

04:08:15,074 --> 04:08:16,606
SPEAKER_0:  us discriminate the difference.

04:08:17,666 --> 04:08:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  And that's an iterative changing landscape.

04:08:20,450 --> 04:08:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  going forward.

04:08:22,498 --> 04:08:23,678
SPEAKER_0:  But at the same time...

04:08:25,058 --> 04:08:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  science.

04:08:26,434 --> 04:08:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  Like I personally on climate modeling or.

04:08:29,506 --> 04:08:31,198
SPEAKER_0:  like narrowing how hot it's gonna get.

04:08:32,130 --> 04:08:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  more clarity on.

04:08:34,082 --> 04:08:35,710
SPEAKER_0:  when an ice sheet is going to collapse.

04:08:35,970 --> 04:08:38,686
SPEAKER_0:  I think those are what I call known unknowable. So being able to-

04:08:39,682 --> 04:08:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  I've seen enough evidence.

04:08:41,378 --> 04:08:41,886
SPEAKER_0:  That

04:08:42,626 --> 04:08:45,246
SPEAKER_0:  Those are deeply complex problems We're not going to get there quickly.

04:08:45,666 --> 04:08:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  So then that gives you a landscape to act on.

04:08:49,058 --> 04:08:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  And that.

04:08:49,826 --> 04:08:52,478
SPEAKER_0:  you know, whether you bring God into the mix is irrelevant. It's really.

04:08:53,218 --> 04:08:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  Know what you can change, know what you can't.

04:08:55,202 --> 04:08:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  and know what that gives you the quality to work on.

04:08:58,274 --> 04:08:59,646
SPEAKER_0:  them and serenity is

04:09:00,034 --> 04:09:00,830
SPEAKER_0:  Comfort with...

04:09:01,762 --> 04:09:03,454
SPEAKER_0:  that this is transitory.

04:09:04,098 --> 04:09:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  The Human Journey.

04:09:06,434 --> 04:09:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  like anyone's individual journey.

04:09:09,634 --> 04:09:11,326
SPEAKER_0:  will have some end.

04:09:11,554 --> 04:09:16,606
SPEAKER_0:  doesn't mean it has to be near. This Anthropocene that I've been writing about for decades is...

04:09:17,698 --> 04:09:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  can still be a good.

04:09:19,010 --> 04:09:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  Anthropocene.

04:09:20,642 --> 04:09:22,942
SPEAKER_0:  or at least a less bad one in terms of how we get through it.

04:09:23,842 --> 04:09:24,967
SPEAKER_0:  and you're also.

04:09:24,967 --> 04:09:27,486
SPEAKER_1:  musician so in context when

04:09:28,066 --> 04:09:30,526
SPEAKER_1:  One of my favorite songs of yours and album.

04:09:30,786 --> 04:09:32,382
SPEAKER_1:  A very fine line.

04:09:32,994 --> 04:09:35,134
SPEAKER_1:  I should mention that with the stroke.

04:09:35,682 --> 04:09:36,830
SPEAKER_1:  Coming close to death.

04:09:37,314 --> 04:09:39,614
SPEAKER_1:  The lyrics here are quite brilliant, I have to say.

04:09:39,714 --> 04:09:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  Oh well.

04:09:40,610 --> 04:09:43,102
SPEAKER_1:  It's a very fine line between winning and losing.

04:09:43,970 --> 04:09:51,678
SPEAKER_1:  A very fine line between living and dying. A very fine line. By the way, people should listen to this. I can't play this because YouTube will give me trouble.

04:09:51,970 --> 04:09:54,814
SPEAKER_1:  A very fine line between loving and leaving.

04:09:55,586 --> 04:10:01,598
SPEAKER_1:  Most of your life you spend walking a very fine line and the rest of the lyrics are just quite brilliant.

04:10:01,954 --> 04:10:03,070
SPEAKER_1:  It is a fine line.

04:10:03,522 --> 04:10:03,870
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

04:10:04,194 --> 04:10:08,030
SPEAKER_1:  I'm glad you walked it with me today, gentlemen. You're brilliant.

04:10:08,866 --> 04:10:11,646
SPEAKER_1:  kind, beautiful human beings. Thank you so much.

04:10:11,906 --> 04:10:16,638
SPEAKER_1:  for having this quote unquote debate that was much more about just exploring ideas together.

04:10:16,898 --> 04:10:18,206
SPEAKER_1:  Bjorn, thank you so much.

04:10:18,754 --> 04:10:21,379
SPEAKER_1:  and uh... andy thank you so much for talking to them

04:10:21,379 --> 04:10:22,558
SPEAKER_0:  You know, these kinds of...

04:10:23,618 --> 04:10:26,782
SPEAKER_0:  Extended conversations, the more of it, the better.

04:10:27,042 --> 04:10:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  and finding ways to.

04:10:28,994 --> 04:10:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  Spread that.

04:10:30,018 --> 04:10:31,006
SPEAKER_0:  capacity.

04:10:31,522 --> 04:10:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  just to get people out of this win-lose thing is really important. So thanks for what you're doing. No.

04:10:36,642 --> 04:10:40,414

04:10:47,074 --> 04:10:48,478
SPEAKER_1:  from Henry David Thoreau.

04:10:49,442 --> 04:10:51,326
SPEAKER_1:  Heaven is under our feet.

04:10:51,618 --> 04:10:53,502
SPEAKER_1:  as well as over our heads.

04:10:54,498 --> 04:10:56,286
