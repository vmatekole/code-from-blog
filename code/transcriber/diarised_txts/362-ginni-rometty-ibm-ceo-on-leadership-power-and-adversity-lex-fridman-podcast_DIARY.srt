00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  I've had to do plenty of unpopular things. I think anytime you have to run a company that endures,

00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:10,174
SPEAKER_0:  a century and has to endure another century, you will do unpopular things. You have no choice.

00:00:10,562 --> 00:00:13,694
SPEAKER_0:  And I often felt I had to sacrifice things for the long term.

00:00:14,178 --> 00:00:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  whether that would have been really difficult things like job changes or reductions.

00:00:20,706 --> 00:00:22,718
SPEAKER_0:  or whether it would be things like, hey,

00:00:23,202 --> 00:00:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  you know, we're going to change the way we do our semiconductors.

00:00:26,146 --> 00:00:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:00:26,978 --> 00:00:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  a whole different philosophy.

00:00:29,282 --> 00:00:35,262
SPEAKER_0:  You have no choice. I mean, and in times of crisis as well, you gotta be, I always said it's not a popularity contest.

00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:39,934
SPEAKER_1:  The following is a conversation with Jeannie Vermette.

00:00:40,354 --> 00:00:41,598
SPEAKER_1:  was a long time CEO.

00:00:41,826 --> 00:00:43,422
SPEAKER_1:  President and Chairman of IBM.

00:00:43,842 --> 00:00:44,798
SPEAKER_1:  for many years.

00:00:45,154 --> 00:00:48,702
SPEAKER_1:  She was widely considered to be one of the most powerful women in the world.

00:00:49,538 --> 00:00:50,814
SPEAKER_1:  She's the author of a new book.

00:00:51,202 --> 00:00:52,478
SPEAKER_1:  Unpower leadership.

00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,238
SPEAKER_1:  and her life story.

00:00:54,562 --> 00:00:55,838
SPEAKER_1:  called Good Power.

00:00:56,418 --> 00:00:57,790
SPEAKER_1:  Coming out on March 7th.

00:00:58,818 --> 00:01:00,766
SPEAKER_1:  She is an incredible leader.

00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,078
SPEAKER_1:  and human being.

00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,478
SPEAKER_1:  both fearless and compassionate.

00:01:04,962 --> 00:01:09,182
SPEAKER_1:  It was a huge honor and pleasure for me to sit down and have this chat with her.

00:01:10,114 --> 00:01:14,718
SPEAKER_1:  This is the Lex treatment podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:01:15,138 --> 00:01:16,478
SPEAKER_1:  And now, dear friends.

00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:17,534
SPEAKER_1:  Here's Genie.

00:01:17,794 --> 00:01:18,270
SPEAKER_1:  Romani.

00:01:19,394 --> 00:01:23,518
SPEAKER_1:  You worked at IBM for over 40 years, starting as a systems engineer.

00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:26,782
SPEAKER_1:  and you ran the company as chairman president and CEO from.

00:01:27,202 --> 00:01:28,734
SPEAKER_1:  2011 to 2020.

00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  IBM is one of the largest tech companies in the world.

00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:33,310
SPEAKER_1:  with.

00:01:33,922 --> 00:01:37,950
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe you can correct me on this with about 280,000 employees.

00:01:38,658 --> 00:01:42,942
SPEAKER_1:  What are the biggest challenges running the company of that size? Let's start with the setup.

00:01:43,202 --> 00:01:43,646
SPEAKER_1:  Big.

00:01:44,034 --> 00:01:44,958
SPEAKER_1:  overview question.

00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,734
SPEAKER_0:  biggest challenges I think are not in writing them, it's in changing them.

00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  and that idea to know what you should change.

00:01:52,386 --> 00:01:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  and what you should not change.

00:01:53,794 --> 00:01:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  Actually, people don't always ask that question.

00:01:56,098 --> 00:01:59,614
SPEAKER_0:  what should endure, even if it has to be modernized, but what should endure.

00:02:00,098 --> 00:02:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  and then I found the hardest part was changing how work got done.

00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  It's such a big company.

00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:06,174
SPEAKER_1:  What was the part that...

00:02:06,562 --> 00:02:07,966
SPEAKER_1:  you thought should endure.

00:02:08,482 --> 00:02:13,566
SPEAKER_1:  the core of the company that was beautiful and powerful could persist through time, that it should persist through time.

00:02:13,698 --> 00:02:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  I'd be interested, do you have a perception of what you think it would be?

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,070
SPEAKER_1:  to have a perception.

00:02:19,618 --> 00:02:24,414
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I'm a romantic for history of long running companies. So there's kind of a.

00:02:24,642 --> 00:02:25,534
SPEAKER_1:  A tradition?

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,390
SPEAKER_1:  as a AI person.

00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,574
SPEAKER_1:  me IBM.

00:02:28,802 --> 00:02:31,454
SPEAKER_1:  has some epic sort of research.

00:02:31,874 --> 00:02:35,070
SPEAKER_1:  accomplishments, where you show off, you know, deep blue.

00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,254
SPEAKER_1:  and Watson.

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,070
SPEAKER_1:  Just impressive big moonshot.

00:02:39,522 --> 00:02:45,534
SPEAKER_1:  challenges and accomplishing those. But that's, I think, that's probably a small part of what IBM is. That's mostly like the-

00:02:46,306 --> 00:02:48,181
SPEAKER_1:  the sexy public facing part.

00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, no, it is. Well, certainly the research part itself, right, is over 3000. So it's not that small. That's pretty big research. Yes. But.

00:02:56,898 --> 00:02:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  The part that should endure.

00:02:58,466 --> 00:02:59,326
SPEAKER_0:  ends up being.

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  you know, company that does things that are essential to the world, meaning...

00:03:03,682 --> 00:03:04,126
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:03:05,858 --> 00:03:08,222
SPEAKER_0:  The who, you know, think back, you said you're romantic.

00:03:08,674 --> 00:03:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  It was the 30s, the social security system. It was putting the man on the moon. It was, you know, to this day banks don't run.

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  you know railroads don't run.

00:03:17,474 --> 00:03:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:03:18,786 --> 00:03:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  That is at its core.

00:03:20,738 --> 00:03:22,078
SPEAKER_0:  It's doing mission critical work.

00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  And so that part, I think is at its core. It's a business to business company.

00:03:27,522 --> 00:03:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  and at its core it's about doing things that are really important.

00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  to the world becoming running and being better.

00:03:33,602 --> 00:03:37,246
SPEAKER_1:  running the infrastructure of the world, so doing it at scale, doing it reliably.

00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:43,966
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, secure in this world, that's like everything. And in fact, when I started, I almost felt people were looking for what that was.

00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  And together we sort of, in a word, was to be essential.

00:03:47,298 --> 00:03:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  And the reason I loved that word was

00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,630
SPEAKER_0:  I can't call myself essential. You have to determine I am, right? Just so

00:03:53,890 --> 00:04:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  It was to be essential, even though some of what we did is exactly what you said, it's below the surface, so many people, because people say to me, well, what does IBM do now, right?

00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,518
SPEAKER_0:  And over the years, it's changed so much.

00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  Today, it's really a software and consulting company.

00:04:08,386 --> 00:04:09,406
SPEAKER_0:  consulting is a third of it.

00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  and the software is all hybrid cloud and AI.

00:04:13,442 --> 00:04:15,134
SPEAKER_0:  That would not have been true, as you well know.

00:04:15,554 --> 00:04:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  back even two decades ago, right? so

00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,998
SPEAKER_0:  It changes, but I think in its core, it's that.

00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  be essential. You said moonshots, can't all be moonshots because moonshots don't always work.

00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:25,214
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

00:04:25,634 --> 00:04:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  Mission critical work.

00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:27,550
SPEAKER_1:  So.

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,790
SPEAKER_1:  Given the size though.

00:04:30,818 --> 00:04:33,150
SPEAKER_1:  When you started running it, did you feel?

00:04:33,762 --> 00:04:34,430
SPEAKER_1:  the sort of.

00:04:34,786 --> 00:04:38,526
SPEAKER_1:  thing that people usually associate with size, which is bureaucracy.

00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:40,382
SPEAKER_1:  And maybe...

00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:44,863
SPEAKER_1:  The aspect of size that hinder progress or hinder pivoting. Did you feel that?

00:04:44,863 --> 00:04:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  You would.

00:04:45,794 --> 00:04:46,206
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  for lots of reasons. I think when you're a big company,

00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  Sometimes people think of...

00:04:51,746 --> 00:04:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  processes the client themselves?

00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  I always say to people, your process is not your customer.

00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,510
SPEAKER_0:  There is a real customer here that you exist for.

00:05:00,898 --> 00:05:08,254
SPEAKER_0:  And that's really easy to fall into because there, you know, people are a master to this process and that's not right.

00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,846
SPEAKER_0:  And when you're big, the other thing in...

00:05:11,586 --> 00:05:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:14,366
SPEAKER_0:  there's a premium on it, is speed, right?

00:05:14,722 --> 00:05:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  that in our industry.

00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  you gotta be fast. And go back like when I took over and it was 2012.

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,678
SPEAKER_0:  you know, we have a lot of catching up to do and a lot of things to do, and it was moving so fast. And as you well know,

00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  All those trends were happening at once, which made them go even faster.

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,262
SPEAKER_0:  And so pretty unprecedented actually for that many trends to be at one time.

00:05:35,778 --> 00:05:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  And I used to say to people, go faster, go faster, go faster.

00:05:38,786 --> 00:05:39,230
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:40,190
SPEAKER_0:  Honestly?

00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:41,918
SPEAKER_0:  I've.

00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  I mean,

00:05:43,586 --> 00:05:48,382
SPEAKER_0:  it kind of dawned on me that when you're that big, it's a really valuable lesson.

00:05:48,674 --> 00:05:51,614
SPEAKER_0:  And it taught me like the hows, perhaps more important than the what.

00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  because

00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  If I didn't do something to change how work was done, like change those processes or give them new tools, help them with skills.

00:06:00,706 --> 00:06:03,038
SPEAKER_0:  They couldn't. They'd just like do the same thing faster.

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,350
SPEAKER_0:  If someone tells you...

00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  you know, you got hiking boots and they're like, no, go run a marathon. You're like, I can't do it in those boots. But so you've got to do something and.

00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  At first...

00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  I think the ways for big companies, I would fun call them like blunt clubs. You do what everyone does. You reduce layers. You reduce layers.

00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  decisions go faster.

00:06:22,498 --> 00:06:23,038
SPEAKER_0:  It's math.

00:06:23,362 --> 00:06:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  If there's less decision points, things go faster.

00:06:26,498 --> 00:06:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:32,894
SPEAKER_0:  you do the blunt club thing. And then after that though, it did lead me down a long journey.

00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  of they sound like buzzwords, but if you really do them at scale, they're hard.

00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:38,174
SPEAKER_0:  around things like Agile.

00:06:38,882 --> 00:06:39,550
SPEAKER_0:  And um...

00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  because you've really gotta change the way work gets done. your job is done be a man

00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:48,542
SPEAKER_0:  We ended up training, God, hundreds of thousands of people on that stuff. To really change it. images nei

00:06:48,802 --> 00:06:52,670
SPEAKER_0:  on how to do it correctly. That's right, versus, because everybody talks about it.

00:06:52,994 --> 00:07:00,990
SPEAKER_0:  but the idea that you would really have small, multidisciplinary teams work from the outside in, set those sort of interim steps, you know.

00:07:01,218 --> 00:07:03,006
SPEAKER_0:  take the feedback pivot.

00:07:03,362 --> 00:07:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  and then do it on not just products, do it on lots of things.

00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  was it's hard to do at scale.

00:07:08,418 --> 00:07:11,326
SPEAKER_0:  People always say, oh, I got this agile group over here of 40 people.

00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:16,095
SPEAKER_0:  but not when you're a couple hundred thousand people. You gotta get a lot of people to work that way.

00:07:16,095 --> 00:07:19,095
SPEAKER_1:  the blonde club thing you're talking about. So flatten the organization.

00:07:19,095 --> 00:07:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, yeah, I probably reduced the layers of management by half.

00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  And so...

00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  It

00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:26,782
SPEAKER_0:  that has lots of benefits, right?

00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  Time to a decision.

00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:32,542
SPEAKER_0:  um, more autonomy to people. Cause and then the idea of like.

00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,918
SPEAKER_0:  faster clarity.

00:07:34,594 --> 00:07:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  of where you're going.

00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  because you're not just filtered through so many different layers.

00:07:38,946 --> 00:07:39,422
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:07:39,874 --> 00:07:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

00:07:40,514 --> 00:07:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  It's the kind of thing a lot of companies, if you're big, have to just keep going through. It's kind of like grass grows, you know, it just comes back.

00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  and you gotta go back town and work on it. So it's a natural thing.

00:07:50,562 --> 00:07:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:07:51,522 --> 00:07:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  But I hear so many people talk about it, this idea of like, okay.

00:07:54,658 --> 00:07:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  Well, who makes a decision? You've often heard nobody can say yes and everybody can say no.

00:07:59,106 --> 00:07:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  And that's actually what.

00:08:00,258 --> 00:08:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  you're trying to get out of a system like that.

00:08:02,978 --> 00:08:03,646
SPEAKER_1:  So...

00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:11,134
SPEAKER_1:  I mean your book in general, the way you lead is very much about we and us, you know, the power of we. It's a,-

00:08:11,618 --> 00:08:17,123
SPEAKER_1:  But is there times when a leader has to step in and be almost autocratic, take control, or make hard

00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  popular decisions. Oh, I am sure you know the answer to that.

00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  And it is, of course, yes. It's fun to hear you say it. It's fun to say it, yeah.

00:08:25,122 --> 00:08:26,430
SPEAKER_0:  Because I actually.

00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:30,974
SPEAKER_0:  A, there's a leader for a time, but then there's a leader for a situation, right? And so-

00:08:31,426 --> 00:08:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  I've had to do plenty of unpopular things. I think anytime you have to run a company that endures,

00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  a century and has to endure another century, you will do unpopular things. You have no choice.

00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:45,022
SPEAKER_0:  And I often felt I had to sacrifice things for the long term.

00:08:45,474 --> 00:08:45,950
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:08:46,338 --> 00:08:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  whether that would have been really difficult things like job changes or reductions.

00:08:52,034 --> 00:08:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  or whether it would be things like, hey,

00:08:54,498 --> 00:08:56,958
SPEAKER_0:  you know, we're going to change the way we do our semiconductors.

00:08:57,442 --> 00:08:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:08:58,274 --> 00:08:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  a whole different philosophy.

00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:06,558
SPEAKER_0:  You have no choice. I mean, and in times of crisis as well, you got to be, I always said it's not a popularity contest.

00:09:07,074 --> 00:09:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:09:08,162 --> 00:09:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  That's none of these jobs are popularity contests. I don't care if your company's got one person.

00:09:12,322 --> 00:09:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  or half a million.

00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,637
SPEAKER_0:  They're not popularity contests.

00:09:15,637 --> 00:09:16,702
SPEAKER_1:  Logically, is it difficult?

00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:18,494
SPEAKER_1:  to just sort of step in.

00:09:18,914 --> 00:09:20,062
SPEAKER_1:  as a new CEO and

00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:26,142
SPEAKER_1:  that too, because you're fighting against tradition, against all these people that act like experts of their thing.

00:09:26,402 --> 00:09:27,838
SPEAKER_1:  and they are experts of their thing.

00:09:28,226 --> 00:09:29,351
SPEAKER_1:  to step in and say we.

00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  differently.

00:09:30,338 --> 00:09:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  when you had to change a company.

00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  It's really tempting to say throw everything else out, back to that what must endure, right? to

00:09:36,962 --> 00:09:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  But.

00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  I know when I took over to start, I knew how much had to change, more I got into it, I could see.

00:09:41,954 --> 00:09:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  Wow, a lot more had to change, right? It was.

00:09:44,386 --> 00:09:55,486
SPEAKER_0:  we needed a platform, we'd always done our best when we had a platform, a technology platform. You will go back in time and you'll think of the mainframe systems, you'll think of the PC, you'll think of perhaps middleware.

00:09:55,714 --> 00:09:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  You know, you could even call service as a platform.

00:09:59,074 --> 00:10:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  we needed a platform, the next platform here to be there.

00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:04,734
SPEAKER_0:  um skills when i took over

00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  If I.

00:10:05,698 --> 00:10:14,590
SPEAKER_0:  we inventoried who had modern skills for the future, it was two out of 10 people for the future. Not that they didn't have relevant skills today, but for the future, two out of 10, yikes. That's a big problem, right?

00:10:14,818 --> 00:10:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  the speed at which things were getting done. So you got so much to do.

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,694
SPEAKER_0:  And you say, is that...

00:10:22,018 --> 00:10:23,678
SPEAKER_0:  Is that a scary thing? Yes.

00:10:24,098 --> 00:10:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  Do you have to sometimes dictate yes?

00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:27,390
SPEAKER_0:  But I did fine.

00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  And it is worth it. I know every big company I know, my good friend that runs General Motors.

00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  as she's had to change.

00:10:33,826 --> 00:10:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  Go back to what is.

00:10:35,906 --> 00:10:38,814
SPEAKER_0:  them them, you know, and when you do that...

00:10:39,298 --> 00:10:42,302
SPEAKER_0:  that back to be essential. We kind of started with, hey, it's be essential.

00:10:42,594 --> 00:10:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  then the next thing I could do with the team was say, okay, now this means

00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  new era of computing, new buyers are out there, and eh, we better have new skills. Okay, now the next thing, how do you operationalize it?

00:10:53,026 --> 00:10:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  and it just takes some time.

00:10:55,842 --> 00:10:59,349
SPEAKER_0:  but you can engineer that and get people to build belief.

00:10:59,349 --> 00:11:03,710
SPEAKER_1:  And for the skills that means that means hiring and it means training.

00:11:04,194 --> 00:11:04,702
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

00:11:04,962 --> 00:11:12,926
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, oh boy, that's a long skills is a really long topic in and of itself. I try to put my view in it. I learned a lot and I changed my view on this a lot.

00:11:13,698 --> 00:11:14,078
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  I'll go back at my very beginning.

00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  say 40 years ago.

00:11:18,498 --> 00:11:19,678
SPEAKER_0:  I would have said...

00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:25,214
SPEAKER_0:  At that point, okay, I was always in a hurry, I was interviewing to hire people, I don't know how you hire people.

00:11:25,506 --> 00:11:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  40 years ago, I'd be like, okay, I gotta fit in these interviews. I gotta hire someone to get this done. Okay, then time would go on. I'm like, oh, that's not very good. In fact, someone once said to me, hey.

00:11:34,274 --> 00:11:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  hire the best people to work for you and your job gets a lot easier.

00:11:37,538 --> 00:11:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, I should spend more time on this topic. I should spend more time on it.

00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:42,206
SPEAKER_0:  Then it was like, okay, hire experts.

00:11:42,562 --> 00:11:43,070
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:45,630
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, hired a lot of experts over my life.

00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  And then...

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  I was really like an epiphany and it really happened over my tenure.

00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,182
SPEAKER_0:  running the company and having to change skills.

00:11:54,274 --> 00:11:57,278
SPEAKER_0:  If someone's an expert at something and has just done that for 30 years.

00:11:58,178 --> 00:12:00,382
SPEAKER_0:  to add to them really wanting to change a lot.

00:12:00,898 --> 00:12:01,630
SPEAKER_0:  are pretty low.

00:12:02,178 --> 00:12:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  And when you're in a really dynamic industry, that's a problem.

00:12:05,314 --> 00:12:06,014
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:10,878
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, that was like kind of my first revelation on this. And then when I looked to hiring,

00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  I can remember when I started my job, when we needed cyber people.

00:12:14,914 --> 00:12:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  and I go out there and I look.

00:12:16,514 --> 00:12:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  Unemployment in the US was almost 10%.

00:12:18,978 --> 00:12:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  can't find them.

00:12:20,002 --> 00:12:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, it's 10% and I can't find the people.

00:12:22,498 --> 00:12:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, what's the issue?

00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,150
SPEAKER_0:  They're not teaching the right things.

00:12:25,794 --> 00:12:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  That led me down a path and it was

00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:36,478
SPEAKER_0:  serendipity that I happened to do a review of social corporate social responsibility. We had this one little fledgling school in a low income area.

00:12:36,898 --> 00:12:41,662
SPEAKER_0:  And high school with a community college, we gave them internships, direction on curriculum.

00:12:42,306 --> 00:12:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, behold.

00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  We can hire these kids.

00:12:45,122 --> 00:12:45,470
SPEAKER_0:  I said.

00:12:46,146 --> 00:12:49,214
SPEAKER_0:  Hmm, this is not CSR, like I just found a new talent pool.

00:12:49,826 --> 00:12:53,246
SPEAKER_0:  which takes me to now what I'm doing in my post, you know, post retirement.

00:12:53,634 --> 00:12:54,046
SPEAKER_0:  I'm like...

00:12:54,498 --> 00:13:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  This idea that don't hire just for a college degree, we had 99% of our hires were.

00:13:00,482 --> 00:13:10,206
SPEAKER_0:  college and PhDs and I'm all for it. So you're very, don't. I'm deeply offended. No, you should not be. And I, you know, I'm vice chair at Northwestern, but I will definitely be at Northwestern.

00:13:10,466 --> 00:13:11,326
SPEAKER_0:  But I said...

00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  I just really like aptitude does not equal access. These people didn't have access, but they had aptitude.

00:13:17,218 --> 00:13:21,854
SPEAKER_0:  it changed my whole view to skills first. And so now for hiring.

00:13:22,274 --> 00:13:27,230
SPEAKER_0:  That's kind of a long story to tell you. The number one thing I would hire for now is somebody's willingness to learn.

00:13:27,714 --> 00:13:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  And you can test, you can try different ways, but their curiosity and willingness to learn.

00:13:32,322 --> 00:13:35,390
SPEAKER_0:  hands down, I will take that trait over anything else they have.

00:13:35,618 --> 00:13:41,374
SPEAKER_1:  So the interview process, the questions you asked. Everything changed. The kind of things you talk to them about is try to get it.

00:13:41,698 --> 00:13:42,046
SPEAKER_1:  How?

00:13:42,466 --> 00:13:43,591
SPEAKER_1:  curious there about the world.

00:13:43,591 --> 00:13:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, we triangulated around it lots of ways. And look...

00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  At the heart of it?

00:13:49,858 --> 00:13:53,182
SPEAKER_0:  What it would do is change. You don't think of buying skills. You think of …

00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  building skills.

00:13:54,754 --> 00:13:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  And when you think that way...

00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,078
SPEAKER_0:  with so many people and I think.

00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  This country, many developed countries, being disenfranchised.

00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  you gotta bring them back into the workforce somehow and they gotta get some kind of contemporary skills.

00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  And if you took that approach, you can bring them back into the workforce.

00:14:10,626 --> 00:14:14,302
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I think some interesting combination of humility and passion.

00:14:14,626 --> 00:14:15,326
SPEAKER_1:  Because like you said...

00:14:15,618 --> 00:14:18,750
SPEAKER_1:  Experts sometimes lack humility.

00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:22,046
SPEAKER_1:  if they call themselves an expert for a few too many years.

00:14:22,434 --> 00:14:24,574
SPEAKER_1:  So you have to have that beginner's mind.

00:14:24,802 --> 00:14:30,206
SPEAKER_1:  and a passion to be able to aggressively constantly be a beginner at everything and learn and learn and learn.

00:14:30,338 --> 00:14:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I saw it firsthand when we were beginning this path, you know, down the cloud and AI and we sit and people say,

00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, IBM, you know.

00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  Existential, they gotta change and...

00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:47,742
SPEAKER_0:  all these things and I did hire a lot of people from outside, very willing to learn new things. Come on in, come on in.

00:14:48,706 --> 00:14:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  And I sometimes say shiny objects, trained in shiny objects. Come on in.

00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  but I saw something, it was another one of these, you're not a shiny object, I'm not saying that.

00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,102
SPEAKER_0:  But I learned something.

00:14:59,554 --> 00:14:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

00:15:00,226 --> 00:15:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  Some of them did fantastic.

00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:04,094
SPEAKER_0:  Others?

00:15:04,418 --> 00:15:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  They're like, well, let me school you on everything.

00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  But they didn't realize we did really mission critical work.

00:15:10,082 --> 00:15:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  and then break a bank. I mean, they would not understand the certain kind of security and the auditability and everything they had to go on.

00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  And then I watched IBM people say.

00:15:18,946 --> 00:15:23,902
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, I actually could learn some some like, yeah, okay. I don't know how to do that's really good thing I could learn.

00:15:24,162 --> 00:15:24,862
SPEAKER_0:  And in the end...

00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:34,270
SPEAKER_0:  There was not like one group was a winner and one was a loser. The winners were the people who were willing to learn from each other. I mean, it was to me, it was very stark example of that point.

00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  And I saw it firsthand. So that's why I'm so committed to this idea about skills first. And that's how people should be hired, promoted, paid.

00:15:42,754 --> 00:15:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  You name it.

00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:44,798
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, the...

00:15:45,186 --> 00:15:49,054
SPEAKER_1:  AI in general, it seems like nobody really understands now.

00:15:50,242 --> 00:16:01,630
SPEAKER_1:  what the future will look like. We're all trying to figure it out. So like what IBM will look like in 50 years in relation to the software business, to AI is unknown. What Google will look like, what all these companies.

00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:04,574
SPEAKER_1:  We're trying to figure it out and that means.

00:16:05,314 --> 00:16:06,206
SPEAKER_1:  constantly learning.

00:16:07,074 --> 00:16:07,934
SPEAKER_1:  Taking risks.

00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:09,470
SPEAKER_1:  All those things.

00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:11,774
SPEAKER_1:  and nobody's really skilled in AI.

00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:16,510
SPEAKER_0:  Because you have to keep it all in. That's right. Couldn't agree more with you on that.

00:16:17,154 --> 00:16:18,558
SPEAKER_1:  You are you wrote in the book.

00:16:19,106 --> 00:16:20,446
SPEAKER_1:  Speaking of hiring.

00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:24,222
SPEAKER_1:  quote, my drive for perfection often meant.

00:16:24,898 --> 00:16:28,574
SPEAKER_1:  I only focused on what needed to change without acknowledging the positive.

00:16:28,994 --> 00:16:31,422
SPEAKER_1:  This could keep people from trusting themselves.

00:16:31,746 --> 00:16:36,574
SPEAKER_1:  It could take me a while to learn that just because I could point something out didn't mean I should.

00:16:37,282 --> 00:16:42,334
SPEAKER_1:  I still spotted errors, but I became more deliberate about what I mentioned and sent back to get fixed.

00:16:42,722 --> 00:16:45,566
SPEAKER_1:  I also tried to curtail my tendency to micromanage.

00:16:45,826 --> 00:16:46,974
SPEAKER_1:  and let people execute.

00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,886
SPEAKER_1:  I had to stop assuming my way was the best.

00:16:50,146 --> 00:16:51,006
SPEAKER_1:  or only way.

00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:55,070
SPEAKER_1:  I was learning that giving other people control builds their confidence.

00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,854
SPEAKER_1:  and that constantly trying to control people destroys it.

00:16:58,338 --> 00:16:59,006
SPEAKER_1:  So

00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,822
SPEAKER_1:  What's the right balance between showing the way

00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:05,086
SPEAKER_1:  and helping people find the way.

00:17:06,018 --> 00:17:07,006
SPEAKER_0:  That is a good question.

00:17:07,874 --> 00:17:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  because

00:17:09,378 --> 00:17:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  like a really flip answer would be.

00:17:12,642 --> 00:17:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  As it gets bigger, you have no choice but to just, you know, you can't do it. You have to-

00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  You have to tell her show. I mean.

00:17:22,178 --> 00:17:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  you've got to let people find their way because it's so big you can't, right?

00:17:26,466 --> 00:17:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  That's an obvious answer. Scope of work. Bigger it gets. I think I've got to let more stuff go.

00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  What?

00:17:34,594 --> 00:17:36,030
SPEAKER_0:  have always believed.

00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  that a leader's job is to do.

00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  as well.

00:17:40,866 --> 00:17:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  And I think there's like a few areas.

00:17:43,906 --> 00:17:44,286
SPEAKER_0:  that.

00:17:44,642 --> 00:17:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  are really important that you always do. Now, doesn't-

00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  Meaning you're showing.

00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:49,342
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,454
SPEAKER_0:  Like when it has to do with values.

00:17:51,714 --> 00:17:55,102
SPEAKER_0:  and value-based decisions, like I think it's really important to constantly-

00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:59,102
SPEAKER_0:  show people that you walk your talk.

00:17:59,554 --> 00:18:02,014
SPEAKER_0:  on that kind of thing is super important.

00:18:02,274 --> 00:18:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  And I actually think it's a struggle young companies have.

00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  because the values aren't deeply rooted.

00:18:07,522 --> 00:18:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  And when a storm comes, it's easy to uproot.

00:18:10,402 --> 00:18:10,846
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:11,742
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:13,022
SPEAKER_0:  So I always felt.

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,590
SPEAKER_0:  like when it was that time.

00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:19,678
SPEAKER_0:  I showed it, I got taught that so young at IBM and even General Motors that

00:18:20,162 --> 00:18:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:23,326
SPEAKER_0:  In fact, I write, I do write about that in the book.

00:18:23,842 --> 00:18:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  First time I was a manager.

00:18:25,218 --> 00:18:25,822
SPEAKER_0:  I had

00:18:26,242 --> 00:18:27,806
SPEAKER_0:  gentlemen telling dirty jokes.

00:18:28,034 --> 00:18:28,894
SPEAKER_0:  The end.

00:18:29,186 --> 00:18:32,382
SPEAKER_0:  not to me, but to other people, and it really offended.

00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  people.

00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,430
SPEAKER_0:  and some of the women.

00:18:35,042 --> 00:18:36,670
SPEAKER_0:  This is the...

00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  very early 80s.

00:18:38,562 --> 00:18:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  And...

00:18:40,642 --> 00:18:44,286
SPEAKER_0:  They came, said something, I talked to my boss, I'm a first time manager.

00:18:44,802 --> 00:18:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  and he was unequivocal.

00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  with what I should do.

00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  He said, and this was a top performer.

00:18:50,082 --> 00:18:51,710
SPEAKER_0:  It stops immediately or you fire him.

00:18:52,546 --> 00:18:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  So there are a few areas like that that I actually think you have to always continue to role model and show, right? That to me.

00:19:00,258 --> 00:19:03,157
SPEAKER_0:  isn't the kind that like when you let go of stuff right so.

00:19:03,157 --> 00:19:06,157
SPEAKER_1:  values and relationships with clients.

00:19:06,157 --> 00:19:07,902
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, whatever you're in service of.

00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  And the other thing was...

00:19:10,338 --> 00:19:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  I really felt it was really important to role model learning, right? So

00:19:14,338 --> 00:19:14,718
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

00:19:15,074 --> 00:19:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  I can remember when we...

00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,598
SPEAKER_0:  started down the journey.

00:19:18,562 --> 00:19:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  And we went on to this thing called the Think Academy, IBM's longtime motto at Think.

00:19:23,202 --> 00:19:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  And we said, okay.

00:19:24,098 --> 00:19:27,582
SPEAKER_0:  I'm gonna make the first Friday of every month compulsory education.

00:19:28,386 --> 00:19:28,958
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:19:30,146 --> 00:19:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  I mean everybody, like everybody, I don't care what your job is, okay? When the whole company has to transform, everybody's gotta have some skin in this game and understand it.

00:19:38,114 --> 00:19:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  I taught the first hour of every month for four years.

00:19:41,538 --> 00:19:41,886
SPEAKER_0:  Now.

00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:50,142
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, I had to learn something. So, but it made me learn, but I was like, okay, if I can teach this, you can do it, right? I mean, you know, kind of thing.

00:19:50,338 --> 00:19:53,713
SPEAKER_1:  So it was a compulsory Thursday night education for you.

00:19:53,713 --> 00:19:57,463
SPEAKER_0:  I'm a little bit better prepared than that. Yes, you're so right. Yes.

00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:58,302
SPEAKER_1:  you prepare.

00:19:58,594 --> 00:20:01,918
SPEAKER_1:  So personality wise, you like to prepare?

00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:06,494
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, but there's roots in that go back deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply. I think an Asian developer subscribe to tabletop

00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:10,558
SPEAKER_0:  That's an interesting reason, so why do, why, you're prepared, my friend.

00:20:10,786 --> 00:20:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, you are. You prepare for your interviews.

00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:14,238
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhh

00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:20,414
SPEAKER_0:  Sure. The rest you wing? Yeah, I wing. But that's OK. I mean, you don't have to prepare everything. I don't prepare everything either.

00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:26,686
SPEAKER_1:  No, but I unfortunately wing stuff. I save it to last minute. I push everything. I'm always almost late.

00:20:27,138 --> 00:20:32,958
SPEAKER_1:  And I don't know why that is. I mean, there's some deep psychological thing we should probably investigate, but it's probably the anxiety.

00:20:33,602 --> 00:20:34,727
SPEAKER_1:  brings out the performance.

00:20:34,727 --> 00:20:36,227
SPEAKER_0:  That can be, that's very true it's-

00:20:36,227 --> 00:20:39,454
SPEAKER_1:  people. I mean so I'm a programmer engineer at heart and so...

00:20:40,098 --> 00:20:42,014
SPEAKER_1:  programmers famously overestimate.

00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,630
SPEAKER_1:  or underestimate, sorry, how long something's going to take.

00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:50,302
SPEAKER_1:  So I just everything always underestimate. It's almost as if I want.

00:20:50,914 --> 00:20:51,646
SPEAKER_1:  to feel.

00:20:52,162 --> 00:20:53,182
SPEAKER_1:  this chaos.

00:20:53,442 --> 00:21:02,462
SPEAKER_1:  of anxiety of a deadline or something like this. Otherwise I'll be lazy sitting on a beach with a pina colada and relaxing. I don't know. We have to know ourselves, but for you.

00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  for me. You like to prepare. Yeah, it came from a few different places. I mean, one would have been as a-

00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:08,926
SPEAKER_0:  as a kid.

00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

00:21:11,874 --> 00:21:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  I was not a memorizer.

00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:17,310
SPEAKER_0:  and my brother is brilliant, he can read it once, boom, done.

00:21:17,602 --> 00:21:22,142
SPEAKER_0:  And so I always wanted to understand like how something happened. Didn't matter what it was I was doing.

00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:29,630
SPEAKER_0:  it was algebra theorems i was wanted don't give me the answer don't give me the answer you know i want to figure out here so i could reproduce it again and didn't have to memorize

00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  So it started with that.

00:21:31,778 --> 00:21:33,022
SPEAKER_0:  and then over time

00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:36,958
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, so I was in university in the 70s.

00:21:37,474 --> 00:21:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  When I was in engineering school, I was the only woman.

00:21:39,618 --> 00:21:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  I meet people still to this day and they're like, oh, I remember you. I'm like, yeah, sorry, I don't remember you. There were 30 of you, one of me.

00:21:45,026 --> 00:21:45,438
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  I think you already get that feeling of, okay, I better really study hard because whatever I say is going to be remembered in this class.

00:21:52,322 --> 00:21:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  Good or bad.

00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  And it started there.

00:21:55,266 --> 00:21:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  So in some ways...

00:21:57,762 --> 00:22:01,822
SPEAKER_0:  I did it for two reasons. Early on, I think it was a shield for confidence.

00:22:02,466 --> 00:22:03,454
SPEAKER_0:  The more I studied.

00:22:04,098 --> 00:22:06,014
SPEAKER_0:  The more prepared I was, the more confident.

00:22:06,274 --> 00:22:07,678
SPEAKER_0:  That's probably still true to this day.

00:22:08,642 --> 00:22:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  The second reason I did it...

00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  evolved over time and became different to prepare.

00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:13,918
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  If I was really prepared...

00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  than when we're in the moment?

00:22:18,146 --> 00:22:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  I can really listen to you.

00:22:20,194 --> 00:22:22,526
SPEAKER_0:  See, because I don't have to be doing all this stuff on the fly in my head.

00:22:23,138 --> 00:22:25,182
SPEAKER_0:  and I could actually take things I know.

00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:32,350
SPEAKER_0:  and maybe help the situation. So it really became a way that I could be present and in the moment and-

00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's something a lot of people that in the moment, I learned it from my husband. He doesn't prepare by the way.

00:22:38,498 --> 00:22:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  So that's not it.

00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  But I watched the in the moment. The negative example. No, no, no, and I'm not gonna change that, as he says. Yes, of course. He's a type Z, I'm an A, okay? That's how love works, yeah. And I have been married 43 years and that seems to work, so.

00:22:51,362 --> 00:22:52,414
SPEAKER_0:  But that idea that...

00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,126
SPEAKER_0:  You could be in the moment with people is a really important thing.

00:22:56,802 --> 00:22:59,998
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so the preparation gives you the freedom to really be present.

00:23:01,154 --> 00:23:03,966
SPEAKER_1:  So just to linger on the, you mentioned your brother.

00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:07,678
SPEAKER_1:  And it seems like in the book that you really had to.

00:23:08,482 --> 00:23:11,646
SPEAKER_1:  work hard when you study to sort of

00:23:12,514 --> 00:23:19,902
SPEAKER_1:  given that you weren't good at memorization, you really truly deeply want to understand the stuff and you put in the hard work and that seems to persist throughout your career.

00:23:20,386 --> 00:23:21,822
SPEAKER_1:  Um, you know, hard work.

00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,710
SPEAKER_1:  is often associated with the

00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:25,086
SPEAKER_1:  sort of.

00:23:25,378 --> 00:23:26,142
SPEAKER_1:  as negative.

00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:29,406
SPEAKER_1:  associations, well maybe with burnout, with dissatisfaction.

00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,574
SPEAKER_1:  Is there some aspect of hard work?

00:23:33,154 --> 00:23:35,934
SPEAKER_1:  at the core of who you are that led to happiness for you.

00:23:37,378 --> 00:23:38,142
SPEAKER_1:  Did you enjoy it?

00:23:38,914 --> 00:23:39,550
SPEAKER_0:  I enjoyed it.

00:23:39,906 --> 00:23:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  So I will be the first and I'm really careful to say that to people because

00:23:43,842 --> 00:23:46,206
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think everyone should associate G to do what you did.

00:23:46,562 --> 00:23:51,006
SPEAKER_0:  you have to, there's only one route there, right? and that's just not true and

00:23:51,234 --> 00:23:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  I do it because I like it.

00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:57,118
SPEAKER_0:  In fact, I'm careful and as time goes on, you have to be careful as more and more people watch you.

00:23:57,346 --> 00:24:10,558
SPEAKER_0:  whether you like it, you're a role model or not, you are a role model for people, whether you know it, like it, want it, does not matter. I learned that the hard way, and I would have to say to people, just because I do this does not mean I do it for these reasons, right? It should be really explicit.

00:24:10,978 --> 00:24:11,902
SPEAKER_0:  I'd come to believe.

00:24:12,162 --> 00:24:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  Usually when people say the word power, I don't know, do you have a positive or negative notion when I say the word power? We'll just do a- negative one.

00:24:18,434 --> 00:24:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  for some stereotype or some view that somebody's abused it in some way. You can read the newspaper, somebody's doing something.

00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:26,110
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:24:26,722 --> 00:24:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  like all these people do want power and they're like, oh no, I'd rather do good.

00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:31,806
SPEAKER_0:  And I think...

00:24:32,386 --> 00:24:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  The irony is you need power to do good.

00:24:35,362 --> 00:24:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  That sort of led me down to in.

00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:42,846
SPEAKER_0:  it was I thought about my own life right cuz it's it starts in a

00:24:44,258 --> 00:24:45,726
SPEAKER_0:  Like many of us, you know.

00:24:46,114 --> 00:24:50,142
SPEAKER_0:  You don't have a lot, but you don't know that because you're like everybody else around you at that time.

00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:24:51,586 --> 00:24:54,494
SPEAKER_0:  I want to end tragedy, right? My father leaves my mother.

00:24:54,914 --> 00:25:00,734
SPEAKER_0:  homeless, no money, no food, nothing, four kids. She's never worked a day in her life outside of a home.

00:25:01,602 --> 00:25:06,846
SPEAKER_0:  And the irony that I hear I would end up as the ninth CEO of one of America's iconic companies.

00:25:07,426 --> 00:25:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  And now I co-chair this group 110. And that journey, I said the biggest thing I learned was you could do really hard, meaningful things in a positive way. So now you ask me about why do I work so hard.

00:25:18,786 --> 00:25:20,510
SPEAKER_0:  I ended up writing the book in three pieces.

00:25:21,378 --> 00:25:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  for this reason, when you really think of your life and power...

00:25:25,282 --> 00:25:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  I thought.

00:25:26,338 --> 00:25:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  It kind of felt like a pebble in water.

00:25:28,578 --> 00:25:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  Like there's a ring about.

00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:31,806
SPEAKER_0:  You really care about yourself.

00:25:32,194 --> 00:25:34,430
SPEAKER_0:  and like the power of yourself, power of me.

00:25:34,882 --> 00:25:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  There's a time it transcends to that you are working with and for others in another moment when it becomes like about society.

00:25:41,314 --> 00:25:42,238
SPEAKER_0:  So, my hard work?

00:25:43,138 --> 00:25:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  I'd ask you...

00:25:44,546 --> 00:25:50,046
SPEAKER_0:  One day sit really hard and think about when you close your eyes, who do you see from your early life, right?

00:25:50,274 --> 00:25:51,166
SPEAKER_0:  And what did you learn?

00:25:51,682 --> 00:25:53,598
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe it's not that hard for you. I mean, it was.

00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  funny the things then?

00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  If I really looked at it, it's no surprise what I do today. And that hard work part.

00:26:02,466 --> 00:26:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  My great grandma.

00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:06,654
SPEAKER_0:  as you and I were comparing notes on Russia, right?

00:26:07,074 --> 00:26:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:26:08,194 --> 00:26:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  never spoke English, spoke Russian, came here to this country, was a cleaning person at the Wrigley building in Chicago.

00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,038
SPEAKER_0:  yet.

00:26:15,266 --> 00:26:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  if she hadn't saved every dime she made.

00:26:18,082 --> 00:26:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  my mother wouldn't have a home and wouldn't have had a car, right? What did I learn from that?

00:26:22,178 --> 00:26:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  hard work. In fact, actually, when I went to college, she's like, you know, you really should be on a farm. You're so big and strong. You know, that was her view.

00:26:30,082 --> 00:26:30,622
SPEAKER_0:  And then

00:26:30,946 --> 00:26:31,678
SPEAKER_0:  My grandmother.

00:26:32,802 --> 00:26:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  another tragic life. What did she do though? Think of how long, that's in the 40s, the 50s.

00:26:37,826 --> 00:26:38,942
SPEAKER_0:  she made lampshades.

00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  And she taught me.

00:26:41,122 --> 00:26:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  how to sew, right? So I could sew clothes when we couldn't afford them.

00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  But my memory of my grandma is...

00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  Working seven days a week, sewing lampshades.

00:26:51,522 --> 00:26:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  And then...

00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  Here comes my mom in her situation who...

00:26:54,754 --> 00:26:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  climbs her way out of it. So I associate that.

00:26:58,626 --> 00:27:01,022
SPEAKER_0:  with, well, strong women, by the way.

00:27:01,602 --> 00:27:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  All strong women.

00:27:02,946 --> 00:27:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  and I associate hard work.

00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:05,598
SPEAKER_0:  with

00:27:06,466 --> 00:27:09,054
SPEAKER_0:  how you are sure you can always take care of yourself.

00:27:09,634 --> 00:27:11,646
SPEAKER_0:  And so I think that the roots go way back there.

00:27:12,034 --> 00:27:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  and they were always teaching something, right? My great grandma was teaching me how to cook, how to work a farm even though I didn't need to be on a farm.

00:27:17,506 --> 00:27:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  My grandma taught me, you know, here's how to sew, here's how to run a business.

00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  And then my mother would teach us that.

00:27:23,682 --> 00:27:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  Look, but just a little bit of education. Look at the difference it could make, right? So anyways, that's a long answer too. I think that hard work thing is really.

00:27:31,874 --> 00:27:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  deeply rooted from that background.

00:27:33,922 --> 00:27:36,286
SPEAKER_1:  It gives you a way out from hard times.

00:27:36,386 --> 00:27:37,310
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, you know...

00:27:37,538 --> 00:27:39,902
SPEAKER_0:  I think I've seen you on other podcasts say...

00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:41,726
SPEAKER_0:  I thought I did.

00:27:42,146 --> 00:27:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  Do you want a Plan B?

00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  Didn't you say no you would not like a plan B?

00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:50,065
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I don't. Cause you're like, I would prefer my back up against, am I in

00:27:50,065 --> 00:27:51,102
SPEAKER_1:  You know, a story like that.

00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:56,254
SPEAKER_1:  You seem to have like at least certain moments in your life seem to.

00:27:56,706 --> 00:27:58,046
SPEAKER_1:  uh, do well.

00:27:58,594 --> 00:27:59,719
SPEAKER_1:  in desperate times.

00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:03,582
SPEAKER_0:  True enough. True enough that's true. I learned that very well.

00:28:04,034 --> 00:28:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  But...

00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:09,598
SPEAKER_0:  I also think that maybe this isn't the same kind of plan B. I think of it as...

00:28:10,082 --> 00:28:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  Like I was taught like.

00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,990
SPEAKER_0:  always be able to take care of yourself.

00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  don't have to rely on someone else.

00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,950
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that to me, so.

00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  that's my plan B, I can take care of myself. And it's even after what I lived through with my father.

00:28:24,098 --> 00:28:26,686
SPEAKER_0:  I felt, well, this set a bar for bad. After this.

00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  Nothing's bad.

00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,558
SPEAKER_0:  And that is a very freeing thought.

00:28:31,138 --> 00:28:32,766
SPEAKER_1:  being able to take care of yourself.

00:28:33,218 --> 00:28:37,054
SPEAKER_1:  Is that, you mean practically or do you mean just a self-belief that I'll figure it out?

00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,518
SPEAKER_0:  I'll figure it out and practically both, right?

00:28:40,194 --> 00:28:41,118
SPEAKER_1:  So you wrote...

00:28:41,442 --> 00:28:43,006
SPEAKER_1:  I vividly remember

00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:45,502
SPEAKER_1:  the last two weeks of my freshman year.

00:28:46,114 --> 00:28:48,222
SPEAKER_1:  when I only had 25 cents left.

00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:52,990
SPEAKER_1:  I put the quarter in a clear plastic box on my desk and just stared at it.

00:28:53,538 --> 00:28:55,678
SPEAKER_1:  This is it I thought, no more money.

00:28:57,218 --> 00:29:03,710
SPEAKER_1:  So do you think there's some aspect of that financial stress, even desperation, just being hungry?

00:29:04,162 --> 00:29:05,662
SPEAKER_1:  Does that play a role?

00:29:06,242 --> 00:29:10,325
SPEAKER_1:  in that drive that led to your success to be the CEO. You know what?

00:29:10,325 --> 00:29:15,518
SPEAKER_0:  of the great companies ever. It's a really interesting question because I was just talking to another colleague who's

00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  CEO of another great American company this weekend.

00:29:19,618 --> 00:29:20,862
SPEAKER_0:  He mentioned to me about...

00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:22,942
SPEAKER_0:  all this adversity and he said.

00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  I said to him, I said...

00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  Do you think?

00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:29,182
SPEAKER_0:  Part of your success is because you had bad stuff happen.

00:29:30,498 --> 00:29:31,006
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:29:31,298 --> 00:29:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  He said yes, you know?

00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  I guess I'll be-

00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  lying if I didn't say, I don't think you have to have tragedy.

00:29:39,682 --> 00:29:40,030
SPEAKER_0:  But.

00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  It does teach you like one really important thing is that there is always a way forward.

00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  always and it's in your control.

00:29:46,178 --> 00:29:50,910
SPEAKER_1:  I think there's probably wisdom for mentorship there, or with your parent or a mentor.

00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:55,326
SPEAKER_1:  that easy times don't result in growth.

00:29:55,682 --> 00:29:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I've heard a lot of my friends and they worry that some of my kids have never had bad times.

00:30:00,258 --> 00:30:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:30:01,474 --> 00:30:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  what happens here. So I don't know, is it required?

00:30:05,026 --> 00:30:06,494
SPEAKER_0:  and why you end up.

00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:09,374
SPEAKER_0:  Not required, but it sure didn't hurt.

00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:12,350
SPEAKER_1:  You had this good line about advice you were given.

00:30:12,674 --> 00:30:14,910
SPEAKER_1:  that growth and comfort never coexist.

00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:19,070
SPEAKER_1:  growth and comfort never coexist and you have to get used to that.

00:30:19,842 --> 00:30:31,070
SPEAKER_0:  if someone said that they think of me like one of the more profound sort of lessons I had, and the irony is, it's from my husband, which is even more funny actually.

00:30:31,234 --> 00:30:32,359
SPEAKER_1:  You could just steal it.

00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, you don't have to give him credit. I have shamelessly, as he'll tell you.

00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:39,422
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, so the story behind growth and comfort never coexist.

00:30:39,842 --> 00:30:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  But honestly...

00:30:41,794 --> 00:30:45,534
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's been a really freeing thought for me and it's helped me immensely since.

00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:47,390
SPEAKER_0:  mid-career.

00:30:48,418 --> 00:30:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  And um...

00:30:49,378 --> 00:30:51,838
SPEAKER_0:  As I write about it in the book, I'm mid-career.

00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:52,734
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:30:53,346 --> 00:31:01,502
SPEAKER_0:  I'd been running a pretty big business actually, and the fella I work for is gonna get a new job. He's gonna get promoted. He calls me and he says, hey, you're gonna get my job. I really want you to have it.

00:31:01,954 --> 00:31:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  And I said to him...

00:31:02,914 --> 00:31:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  No way.

00:31:04,322 --> 00:31:09,022
SPEAKER_0:  I said, I'm not ready for that job. I got a lot more things I gotta learn. That is like a huge job.

00:31:09,378 --> 00:31:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  around the world every product line development you name it every function i can't do it.

00:31:14,946 --> 00:31:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  It looked at me.

00:31:16,482 --> 00:31:16,830
SPEAKER_0:  He says.

00:31:17,282 --> 00:31:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  but I think you should go to the interview.

00:31:19,938 --> 00:31:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  I went to interview the next day.

00:31:21,954 --> 00:31:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  Buh-Buh-Bla!

00:31:23,042 --> 00:31:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  Guy says to me, he looks at me and he says, I want to offer you that job.

00:31:26,722 --> 00:31:27,262
SPEAKER_0:  And I said...

00:31:28,706 --> 00:31:29,630
SPEAKER_0:  I would like to think about it.

00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  I said, I wanna go home and talk to my husband about it.

00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  Kinda looked at me.

00:31:34,882 --> 00:31:35,262
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:36,670
SPEAKER_0:  I went home.

00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  My husband is sitting there and he says to me...

00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  I went on and on about the story, et cetera.

00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,078
SPEAKER_0:  And he says,

00:31:43,298 --> 00:31:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  Do you think a man would have answered it that way?

00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  And I said...

00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  He says, I know you.

00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:51,806
SPEAKER_0:  He's like, six months, you're gonna be bored.

00:31:52,322 --> 00:31:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:31:53,154 --> 00:31:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  all you can think of is what you don't know. And he said, I know these other people.

00:31:56,994 --> 00:31:59,710
SPEAKER_0:  You have way more skill than them and they think they could do it.

00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  And he's like, why?

00:32:02,882 --> 00:32:05,182
SPEAKER_0:  And for me, it internalizes feeling that.

00:32:06,786 --> 00:32:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  And I am gonna say something that's a bit stereotyped.

00:32:10,914 --> 00:32:14,046
SPEAKER_0:  It resonates with many, many women, and I'll ask you if it does after.

00:32:14,274 --> 00:32:17,310
SPEAKER_0:  is that either they're most harsh critic of themselves.

00:32:17,858 --> 00:32:21,758
SPEAKER_0:  And so this idea that I won't grow unless I can feel uncomfortable.

00:32:22,018 --> 00:32:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  Doesn't mean I always have to show it, by the way.

00:32:24,226 --> 00:32:27,486
SPEAKER_0:  So that's why I meant growth and comfort can never coexist. So.

00:32:28,034 --> 00:32:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  I got, I was like, he's exactly right. Now, the end of that story is I went in and I took the job.

00:32:33,154 --> 00:32:37,054
SPEAKER_0:  when I went back to the man who was really my mentor looking out for me and he

00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  He looked at me and he said...

00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:39,934
SPEAKER_0:  Don't ever do that again.

00:32:40,386 --> 00:32:41,598
SPEAKER_0:  And I said, I understand.

00:32:41,922 --> 00:32:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  because...

00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,534
SPEAKER_0:  It was okay to be uncomfortable. I didn't have to use it. I mean-

00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  Now I would take stock of the things I can do?

00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  Right? And really think, or I look for times to be uncomfortable.

00:32:53,602 --> 00:32:55,550
SPEAKER_0:  Because I know if I am nervous...

00:32:56,354 --> 00:33:05,022
SPEAKER_0:  Like, I don't know if you're nervous to meet me. We never met in real person. 100%. I'm still terrified. No, you're not. But then it means you're learning something, right? We're building it together.

00:33:05,282 --> 00:33:07,774
SPEAKER_0:  So that to me matters.

00:33:08,322 --> 00:33:14,590
SPEAKER_1:  I think it's interesting, maybe you could speak to that, the sort of self-critical thing inside your brain.

00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:15,582
SPEAKER_1:  is that I think.

00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  Sometimes...

00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:18,654
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,246
SPEAKER_1:  It's talked about that women have that.

00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,838
SPEAKER_1:  But I have that.

00:33:24,162 --> 00:33:34,366
SPEAKER_1:  Definitely. And I think that's not just solely property of women in the workplace. But I also want to sort of push back on the idea that that's a bad thing that you should silence because.

00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,414
SPEAKER_1:  I think that anxiety.

00:33:36,738 --> 00:33:43,935
SPEAKER_1:  that leads to growth also, that's like this discomfort. So there's this weird balance you have to have between that self-critical agent and common-

00:33:43,935 --> 00:33:46,185
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I think that's a good point.

00:33:46,185 --> 00:33:51,710
SPEAKER_1:  dance because if you're super confident people will value you higher that's important but if you're way too confident

00:33:52,034 --> 00:33:54,659
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe in the short term you'll gain, but in the long term you won't grow.

00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:59,774
SPEAKER_0:  Very good point. I can't really disagree with that. And to me, even when I took on jobs.

00:34:00,386 --> 00:34:02,014
SPEAKER_0:  I always felt people say, well, is it?

00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:07,838
SPEAKER_0:  you know, what point are you confident enough? And I came to sort of believe, again, the theme of my beliefs that-

00:34:08,578 --> 00:34:12,254
SPEAKER_0:  If I was willing to ask lots of questions and understood enough, that's all I needed to know.

00:34:14,722 --> 00:34:19,902
SPEAKER_1:  Let me ask you about your husband a little bit. Oh, is it? See, you write in the book. You write in the book. So he's just.

00:34:20,194 --> 00:34:23,569
SPEAKER_1:  Jumping around and like I said, I'm a bit of a romantic. So how did you meet?

00:34:23,569 --> 00:34:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  husband. So I met my husband when I was 19 years old, so I was a young kid.

00:34:28,546 --> 00:34:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  and I met him when I had a General Motors scholarship.

00:34:34,178 --> 00:34:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  So I was at Northwestern University through my first two years.

00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  had a lot of loans, financial aid.

00:34:40,194 --> 00:34:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  And a professor said, hey, you should sign up for this.

00:34:43,522 --> 00:34:44,062
SPEAKER_0:  Interview.

00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  They're looking to bring forward diverse candidates through their management track.

00:34:48,162 --> 00:34:50,110
SPEAKER_0:  Now these programs don't exist anymore like that.

00:34:50,466 --> 00:34:53,150
SPEAKER_0:  They will pay your tuition, your room and board, your expenses.

00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  Northwestern, other Ivy League schools, these very expensive schools.

00:34:57,282 --> 00:34:58,110
SPEAKER_0:  and um...

00:34:58,786 --> 00:34:59,614
SPEAKER_0:  I think you'd be a good fit.

00:35:00,546 --> 00:35:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  I am eternally thankful for that advice. When I interviewed, I actually got the scholarship.

00:35:05,058 --> 00:35:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, without it, I'd have graduated with hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt.

00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:09,854
SPEAKER_0:  Um, so?

00:35:10,114 --> 00:35:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  part of that was in the summer?

00:35:11,746 --> 00:35:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  I had to work in Detroit. I lived in a little room by a cement plant.

00:35:15,842 --> 00:35:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  not theirs, but I mean, that's all I could afford. It's very romantic. Very, very romantic. And the person who owned the house said, hey, I'm having a party, you're not invited, I'm going to fix you up with someone tonight. And that turned out to be my husband.

00:35:28,578 --> 00:35:31,335
SPEAKER_0:  And so it was a blind date is how we.

00:35:31,335 --> 00:35:35,422
SPEAKER_1:  very first. And then it was over. It was, the story was written. Yep.

00:35:35,746 --> 00:35:39,230
SPEAKER_1:  If it's okay, just zoom out to you mentioned.

00:35:39,746 --> 00:35:47,710
SPEAKER_1:  Power and good power a few times so if we can just even talk about it your book is called good power leading positive change in our lives work and world

00:35:48,642 --> 00:35:50,846
SPEAKER_1:  What is good power? What's the essence of good power?

00:35:51,042 --> 00:35:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  So

00:35:51,906 --> 00:35:53,502
SPEAKER_0:  the essence of it would be

00:35:54,178 --> 00:35:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  doing something hard or meaningful.

00:35:56,642 --> 00:35:57,982
SPEAKER_0:  but in a positive way.

00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,414
SPEAKER_0:  I would also tell you.

00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  I hope one day...

00:36:02,978 --> 00:36:04,734
SPEAKER_0:  I'm remembered for how I did things.

00:36:05,378 --> 00:36:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  Not just for what I did.

00:36:06,946 --> 00:36:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  I think that could almost be more important. I think it's a choice we can all make.

00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:14,206
SPEAKER_0:  So the essence to me of good power, if I had a contrast good to bad, let's say.

00:36:14,498 --> 00:36:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  would be that.

00:36:15,522 --> 00:36:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  First off...

00:36:17,602 --> 00:36:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  you have to embrace and navigate tension.

00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  This is the world we live in.

00:36:22,466 --> 00:36:22,942
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:36:23,394 --> 00:36:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  by embracing tension, not running from it?

00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,710
SPEAKER_0:  You would bridge divides?

00:36:28,098 --> 00:36:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  that unites people, not divides them.

00:36:30,018 --> 00:36:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  It's a hard thing to do, but you can do it.

00:36:32,258 --> 00:36:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  You do it with respect?

00:36:33,538 --> 00:36:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  which is the opposite of fear.

00:36:35,138 --> 00:36:37,150
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of people think the way to get things done is fear.

00:36:37,602 --> 00:36:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  And then the third thing would be.

00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  You gotta celebrate some progress?

00:36:42,306 --> 00:36:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  versus perfection.

00:36:44,098 --> 00:36:50,526
SPEAKER_0:  because I also think that's what stops a lot of things from happening because if you go for whatever your definition of perfect is.

00:36:50,818 --> 00:36:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  It can, it's either polarization.

00:36:53,026 --> 00:36:55,678
SPEAKER_0:  or paralyzation. I mean, something happens in there.

00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,694
SPEAKER_0:  versus no, no, no, I can.

00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:04,030
SPEAKER_0:  Don't worry about getting to that actual, exact endpoint. If I keep taking a step forward of progress,

00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  really tough stuff can get done.

00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:06,974
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

00:37:07,298 --> 00:37:13,310
SPEAKER_0:  My view of that is like, honestly, I hope it can, I said it's like a memoir with purpose, I'm only-

00:37:13,794 --> 00:37:18,814
SPEAKER_0:  It was a really hard thing for me to do because I don't actually talk about all these things and I had to...

00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  Nobody cares about your scientific description of this. They want the stories in your life to bring it alive.

00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:29,310
SPEAKER_0:  So it's a memoir with purpose. And in the writing of it, it became the power of me.

00:37:29,698 --> 00:37:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  the power of we and the power of us. the idea.

00:37:32,706 --> 00:37:34,270
SPEAKER_0:  You build a foundation when you're young.

00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,478
SPEAKER_0:  mostly from my work life.

00:37:36,706 --> 00:37:38,814
SPEAKER_0:  the power of we, which says.

00:37:39,618 --> 00:37:40,158
SPEAKER_0:  I kind of...

00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:41,822
SPEAKER_0:  in retrospect.

00:37:42,114 --> 00:37:45,246
SPEAKER_0:  could see five principles on how to really drive change.

00:37:45,794 --> 00:37:46,494
SPEAKER_0:  Um, that were

00:37:46,754 --> 00:37:47,774
SPEAKER_0:  be done in a good way.

00:37:48,354 --> 00:37:50,558
SPEAKER_0:  And then eventually you could scale that, the power.

00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  really of us.

00:37:52,386 --> 00:37:58,110
SPEAKER_0:  which is what I'm doing about finding better jobs for more people now that I co-chair an organization called 110.

00:37:58,434 --> 00:37:58,878
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:37:59,618 --> 00:38:00,670
SPEAKER_0:  Bad essence of...

00:38:01,762 --> 00:38:03,038
SPEAKER_0:  Navigate tensions.

00:38:03,426 --> 00:38:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  Do it respectfully. Celebrate progress.

00:38:06,914 --> 00:38:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,174
SPEAKER_0:  Give me, it tells me one more minute.

00:38:10,434 --> 00:38:10,846
SPEAKER_0:  Peace.

00:38:11,138 --> 00:38:19,390
SPEAKER_0:  sort of again, it's retrospect that I, I didn't know this in the moment. I had to learn it, I learned it. I am blessed by a lot of people I worked with and around and-

00:38:21,762 --> 00:38:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  but some of the principles, like the first one is.

00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  says.

00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:29,278
SPEAKER_0:  If you're going to do something, change something, do something.

00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  You gotta be in service of something.

00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  Being in service of is really different than serving.

00:38:36,418 --> 00:38:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  super different.

00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  And I just had my knee replaced.

00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  and I interviewed all these doctors.

00:38:43,394 --> 00:38:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  You can tell the difference of the guy who's gonna do a surgery, hey, my surgery's fine. I really don't care whether you can walk and do the stuff you wanted to do again, but because my surgery's fine. Your hardware is good.

00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:52,670
SPEAKER_0:  I actually had some trouble.

00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  And I had a doctor who was like, you know, this doesn't sound right. I'm coming to you.

00:38:57,954 --> 00:38:59,038
SPEAKER_0:  The surgery was fine.

00:38:59,554 --> 00:39:08,350
SPEAKER_0:  It was me that was reacting wrong to it, and he didn't care until I could walk again. Okay, there's a big difference in those two things, and it's true in any business you have.

00:39:08,898 --> 00:39:09,278
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:39:09,858 --> 00:39:11,102
SPEAKER_0:  a waiter serves you food.

00:39:11,394 --> 00:39:14,238
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, he served his food, he did his job. Or did he care he had a good time?

00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  That thought to be in service of it took me a while to get that, like to try to write it, to get that across because I think it's like so fundamental.

00:39:22,978 --> 00:39:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  If people were really in service of something.

00:39:25,858 --> 00:39:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  You gotta believe that if I fulfill your needs at the end of the day, mine will be fulfilled.

00:39:31,842 --> 00:39:33,214
SPEAKER_0:  And that is.

00:39:33,698 --> 00:39:35,582
SPEAKER_0:  that essence that makes it so different.

00:39:36,066 --> 00:39:38,942
SPEAKER_0:  And then the second part, second principle is about building belief.

00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  which is I gotta hope you'll voluntarily believe in a new future or in some alternate reality.

00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:47,582
SPEAKER_0:  and you will use your discretionary energy versus me ordering you.

00:39:48,738 --> 00:39:49,758
SPEAKER_0:  y'all get so much more done.

00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:53,502
SPEAKER_0:  Then the third, change in Endure. We kind of talked about that earlier.

00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  focus more on the how and the skills.

00:39:56,962 --> 00:39:59,294
SPEAKER_0:  and then the part on good tech and.

00:39:59,618 --> 00:40:00,510
SPEAKER_0:  being resilient.

00:40:01,154 --> 00:40:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:40:01,922 --> 00:40:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  Anyways, I just felt that...

00:40:04,258 --> 00:40:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  Like GoodTech, everybody's a tech company. I don't care what you do today.

00:40:07,778 --> 00:40:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  And there's some fundamental things you got to do. In fact, pick up today's any newspaper, right?

00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,230
SPEAKER_0:  chat GPT you're an AI guy.

00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  Alright?

00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:19,070
SPEAKER_0:  I believe one of the tenets of good tech is...

00:40:19,746 --> 00:40:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  it's like responsibility for the long term. It says, so if you're gonna invent something, you better look at its upside and its downside.

00:40:25,794 --> 00:40:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  like we did quantum computing.

00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:33,342
SPEAKER_0:  Great, lot of great stuff, right? Materials development, risk management calculations.

00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  Endless list one day.

00:40:35,842 --> 00:40:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  On the other side, it can break encryption.

00:40:37,506 --> 00:40:38,270
SPEAKER_0:  That's a bad thing.

00:40:38,914 --> 00:40:43,166
SPEAKER_0:  So we worked equally hard on all the algorithms that would sustain quantum.

00:40:44,098 --> 00:40:45,150
SPEAKER_0:  I think we're chat.

00:40:45,602 --> 00:40:46,494
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, great.

00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:50,782
SPEAKER_0:  there's equal in their people working on it, but like, okay.

00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:52,062
SPEAKER_0:  The things that say hey.

00:40:52,994 --> 00:40:55,454
SPEAKER_0:  I can tell this was written with that, right? Because20 people life at hughaway f س Dani Korsby

00:40:55,778 --> 00:40:57,886
SPEAKER_0:  the implications of how people learn, right?

00:40:58,274 --> 00:41:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  This is not a great thing if all it does is do your homework. That is not the idea of-

00:41:01,634 --> 00:41:07,259
SPEAKER_0:  homework as someone who liked to study so hard. But anyways, you get my point. It's just the upside and the downside.

00:41:07,259 --> 00:41:14,573
SPEAKER_1:  that there could be much larger implications that are much more difficult to predict and it's our responsibility to really work hard to...

00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  I was talking AI ethics a decade ago and I'm like, why won't anybody listen to us?

00:41:19,714 --> 00:41:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  It's...

00:41:20,642 --> 00:41:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  That's another one of those values things that you realize, hey, if I'm gonna bring technology in the world, I better bring it safely, right?

00:41:26,946 --> 00:41:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  And that to me comes with.

00:41:29,026 --> 00:41:35,134
SPEAKER_0:  When you're an older company that's been around, you realize that society gave you a license to operate and it can take it away.

00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  And we see that happen in companies.

00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  Therefore you're like, okay.

00:41:39,874 --> 00:41:44,574
SPEAKER_0:  Like why I feel so strong about skills. Hey, if I'm gonna bring in, it's gonna create all these new jobs.

00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  job dislocation, then I should help. I'm trying to help people get new skills.

00:41:48,866 --> 00:41:52,766
SPEAKER_0:  Anyways, that's a long answer to a good tech, but the idea that

00:41:53,026 --> 00:41:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  there's kind of in retrospect a set of principles you could look at

00:41:57,186 --> 00:42:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  and maybe learn something from my sort of rocky road through there.

00:42:01,922 --> 00:42:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  but it started with the power of we, and there's that.

00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:08,766
SPEAKER_1:  big leap, I think, that propagates to the things you're saying, which is the leap from

00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:13,694
SPEAKER_1:  focusing on yourself to the focusing on others, so that having that empathy. You've said.

00:42:14,306 --> 00:42:21,086
SPEAKER_1:  At some point in our lives and careers, our attention turns from ourselves to others. We still have our own goals, but we recognize that we have to work hard to achieve them.

00:42:21,346 --> 00:42:26,686
SPEAKER_1:  that our actions affect many, that it is impossible to achieve anything truly meaningful alone.

00:42:27,138 --> 00:42:27,774
SPEAKER_1:  So it's.

00:42:28,226 --> 00:42:29,342
SPEAKER_1:  To you, I think.

00:42:29,794 --> 00:42:31,198
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe you can correct me, but...

00:42:31,714 --> 00:42:33,278
SPEAKER_1:  ultimate good power is about.

00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:34,654
SPEAKER_1:  collaboration.

00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:36,894
SPEAKER_1:  maybe.

00:42:37,122 --> 00:42:37,502
SPEAKER_1:  And becomes a two two two two

00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:40,158
SPEAKER_1:  you know, in a large conference like delegation.

00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:42,046
SPEAKER_1:  on great teams.

00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:50,782
SPEAKER_0:  the ultimate good power is actually doing something for society. That would be my ultimate definition of good power by the way. Yeah. It would, but how it's done, right?

00:42:51,106 --> 00:42:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  the how it's done, and so.

00:42:53,218 --> 00:42:53,630
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:42:54,754 --> 00:42:55,198
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

00:42:55,842 --> 00:42:56,702
SPEAKER_0:  When you set a leap?

00:42:56,994 --> 00:43:00,254
SPEAKER_0:  Do you think people make a leap when they go from thinking about themselves to others?

00:43:00,738 --> 00:43:03,582
SPEAKER_0:  Do you think it's a leap or do you think it kind of just is a sort of slow?

00:43:04,098 --> 00:43:04,574
SPEAKER_0:  point.

00:43:04,706 --> 00:43:05,982
SPEAKER_1:  I think the leap is in...

00:43:06,306 --> 00:43:08,030
SPEAKER_1:  deciding that this is a...

00:43:08,354 --> 00:43:09,822
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, it's like deciding.

00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:11,294
SPEAKER_1:  that you will.

00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:16,318
SPEAKER_1:  care about others. This is like a leap of going to the gym for the first time.

00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:23,166
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, it takes a long time to develop that and to actually care, but that decision that I'm going to actually care about other human beings. Yeah.

00:43:23,394 --> 00:43:24,830
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. I think, or at least.

00:43:25,154 --> 00:43:27,966
SPEAKER_1:  Like, yeah, it just feels like a deliberate action.

00:43:28,354 --> 00:43:29,310
SPEAKER_1:  take of empathy.

00:43:29,442 --> 00:43:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, because sometimes I think it happens a little, it's maybe not as deliberate. Yeah, it's a little bit more gradual because it might happen because you realize that, geez, I can't get this done alone. So I gotta have other.

00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  people with me, but how do I get them to help me do something? So I think it does help happen a little bit more gradually. And as you get more confident, you start to not think so much that it's about you.

00:43:49,858 --> 00:43:55,070
SPEAKER_0:  and you start to think about this other thing you're trying to accomplish. And so that's why I felt it was a little more.

00:43:55,618 --> 00:43:56,382
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, gradual?

00:43:56,706 --> 00:43:59,198
SPEAKER_0:  I also felt like I can remember so well.

00:44:00,354 --> 00:44:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

00:44:03,042 --> 00:44:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  this idea that, again, now we're in the 80s.

00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  90s.

00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,862
SPEAKER_0:  I'm a woman, I'm in technology.

00:44:09,282 --> 00:44:09,854
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:44:10,274 --> 00:44:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  I was down in Australia at a conference.

00:44:13,378 --> 00:44:22,302
SPEAKER_0:  and I gave this great speech, again, meet power, you know, I'm thinking I give this great speech, financial services, this guy walks up to me after, I think he's gonna like ask me some great question.

00:44:22,722 --> 00:44:23,678
SPEAKER_0:  And he said to me,

00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  I wish my daughter could have been here.

00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:27,806
SPEAKER_0:  And in that moment...

00:44:29,282 --> 00:44:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  And at that point, up to then, I'd always been about, Look.

00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  Please don't notice I'm a woman. Do not notice that.

00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  I am, I just want to be recognized for my work.

00:44:38,466 --> 00:44:39,902
SPEAKER_0:  Crossing over from me to we.

00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  Like it or not, I was a role model for some number of people.

00:44:44,194 --> 00:44:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:47,678
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe I didn't want to be, but that didn't really matter.

00:44:48,354 --> 00:44:55,198
SPEAKER_0:  So I could either accept that and embrace it or not. I think it's a good example of that transition. I did have a little epiphany with that happening.

00:44:55,618 --> 00:44:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  And then I'm like, okay.

00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  Because I would always be like, no, I won't go on a women's conference. I won't talk here. You know, no, no, no.

00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  But then I sort of realized, wait a second.

00:45:04,514 --> 00:45:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  You know that old saying, you cannot be what you cannot see?

00:45:07,906 --> 00:45:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  I said myself, what?

00:45:10,722 --> 00:45:11,742
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, wait a second, okay.

00:45:12,578 --> 00:45:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  I am in these positions, I have a responsibility too.

00:45:15,298 --> 00:45:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  and it's to others.

00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:22,718
SPEAKER_0:  And that's what I meant. I felt like it can be somewhat gradual that you come and you may have these like pivotal moments that you see it.

00:45:23,074 --> 00:45:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  but then you feel it and you sort of move over that transom into the power.

00:45:28,194 --> 00:45:30,942
SPEAKER_1:  You're one of the most powerful tech leaders.

00:45:31,522 --> 00:45:31,998
SPEAKER_1:  ever.

00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:38,494
SPEAKER_1:  And as you mentioned the word power, the old saying goes power corrupts, absolutely power corrupts absolutely.

00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:41,630
SPEAKER_1:  Was there an aspect of power that was...

00:45:43,234 --> 00:45:44,190
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:45:44,802 --> 00:45:46,334
SPEAKER_1:  that you had to resist.

00:45:48,098 --> 00:45:51,326
SPEAKER_1:  its ability to corrupt your mind to...

00:45:52,194 --> 00:45:56,319
SPEAKER_1:  to sort of delude you into thinking you're smarter than you are that kind of all the way

00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,078
SPEAKER_0:  That's very dangerous, I agree with that.

00:45:58,562 --> 00:46:00,830
SPEAKER_0:  I think you gotta be careful who you surround yourself with.

00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:04,798
SPEAKER_0:  That's how I would answer that question, right? And people who will hold the mirror up to you?

00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:07,838
SPEAKER_0:  can be done in a very positive way, by the way. It doesn't mean, you know...

00:46:08,706 --> 00:46:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  that were sycophants, you cannot have that, right? I mean, it's like...

00:46:12,546 --> 00:46:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  I would say to someone like...

00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  Hey, listen to me, tell me what would make me better or do something or

00:46:18,338 --> 00:46:22,463
SPEAKER_0:  I have a husband that'll do that for me quite easily, by the way. He'll always tell me.

00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,213
SPEAKER_1:  I'm gonna cut that.

00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  I have I have been surrounded myself with a number of people that will do that and I think you have to have that I had a woman that worked with me for a very long time and one time we were competitors.

00:46:34,178 --> 00:46:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  and then at some point she started to work for me.

00:46:36,386 --> 00:46:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  and stayed with me for a creative way. And she was one of the few people that would tell me the truth. And sometimes I'm like enough already. And she'd be like, do not roll your eyes at this. And

00:46:46,498 --> 00:46:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  You absolutely have got to have that. And I think it also comes, it'll go back to my complete commitment to inclusion and diversity, because you gotta have that variety around you. You'll get a better product and a better answer at the end of the day.

00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  And so that.

00:47:00,386 --> 00:47:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  To resist that allure?

00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:06,462
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's around about who you surround yourself with. Current politics would say that too.

00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:10,814
SPEAKER_1:  So you write about, and in general, you value diversity a lot.

00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:14,430
SPEAKER_1:  Can you speak to almost like philosophically what is diversity mean?

00:47:15,842 --> 00:47:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  Diversity to me means.

00:47:18,018 --> 00:47:18,750
SPEAKER_0:  I'm gonna get.

00:47:19,202 --> 00:47:20,958
SPEAKER_0:  a better product, a better answer.

00:47:21,762 --> 00:47:23,262
SPEAKER_0:  I value different views.

00:47:23,714 --> 00:47:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  and so it's inclusion. So for everyone so

00:47:26,434 --> 00:47:29,438
SPEAKER_0:  I always say inclusion, diversity is a number, inclusion is a choice.

00:47:30,818 --> 00:47:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  and you can make that choice every single day.

00:47:33,602 --> 00:47:34,206
SPEAKER_0:  Good line.

00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:44,798
SPEAKER_0:  I really believe and I've witnessed it, that I've had, when my teams are diverse, I get a better answer. My friends are diverse, I have a better life. I mean, all these kinds of things and so...

00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:47:46,498 --> 00:47:52,638
SPEAKER_0:  I also believe it's like no silver thread, there's no easy way. You have to authentically believe it. I mean, do you authentically believe that?

00:47:53,378 --> 00:47:54,462
SPEAKER_0:  that diversity is a good thing.

00:47:55,074 --> 00:47:58,211
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, but I believe that diversity like broadly.

00:47:58,211 --> 00:48:00,461
SPEAKER_0:  I thought I very broadly define it. Any other questions, please feel free to post in comments at handle thread F definitely,

00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:01,470
SPEAKER_1:  like there's, you know.

00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:07,838
SPEAKER_1:  Sometimes the way diversity is used today is like surface level characteristics.

00:48:08,226 --> 00:48:15,230
SPEAKER_1:  which are also important, but they're usually reflective of something else, which is a diversity of background, a diversity of thought, a diversity of...

00:48:15,618 --> 00:48:16,254
SPEAKER_1:  struggle.

00:48:16,642 --> 00:48:18,878
SPEAKER_1:  awesome people that go up middle class.

00:48:19,106 --> 00:48:20,734
SPEAKER_1:  uh... versus poor

00:48:21,058 --> 00:48:24,670
SPEAKER_1:  different countries, different motivations, all of that. Yeah, it's beautiful.

00:48:24,994 --> 00:48:31,614
SPEAKER_1:  different people from very different walks of life get together, yeah, it's beautiful to see. Well, like sometimes it's very difficult to get.

00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,334
SPEAKER_1:  at that on a sheet of paper.

00:48:34,562 --> 00:48:37,187
SPEAKER_1:  of the characteristics that defines it.

00:48:37,187 --> 00:48:41,438
SPEAKER_0:  I know. So it is. It's just like, oh, I can't hire exactly for a roof. I'm trying to.

00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  in.

00:48:42,882 --> 00:48:51,507
SPEAKER_0:  But I do know one thing that when people say, well, I can't find these kinds of people I'm looking for, I'm like, you're just not looking in the right places. You have to open up, just- You gotta really open up new pools, right? And that's отношtense.

00:48:51,507 --> 00:48:56,839
SPEAKER_1:  You have to think, like everybody, you don't have to have a PhD, just like you said. Yeah. Yeah.

00:48:56,839 --> 00:48:59,839
SPEAKER_0:  I know it's very valuable, but you have, trust me.

00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:04,702
SPEAKER_1:  Just like you said, it could even be a negative. See, you mentioned, uh…

00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:06,590
SPEAKER_1:  Like for good power.

00:49:07,042 --> 00:49:10,718
SPEAKER_1:  You are a CEO, you were a CEO for a long time of a public company.

00:49:11,362 --> 00:49:14,142
SPEAKER_1:  were there times when there was pressure to sacrifice.

00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,510
SPEAKER_1:  What is good for the world?

00:49:17,346 --> 00:49:17,822
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:19,198
SPEAKER_1:  for the bottom line.

00:49:19,906 --> 00:49:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  in order to do what's good for the company. There were a lot of times for that. I mean, I think every company faces that today in that.

00:49:26,242 --> 00:49:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:49:27,394 --> 00:49:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  I always felt like there's so much discussion about stakeholder capitalism, right? Do you just serve a shareholder? I had a bass role playing you in trophies 뭐라고 하시면이고

00:49:33,858 --> 00:49:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  I have always found, and I've been very vocal about that topic, that...

00:49:37,794 --> 00:49:42,206
SPEAKER_0:  and I participated in the Business Roundtable, wrote up a new purpose statement that had multiple stakeholders.

00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's common sense. Like if you're going to be 100 years old.

00:49:46,114 --> 00:49:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  You only get there because you actually do at some time balance all these different stakeholders in what it is that you do, and short term, long term, all these trade offs.

00:49:55,138 --> 00:49:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  And I always say, people who write about it.

00:49:57,026 --> 00:49:59,742
SPEAKER_0:  They write about it black and white, but I have to live in a gray world.

00:50:00,034 --> 00:50:07,614
SPEAKER_0:  Nothing I've ever done has been in a black and white world, hardly. Maybe things of values that I had to answer. But most of it is gray. And so.

00:50:07,906 --> 00:50:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  I think back.

00:50:09,378 --> 00:50:11,166
SPEAKER_0:  lots of different decisions.

00:50:11,874 --> 00:50:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  I think back.

00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:22,206
SPEAKER_0:  which you would well remember you're a student of history. IBM was one of the really the originators of the semiconductor industry and certainly of commercializing the semiconductor industry.

00:50:22,626 --> 00:50:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  great R&D and manufacturing.

00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  but it is a game of volume.

00:50:27,074 --> 00:50:28,990
SPEAKER_0:  And so when I came on...

00:50:29,378 --> 00:50:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  We were still manufacturing R&D and manufacturing our own chips. We were losing a lot of money. Yet here we had to fight a war on cloud and AI.

00:50:38,626 --> 00:50:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

00:50:39,746 --> 00:50:42,494
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, now shareholders would say, fine, shut it down.

00:50:42,818 --> 00:50:50,846
SPEAKER_0:  okay, those chips also power some of the most important systems that power the banks of today. If I just shut it down, well, what would that do?

00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:51,902
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

00:50:52,354 --> 00:50:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, the answer wasn't just stop it.

00:50:55,138 --> 00:50:57,374
SPEAKER_0:  The answer wasn't just keep putting money into it.

00:50:57,986 --> 00:51:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  The answer was, and we had to kind of sit in an uncomfortable spot till we found a way. I mean, it's going to sound so basic.

00:51:04,482 --> 00:51:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  but you as an engineer understand it.

00:51:06,978 --> 00:51:16,798
SPEAKER_0:  we had to separate, it was a very integrated process of research, development, and manufacturing. And you'd also, you'd be perfecting things in manufacturing. And these were very high performance chips.

00:51:17,922 --> 00:51:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  we had to be able to separate those. We eventually found a way to do that so that we could.

00:51:22,146 --> 00:51:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:51:22,818 --> 00:51:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  take the manufacturing elsewhere and we would maintain the R&D. it's a week

00:51:27,426 --> 00:51:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  I think is a great example of the question you just asked because

00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  there was people would applaud it.

00:51:32,834 --> 00:51:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  others would have been, this is horrible.

00:51:35,138 --> 00:51:40,862
SPEAKER_0:  or we had a financial roadmap that had been put in place that said, I'll make this amount of money PS by this date.

00:51:41,218 --> 00:51:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  There came a time we couldn't honor it because we had to invest.

00:51:45,218 --> 00:51:45,950
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

00:51:46,306 --> 00:51:49,150
SPEAKER_0:  is a million of these decisions. I think most people of their.

00:51:49,442 --> 00:51:51,006
SPEAKER_0:  Run firms, any size firm.

00:51:51,938 --> 00:51:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  They're just one right after another like that. And you're always making that short and long.

00:51:56,098 --> 00:51:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  Attention.

00:51:56,962 --> 00:51:58,238
SPEAKER_0:  of what am I giving up?

00:51:58,786 --> 00:52:02,750
SPEAKER_1:  What is that partnership like with the clients because you work with gigantic businesses?

00:52:03,234 --> 00:52:04,926
SPEAKER_1:  And what's it like?

00:52:06,754 --> 00:52:07,934
SPEAKER_1:  sort of a...

00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:13,246
SPEAKER_1:  really forming a great relationship with them, understanding what their needs are, being in service of their.

00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of, yeah.

00:52:15,362 --> 00:52:15,934
SPEAKER_0:  Very simple.

00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:17,694
SPEAKER_0:  honor your promises.

00:52:19,138 --> 00:52:20,254
SPEAKER_0:  And that happens over time.

00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  I mean.

00:52:21,826 --> 00:52:22,686
SPEAKER_0:  In service of...

00:52:23,234 --> 00:52:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  which is often why you can work with competitors, because if you are really in service of you and you need something, it takes two of us to do it.

00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  that becomes easier to do because I really, we both care you get what you needed.

00:52:34,658 --> 00:52:35,326
SPEAKER_0:  And so...

00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:36,990
SPEAKER_0:  I can remember.

00:52:38,018 --> 00:52:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  during one of the times I was on a European trip.

00:52:40,098 --> 00:52:40,606
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:52:41,442 --> 00:52:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  at the time lauded in, and this is still true.

00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  about.

00:52:45,186 --> 00:52:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  views about technology and national technology giants and global ones and the pros and the cons and countries want their own national champions, quite obvious. I mean, if I'm France or Germany.

00:52:55,426 --> 00:52:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  And, um...

00:52:56,290 --> 00:53:00,030
SPEAKER_0:  There was a lot of discussion about security and data and who was getting access to what.

00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  and I can remember being in one of the, I was with Chancellor Merkel.

00:53:04,162 --> 00:53:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  I had met her many times. She was very well prepared, very well prepared every time.

00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:09,374
SPEAKER_0:  you would know.

00:53:09,602 --> 00:53:10,046
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:53:10,946 --> 00:53:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  I started explaining all these things about why, how...

00:53:13,474 --> 00:53:13,822
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:19,646
SPEAKER_0:  how we don't share data, who it belongs to. Our system's never had back doors, and she sort of stopped me.

00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:22,878
SPEAKER_0:  Like you're one of the good guys. Like stop.

00:53:24,386 --> 00:53:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  But that wasn't about me personally.

00:53:25,826 --> 00:53:30,622
SPEAKER_0:  She's talking about a company that's acted consistent with values for decades, right?

00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:31,198
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:53:31,426 --> 00:53:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  to me how you work with those big kind of clients.

00:53:34,754 --> 00:53:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  is you honor your promises, you say what you do and you do what you say.

00:53:39,298 --> 00:53:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  and you act with values over a long period of time. And that to me, people say we're valued, it is not a fluffy thing. It is not a fluffy thing. It is a-

00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:53,182
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, if I was starting a company now, I'd spend a lot of time on that.

00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:53:55,234 --> 00:54:00,382
SPEAKER_0:  you know, why we do what we do and why some things are tolerable and something, I wish your fundamental beliefs are.

00:54:00,706 --> 00:54:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  And many people sort of zoom past that stage, right?

00:54:04,386 --> 00:54:05,310
SPEAKER_0:  It's okay for a while.

00:54:05,474 --> 00:54:07,134
SPEAKER_1:  And never sacrifice that.

00:54:07,842 --> 00:54:09,342
SPEAKER_0:  You would never sacrifice that.

00:54:09,762 --> 00:54:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think you can.

00:54:10,786 --> 00:54:16,222
SPEAKER_1:  So there was a lot of pressure when you took over as CEO and there was 22 consecutive quarters.

00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:20,222
SPEAKER_1:  of revenue decline between 2012 and the summer of 2017.

00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:22,718
SPEAKER_1:  So it was a stressful time, maybe not, maybe you can.

00:54:23,362 --> 00:54:24,574
SPEAKER_1:  Correct me on that so

00:54:25,186 --> 00:54:32,350
SPEAKER_1:  As a CEO, what was it like going through that time? The decisions, the tensions in terms of investing versus...

00:54:32,642 --> 00:54:34,014
SPEAKER_1:  making a profit.

00:54:35,202 --> 00:54:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  I always felt that.

00:54:36,674 --> 00:54:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  that sense of urgency.

00:54:38,146 --> 00:54:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  was so high, even if I was calm on the outside.

00:54:41,154 --> 00:54:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  because...

00:54:42,146 --> 00:54:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  You- you have.

00:54:44,194 --> 00:54:51,454
SPEAKER_0:  one of the world's largest pensions. So, so many people depend on you. You have a huge workforce, they're depending on you. You have clients whose businesses don't run. If you don't.

00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:52,478
SPEAKER_0:  perform.

00:54:52,866 --> 00:54:53,406
SPEAKER_0:  Etc.

00:54:53,762 --> 00:54:55,294
SPEAKER_0:  And shareholders, of course, right?

00:54:55,618 --> 00:54:56,254
SPEAKER_0:  And so...

00:54:57,282 --> 00:54:58,398
SPEAKER_0:  But I also...

00:54:58,626 --> 00:54:58,974
SPEAKER_0:  and-

00:54:59,714 --> 00:55:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  really clear this was perhaps the largest reinvention IBM ever had to undertake. Yes. I understood that.

00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:09,374
SPEAKER_0:  In fact, some of the headlines were like, this is existential.

00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, nobody gives you a right to exist forever.

00:55:12,322 --> 00:55:17,022
SPEAKER_0:  in their many techs you're the student of it they are gone they are all gone

00:55:17,602 --> 00:55:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  And so if we didn't reinvent ourselves...

00:55:20,354 --> 00:55:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  we were going to be extinct.

00:55:21,826 --> 00:55:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

00:55:23,842 --> 00:55:24,254
SPEAKER_0:  Now.

00:55:24,578 --> 00:55:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  and it's like changing, what's that old saying? Can I change?

00:55:28,834 --> 00:55:35,966
SPEAKER_0:  the wheels while the train's running or something like that or the engines while the plane's flying. And that's what you have to do. And that took time. And so.

00:55:36,386 --> 00:55:39,646
SPEAKER_0:  You know, Lex, do I wish it would have been faster? Absolutely.

00:55:39,938 --> 00:55:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  But.

00:55:41,218 --> 00:55:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  the team worked so hard in that timeframe.

00:55:44,578 --> 00:55:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  50% of the portfolio was changed.

00:55:46,978 --> 00:55:48,222
SPEAKER_0:  It's a very large company.

00:55:48,674 --> 00:55:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:55:49,922 --> 00:55:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:55:51,138 --> 00:55:52,990
SPEAKER_0:  if you would also divest it.

00:55:53,442 --> 00:56:02,494
SPEAKER_0:  billion of businesses. So if you would look at that growth rate without divestitures and currency, which now today everyone talks about currency, back then we were the only international guy.

00:56:03,138 --> 00:56:03,550
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:56:03,874 --> 00:56:05,694
SPEAKER_0:  Net of divestitures in currency.

00:56:05,954 --> 00:56:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  the growth was flat.

00:56:07,554 --> 00:56:08,542
SPEAKER_0:  Flat grate? No?

00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  But flat for a big transformation?

00:56:11,298 --> 00:56:12,990
SPEAKER_0:  I was really proud of the team for what they did.

00:56:13,378 --> 00:56:14,206
SPEAKER_0:  That is actually.

00:56:14,434 --> 00:56:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  pretty miraculous to have made it through that.

00:56:17,186 --> 00:56:21,182
SPEAKER_0:  I have my little nephew one day and he would see on TV occasionally when there would be criticism.

00:56:21,474 --> 00:56:23,166
SPEAKER_0:  And you'd say, you know, anti-dysent?

00:56:23,618 --> 00:56:26,174
SPEAKER_0:  Does that make you mad when they talk mean? Yeah.

00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  And I just looked at him and I said...

00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:29,726
SPEAKER_0:  He's like, how do you feel? I said, look-

00:56:30,242 --> 00:56:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  I'm doing what has to be done.

00:56:32,546 --> 00:56:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  and I happen to be the one there.

00:56:35,074 --> 00:56:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  And if you have great conviction.

00:56:37,474 --> 00:56:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  And I did.

00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  A great conviction, I knew it was the right thing.

00:56:41,154 --> 00:56:44,542
SPEAKER_0:  I knew it would be needed for IBM to live its second century.

00:56:44,994 --> 00:56:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  And so, and my successor, they have picked up, gone for it. I mean...

00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:49,342
SPEAKER_0:  You go back.

00:56:49,794 --> 00:56:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  we did the acquisition of Red Hat. I mean, we had to find our way on cloud, right? We were late to it.

00:56:54,658 --> 00:56:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  So we had to find our way.

00:56:56,322 --> 00:56:57,982
SPEAKER_0:  and eventually that led us to hybrid cloud.

00:56:59,106 --> 00:57:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  We did a lot of work with Red Hat back in 2017. Oh, we'd always done a lot of work with them. Actually, we were one of the first investors when they were first formed.

00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:06,622
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:57:07,042 --> 00:57:07,358
SPEAKER_0:  But.

00:57:07,938 --> 00:57:09,150
SPEAKER_0:  That was 2018.

00:57:09,538 --> 00:57:14,366
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we took quite a hit for even, you know, oh, it was the largest to then software acquisition ever.

00:57:14,882 --> 00:57:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  But it is...

00:57:16,482 --> 00:57:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  foundation of what is our hybrid cloud play today and doing very, very well.

00:57:21,378 --> 00:57:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:27,198
SPEAKER_0:  But I had to take a short-term hit for that, right? Short-term hit for a very large $34 billion acquisition.

00:57:27,682 --> 00:57:30,366
SPEAKER_0:  But for all of us, it was the right thing to do.

00:57:30,722 --> 00:57:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:57:31,394 --> 00:57:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  I think when you get really centered on, you know what's the right thing to do.

00:57:34,434 --> 00:57:35,559
SPEAKER_0:  You just keep going, right?

00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:39,309
SPEAKER_1:  So the team had the vision, they had the belief in everything else, the criticism.

00:57:39,309 --> 00:57:43,614
SPEAKER_0:  So don't we didn't always have exactly the right, you know, this wasn't a straight arrow, but

00:57:44,546 --> 00:57:50,142
SPEAKER_0:  Stay down, you know you're right, keep going. Okay, made a mistake. You know, there's no bad mistake as long as you learn from it, right?

00:57:50,562 --> 00:57:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  and keep moving. So yes, did it take longer, but we are the largest that was there.

00:57:54,658 --> 00:57:57,918
SPEAKER_1:  Could you maybe just on a small tangent educate me a little bit so?

00:57:58,242 --> 00:58:02,878
SPEAKER_1:  Red Hat originally is Linux open source distribution of Linux, but it's also consulting.

00:58:03,842 --> 00:58:09,886
SPEAKER_0:  It's a little bit of consulting, but it's mostly software district. It's mostly Linux. It was mostly software. Yeah, absolutely.

00:58:10,306 --> 00:58:16,606
SPEAKER_1:  Absolutely. So, but today IBM is very much this, you know, most IT services.

00:58:16,866 --> 00:58:18,078
SPEAKER_1:  And the world is done.

00:58:18,306 --> 00:58:22,398
SPEAKER_1:  but IBM, there's so many varied, so basically if you have

00:58:22,626 --> 00:58:25,918
SPEAKER_1:  issues, problems to solve in business.

00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:28,926
SPEAKER_1:  in the software space IBM can help.

00:58:29,154 --> 00:58:32,030
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, and so in that my last year.

00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  Our services business, we broke it into two pieces and one piece was spun off into a company called Kindle, which is managed outsourcing.

00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:58:40,674 --> 00:58:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  keeping things running.

00:58:41,986 --> 00:58:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  and they're off creating their own company.

00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:47,902
SPEAKER_0:  What IBM then retained is really the part I built with PWCC.

00:58:48,482 --> 00:58:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  big consulting arm.

00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  And so today, the IBM of today in 2023 is.

00:58:53,314 --> 00:58:55,166
SPEAKER_0:  you know, or at least ending 2022.

00:58:55,394 --> 00:58:58,974
SPEAKER_0:  was 30% consulting and the other 70% would be.

00:58:59,362 --> 00:59:01,342
SPEAKER_0:  What would you consider software cloud AI?

00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  So hybrid cloud and AI is the other. And some hardware, obviously. Still, the mainframe is modernized, alive, and kicking.

00:59:08,674 --> 00:59:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  and still running.

00:59:09,986 --> 00:59:11,326
SPEAKER_0:  some of the most important things.

00:59:12,194 --> 00:59:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  every bank you can think of practically in the world.

00:59:15,394 --> 00:59:16,126
SPEAKER_0:  And so...

00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  BAT

00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:17,950
SPEAKER_0:  is

00:59:18,274 --> 00:59:22,238
SPEAKER_0:  the IBM of today versus perhaps in Red Hat.

00:59:22,498 --> 00:59:25,726
SPEAKER_0:  is a big piece and an important part of that software portfolio.

00:59:26,082 --> 00:59:33,022
SPEAKER_0:  And they had some services with them for implementation, but it wasn't a very large part. And it's grown by leaps and bounds.

00:59:33,314 --> 00:59:34,462
SPEAKER_0:  You know, because originally...

00:59:34,978 --> 00:59:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  The belief was everything was going to go to the public cloud.

00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:38,302
SPEAKER_0:  and at least

00:59:39,074 --> 00:59:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  many people thought that way.

00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  We didn't, in fact, we tried. We procured a public cloud company. We really tried to work it, but what we found was a lot of the mission critical work.

00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:50,462
SPEAKER_0:  EW

00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  It was tuned for consumer world. It wasn't tuned for the enterprise.

00:59:54,146 --> 00:59:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:59:55,394 --> 00:59:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  Then, time is elapsing here though.

00:59:57,858 --> 00:59:59,070
SPEAKER_0:  and you gotta be upscale.

00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:04,574
SPEAKER_0:  and we didn't have any application. Remember, we're not an application company. So it wasn't like we had.

01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:05,758
SPEAKER_0:  an office.

01:00:06,018 --> 01:00:08,926
SPEAKER_0:  We didn't have anything that pulled things out to the cloud.

01:00:09,474 --> 01:00:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  And so as we look for what our.

01:00:11,138 --> 01:00:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  but we really back to who you are, we really know mission critical work.

01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:23,294
SPEAKER_0:  We know where it lives today, and we know how to make it live on the cloud, which led us down hybrid cloud. You know, that belief that the real world would turn into.

01:00:23,586 --> 01:00:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  There'll be things, aren't?

01:00:24,802 --> 01:00:27,550
SPEAKER_0:  traditional that'll you'll never move because it doesn't make sense

01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  There'll be private clouds for...

01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:37,854
SPEAKER_0:  have all the benefit of the cloud, but they just don't have infinite expansion, and then they'll be public clouds, and you're gonna have to connect them and be secure.

01:00:38,338 --> 01:00:40,963
SPEAKER_0:  And that's what took us down the path with Red Hat, I'll explain how many stones we need here.

01:00:40,963 --> 01:00:49,213
SPEAKER_1:  The structure of that is fundamentally different than something that's consumer facing. So the lesson you learn there is you can't just reuse something that's optimized for

01:00:49,213 --> 01:00:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, very interesting point. Doesn't mean consumer companies can't move up in the enterprise, because obviously they have, right?

01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  but I think it's very hard to take something from the enterprise.

01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,078
SPEAKER_0:  and come on down.

01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  because it's got to be simple, consumable, all the things we talked about already.

01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:04,117
SPEAKER_1:  Plus you have to have the relationships with enterprise.

01:01:04,117 --> 01:01:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, very different. Yeah, I mean, you know our history, right? One time we had the PC business.

01:01:08,834 --> 01:01:09,406
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  You know the short answer to why would we would not do that is it's a consumer facing business. We were good at the enterprise and that consumer business a.

01:01:17,346 --> 01:01:19,742
SPEAKER_0:  highly competitive, gotta be low cost.

01:01:20,194 --> 01:01:24,990
SPEAKER_0:  all the things that are not the same muscles necessarily of being in an innovation driven

01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  You know, uh...

01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:28,135
SPEAKER_0:  technology business.

01:01:28,135 --> 01:01:32,990
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, but what is now Lenovo, I guess that's what's been told. That's right, Lenovo acquired it. Extremely good at

01:01:33,506 --> 01:01:33,854
SPEAKER_1:  that.

01:01:34,242 --> 01:01:34,622
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:01:35,042 --> 01:01:38,417
SPEAKER_1:  but not as good as you're saying is that an enterprise there's not

01:01:38,417 --> 01:01:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  Lenovo is very good at their PC world, yes, but I wouldn't, and they can sell into the enterprise, right? But you as a consumer can go buy a Lenovo too.

01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  So look in China, right? Look in other places, so.

01:01:48,866 --> 01:02:00,318
SPEAKER_0:  That's what I mean by consumer, you know, an end device. And that was a big decision because it would have been one of the last things that had our logo on it that sits in your hands, right? So when a new generation says, well, what does IBM do, right? Was that a difficult decision?

01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  Do you remember?

01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:05,406
SPEAKER_0:  This was a long time ago now, it was like 2005. So ______

01:02:06,146 --> 01:02:09,054
SPEAKER_0:  They're all difficult because it's not only things, it's people.

01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:02:10,402 --> 01:02:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  But it's back to knowing.

01:02:11,778 --> 01:02:13,310
SPEAKER_0:  who you are is how I would.

01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  sum that up as, right?

01:02:15,618 --> 01:02:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  And we were never.

01:02:16,994 --> 01:02:22,078
SPEAKER_0:  great at making a lot of money at that. And you can remember if it was originally IBM PC, it was in the IBM clones.

01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  or you even called IBM clones back then.

01:02:25,122 --> 01:02:27,582
SPEAKER_0:  as the field became highly, highly.

01:02:27,906 --> 01:02:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  and as things commoditized...

01:02:30,562 --> 01:02:32,286
SPEAKER_0:  we often as they commoditize.

01:02:32,642 --> 01:02:33,758
SPEAKER_0:  we would move them out.

01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:35,902
SPEAKER_0:  and move on to the next innovation level.

01:02:37,058 --> 01:02:41,973
SPEAKER_1:  But because of that, it's not as public facing. That's right. That's absolutely right.

01:02:41,973 --> 01:02:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  logos ever. Yeah, isn't it true? That is very true. That is.

01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,414
SPEAKER_0:  actually a very important point and that is

01:02:49,026 --> 01:02:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  you know, branding, as you say, one of the most recognizable and a very highly ranked brand strength around the world.

01:02:55,394 --> 01:02:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  And so...

01:02:57,986 --> 01:02:58,718
SPEAKER_0:  That's a trade off.

01:02:58,946 --> 01:03:00,030
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I can't, you know.

01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  because there was a time you'd have something of IBM in your home or a cash register, as an example. You'd walk into a store. Actually, they're still in places. That went to Toshiba. So, I'm going to go ahead and close this one. I'm going to go ahead and close this one.

01:03:10,594 --> 01:03:14,750
SPEAKER_1:  Can you speak to consulting a little bit? What does that entail to train up to hire?

01:03:15,138 --> 01:03:16,222
SPEAKER_1:  a workforce that can.

01:03:16,578 --> 01:03:19,838
SPEAKER_1:  be of service to all kinds of different problems in the software space.

01:03:20,066 --> 01:03:22,558
SPEAKER_1:  in a tech space. What's entailed in that?

01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:25,534
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, you have to value a different set of things, right?

01:03:25,954 --> 01:03:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  And so...

01:03:27,490 --> 01:03:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  You've got to always stay ahead. It's about hiring people who are willing to learn.

01:03:31,746 --> 01:03:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  It is about...

01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:34,526
SPEAKER_0:  At the same time...

01:03:35,906 --> 01:03:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  in my view.

01:03:37,538 --> 01:03:39,678
SPEAKER_0:  it's what really drives you to be customer-centric.

01:03:39,842 --> 01:03:41,214
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe you can educate me.

01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:44,190
SPEAKER_1:  I think consulting is a kind of...

01:03:44,866 --> 01:03:45,854
SPEAKER_1:  You roll in.

01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:49,310
SPEAKER_1:  and you try to solve problems that businesses have.

01:03:49,762 --> 01:03:54,238
SPEAKER_1:  Like with expertise, right? Okay. Is that the process of consulting? Somewhere?

01:03:54,466 --> 01:03:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  Right, so there, that, okay, so fair enough.

01:03:56,674 --> 01:03:59,102
SPEAKER_0:  When you say that we're consulting, it's a really broad spectrum.

01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:02,494
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I think people could be sitting here thinking it does any, it could be.

01:04:02,722 --> 01:04:08,894
SPEAKER_0:  I just give advice and I leave, to all the way to I run your systems, right? And I think it's generally.

01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  people use the word to cover everything in that space. So.

01:04:13,378 --> 01:04:15,390
SPEAKER_0:  we sort of fit in the spot, which is.

01:04:15,842 --> 01:04:26,526
SPEAKER_0:  we would come in and live at that intersection of business and technology. So yeah, we could give you recommendations and then we'd implement them and see them through because we had the technology to go to the implementation and see them through. And at the time back then.

01:04:26,754 --> 01:04:27,710
SPEAKER_0:  That's what, you know.

01:04:28,034 --> 01:04:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  there'd been five of those that had failed, the companies that bought other consulting firms.

01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:35,934
SPEAKER_0:  So we were, okay, that was the great thing about, I mean.

01:04:36,322 --> 01:04:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  The harrowing thing about it was here, please go work on this. None of the others have ever succeeded before. And yet on the other hand, the great promise was you could really, clients were dying at that time when we were doing that to get more value out of their technology and have it really change the way the business worked. So I think of it as how to improve business and apply technology and see it all the way through. That's what we do today still.

01:04:57,218 --> 01:04:58,942
SPEAKER_1:  The seed all the way through. Yes.

01:04:59,298 --> 01:05:06,526
SPEAKER_1:  So let me say almost like a personal question. So that was a big thing you were a part of that you led in 2002.

01:05:06,786 --> 01:05:11,966
SPEAKER_1:  that you championed and helped, I should say, negotiate the purchase of one day, the consulting arm.

01:05:12,258 --> 01:05:12,670
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:05:13,058 --> 01:05:14,622
SPEAKER_1:  of PricewaterhouseCoopers.

01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:17,054
SPEAKER_1:  for $3.5 billion.

01:05:17,378 --> 01:05:19,838
SPEAKER_1:  So what were some of the challenges of that Do you remember?

01:05:20,674 --> 01:05:21,662
SPEAKER_1:  personal and

01:05:22,786 --> 01:05:23,358
SPEAKER_1:  business.

01:05:24,098 --> 01:05:28,734
SPEAKER_0:  At that time, PW really had to divest. And so they were-

01:05:28,994 --> 01:05:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  in parallel going to IPO, right? So we...

01:05:31,618 --> 01:05:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  sort of swept in at that point and said, and we'd been thinking about it a long time and.

01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  started to work on that as an acquisition.

01:05:38,594 --> 01:05:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  you know, kind of balancing which way would they go, IPO or acquisition. And so the challenges are obvious and part of it's.

01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  why they went with us as an acquisition.

01:05:46,722 --> 01:05:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  Big difference to be a private firm than a public firm.

01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:55,358
SPEAKER_0:  I can remember one of the guys, you know, he asked somebody, how long you been with IBM? And the person answered 143 quarters.

01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, that's a little enlightening about a business model, right?

01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  So we had the challenges of.

01:06:01,698 --> 01:06:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  Being private versus public.

01:06:03,586 --> 01:06:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  You have the challenge of when you acquire something like that, as I say, you acquire hearts, not parts.

01:06:08,386 --> 01:06:08,766
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:15,038
SPEAKER_0:  They could leave. I mean, you could destroy your value by them leaving. They can walk right out the door. I mean, yes, you can put.

01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  you know, lots of restraints, but still.

01:06:18,018 --> 01:06:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  that you have there and then we had to really build a new business model.

01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  that people and clients would.

01:06:23,714 --> 01:06:26,110
SPEAKER_0:  you know, see as valuable and be willing to pay for.

01:06:26,434 --> 01:06:34,558
SPEAKER_0:  And so we had to do something that lived at that intersection and say that how this was unique is what we were doing. So you had the people aspect.

01:06:34,946 --> 01:06:38,142
SPEAKER_0:  you had that they were gonna be private and they had, or public and they had.

01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  always been private their whole life. And then you had the business model. So it made sense.

01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  and the others it all failed.

01:06:45,090 --> 01:06:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  that had tried to do this.

01:06:46,594 --> 01:06:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:47,966
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it was a-

01:06:48,450 --> 01:06:50,078
SPEAKER_0:  It was a tough thing to do.

01:06:50,562 --> 01:06:55,902
SPEAKER_1:  What about the personal side of that? That was a big leap step up for you. You've been at IBM for a long time.

01:06:56,386 --> 01:06:56,830
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:06:57,250 --> 01:07:00,222
SPEAKER_1:  This is a big sort of leadership.

01:07:00,962 --> 01:07:04,670
SPEAKER_1:  like very impactful large scale.

01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:07,230
SPEAKER_1:  leadership decisions. What was that like?

01:07:07,874 --> 01:07:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:07:09,282 --> 01:07:13,854
SPEAKER_0:  You know, unlike in my career earlier where I said I was changing jobs, I said I wasn't comfortable, etc.

01:07:14,082 --> 01:07:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  So now here, fast forward.

01:07:15,650 --> 01:07:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  10 years.

01:07:16,514 --> 01:07:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  and I'm like, okay.

01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  Honestly, how I felt inside, on one hand, I did what I learned, like inventory, which you know how to do.

01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  You have some good strengths.

01:07:25,858 --> 01:07:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  that could work here.

01:07:27,522 --> 01:07:28,542
SPEAKER_0:  The other part of me said...

01:07:29,122 --> 01:07:30,462
SPEAKER_0:  Boy, this is really high profile.

01:07:31,042 --> 01:07:31,646
SPEAKER_0:  and I felt.

01:07:32,226 --> 01:07:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  And I can remember saying to someone, like, this is gonna kill me?

01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:36,830
SPEAKER_0:  or catapult.

01:07:37,058 --> 01:07:38,933
SPEAKER_0:  Probably nothing in between.

01:07:38,933 --> 01:07:41,183
SPEAKER_1:  And that wasn't terrifying to those okay.

01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  you're okay with that kind of pressure. I'm okay with that because I felt...

01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  I knew enough.

01:07:45,346 --> 01:07:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  You know, like these things I had, and I'll tell you that one thing I felt I knew the best.

01:07:49,890 --> 01:07:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:07:53,282 --> 01:07:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  consultants.

01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  of any

01:07:55,842 --> 01:07:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  worth their weight.

01:07:57,346 --> 01:08:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  they really do care that they deliver for an end client.

01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  And I-

01:08:02,594 --> 01:08:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  I felt I understood service to a client so well, that what it meant to really provide value.

01:08:07,906 --> 01:08:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  So I knew we would have like.

01:08:09,314 --> 01:08:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  something that I knew the PwC people more than anything wanted to deliver value to those clients they had.

01:08:15,746 --> 01:08:19,230
SPEAKER_0:  next to then developing their people. Those were like the really two things.

01:08:19,778 --> 01:08:21,630
SPEAKER_0:  and that I couldn't, I also knew they felt.

01:08:21,922 --> 01:08:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  they could do better if they had more technology. And we did, so there really was a reason, you know, that I could really believe in. So I authentically believed back to that point, and I also...

01:08:31,394 --> 01:08:34,654
SPEAKER_0:  felt I had built some of those skills to be able to do that.

01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  But.

01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  I wouldn't call it terrifying.

01:08:38,658 --> 01:08:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  But make no mistake, like s-

01:08:41,346 --> 01:08:43,582
SPEAKER_0:  It was very hard.

01:08:43,906 --> 01:08:46,014
SPEAKER_0:  it turned out to be extremely successful.

01:08:46,338 --> 01:08:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  By the time we ended, it was worth 19 and a half, by the time I stepped, I ran it for...

01:08:50,786 --> 01:08:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, goodness gracious. Quite a long time. I'm gonna say seven or eight, nine years. and

01:08:56,450 --> 01:09:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  over 19 and a half billion dollars. It made 2.7 billion in profit. It was very consequential to IBM.

01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  The fact that it was consequential is also very, I mean, there was a time as we moved through it, I can even remember it.

01:09:11,202 --> 01:09:11,614
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:09:12,034 --> 01:09:16,926
SPEAKER_0:  We just weren't meeting the goals as fast as we should. And some of it was clients were like, oh, now you're IBM.

01:09:17,346 --> 01:09:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  So, I mean, some things I knew would happen, but they happen so much faster. It'd be things like clients would say, oh, IBM cares about a quarter, so let's negotiate every quarter on these prices. Can't wait to do more!

01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:37,982
SPEAKER_0:  when they were private, they didn't have these issues. Well, that had an impact on margins really fast. And so that ability- So you picked up a lot of challenges. You pick them up right away and-

01:09:38,370 --> 01:09:39,678
SPEAKER_0:  And I thought, oh boy.

01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, if I don't get this turned around, this is really a problem.

01:09:43,618 --> 01:09:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  And the team learned a lot of lessons. I mean, I learned.

01:09:46,114 --> 01:09:48,510
SPEAKER_0:  people I had to move out, that I learned that when people...

01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:50,366
SPEAKER_0:  don't believe they can do something?

01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  they probably won't do it.

01:09:52,514 --> 01:09:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:09:53,474 --> 01:09:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  We wanted to run the business at a certain level. I really did have some great leaders, but-

01:09:57,954 --> 01:10:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  and they didn't really believe it could do that. And I finally had to come to terms with, if you don't really believe in something, you really aren't gonna probably make it happen at the end of the day. And.

01:10:05,826 --> 01:10:06,270
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:08,574
SPEAKER_0:  We would change that. We would have to-

01:10:08,962 --> 01:10:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  actually get some more help to help us on doing so. And then it turned, and I can remember the day that we started.

01:10:15,202 --> 01:10:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  really getting the business to hum and start to.

01:10:17,826 --> 01:10:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  is almost like

01:10:18,786 --> 01:10:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  Finally!

01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  I gave the team this little plaque, this little, kind of corny paperweight thing.

01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  and um

01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  I'm gonna believe it, remember it was Thomas Edison.

01:10:28,994 --> 01:10:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  And he said, many of life's greatest.

01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  failures.

01:10:33,154 --> 01:10:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  are people who gave up right before they were going to be successful.

01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:37,310
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:39,102
SPEAKER_0:  And it's so true.

01:10:39,554 --> 01:10:40,030
SPEAKER_0:  I mean...

01:10:40,546 --> 01:10:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  There was also a governor of Texas.

01:10:42,786 --> 01:10:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  This is who's-

01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:48,254
SPEAKER_0:  but she had said someone said what's the secret of your success and she said it's passion

01:10:48,610 --> 01:10:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  and perseverance when everyone else would have given up.

01:10:51,426 --> 01:10:54,718
SPEAKER_0:  And I feel that's what that taught me. That taught me like...

01:10:55,042 --> 01:11:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  No, no matter how bad this gets, you are not giving up. Now you can't keep doing the same thing, like the, you know, doctor, this hurts, oh, then stop doing it. You can't keep doing the same thing.

01:11:04,738 --> 01:11:07,710
SPEAKER_0:  we had to keep changing till we found our right way.

01:11:08,098 --> 01:11:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  to get the model to work right and...

01:11:11,138 --> 01:11:11,742
SPEAKER_0:  Client work.

01:11:12,002 --> 01:11:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  We never, never had an issue and kept so many of the people. And now we are 25 years almost later.

01:11:18,594 --> 01:11:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  and a number of them.

01:11:20,578 --> 01:11:22,878
SPEAKER_0:  run parts of the IBM business still today, so.

01:11:23,298 --> 01:11:27,486
SPEAKER_0:  It's that old Maya Angelou saying when you said, what do I remember?

01:11:28,130 --> 01:11:39,710
SPEAKER_0:  They'll say, you won't remember the specifics of this, but you'll remember how you felt. And that's kind of how I feel. And I think they do too. The whole team does of that. Like I'll get anniversary notes still on that.

01:11:40,098 --> 01:11:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  when you've been through something like that and you bring it all togetheré with people.

01:11:42,626 --> 01:11:45,726
SPEAKER_1:  So during the acquisition, the way you knew the people...

01:11:46,754 --> 01:11:54,366
SPEAKER_1:  It's the right team are the ones that could believe that this, this consulting can grow, can integrate with IBM and all of that.

01:11:54,466 --> 01:11:57,758
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I was lucky. Look, I did things that helped that. I mean, I knew that-

01:11:58,114 --> 01:12:02,878
SPEAKER_0:  People joining us would feel more comfortable if they had people leading it that they recognized, etc.

01:12:03,138 --> 01:12:03,870
SPEAKER_0:  But, um...

01:12:04,834 --> 01:12:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  Again, I learned those that didn't then, I eventually had to take some action out, but PWCC had a lot of really dedicated leaders to it.

01:12:13,826 --> 01:12:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  I give them a lot of credit.

01:12:15,746 --> 01:12:18,270
SPEAKER_1:  Well, it's amazing to see a thing that kind of start at that.

01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:22,910
SPEAKER_1:  that very stressful time and then it turns out to be a success. Yeah.

01:12:23,138 --> 01:12:28,798
SPEAKER_1:  That's just beautiful to see. So what about the acquisition itself? Is there something interesting to say about the?

01:12:29,122 --> 01:12:29,438
SPEAKER_1:  Like.

01:12:29,794 --> 01:12:33,310
SPEAKER_1:  where you learn about maybe negotiation, because there's a lot of money involved too.

01:12:33,666 --> 01:12:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  To me it was a win-win.

01:12:36,066 --> 01:12:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:12:36,802 --> 01:12:40,702
SPEAKER_0:  we both actually cared that customers got value. So there was this like third thing.

01:12:40,962 --> 01:12:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  that had a benefit.

01:12:42,114 --> 01:12:44,478
SPEAKER_0:  Not them, not a- there was this third thing.

01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:47,751
SPEAKER_0:  And then next to that. I like how you think that. That.

01:12:47,751 --> 01:12:53,895
SPEAKER_1:  People would have the wisdom of what it takes to have great negotiation. But yeah, so it's a win-win is one of the ways you can have.

01:12:53,895 --> 01:13:00,958
SPEAKER_0:  of success. But it's like obvious to even say that, right? I mean, if you can, back to being in service of something, we were both in service of clients. So.

01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  In and then.

01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:04,350
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I always say...

01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:06,846
SPEAKER_0:  when you have a negotiation with someone.

01:13:07,842 --> 01:13:10,430
SPEAKER_0:  Um, okay, both parties always kind of walk away a little bit.

01:13:11,202 --> 01:13:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, that's good. If they both walk away going, can I should have got a little bit more. Okay, but it's okay, I might as well get. Okay, they're both a little fussy.

01:13:17,922 --> 01:13:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  When one walks away and thinks they did great and the other one did horrible, they usually is like born bad.

01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, because...

01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  They never worked that way. I've always felt that way with negotiations that

01:13:29,634 --> 01:13:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  You push too far down, you will re- you-

01:13:32,098 --> 01:13:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  Usually.

01:13:33,346 --> 01:13:33,918
SPEAKER_0:  We'll...

01:13:34,306 --> 01:13:36,181
SPEAKER_0:  be sorry you did that, you know?

01:13:36,181 --> 01:13:39,934
SPEAKER_1:  Don't push too far. I mean, that's ultimately what collaboration and empathy.

01:13:40,162 --> 01:13:41,246
SPEAKER_1:  Means, as you-

01:13:41,762 --> 01:13:45,887
SPEAKER_1:  You're interested in long-term success of everybody together versus like you're short.

01:13:45,887 --> 01:13:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  And then you get the discretionary energy from him versus like, okay, you screwed me here, I'm done, right?

01:13:51,874 --> 01:13:54,558
SPEAKER_1:  So let's even rewind even back.

01:13:54,658 --> 01:13:59,533
SPEAKER_0:  Oh no. Do you feel like this is a nostalgia interview?

01:13:59,533 --> 01:14:07,619
SPEAKER_1:  Let me just ask the romantic question. What did you love most about engineering computer science electrical engineering? So in those early days from your degree to the to the

01:14:07,619 --> 01:14:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  the early work at it. I love that logic part of it, right? And you do get a sense of completion at some point when you reach certain milestones that, you know, like, yes, it worked or yes.

01:14:17,538 --> 01:14:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

01:14:18,434 --> 01:14:23,006
SPEAKER_0:  that finite answer to that. So that's what I loved about it. I loved the problem solving of it.

01:14:23,394 --> 01:14:27,742
SPEAKER_1:  What led you down that path with competing in general? What made you fall in love with?

01:14:28,066 --> 01:14:29,598
SPEAKER_1:  with computing with engineering.

01:14:30,562 --> 01:14:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  It's probably that back to that desire, wanting to know how things work, right? And so that's like a natural thing, you know, math, I loved math for that reason. I always wanted to study how did that, you know.

01:14:40,002 --> 01:14:41,918
SPEAKER_0:  how did it get that to work kind of thing.

01:14:42,338 --> 01:14:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  So it goes back in that time. But I did start when I went to when I started Northwestern. I was already in the engineering school, but my first thought was to be a doctor, that that was far more noble.

01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:52,638
SPEAKER_0:  that I should be a medical doctor.

01:14:52,930 --> 01:15:11,721
SPEAKER_0:  until I could not pass human reproduction as a course. And I thought the irony that I could not, I'm like, I got all these colored pencils, I got all these pictures, this is not working out for me. I'm gonna stick to math. It was the only course in my four year college education I had to take pass fail. Otherwise I risked impairing my grade point.

01:15:11,721 --> 01:15:18,686
SPEAKER_1:  Engineering it is. But after about 10 years you jumped from the technical road of systems engineer to.

01:15:19,298 --> 01:15:21,054
SPEAKER_1:  management a leadership role.

01:15:21,538 --> 01:15:26,718
SPEAKER_1:  Did you miss at that time the technical direct contribution versus being a leader, a manager?

01:15:27,266 --> 01:15:35,902
SPEAKER_0:  That's an interesting point. Like I said, I've always been sort of a doer leader, you know? So. So you never lost the race then? I never really did. It's really nice to have an idea in front of people.

01:15:36,226 --> 01:15:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  you know, and I think this is really important for today.

01:15:39,458 --> 01:15:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  The best way people learn is experientially.

01:15:41,762 --> 01:15:46,334
SPEAKER_0:  I think. Now you may, that's being a generalization because there are people can learn all different ways, right?

01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:47,582
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:15:48,002 --> 01:15:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  I've done things like with my whole team.

01:15:50,626 --> 01:15:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  they all had to learn how to build cloud applications.

01:15:54,178 --> 01:15:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  called it code off. And so

01:15:56,258 --> 01:15:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

01:15:57,058 --> 01:15:58,078
SPEAKER_0:  I don't care what your job is.

01:15:58,690 --> 01:15:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  Write code.

01:15:59,522 --> 01:16:00,926
SPEAKER_0:  you know, and uh...

01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  I remember when we were trying to get the company to understand AI.

01:16:04,386 --> 01:16:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  We did something called a cognitive jam. Okay.

01:16:06,914 --> 01:16:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  There's a reason we picked the word cognitive, by the way, instead of AI. Today we use the word AI.

01:16:12,002 --> 01:16:14,334
SPEAKER_0:  It was really symbolic. It was to mean.

01:16:15,426 --> 01:16:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  This is to help you think, not replace your thinking. There was so much in the zeitgeist about AI being a bad thing at that time.

01:16:22,146 --> 01:16:31,614
SPEAKER_0:  So that was why we picked a mouth full of a word like cognitive. And it was like, no, no, this is to help you actually. So do what you do better or do something you haven't yet learned.

01:16:31,938 --> 01:16:33,342
SPEAKER_0:  and we did something called.

01:16:33,602 --> 01:16:37,470
SPEAKER_0:  the cognitive jam, but the whole point was everybody in the company could volunteer, get on a team.

01:16:37,698 --> 01:16:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  You either had to build something that improved to one of our products or did something for a client or did a social issue with AI.

01:16:46,082 --> 01:16:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:16:47,042 --> 01:16:48,446
SPEAKER_0:  Again, this goes back now.

01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  Ten years?

01:16:50,754 --> 01:16:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:16:51,586 --> 01:16:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  People did things from bullying applications to railroad stuff to whatever it was.

01:16:56,642 --> 01:16:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  but it got like.

01:16:58,146 --> 01:17:02,718
SPEAKER_0:  100,000 people to understand, you know, viscerally what is AI. So.

01:17:03,042 --> 01:17:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  That's a long answer to my belief around...

01:17:05,122 --> 01:17:06,942
SPEAKER_0:  experiential, so do you ever give it up?

01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think so, because I actually think that's pretty good to get your hands dirty in something. I can't do it.

01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:16,693
SPEAKER_0:  you know, depending what you're doing, your effort to do that will be less, but. haha

01:17:16,693 --> 01:17:19,693
SPEAKER_1:  CEO you try to always get your hands

01:17:19,693 --> 01:17:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  chat GPT, I've played, I mean, still, I'm not saying I'm any good at any of it anymore, but. But to build up intuition. But it's that, yeah, it's that really understand, right? And not be afraid of. Yeah.

01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:39,902
SPEAKER_1:  Like we mentioned at the beginning, IBM research has helped catalyze some of the biggest accomplishments in computing and artificial intelligence history.

01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:41,854
SPEAKER_1:  So, uh, D blue.

01:17:42,626 --> 01:17:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  IBM D-Blue vs. Kasparov chess match in 96 and 97.

01:17:47,714 --> 01:17:51,742
SPEAKER_1:  Just to ask kind of like what your perception is, what your memory is of it.

01:17:52,162 --> 01:17:53,758
SPEAKER_1:  What is that moment?

01:17:53,986 --> 01:17:59,070
SPEAKER_1:  Like this seminal moment, I believe probably one of the greatest moments in AI history when the machine first...

01:17:59,490 --> 01:18:00,766
SPEAKER_1:  beat a human at a-

01:18:01,154 --> 01:18:02,206
SPEAKER_1:  Think they're humans.

01:18:02,626 --> 01:18:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  You make a very interesting point, because it is like one of the first demonstrations of using a game to like bring something to people's consciousness, right? And to this day, people use games, right, to demonstrate different things.

01:18:14,466 --> 01:18:14,814
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:18:15,234 --> 01:18:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  But at the time...

01:18:17,698 --> 01:18:18,142
SPEAKER_0:  funny.

01:18:18,658 --> 01:18:21,214
SPEAKER_0:  And didn't I think of it so much as AI and I'll tell you why.

01:18:21,922 --> 01:18:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  I was, and I'm not a chess player, you might be a chess player, so I'm not expert at it.

01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  I think I understand properly of chess that chess has got a finite number of moves that can be made.

01:18:31,682 --> 01:18:32,798
SPEAKER_0:  Therefore, if it's finite...

01:18:33,378 --> 01:18:39,166
SPEAKER_0:  really what's a demonstration of a supercomputing, right? It's about the amount of time and how fast it can crunch through to find the right.

01:18:39,394 --> 01:18:39,902
SPEAKER_0:  move.

01:18:40,162 --> 01:18:43,806
SPEAKER_0:  So in some ways I thought of it as almost a bigger demonstration of that.

01:18:44,418 --> 01:18:51,358
SPEAKER_0:  But it is absolutely, as you said, it was a motivator, one of the big milestones of AI because it put in your consciousness that it's man.

01:18:52,002 --> 01:18:53,214
SPEAKER_0:  in this other-

01:18:53,442 --> 01:18:55,317
SPEAKER_0:  machine, right? Yeah.

01:18:55,317 --> 01:18:58,910
SPEAKER_1:  So you saw this is just a challenge of competition problem and this is a way to

01:18:59,138 --> 01:19:01,763
SPEAKER_1:  demonstrate hardware and software computation at his best.

01:19:01,763 --> 01:19:02,974
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, I did.

01:19:03,106 --> 01:19:05,342
SPEAKER_1:  But the thing is, there is a romantic notion.

01:19:05,762 --> 01:19:10,654
SPEAKER_1:  that chess is the embodiment of human intellect, I mean, intelligence.

01:19:10,946 --> 01:19:15,006
SPEAKER_1:  that you can't build a machine that can beat a chess champion in chess and the

01:19:15,426 --> 01:19:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  The fact that- See, and I was blessed by not being a chess expert, so I wasn't like- So it's just a computation problem. It's a computation problem to me.

01:19:21,410 --> 01:19:23,390
SPEAKER_1:  Well that's probably required to...

01:19:23,938 --> 01:19:27,038
SPEAKER_1:  not be paralyzed by the immensity of the task.

01:19:27,490 --> 01:19:29,438
SPEAKER_1:  so that this is just solvable.

01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:30,494
SPEAKER_1:  But it was a very m-

01:19:30,786 --> 01:19:35,230
SPEAKER_1:  very, I think that was a powerful moment. So speaking just as an AI person, that was a.

01:19:36,738 --> 01:19:37,278
SPEAKER_1:  that.

01:19:37,538 --> 01:19:39,413
SPEAKER_1:  reinvigorated the dream.

01:19:39,413 --> 01:19:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  You were a little kid back then though, right? Did that end in 95? You have to be like, were you-

01:19:44,354 --> 01:19:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  You remember it actually at the moment? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What did you think at the moment about it?

01:19:49,826 --> 01:19:50,430
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:19:52,482 --> 01:19:53,246
SPEAKER_1:  It was...

01:19:54,402 --> 01:19:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  awe-inspiring because especially sort of growing up in the Soviet Union.

01:20:00,418 --> 01:20:02,814
SPEAKER_1:  you think especially of a good character's prowl.

01:20:03,234 --> 01:20:03,998
SPEAKER_1:  and chess.

01:20:04,482 --> 01:20:09,982
SPEAKER_1:  Like your intuition is weak about those things. I didn't see it as computation. I thought of it as a

01:20:11,010 --> 01:20:12,574
SPEAKER_1:  intelligence because

01:20:13,282 --> 01:20:18,078
SPEAKER_1:  Chess for a human being doesn't feel like computation. It feels like...

01:20:18,498 --> 01:20:18,910
SPEAKER_1:  some

01:20:19,234 --> 01:20:20,190
SPEAKER_1:  complicated.

01:20:20,546 --> 01:20:24,190
SPEAKER_1:  relationship between memory and patterns and intuition.

01:20:24,738 --> 01:20:27,742
SPEAKER_1:  and guts and instinct and all of those.

01:20:27,842 --> 01:20:30,467
SPEAKER_0:  If you watch someone play, that's what you would conclude, right?

01:20:30,467 --> 01:20:32,702
SPEAKER_1:  And so to see a machine be able to.

01:20:33,122 --> 01:20:37,662
SPEAKER_1:  uh... be a human i mean you get a little bit of that with chat gpt now is like

01:20:38,178 --> 01:20:39,998
SPEAKER_1:  Language was to us humans.

01:20:40,322 --> 01:20:41,758
SPEAKER_1:  the thing that we kind of.

01:20:42,466 --> 01:20:49,118
SPEAKER_1:  Surely the poetry of language is something only humans can really have. It's going to be very difficult.

01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:51,422
SPEAKER_1:  to replicate the magic of

01:20:52,066 --> 01:20:55,038
SPEAKER_1:  a natural language without deeply understanding language.

01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:57,214
SPEAKER_1:  but it seems like Chad GPT.

01:20:57,538 --> 01:21:02,334
SPEAKER_1:  is can do some incredible things with language.

01:21:02,946 --> 01:21:04,190
SPEAKER_1:  and natural language dialogue.

01:21:05,186 --> 01:21:07,358
SPEAKER_1:  But that was the first moment in AI.

01:21:07,682 --> 01:21:10,878
SPEAKER_1:  They're all the AI Winters from the 60s, the promise of the

01:21:11,106 --> 01:21:14,430
SPEAKER_1:  It was, wow, this is possible for...

01:21:15,554 --> 01:21:17,726
SPEAKER_1:  for a simple set of algorithms.

01:21:18,114 --> 01:21:27,358
SPEAKER_1:  to accomplish something that we think of as intelligence. So that was truly inspiring that maybe intelligence, maybe the human mind is just algorithms. That was the thought at the time.

01:21:27,874 --> 01:21:30,750
SPEAKER_1:  And of course now, the funny thing what happens...

01:21:31,234 --> 01:21:35,358
SPEAKER_1:  is the moment you accomplish it, everyone says, I was just brute force algorithms, it's silly.

01:21:36,546 --> 01:21:42,366
SPEAKER_1:  And this continues at every single time you pass a benchmark, a threshold to win a game.

01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:47,262
SPEAKER_1:  People say, oh, well, it's just this. It's just this. It's just this. and that

01:21:48,002 --> 01:21:48,542
SPEAKER_1:  I think that's.

01:21:48,866 --> 01:21:50,814
SPEAKER_1:  funny and there is going to be a moment when

01:21:51,426 --> 01:21:54,878
SPEAKER_1:  We're going to have to contend with AI systems that.

01:21:55,746 --> 01:21:56,350
SPEAKER_1:  Exhibit

01:21:56,610 --> 01:21:57,342
SPEAKER_1:  human-like.

01:21:57,794 --> 01:21:59,806
SPEAKER_1:  emotions and feelings and you have to

01:22:00,098 --> 01:22:01,246
SPEAKER_1:  start to have some.

01:22:01,922 --> 01:22:03,230
SPEAKER_1:  difficult discussions about.

01:22:03,522 --> 01:22:05,534
SPEAKER_1:  Well, how do we treat those beings?

01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:12,894
SPEAKER_1:  What role do they have in society? What are the rules around that? Yeah, and this is really exciting because that also puts a mirror to ourselves.

01:22:13,218 --> 01:22:14,686
SPEAKER_1:  to see, okay, what's the right.

01:22:15,554 --> 01:22:19,679
SPEAKER_1:  way to treat each other as human beings, because it's a good test for that.

01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  is cuz

01:22:20,450 --> 01:22:22,078
SPEAKER_0:  I always say it's a um.

01:22:22,498 --> 01:22:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  reflection of humanity.

01:22:24,130 --> 01:22:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's taught by what man, you know, bad stuff in the past, you'll teach it bad stuff for the future, which is why...

01:22:30,530 --> 01:22:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  I think, you know, like efforts to regulate it.

01:22:33,026 --> 01:22:35,550
SPEAKER_0:  are a fool's errand, you need to regulate uses, not-

01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  you know, because it's not the technology itself that's not inherently good or bad.

01:22:39,586 --> 01:22:41,086
SPEAKER_0:  but how it's used or taught.

01:22:41,538 --> 01:22:43,166
SPEAKER_0:  can be good or bad for sure, right?

01:22:43,586 --> 01:22:44,574
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

01:22:44,962 --> 01:22:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  That's to me will unveil now a whole different way of having to look at technology.

01:22:49,730 --> 01:22:54,430
SPEAKER_1:  What about another magical leap with the early days of Watson with beating the jeopardy challenge?

01:22:54,754 --> 01:22:58,129
SPEAKER_1:  What was your experience like with Watson? What's your vision for Watson in general?

01:22:58,129 --> 01:23:03,966
SPEAKER_0:  And it was really inspired by first chess, right? Kasparov and then you come forward in time.

01:23:04,194 --> 01:23:04,702
SPEAKER_0:  N

01:23:05,090 --> 01:23:07,390
SPEAKER_0:  you know, I think what Watson did.

01:23:08,034 --> 01:23:09,406
SPEAKER_0:  because you used a really important word.

01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:14,014
SPEAKER_0:  AI had kind of waxed and waned in these winters, right? In and out, in and out.

01:23:14,434 --> 01:23:17,342
SPEAKER_0:  popular not more money less money you know in and out

01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  Confidence, no confidence.

01:23:18,978 --> 01:23:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

01:23:20,130 --> 01:23:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  I think that was one of the first times it brought to the forefront of

01:23:23,746 --> 01:23:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  People like, whoa.

01:23:25,122 --> 01:23:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  like it humanized it. Because here it is playing against these two gentlemen.

01:23:29,666 --> 01:23:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  as you did lose it first, you know, and then finally, finally won at the end of the day.

01:23:35,330 --> 01:23:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  And but what it was doing is making you say.

01:23:38,306 --> 01:23:43,422
SPEAKER_0:  A, natural language, it's actually understanding natural language. It's one of the first demonstrations of natural language support.

01:23:43,746 --> 01:23:47,038
SPEAKER_0:  and a bit of reasoning over lots of data, right?

01:23:47,394 --> 01:23:48,190
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

01:23:48,546 --> 01:23:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  Bet.

01:23:49,186 --> 01:23:52,030
SPEAKER_0:  it could have access to a lot of things, come up with a conclusion on it.

01:23:52,546 --> 01:23:57,406
SPEAKER_0:  And to me that was a really big moment. And I do think it brought to the conscious of the public.

01:23:57,794 --> 01:24:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  And in good ways and bad, because it probably set expectations very high of like, whoa, what this could be.

01:24:02,978 --> 01:24:04,574
SPEAKER_0:  But, and I still do believe.

01:24:04,930 --> 01:24:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  that it has got the ability.

01:24:07,074 --> 01:24:07,774
SPEAKER_0:  to change.

01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  and help us man.

01:24:10,594 --> 01:24:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  make better decisions, that so many decisions are not optimal in this world.

01:24:14,882 --> 01:24:16,574
SPEAKER_0:  you know, even medical decisions.

01:24:16,962 --> 01:24:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  It's right or wrong what took us down a path.

01:24:19,170 --> 01:24:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  of healthcare first with our AI.

01:24:21,538 --> 01:24:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  And we took many pivots and I think there's a really valuable lesson in what we learned.

01:24:26,402 --> 01:24:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  One is that...

01:24:27,714 --> 01:24:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  I actually don't think the challenges are the technology.

01:24:29,826 --> 01:24:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, those are challenges.

01:24:31,074 --> 01:24:31,870
SPEAKER_0:  the townses.

01:24:32,162 --> 01:24:35,262
SPEAKER_0:  are the people challenges around this, right? So....

01:24:35,586 --> 01:24:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  Do people trust it?

01:24:37,250 --> 01:24:38,078
SPEAKER_0:  How will they use it?

01:24:38,754 --> 01:24:39,102
SPEAKER_0:  I mean.

01:24:39,618 --> 01:24:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  I saw that.

01:24:41,314 --> 01:24:41,982
SPEAKER_0:  straight up.

01:24:42,242 --> 01:24:43,710
SPEAKER_0:  with doctors and like.

01:24:43,938 --> 01:24:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  Meaning.

01:24:44,610 --> 01:24:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  They're so busy in the way they've been taught to do something.

01:24:48,130 --> 01:24:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  Do they really have time to learn another way?

01:24:50,018 --> 01:24:53,630
SPEAKER_0:  I saw it was a mistake when you put it on top of processes, it didn't change, kind of like.

01:24:53,986 --> 01:24:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  paving a cow path.

01:24:55,266 --> 01:24:57,118
SPEAKER_0:  Didn't work. I mean it was all

01:24:57,474 --> 01:25:01,758
SPEAKER_0:  human change management around it that really its biggest challenge is.

01:25:02,178 --> 01:25:06,078
SPEAKER_0:  And another valuable lesson we picked back to usage, if you think of IBM as moonshaps,

01:25:06,498 --> 01:25:08,766
SPEAKER_0:  We picked really hard problems to start with.

01:25:09,314 --> 01:25:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  I think you see a lot of technology now starts with really simple problems.

01:25:13,090 --> 01:25:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  in.

01:25:13,826 --> 01:25:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  And by that, it probably starts to build trust because I start little. It's like, oh, I'm not ready to outsource my diagnosis to you, but I'll get some information here about a test question. So very different thinking.

01:25:25,602 --> 01:25:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of things to learn, we were making a market at the time.

01:25:28,770 --> 01:25:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  And when you make a market...

01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:34,654
SPEAKER_0:  you know, choice of problem you work on gets to be very important. When you're catching up.

01:25:34,914 --> 01:25:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  Well, then it's a scale game. So very different thing. And so.

01:25:38,690 --> 01:25:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  But what's improved, I think, I mean, I hope I'm not being too-

01:25:42,818 --> 01:25:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:25:44,418 --> 01:25:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  I think Watson brought AI back out of winter.

01:25:47,202 --> 01:25:47,742
SPEAKER_0:  for the world.

01:25:47,970 --> 01:25:52,510
SPEAKER_0:  And that since then, there's just been one company after another and innovations and people working on it.

01:25:52,834 --> 01:25:53,470
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:25:53,986 --> 01:25:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  I have no regrets of anything that we did. We learned so much. I mean, we probably rebuilt it.

01:25:57,794 --> 01:26:00,414
SPEAKER_0:  many times over, it made it more modular.

01:26:01,026 --> 01:26:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  And today, TyBM.

01:26:03,042 --> 01:26:08,862
SPEAKER_0:  Watson is more about AI inside of a lot of things if you think of it that way, which is more like an ingredient

01:26:09,218 --> 01:26:13,854
SPEAKER_0:  versus it's a thing in and of itself. And I think that's how it'll bring its real value, more as an ingredient.

01:26:14,402 --> 01:26:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  and it's so badly needed, and even back then the issue was.

01:26:17,282 --> 01:26:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  So much data, like what do you ever do with it? You can't get through it, you can't use it for anything. And you know this well, it's your profession.

01:26:22,914 --> 01:26:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:26:23,746 --> 01:26:24,094
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:26:25,474 --> 01:26:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  We have to have it, so that's gonna propel it forward.

01:26:28,354 --> 01:26:33,979
SPEAKER_1:  So it's part of the suite of tools that you use when you go to enterprise and you try to solve. Yeah, so-

01:26:33,979 --> 01:26:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  AI for security, AI in automated operations, AI in your robotics, AI on your factory floor, you know what I mean? It's all part of. And I think.

01:26:42,946 --> 01:26:47,646
SPEAKER_0:  And that's why even to this day, thousands, I mean, thousands and thousands of clients of IBM still have.

01:26:48,034 --> 01:26:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  the Watson components that it's the AI being used. So it became a platform is how I would say it, right?

01:26:53,666 --> 01:26:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:26:54,434 --> 01:26:56,126
SPEAKER_0:  and an ingredient.

01:26:56,674 --> 01:26:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  that went inside and consultants like you said had to learn.

01:27:00,642 --> 01:27:02,206
SPEAKER_0:  I had to, they had to learn.

01:27:03,330 --> 01:27:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  Don't just put it on something. You gotta rethink how that thing should work because with the AI, it could work entirely differently.

01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

01:27:11,170 --> 01:27:14,846
SPEAKER_0:  I also felt it could open up and still will open up jobs to a lot of people.

01:27:15,202 --> 01:27:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  because

01:27:16,034 --> 01:27:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  more like an assistant and it could help me be qualified to do something and we we even years ago saw this with the french banks very unionized

01:27:23,714 --> 01:27:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  but that idea that you could.

01:27:26,210 --> 01:27:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  In this case, the unions voted for it because it felt people did a better job.

01:27:29,954 --> 01:27:30,654
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:35,262
SPEAKER_0:  And that's just part about being really dedicated to help it help humanity, not destroy it.

01:27:35,970 --> 01:27:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  Speaking of which...

01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:40,734
SPEAKER_1:  A funny side note, Kubrick's...

01:27:41,058 --> 01:27:42,814
SPEAKER_1:  2001 Space Odyssey.

01:27:43,074 --> 01:27:44,382
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think about?

01:27:44,642 --> 01:27:46,718
SPEAKER_1:  You know, the fact that Hal 9000.

01:27:47,234 --> 01:27:48,766
SPEAKER_1:  I was named after IBM.

01:27:48,930 --> 01:28:01,305
SPEAKER_0:  I really don't think it was. I know there's, I really don't. I've often- It could be more fake news. It's more fake news. I have done, I've like researched this, tried to find any evidence and people have talked to you. Was it really, you know, one letter, it was one letter. One letter off.

01:28:01,305 --> 01:28:04,478
SPEAKER_1:  So for people that know H is one letter off of I.

01:28:04,706 --> 01:28:07,331
SPEAKER_1:  A is one letter for B and then L is one letter for B.

01:28:07,331 --> 01:28:09,790
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I think that's a solution.

01:28:10,018 --> 01:28:13,758
SPEAKER_0:  found afterwards, you know. But here's what I think it more was.

01:28:14,242 --> 01:28:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  I do think it's one of the early demonstrations of evil AI.

01:28:17,090 --> 01:28:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  Like can be taught bad.

01:28:18,754 --> 01:28:20,126
SPEAKER_1:  I could push back on that because

01:28:20,450 --> 01:28:25,502
SPEAKER_1:  It's presented as evil in the movie because it hurts the AI hurts people.

01:28:26,082 --> 01:28:30,302
SPEAKER_1:  but it's a really interesting ethical question because the role of HAL 9000

01:28:30,658 --> 01:28:34,014
SPEAKER_1:  is to carry out a successful mission.

01:28:34,914 --> 01:28:42,110
SPEAKER_1:  And so the question that is a human question, it's not an AI question, at what price? Do humans wage war?

01:28:42,594 --> 01:28:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  They pay very heavy costs.

01:28:45,314 --> 01:28:46,366
SPEAKER_1:  for um...

01:28:47,874 --> 01:28:53,950
SPEAKER_1:  for a vision, for a goal of a future that creates a better world. And so that's the question certainly in space.

01:28:54,178 --> 01:28:59,053
SPEAKER_1:  Doctors ask that question all the time. My delimited resources could allocate my time and money in efforts.

01:28:59,053 --> 01:29:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  I agree. Like I said, I've spent a decade talking about this question of AI ethics, right?

01:29:03,874 --> 01:29:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  that it needs.

01:29:04,994 --> 01:29:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  really considerable, not just attention.

01:29:07,426 --> 01:29:08,990
SPEAKER_0:  because otherwise it will mirror.

01:29:09,954 --> 01:29:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  everything we love and everything we don't love.

01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  And again, and that's in beauty in the eye of the holder, right? Depending on your culture and everything else.

01:29:17,282 --> 01:29:19,294
SPEAKER_0:  with what you're doing and what you're gonna do.

01:29:19,618 --> 01:29:28,561
SPEAKER_0:  How do you think about it? Do you think about the AI you're going to develop as having guardrails dictated by some of your beliefs?

01:29:28,561 --> 01:29:32,574
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, for sure. So there's there's so many interesting ways to do this.

01:29:32,962 --> 01:29:38,366
SPEAKER_1:  of the right way and I don't think anyone has an answer. I tend to believe that transparency is really important. I don't think anyone has an answer.

01:29:38,690 --> 01:29:40,254
SPEAKER_1:  So I think some.

01:29:40,514 --> 01:29:43,294
SPEAKER_1:  aspect of your work should be open sourced.

01:29:44,130 --> 01:29:50,462
SPEAKER_1:  or at least have an open source competitor that creates kind of forcing function for transparency of how you do things.

01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:51,838
SPEAKER_1:  So, um...

01:29:52,130 --> 01:29:54,014
SPEAKER_1:  The other is I tend to believe.

01:29:54,242 --> 01:29:57,118
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe it's because of the podcast and I've just talked to a lot of people.

01:29:57,570 --> 01:29:59,614
SPEAKER_1:  You should know the people involved.

01:30:00,098 --> 01:30:09,406
SPEAKER_1:  I agree 100% as opposed to hide behind a company while sometimes there's a pressure. You have a PR team and you have to careful investors and discussions. So let's protect.

01:30:09,634 --> 01:30:11,806
SPEAKER_1:  That's surely not tweet, not this.

01:30:12,642 --> 01:30:14,206
SPEAKER_1:  and you form this bubble.

01:30:14,498 --> 01:30:17,246
SPEAKER_1:  where you have incredible engineers doing fascinating work.

01:30:17,826 --> 01:30:19,454
SPEAKER_1:  and also doing work that's.

01:30:20,226 --> 01:30:23,358
SPEAKER_1:  difficult complex human questions being answered.

01:30:23,778 --> 01:30:28,414
SPEAKER_1:  and we don't know about any of them as a society. So we can't really have that conversation.

01:30:28,834 --> 01:30:39,262
SPEAKER_1:  even though that conversation would be great for hiring, it would be great for revealing the complexities of what the company is facing. So when the company makes mistakes, you understand that it wasn't.

01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:47,486
SPEAKER_1:  malevolence or half-assetness in the decision-making is just a really hard problem. So I think transparency is just good for everybody.

01:30:47,970 --> 01:30:48,414
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

01:30:49,122 --> 01:30:49,534
SPEAKER_1:  and

01:30:50,146 --> 01:30:54,174
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, in general, just having a lot of public conversations about.

01:30:54,434 --> 01:30:56,286
SPEAKER_1:  This is serious stuff. It's...

01:30:57,858 --> 01:31:03,102
SPEAKER_1:  that AI will have a transformative impact on our society and it might do so very, very quickly.

01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:08,062
SPEAKER_1:  through all kinds of ways we're not expecting, which is social media recommendation systems.

01:31:08,450 --> 01:31:10,814
SPEAKER_1:  They at scale have impact on

01:31:11,170 --> 01:31:13,630
SPEAKER_1:  the way we think and the way we consume news.

01:31:14,178 --> 01:31:14,686
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:31:15,234 --> 01:31:22,590
SPEAKER_1:  the growth, like the kind of stuff we consume to grow and learn and become better human beings, all of that. That's all AI.

01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:25,886
SPEAKER_1:  And then obviously the tools that run.

01:31:26,146 --> 01:31:27,870
SPEAKER_1:  companies on which we depend.

01:31:28,258 --> 01:31:34,014
SPEAKER_1:  the infrastructure in which we depend. We need to know all about those AI decisions. And it's not as simple as.

01:31:34,370 --> 01:31:36,190
SPEAKER_1:  Well, we don't want the AI to say.

01:31:36,834 --> 01:31:39,102
SPEAKER_1:  these specific set of bad things.

01:31:39,426 --> 01:31:43,806
SPEAKER_1:  is unfortunately I don't believe it's possible to prevent.

01:31:44,642 --> 01:31:46,014
SPEAKER_1:  evil or...

01:31:46,402 --> 01:31:46,974
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:31:47,586 --> 01:31:49,790
SPEAKER_1:  bad things by creating a set of

01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:55,774
SPEAKER_1:  cold mathematical rules. Unfortunately, it's all fuzzy and gray areas. It's all a giant mess.

01:31:55,970 --> 01:32:00,318
SPEAKER_0:  It is, I mean, you think about it like a knife. A knife can do good and a knife can do bad, okay? You can't.

01:32:00,578 --> 01:32:04,350
SPEAKER_0:  It's very hard. You can't ban knives. You can't ban knives. And that's the way it is.

01:32:04,962 --> 01:32:05,406
SPEAKER_0:  This is-

01:32:05,698 --> 01:32:12,894
SPEAKER_0:  I think back, it was probably 2015, 16, we did principles of trust and transparency. Notice the word transparency.

01:32:13,122 --> 01:32:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  that belief that with AI, it should be explainable. You should know who taught it. You should know the data that went into training it. You should know how it was written. If it's being used, you have a right to know these things. And I think those are pretty.

01:32:25,986 --> 01:32:26,878
SPEAKER_0:  to this day.

01:32:27,106 --> 01:32:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  really powerful principles.

01:32:28,994 --> 01:32:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  to be followed, right? and

01:32:30,722 --> 01:32:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  And part of it, we ended up writing because here we were when we were working on it.

01:32:33,602 --> 01:32:34,654
SPEAKER_0:  particularly healthcare, like.

01:32:35,010 --> 01:32:37,342
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, you care who trained it in what?

01:32:37,698 --> 01:32:40,542
SPEAKER_0:  and that's sort of simply, you know, that.

01:32:40,834 --> 01:32:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  comes to your mind and you're like, yeah, that makes a lot of sense for something important like that, but it just in general.

01:32:45,762 --> 01:32:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  People won't trust the technologies, I don't think, unless...

01:32:48,546 --> 01:32:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  they have transparency into those things. In the end, they won't really trust it.

01:32:52,258 --> 01:32:54,430
SPEAKER_1:  I think a lot of people would like to know.

01:32:55,042 --> 01:32:55,966
SPEAKER_1:  sort of a

01:32:56,546 --> 01:32:57,950
SPEAKER_1:  Because a lot of us.

01:32:58,306 --> 01:33:00,542
SPEAKER_1:  I certainly do suffer from imposter syndrome.

01:33:01,346 --> 01:33:02,846
SPEAKER_1:  That self-critical brain.

01:33:03,170 --> 01:33:04,414
SPEAKER_1:  you know, taking that big.

01:33:04,770 --> 01:33:12,350
SPEAKER_1:  step into leadership. Did you at times suffer from imposter syndrome? Like, how did I get here? Do I really belong here? Or did you, were you able to?

01:33:12,674 --> 01:33:15,774
SPEAKER_1:  summon the courage and sort of the confidence to really step up.

01:33:19,362 --> 01:33:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  I think that's very natural for someone, like no matter like the bigger the job gets.

01:33:25,282 --> 01:33:27,358
SPEAKER_0:  You turn and you look to the left and the right.

01:33:27,650 --> 01:33:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  and you see people around you and you think.

01:33:29,698 --> 01:33:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  What am I doing here, right?

01:33:31,810 --> 01:33:33,182
SPEAKER_0:  but then you remember what you do.

01:33:33,602 --> 01:33:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  in.

01:33:34,754 --> 01:33:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  There's no one else doing it.

01:33:36,130 --> 01:33:36,830
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:38,846
SPEAKER_0:  you get that confidence. So

01:33:39,490 --> 01:33:42,078
SPEAKER_0:  I do hear a lot of people talk about imposter syndrome, right?

01:33:42,626 --> 01:33:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  8.

01:33:46,562 --> 01:33:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  Actually this past year I've spent some time helping people on that topic.

01:33:49,954 --> 01:33:50,558
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:33:53,602 --> 01:33:55,486
SPEAKER_0:  Pardon, sir, so you have to believe you, you.

01:33:56,386 --> 01:34:00,830
SPEAKER_0:  you have a right to be like anyone else does if you prepared for that moment you know and so

01:34:01,442 --> 01:34:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  It's a bit more of a...

01:34:04,034 --> 01:34:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  I know it's hard to say, like a confidence thing more than anything else. So yes, there are times I look around, but then I think,

01:34:10,466 --> 01:34:12,606
SPEAKER_0:  Wow, I'm in a position to make something change.

01:34:12,994 --> 01:34:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  So I can't say I have ever really dwelled on that feeling for a long time.

01:34:16,962 --> 01:34:18,837
SPEAKER_1:  I guess he's just focusing on work. I have an oppORTUNITY..

01:34:18,837 --> 01:34:22,718
SPEAKER_0:  I'm gonna stop propagating. You know, it's good or bad, I just focus on the work. Yeah, good or bad.

01:34:23,682 --> 01:34:26,494
SPEAKER_1:  One important lesson you said you learned from your mom.

01:34:27,202 --> 01:34:31,102
SPEAKER_1:  is never let anyone else define you. Only you define who you are.

01:34:31,426 --> 01:34:32,382
SPEAKER_1:  What's the...

01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:38,398
SPEAKER_1:  trajectory, let's say, of your self-definition journey, of you discovering who you are.

01:34:39,874 --> 01:34:43,166
SPEAKER_1:  from having that very difficult upbringing.

01:34:44,322 --> 01:34:47,934
SPEAKER_0:  You know they say pivotal moments happen and you don't realize it when they're happening?

01:34:48,962 --> 01:34:51,838
SPEAKER_0:  So most of my, I feel like most of my self discovery.

01:34:52,098 --> 01:34:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  It's been like

01:34:53,314 --> 01:34:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  Something happens.

01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:58,046
SPEAKER_0:  in a year or two or some number later, I look back on it and say,

01:34:58,338 --> 01:34:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

01:34:59,010 --> 01:35:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  I learned this from that. It's like not in the moment always with me.

01:35:02,786 --> 01:35:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  that could just be how I am. So.

01:35:05,186 --> 01:35:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like it's been...

01:35:07,106 --> 01:35:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:35:08,290 --> 01:35:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  Know yourself is a good thing, right? I've actually heard you say that on different podcasts And even if you get the kids on bad things, that will catch Those words, cuz' it's the Moon,...

01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:16,931
SPEAKER_0:  ask people questions, you're like, well, it depends, you know, like know yourself a bit, right? And, uh,

01:35:16,931 --> 01:35:20,638
SPEAKER_1:  It's hard to know who you are though, there's a lot of things like you said Nick.

01:35:21,474 --> 01:35:27,262
SPEAKER_1:  For me, there's moods when you're super self-critical. Sometimes you're super confident. And there's many, sometimes you're...

01:35:27,554 --> 01:35:32,359
SPEAKER_1:  Emotional sometimes you cool under pressure and although those all those are the same human

01:35:32,359 --> 01:35:33,758
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, and I think that's fine.

01:35:34,082 --> 01:35:34,558
SPEAKER_0:  Ha ha.

01:35:35,074 --> 01:35:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  uh... self-awareness that's different

01:35:38,274 --> 01:35:43,294
SPEAKER_1:  Was there societal expectations and norms regarding gender that you felt?

01:35:44,098 --> 01:35:45,598
SPEAKER_1:  in your career.

01:35:45,986 --> 01:35:50,270
SPEAKER_1:  You've spoken to that a little bit, but was there some aspect of that that was constraining empowering?

01:35:51,106 --> 01:35:51,582
SPEAKER_1:  or both.

01:35:53,602 --> 01:35:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  You know...

01:35:54,498 --> 01:36:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  I chose to never look at it, okay? Now whether that is right or wrong, and again, I'm a product of the 70s.

01:36:00,674 --> 01:36:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  70s and the 80s where

01:36:02,722 --> 01:36:04,798
SPEAKER_0:  I think I was surrounded all the other women around me.

01:36:05,410 --> 01:36:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  viewed our way to get ahead was just to work hard.

01:36:07,746 --> 01:36:11,262
SPEAKER_0:  work hard, work hard, and that was the way you differentiated yourself.

01:36:11,522 --> 01:36:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:36:12,482 --> 01:36:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  And that's obvious it did help. I mean, there's no doubt about it. You're always, you know, you learned a lot of things, which qualified, opened up another door, opened up another door.

01:36:21,122 --> 01:36:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  Very-

01:36:21,922 --> 01:36:26,814
SPEAKER_0:  mindful that I have worked for companies that are very steeped in those values of equal opportunity.

01:36:27,234 --> 01:36:28,030
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

01:36:28,578 --> 01:36:31,678
SPEAKER_0:  nothing remarkable about that. I mean, when I was a wee-

01:36:32,066 --> 01:36:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  I'm Todd.

01:36:33,794 --> 01:36:34,654
SPEAKER_0:  hire a diverse team.

01:36:35,202 --> 01:36:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  I get evaluated for it.

01:36:37,122 --> 01:36:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  I get evaluated if my team has built up their skills. So this is when you're really formative.

01:36:42,818 --> 01:36:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  you're in a culture that that's what it's valuing, right? So it becomes part of you. so

01:36:48,066 --> 01:36:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  I say sometimes to chagrin, did I ever feel I was held back for that reason? No, were there plenty of times when-

01:36:54,146 --> 01:36:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  I write about a few of the stories in the book, I'm laying cables at night and the guys are at the bar.

01:36:58,306 --> 01:37:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  Now, I didn't really wanna go with him to the bar anyways. They'd be like, we'll be back to get you, you know, bye. And I'm like, okay.

01:37:05,410 --> 01:37:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I learned a lot, so it didn't now.

01:37:08,290 --> 01:37:09,214
SPEAKER_0:  All that said...

01:37:09,474 --> 01:37:11,774
SPEAKER_0:  Back to my earlier story about being a role model.

01:37:12,322 --> 01:37:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  you know, it would be.

01:37:14,306 --> 01:37:17,118
SPEAKER_0:  foolish to not believe that there were times that that mattered.

01:37:17,474 --> 01:37:18,110
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:37:19,746 --> 01:37:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  I would say...

01:37:21,346 --> 01:37:23,550
SPEAKER_0:  two things, even not that long ago.

01:37:24,226 --> 01:37:25,982
SPEAKER_0:  you know, a colleague called me and...

01:37:26,594 --> 01:37:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  I was talking about media in.

01:37:28,674 --> 01:37:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  about women.

01:37:29,794 --> 01:37:31,198
SPEAKER_0:  CEOs and said, do you notice it?

01:37:31,682 --> 01:37:34,110
SPEAKER_0:  Sometimes when it's a woman CEO, they call the person by name.

01:37:34,754 --> 01:37:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  And when it's a man, they call the company out, not the...

01:37:37,122 --> 01:37:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  person's name exactly associated with the issue.

01:37:40,194 --> 01:37:44,798
SPEAKER_0:  And I said, yeah, well, I think you have to just understand much of what you do, it will be.

01:37:45,026 --> 01:37:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  Magnified.

01:37:46,050 --> 01:37:47,358
SPEAKER_0:  because there are so few of you.

01:37:48,034 --> 01:37:50,526
SPEAKER_0:  And sometimes it will be, you know, really.

01:37:50,882 --> 01:37:52,926
SPEAKER_0:  can be blown out of proportion, right? And so.

01:37:53,442 --> 01:37:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  that can happen in...

01:37:55,842 --> 01:37:58,622
SPEAKER_0:  you gotta learn in which way. Now all that said,

01:37:58,978 --> 01:37:59,614
SPEAKER_0:  on gender.

01:38:00,002 --> 01:38:04,030
SPEAKER_0:  It is an interesting thing with the book as I've talked to, you know, having a book.

01:38:05,282 --> 01:38:08,222
SPEAKER_0:  Even some of my best friends are frustrated. I can't wait for my daughter to read it.

01:38:09,314 --> 01:38:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  I say.

01:38:10,498 --> 01:38:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  Well that's interesting, do you think you could read it?

01:38:13,826 --> 01:38:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  It's a interesting reaction. And here I am 40 years later, that's an interesting reaction, right? And I say, no, the book, I really worked hard to write it for everyone. And I just happened to be a woman.

01:38:25,154 --> 01:38:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  right? But there's still that there and so.

01:38:29,058 --> 01:38:32,030
SPEAKER_0:  Look until I think people see and never feel that-

01:38:32,354 --> 01:38:36,222
SPEAKER_0:  They have a, it doesn't even matter whether it's a woman, it could be another diverse group that feels it.

01:38:37,154 --> 01:38:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  it's okay to ask those questions and that's why actually I'm okay talking about it because

01:38:41,602 --> 01:38:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  There were times I felt it, right? There were times in my life on my looks or my weight or my clothing or...

01:38:47,458 --> 01:38:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  endless numbers of things that people would comment on.

01:38:50,082 --> 01:38:51,902
SPEAKER_0:  that they would not have commented on.

01:38:52,386 --> 01:38:53,790
SPEAKER_0:  if it was someone else.

01:38:54,338 --> 01:38:54,846
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:38:56,194 --> 01:38:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  On the other hand, when there's so few of you...

01:38:58,754 --> 01:38:59,934
SPEAKER_0:  and you know.

01:39:00,226 --> 01:39:00,574
SPEAKER_0:  in

01:39:01,506 --> 01:39:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  There's good and bad, I mean there's benefit to that too, right?

01:39:04,450 --> 01:39:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  you if you do good work you'll be wrecking it's easier to be recognized and so.

01:39:08,802 --> 01:39:10,718
SPEAKER_0:  a pronicon and I think um

01:39:11,106 --> 01:39:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  I've just grown, you know.

01:39:12,354 --> 01:39:14,590
SPEAKER_0:  grown-up believing like my advice to young women.

01:39:14,882 --> 01:39:20,670
SPEAKER_0:  going to engineering. Not because you're going to be an engineer. It teaches you to solve problems. And anything you do is going to be solving problems.

01:39:21,730 --> 01:39:22,846
SPEAKER_0:  Things like that are...

01:39:23,074 --> 01:39:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  would I take away from that in that journey.

01:39:25,538 --> 01:39:28,190
SPEAKER_1:  It is interesting that I hear from women.

01:39:29,570 --> 01:39:31,582
SPEAKER_1:  that even on this podcast when I...

01:39:31,810 --> 01:39:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  talk to.

01:39:32,706 --> 01:39:33,086
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:39:33,474 --> 01:39:34,174
SPEAKER_1:  Incredible.

01:39:34,850 --> 01:39:37,150
SPEAKER_1:  women like yourself, it is inspiring to young women.

01:39:37,666 --> 01:39:39,678
SPEAKER_1:  to hear. I mean, you like to see.

01:39:40,066 --> 01:39:43,134
SPEAKER_1:  You talk to somebody from Turkey and then Turkish people all get excited.

01:39:43,554 --> 01:39:47,614
SPEAKER_1:  It's so true. So you get like somebody that looks like you somebody that

01:39:47,938 --> 01:39:48,382
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:39:48,834 --> 01:39:50,942
SPEAKER_1:  And the category could be tiny or it could be.

01:39:51,362 --> 01:39:52,222
SPEAKER_1:  It can be huge.

01:39:52,546 --> 01:39:53,671
SPEAKER_1:  That's just the reality.

01:39:53,671 --> 01:40:03,038
SPEAKER_0:  It is a reality of the world. It is a reality of the world. And the work I do now to put this group called 110, put 1 million black employees into the middle class without college degrees.

01:40:03,298 --> 01:40:04,318
SPEAKER_0:  Upwardly Mobile Jobs.

01:40:04,930 --> 01:40:05,310
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:40:05,986 --> 01:40:07,326
SPEAKER_0:  One of my last years...

01:40:07,554 --> 01:40:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  uh... we've been working on uh... it just a regular leadership session i b m and had our black colleagues were talking about what it feel like to be a black leader

01:40:15,522 --> 01:40:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  And here, these are extremely accomplished people.

01:40:18,882 --> 01:40:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  And I can remember very well when telling a story about.

01:40:21,858 --> 01:40:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  Look, I felt.

01:40:23,618 --> 01:40:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  If I failed or succeeded...

01:40:25,154 --> 01:40:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  It's not just me.

01:40:26,434 --> 01:40:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  It came from a country in Africa.

01:40:28,034 --> 01:40:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  It's like the whole country is on my shoulder.

01:40:30,626 --> 01:40:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  my success or failure.

01:40:32,098 --> 01:40:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  That's a burden. I mean, like I don't feel that burden. Not true as woman CEO, I did feel like, you know.

01:40:38,690 --> 01:40:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  Even the headlines when I was named said, you know, her appointment will either, you know, her success or failure will be a statement for the whole gender kind of thing.

01:40:47,106 --> 01:40:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  End.

01:40:48,482 --> 01:40:49,950
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't dwell on it, but I meant that's-

01:40:50,178 --> 01:40:53,502
SPEAKER_0:  But I could see how people, like you said, could be a small group, could be whatever.

01:40:53,730 --> 01:41:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  And so that is a lot of pressure on people and they need role models. You are a role model for people. Look at what you're able to do. You do these podcasts, you understand your science very well, you're very well prepared, your ability to...

01:41:04,290 --> 01:41:05,470
SPEAKER_0:  translated to people.

01:41:05,858 --> 01:41:14,270
SPEAKER_0:  you know, that's not an insignificant thing. And you may think, oh, you know, is that about the power of me? Not really, right? And you obviously believe you don't do this because.

01:41:14,562 --> 01:41:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  you just like sitting at a microphone, you do it because you think, okay, if I can get people to say things that are really valuable to other people, they're gonna learn something. I assume that is, I mean, you ever told me my interpretation is...

01:41:24,898 --> 01:41:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  That's why you do this podcast.

01:41:26,498 --> 01:41:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  that you feel like in service of other people that.

01:41:29,058 --> 01:41:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  you can bring them something unique.

01:41:30,946 --> 01:41:32,030
SPEAKER_0:  by the way you do this.

01:41:32,546 --> 01:41:35,171
SPEAKER_0:  Now I should ask you, why do you do it? That's my impression.

01:41:35,171 --> 01:41:44,062
SPEAKER_1:  By the way, can I just comment on the fact that you keep asking me really hard questions? I really appreciate it. I love this. I'm really honored by it.

01:41:45,666 --> 01:41:46,558
SPEAKER_1:  As a fan of

01:41:47,202 --> 01:41:48,254
SPEAKER_1:  podcast myself.

01:41:49,506 --> 01:41:50,430
SPEAKER_1:  What I hope...

01:41:50,658 --> 01:41:52,254
SPEAKER_1:  is to talk to people like you and

01:41:52,578 --> 01:41:54,014
SPEAKER_1:  to show that you are.

01:41:54,498 --> 01:41:56,830
SPEAKER_1:  a fascinating and beautiful human being.

01:41:57,090 --> 01:41:58,846
SPEAKER_1:  outside of your actual accomplishments.

01:41:59,074 --> 01:41:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  Also.

01:41:59,906 --> 01:42:01,406
SPEAKER_1:  So sometimes people are very...

01:42:01,858 --> 01:42:02,814
SPEAKER_1:  I'll focus on.

01:42:03,458 --> 01:42:09,086
SPEAKER_1:  you know, very specific things about, like you said, science, like what, what the actual work is, whether it's nuclear.

01:42:09,314 --> 01:42:11,038
SPEAKER_1:  Fusion or StratGPT.

01:42:11,938 --> 01:42:14,206
SPEAKER_1:  I just want to show that it's...

01:42:14,530 --> 01:42:15,358
SPEAKER_1:  Because I see it.

01:42:15,970 --> 01:42:20,190
SPEAKER_1:  At MIT and everywhere, it's just human beings trying their best, they're flawed.

01:42:20,738 --> 01:42:23,934
SPEAKER_1:  but just realizing that all of these very well.

01:42:24,354 --> 01:42:25,214
SPEAKER_1:  people.

01:42:25,538 --> 01:42:26,302
SPEAKER_1:  all the same.

01:42:26,818 --> 01:42:32,478
SPEAKER_1:  That's a very good, well said. And then so then regular people and young people, they're able to see.

01:42:32,738 --> 01:42:40,003
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I can do this too. I can have a very big impact. Yeah, exactly. It's like we're all kind of imposters. We're all like trying to figure out.

01:42:40,003 --> 01:42:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  To a certain degree.

01:42:42,210 --> 01:42:48,062
SPEAKER_1:  So let me just ask you about family. You wrote that my family still jokes the reason I never had children.

01:42:48,482 --> 01:42:51,358
SPEAKER_1:  on my own was because I had already raised my family.

01:42:51,714 --> 01:42:55,870
SPEAKER_1:  they're right. So this is talking to you upbringing, but in general, what was your.

01:42:57,378 --> 01:42:59,678
SPEAKER_1:  you know, leading a giant company, what was the...

01:43:00,130 --> 01:43:03,326
SPEAKER_1:  right place to find a work-life balance for you.

01:43:03,778 --> 01:43:06,878
SPEAKER_1:  to have time for family, have time for.

01:43:07,266 --> 01:43:08,094
SPEAKER_1:  away from work.

01:43:08,642 --> 01:43:09,598
SPEAKER_1:  and be successful.

01:43:09,794 --> 01:43:11,518
SPEAKER_0:  So I had to learn that and I might've said.

01:43:12,130 --> 01:43:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

01:43:13,090 --> 01:43:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  You're the only one that can determine your own work-life balance. Companies are innate things. I mean, they will take everything they can from you. And it's not a bad thing. They just will, as will bosses. I mean,

01:43:22,178 --> 01:43:22,654
SPEAKER_0:  You give it?

01:43:22,946 --> 01:43:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  We'll take it.

01:43:23,874 --> 01:43:24,222
SPEAKER_0:  in

01:43:24,546 --> 01:43:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  When people ask for, you know, I need roof, I'm like, okay.

01:43:27,234 --> 01:43:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  I had to come with terms with.

01:43:28,834 --> 01:43:29,758
SPEAKER_0:  The criminal was me.

01:43:30,562 --> 01:43:33,438
SPEAKER_0:  if I needed that balance. I had to set those boundaries.

01:43:33,922 --> 01:43:34,686
SPEAKER_0:  And so.

01:43:35,010 --> 01:43:39,678
SPEAKER_0:  when I comment about a family, because I am in extreme awe of people with children who work.

01:43:39,970 --> 01:43:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  It is.

01:43:41,410 --> 01:43:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  extremely hard thing to do. I watch my siblings, I love my nieces and nephews, and

01:43:47,010 --> 01:43:47,422
SPEAKER_0:  Whew!

01:43:48,066 --> 01:43:54,846
SPEAKER_0:  you know, A, the emotional, their pain is your pain every minute of a day, and then you still have a job on top of it, and so.

01:43:55,202 --> 01:43:57,790
SPEAKER_0:  when my mom had to go back to school and had to work.

01:43:58,082 --> 01:43:58,814
SPEAKER_0:  I was the one.

01:43:59,042 --> 01:44:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  And so when she couldn't go to the teacher meeting, I went to the teacher meeting. And so in some ways, and there's an age gap between my brother and I and my other two sisters.

01:44:07,394 --> 01:44:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:44:08,674 --> 01:44:15,774
SPEAKER_0:  So I'm still, they still call me Mama Bear even. I mean, I'm extremely protective of all of them and it is as if I had...

01:44:16,066 --> 01:44:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  raise them and my mom did a great job raising him i didn't i bet i was there.

01:44:20,514 --> 01:44:21,022
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:44:21,378 --> 01:44:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:44:22,914 --> 01:44:29,630
SPEAKER_0:  when it came time to have children, and my husband came from a family where his father died and was raised by a single mother.

01:44:29,954 --> 01:44:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  very similar.

01:44:32,162 --> 01:44:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  End point.

01:44:32,962 --> 01:44:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  different reasons why he ended up, you know.

01:44:36,162 --> 01:44:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  fathered not abandon them.

01:44:37,794 --> 01:44:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:44:39,234 --> 01:44:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  I don't want people to believe.

01:44:40,738 --> 01:44:42,654
SPEAKER_0:  to do my job, you can have no children.

01:44:42,978 --> 01:44:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  That is not right.

01:44:44,354 --> 01:44:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  I know other great women CEOs.

01:44:46,882 --> 01:44:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  uh... maryland houston her and like he'd martin treatment technical company mary bar who runs general motors alan colman who run dupli these are all my friends to this day

01:44:56,546 --> 01:44:56,990
SPEAKER_0:  in

01:44:57,826 --> 01:45:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  they've been fantastic mothers and husbands, good parents, right?

01:45:01,602 --> 01:45:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  And so...

01:45:02,786 --> 01:45:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  I talk about it because it was a choice we made. so

01:45:05,858 --> 01:45:06,974
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we both felt.

01:45:07,330 --> 01:45:07,646
SPEAKER_0:  Look.

01:45:08,290 --> 01:45:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  we'd reached a point where for his reasons, what he had to do, I'd already felt that way.

01:45:13,090 --> 01:45:13,694
SPEAKER_0:  and that we were.

01:45:13,954 --> 01:45:22,270
SPEAKER_0:  I'm comfortable just being great aunts and uncles, and I'm a great aunt. You know, I like to think that for my little guys, and they're older now, but lots of them.

01:45:22,626 --> 01:45:23,102
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:45:24,418 --> 01:45:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  And there's no doubt though the choices we made.

01:45:26,978 --> 01:45:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  Mark and I, that-

01:45:28,898 --> 01:45:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  That made it easier for me to focus on work. I mean, that's just-

01:45:33,026 --> 01:45:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  You know, when you've got less

01:45:35,138 --> 01:45:36,446
SPEAKER_0:  people to have to take care of.

01:45:36,866 --> 01:45:37,374
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:45:37,954 --> 01:45:44,606
SPEAKER_0:  So I'm very considerate of that, and I think much of it informed many of the policies I put into because I had such great empathy.

01:45:44,962 --> 01:45:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  for those who then still had these other responsibilities. And I desperately wanted

01:45:49,826 --> 01:45:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  them all to stay in the workforce.

01:45:51,522 --> 01:45:51,902
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:45:52,578 --> 01:45:54,494
SPEAKER_0:  I can remember and my siblings have been...

01:45:54,978 --> 01:45:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  More successful than I, by the way. I mean, to my mother's credit.

01:45:58,402 --> 01:45:59,038
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:45:59,362 --> 01:46:01,822
SPEAKER_0:  My one sister who, uh...

01:46:02,338 --> 01:46:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  you know, went to Northwestern, has an MBA.

01:46:04,930 --> 01:46:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  built some of the most sophisticated systems.

01:46:07,138 --> 01:46:07,614
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:46:08,002 --> 01:46:13,022
SPEAKER_0:  She spent her whole career at Accenture and just recently retired as a chief executive of all of consulting.

01:46:13,378 --> 01:46:15,134
SPEAKER_0:  But at one point she took off time.

01:46:15,426 --> 01:46:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  to spend with her family and then went to go back to work, she's talking to me and she's like, I don't know if I should go back to work. Maybe the life's path, technology goes so fast, it's been a few years.

01:46:25,698 --> 01:46:28,542
SPEAKER_0:  I'm sitting there like, what are you talking about?

01:46:28,994 --> 01:46:29,406
SPEAKER_0:  I'm like...

01:46:29,730 --> 01:46:33,182
SPEAKER_0:  you know, look at her credentials, they're far outstanding. I'm like-

01:46:34,018 --> 01:46:35,422
SPEAKER_0:  And I thought to myself like, ding.

01:46:35,746 --> 01:46:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  One of those moments.

01:46:37,154 --> 01:46:40,318
SPEAKER_0:  if my own sister feels that way with all her credentials.

01:46:40,962 --> 01:46:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  I'll bet I went back to work the next day and I said, hey, pull for me.

01:46:43,970 --> 01:46:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  All the people who've left.

01:46:45,250 --> 01:46:48,446
SPEAKER_0:  for parental reasons or whatever, family reasons.

01:46:48,834 --> 01:46:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  and didn't come back.

01:46:50,114 --> 01:46:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  and it began a program of return ships. And I can't tell you how many in men and women.

01:46:54,658 --> 01:46:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  was because they didn't feel confident to come back. They thought—

01:46:57,410 --> 01:46:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  Technology passed him by.

01:46:59,010 --> 01:47:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, we said it's three months, you can stay one month, three months, doesn't matter.

01:47:02,882 --> 01:47:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  Well, a lot of people, like one day, they're like, you're right, not that much happened.

01:47:05,602 --> 01:47:10,494
SPEAKER_0:  Well, it happened, but I caught up. I actually know more than I think, you know? And I-

01:47:10,978 --> 01:47:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:47:12,322 --> 01:47:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  That's a long answer to your question about...

01:47:14,466 --> 01:47:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't, but I am so empathetic.

01:47:16,386 --> 01:47:20,062
SPEAKER_0:  and I am in awe of what they are able to do. so

01:47:20,290 --> 01:47:23,678
SPEAKER_0:  And it made me then, I think, more empathetic to the policies and the like.

01:47:23,970 --> 01:47:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  around that topic so you can keep great people in the work.

01:47:26,658 --> 01:47:28,734
SPEAKER_1:  So you mentioned you're friends with Mayabara.

01:47:28,962 --> 01:47:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  uh... the the CEO of GM

01:47:31,618 --> 01:47:34,791
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't mean to name drop.

01:47:34,791 --> 01:47:37,041
SPEAKER_1:  I love her, she's amazing. I just wanted to, I'm just curious.

01:47:37,041 --> 01:47:45,726
SPEAKER_0:  I'll tell Mary she should do your podcast. We'll make it happen. She's a great leader. I always, I tell Mary what I think of her is I think she's one of the most authentic leaders out there.

01:47:45,986 --> 01:47:46,654
SPEAKER_0:  most authentic.

01:47:46,914 --> 01:47:48,894
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, just very different companies.

01:47:49,186 --> 01:48:01,630
SPEAKER_0:  huge challenges. I worked there first, I remember, right? So I'm very, you know, in some ways I'm very beholden, right? You know, I'm very appreciative of what they did. I mean, Mary and I are circa the same. Well, I'm a bit older, so, but circa that genre.

01:48:01,794 --> 01:48:02,919
SPEAKER_1:  Do exchange wisdom.

01:48:02,919 --> 01:48:07,838
SPEAKER_0:  Oh yeah, yeah. When you do anything hard, it takes time and perseverance like we talked about.

01:48:08,802 --> 01:48:09,790
SPEAKER_0:  and you can get that.

01:48:11,938 --> 01:48:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  Where do you get the fuel for it?

01:48:13,602 --> 01:48:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  You can either get it from your attitude.

01:48:15,586 --> 01:48:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  or you can get it from your network or your relationships.

01:48:19,138 --> 01:48:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  and I'm a firm believer relationships are from what you give.

01:48:22,018 --> 01:48:30,334
SPEAKER_0:  not what you get, meaning you give, trust me, they will come back at the time they need to come back to you at these moments in life. If you focus on...

01:48:30,754 --> 01:48:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  How can I bring?

01:48:32,162 --> 01:48:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  Lex value.

01:48:33,378 --> 01:48:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  There'll be a day I need likes, he will be back.

01:48:35,746 --> 01:48:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:48:36,898 --> 01:48:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  So to those women.

01:48:38,658 --> 01:48:40,638
SPEAKER_0:  To me, relationships are not transactional.

01:48:41,826 --> 01:48:42,494
SPEAKER_0:  And

01:48:43,202 --> 01:48:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  It's a proof that to this day, even though I'm no longer still active as a CEO, these are all still my friends.

01:48:48,642 --> 01:48:50,846
SPEAKER_0:  and we are friends, all of us.

01:48:51,170 --> 01:48:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:48:52,066 --> 01:48:53,022
SPEAKER_0:  I can remember...

01:48:53,282 --> 01:48:56,382
SPEAKER_0:  Some of them, when I first became a CEO, calling me and saying, Hey,

01:48:56,706 --> 01:48:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  It's a little lonely here.

01:48:58,050 --> 01:48:59,102
SPEAKER_0:  So let me talk to you.

01:48:59,586 --> 01:49:01,534
SPEAKER_0:  And then when they became, I did the same for them.

01:49:02,050 --> 01:49:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  and then they remember, and they do for the next generation.

01:49:05,442 --> 01:49:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  And so...

01:49:06,594 --> 01:49:07,102
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:49:07,714 --> 01:49:09,150
SPEAKER_0:  It's very supportive.

01:49:09,570 --> 01:49:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  it almost to a tee any of the women you can name who have been CEOs I would say

01:49:15,010 --> 01:49:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  almost to a T have all been very supportive. In fact, a number of us work on a little, another non-for-profit right now called Journey.

01:49:21,218 --> 01:49:25,566
SPEAKER_0:  which some women who had started, the fortune's most powerful women had started, which was

01:49:25,858 --> 01:49:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  Could we get?

01:49:27,042 --> 01:49:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  more women, particularly diverse women, but women in general, to more quickly be into positions of leadership and power.

01:49:32,930 --> 01:49:33,662
SPEAKER_0:  And so...

01:49:34,370 --> 01:49:35,806
SPEAKER_0:  many of the women you named and more.

01:49:36,130 --> 01:49:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  you know, we all dedicate time mentoring.

01:49:38,658 --> 01:49:41,763
SPEAKER_0:  in kind of creating this little group of fellows every year to do this.

01:49:41,763 --> 01:49:50,558
SPEAKER_1:  Friendship and love is core to this whole thing, not just to success, but just to the whole human condition. Let me ask one last question, advice for young people. If you

01:49:50,946 --> 01:49:52,126
SPEAKER_1:  a difficult upbringing.

01:49:52,866 --> 01:49:54,526
SPEAKER_1:  a difficult life and you've...

01:49:54,882 --> 01:49:59,582
SPEAKER_1:  become one of the most successful human beings in history, what advice would you give to young people?

01:49:59,906 --> 01:50:01,822
SPEAKER_1:  or just people in general who are struggling a bit.

01:50:02,274 --> 01:50:03,038
SPEAKER_1:  trying to figure out.

01:50:03,458 --> 01:50:05,950
SPEAKER_1:  how they can have a career they can be proud of or.

01:50:06,274 --> 01:50:07,614
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe a life that can be proud.

01:50:09,218 --> 01:50:12,478
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like a life you can be proud of is just one if you leave something a little bit better.

01:50:13,250 --> 01:50:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  It doesn't have to be big.

01:50:15,618 --> 01:50:16,190
SPEAKER_0:  you know?

01:50:16,866 --> 01:50:22,654
SPEAKER_0:  That's a life well lived, right? It was Churchill who said, we may, it was how you might remember it better than I, made you make it?

01:50:23,170 --> 01:50:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  living by what you get.

01:50:25,314 --> 01:50:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  and you live a life by what you give, something to that effect.

01:50:28,578 --> 01:50:28,958
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:50:29,218 --> 01:50:31,646
SPEAKER_0:  But my advice would probably, when I'm asked this...

01:50:33,634 --> 01:50:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  I would tell them to ask more questions and give answers.

01:50:38,018 --> 01:50:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  Just focus on being a sponge. And it's funny, I asked my husband the same question the other day, I said, hey, we're talking to somebody and...

01:50:47,074 --> 01:50:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  people were asking this in.

01:50:49,794 --> 01:50:51,710
SPEAKER_0:  He started to pause for a while and he said

01:50:52,066 --> 01:50:53,182
SPEAKER_0:  I tell them patience.

01:50:53,762 --> 01:50:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  I said, what do you mean? I said...

01:50:56,898 --> 01:51:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  I see so many young people, like they're in such a hurry to somewhere, I don't know where.

01:51:01,058 --> 01:51:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  and that if they just had patience and let life unfold.

01:51:04,866 --> 01:51:06,622
SPEAKER_0:  I think they may be surprised where they ended up.

01:51:08,354 --> 01:51:10,174
SPEAKER_0:  And actually, I think that's a really good answer.

01:51:10,466 --> 01:51:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  To be honest.

01:51:11,586 --> 01:51:14,961
SPEAKER_1:  Along the way, keep asking questions, keep that childlike curiosity.

01:51:14,961 --> 01:51:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  I know it sounds so easy to say, it's just so...

01:51:18,178 --> 01:51:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

01:51:19,842 --> 01:51:25,502
SPEAKER_1:  It's like you said, the obvious things. Yeah. It turned out to be the most profound.

01:51:25,858 --> 01:51:29,630
SPEAKER_1:  You're an incredible human being, your inspiration is so many. Thank you for.

01:51:30,498 --> 01:51:38,270
SPEAKER_1:  helping run and contribute to one of the great companies that bring so much good power to the world. And thank you for it.

01:51:38,562 --> 01:51:44,771
SPEAKER_1:  putting in the hard work of putting it all in the great book. And thank you for talking to me, this is a huge honor. Thank you for doing it.

01:51:44,771 --> 01:51:45,521
SPEAKER_0:  Ah, you did love-

01:51:45,521 --> 01:51:45,918
SPEAKER_1:  suggestion about what kind of comments you think it would be in? Or will you write it down? My tip in actually screaming with my Thunder CC, or disadvantageous, river rest.

SPEAKER_1:  Let me leave you with some words from Eleanor Roosevelt.

01:51:57,666 --> 01:51:59,518
SPEAKER_1:  Do what you feel in your heart to be right.

01:52:00,450 --> 01:52:01,758
SPEAKER_1:  where you'll be criticized.

01:52:02,050 --> 01:52:02,686

01:52:03,682 --> 01:52:04,510
