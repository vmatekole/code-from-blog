00:00:00,162 --> 00:00:02,622
SPEAKER_1:  The following is a conversation with Bhaskar Sankara.

00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,406

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,614
SPEAKER_1:  founding editor of Jacobin.

00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,246
SPEAKER_1:  President of the Nation.

00:00:09,538 --> 00:00:15,454
SPEAKER_1:  former vice chair of the Democratic Socialist of America and the author of the Socialist Manifesto.

SPEAKER_1:  The Case for Radical Politics.

00:00:17,858 --> 00:00:19,966
SPEAKER_1:  in an era of extreme inequality.

00:00:21,058 --> 00:00:24,734
SPEAKER_1:  As a side note, let me say that this conversation with Bhaskar Sankara

00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:29,662
SPEAKER_1:  who is a brilliant socialist writer and philosopher represents what I hope to do with this podcast.

00:00:30,242 --> 00:00:31,038
SPEAKER_1:  I hope to talk.

00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  to the left.

00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:32,958
SPEAKER_1:  and the right.

00:00:33,538 --> 00:00:35,070
SPEAKER_1:  to the far left and the far right.

00:00:35,586 --> 00:00:40,478
SPEAKER_1:  always with the goal of presenting and understanding both the strongest interpretation of their ideas

00:00:40,962 --> 00:00:44,638
SPEAKER_1:  and valuable thought provoking arguments against those ideas.

00:00:45,602 --> 00:00:48,318
SPEAKER_1:  Also, I hope to understand the human being behind.

00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,278
SPEAKER_1:  ideas.

00:00:50,306 --> 00:00:53,630
SPEAKER_1:  I trust in your intelligence as the listener to use the ideas you hear.

00:00:54,114 --> 00:00:57,822
SPEAKER_1:  to help you learn, to think, to empathize, and to make up your own mind.

00:00:59,138 --> 00:01:01,630
SPEAKER_1:  I will often fall short in pushing back.

00:01:02,082 --> 00:01:02,686
SPEAKER_1:  too hard.

00:01:03,426 --> 00:01:04,510
SPEAKER_1:  or not pushing back enough.

00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:07,678
SPEAKER_1:  of uh... not bring up topics i should have

00:01:08,098 --> 00:01:13,694
SPEAKER_1:  of talking too much, of interrupting too much, or maybe sometimes in the rare cases not enough.

00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:16,382
SPEAKER_1:  of being too silly on a serious topic.

00:01:16,674 --> 00:01:18,462
SPEAKER_1:  being too serious on a silly topic.

00:01:19,298 --> 00:01:20,382
SPEAKER_1:  I'm trying to do my best.

00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,934
SPEAKER_1:  and I will keep working my ass off to improve.

00:01:25,154 --> 00:01:25,790
SPEAKER_1:  in this way.

00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,694
SPEAKER_1:  I hope to talk to prominent figures in the political space.

00:01:29,954 --> 00:01:31,166
SPEAKER_1:  even controversial ones.

00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:32,926
SPEAKER_1:  on both the left and the right.

00:01:33,506 --> 00:01:36,030
SPEAKER_1:  For example, I hope to talk to Donald Trump.

00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,462
SPEAKER_1:  and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

00:01:39,202 --> 00:01:40,190
SPEAKER_1:  to Rādhāsānta.

00:01:40,418 --> 00:01:41,822
SPEAKER_1:  and Barack Obama.

00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,798
SPEAKER_1:  and of course many others across the political spectrum.

00:01:45,954 --> 00:01:46,974
SPEAKER_1:  I sometimes hear...

00:01:47,586 --> 00:01:53,470
SPEAKER_1:  accusations about me being controlled in some way by a government or an intelligence agency.

00:01:53,698 --> 00:01:55,358
SPEAKER_1:  like CIA, FSB.

00:01:55,586 --> 00:01:56,158
SPEAKER_1:  Masaad.

00:01:56,802 --> 00:02:02,206
SPEAKER_1:  or perhaps that I'm controlled in some way by the very human desire for money, fame, power access.

00:02:03,074 --> 00:02:05,278
SPEAKER_1:  All I have is my silly little words.

00:02:05,954 --> 00:02:07,486
SPEAKER_1:  But let me give them to you.

00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:11,166
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not and will never be controlled by anyone.

00:02:11,842 --> 00:02:15,646
SPEAKER_1:  There's nothing in this world that can break me and force me to sacrifice my integrity.

00:02:16,578 --> 00:02:17,662
SPEAKER_1:  People call me naive.

00:02:18,434 --> 00:02:19,326
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not naive.

00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:20,830
SPEAKER_1:  I'm optimistic.

00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:24,446
SPEAKER_1:  and optimism isn't a passive state of being.

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,206
SPEAKER_1:  It's a constant battle.

00:02:26,498 --> 00:02:29,822
SPEAKER_1:  against the world that wants to pull you into a downward spiral of cynicism.

00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:31,710
SPEAKER_1:  To me, optimism.

00:02:32,034 --> 00:02:32,702
SPEAKER_1:  is freedom.

00:02:33,442 --> 00:02:34,302
SPEAKER_1:  Freedom to think.

00:02:34,562 --> 00:02:35,006
SPEAKER_1:  to act.

00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,766
SPEAKER_1:  to build, to help.

00:02:37,314 --> 00:02:38,014
SPEAKER_1:  At times.

00:02:38,402 --> 00:02:39,966
SPEAKER_1:  in the face of impossible odds.

00:02:41,186 --> 00:02:42,110
SPEAKER_1:  as I often do.

00:02:42,402 --> 00:02:44,926
SPEAKER_1:  Please allow me to read a few lines from the poem, If.

00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,302
SPEAKER_1:  by Roger Kipling.

00:02:47,618 --> 00:02:51,774
SPEAKER_1:  If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you.

00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  if you can trust yourself and all men doubt you.

00:02:55,202 --> 00:02:56,830
SPEAKER_1:  but make allowance for their doubting too.

00:02:57,698 --> 00:02:59,838
SPEAKER_1:  If you can wait, not be tired by waiting.

00:03:00,322 --> 00:03:02,366
SPEAKER_1:  are being lied about on Dylan lies.

00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:04,030
SPEAKER_1:  are being hated.

00:03:04,354 --> 00:03:05,470
SPEAKER_1:  Don't give way to hating.

00:03:06,082 --> 00:03:07,422
SPEAKER_1:  and yet don't look too good.

00:03:07,842 --> 00:03:09,086
SPEAKER_1:  or talk too wise.

00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:11,486
SPEAKER_1:  even this very poem.

00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:15,006
SPEAKER_1:  is mocking my over romantic ridiculousness as I read it.

00:03:15,522 --> 00:03:16,446
SPEAKER_1:  The Meta Irony.

00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:18,558
SPEAKER_1:  is not lost on me, my friends.

00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:22,110
SPEAKER_1:  I'm a silly little kid trying to do a bit of good in this world.

00:03:22,882 --> 00:03:24,958
SPEAKER_1:  Thank you for having my back through all of it.

00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,622
SPEAKER_1:  All of my mistakes.

00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  Thank you for the love.

00:03:29,538 --> 00:03:31,358
SPEAKER_1:  This is the Lux Freeingman Podcast.

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:32,510
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:03:33,442 --> 00:03:34,046
SPEAKER_1:  to support it.

00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,670
SPEAKER_1:  Please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:03:37,058 --> 00:03:38,110
SPEAKER_1:  And now, dear friends.

00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,542
SPEAKER_1:  Here's Bhaskar Sankara.

00:03:41,826 --> 00:03:42,846
SPEAKER_1:  Let's start with a...

00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,982
SPEAKER_1:  Big broad question, what is socialism?

00:03:46,754 --> 00:03:47,774
SPEAKER_1:  How do you like to define it?

00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:49,118
SPEAKER_1:  How do you like to think about it?

00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,294
SPEAKER_0:  Well, there's so many socialists out there.

00:03:51,586 --> 00:03:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  And we can't seem to agree about anything. So my definition, I'm sure, is really just my definition. But I think

00:03:58,178 --> 00:04:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  At the minimum, socialism is about making sure that the core necessities of life

00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,814
SPEAKER_0:  food, housing, education, and so on.

00:04:07,106 --> 00:04:12,478
SPEAKER_0:  are guaranteed to everyone just by virtue of being born so that those people can reach their potential.

00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that's a minimum requirement of socialism.

00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:20,254
SPEAKER_0:  Beyond that, I think, socialism, especially democratic socialism.

00:04:20,514 --> 00:04:21,950
SPEAKER_0:  and that I believe in.

00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:22,814
SPEAKER_0:  is about.

00:04:23,234 --> 00:04:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  taking democracy.

00:04:24,802 --> 00:04:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  from just the political democratic realm.

00:04:27,618 --> 00:04:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  and extending it into economic and social spheres as well.

00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  So if we think that democracy is a good thing.

00:04:33,698 --> 00:04:38,846
SPEAKER_0:  Why do we allow our workplaces to be run in autocratic ways?

00:04:39,522 --> 00:04:39,998
SPEAKER_1:  So.

00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,118
SPEAKER_1:  Economic.

00:04:41,762 --> 00:04:42,526
SPEAKER_1:  political.

00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:43,838
SPEAKER_1:  Social

00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,206
SPEAKER_1:  In all those realms, the-

00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,182
SPEAKER_1:  the ideas, the philosophical ideas apply.

00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:50,590
SPEAKER_1:  Like, what are-

00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:52,798
SPEAKER_1:  If you can put words to it, what are some?

00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,870
SPEAKER_1:  philosophical ideas about

00:04:56,194 --> 00:04:58,302
SPEAKER_1:  human beings that are at the core of this.

00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  I think at the core.

00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,486
SPEAKER_0:  It's the idea that we have intrinsic value.

00:05:04,002 --> 00:05:08,670
SPEAKER_0:  We are individuals that have unequal talents, of course.

00:05:08,962 --> 00:05:10,174
SPEAKER_0:  We're individuals.

00:05:10,594 --> 00:05:11,934
SPEAKER_0:  that want different.

00:05:12,194 --> 00:05:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  things.

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  but this unique individualness.

00:05:15,426 --> 00:05:16,446
SPEAKER_0:  can only.

00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  Truly.

00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  come to light in a society in which there certain collective or social

00:05:22,594 --> 00:05:23,422
SPEAKER_0:  Guarantees.

00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  so we could think just like Stephen Jay Gould.

00:05:27,138 --> 00:05:28,926
SPEAKER_0:  the scientists.

00:05:29,282 --> 00:05:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  Socialists used to say

00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:33,982
SPEAKER_0:  about how many thousands of potential...

00:05:34,274 --> 00:05:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  Einstein's or Leonardo da Vinci's that died in sweatshops.

00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  and on plantations and never got the chance to cultivate what was unique and human about themselves and also never got a chance to...

00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,542
SPEAKER_0:  have.

00:05:49,026 --> 00:05:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  families and in part what was special and important to them, to future generations, and to posterity. My own grandmother.

00:05:56,674 --> 00:05:58,238
SPEAKER_0:  I was born in Trinidad and Tobago.

00:05:58,626 --> 00:05:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  She was illiterate.

00:05:59,778 --> 00:06:04,734
SPEAKER_0:  till her dying days in East Orange, New Jersey. She never had the chance to.

00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  write down her memories of her life in Trinidad.

00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,710
SPEAKER_0:  as a young woman and what it meant. She, of course.

00:06:12,386 --> 00:06:16,446
SPEAKER_0:  lots of children and she was able to impart some stories to her children and grandchildren.

00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  but I often think about with someone with her wit and intelligence.

00:06:21,122 --> 00:06:21,694
SPEAKER_0:  could have done.

00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:23,902
SPEAKER_0:  with a little bit more support.

00:06:24,642 --> 00:06:24,990
SPEAKER_1:  But...

00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,422
SPEAKER_1:  If all human beings have intrinsic value.

00:06:27,746 --> 00:06:29,246
SPEAKER_1:  You don't have to be an Einstein.

00:06:29,954 --> 00:06:32,286
SPEAKER_1:  for the application of some of the ideas that you're talking about.

00:06:32,738 --> 00:06:33,758
SPEAKER_1:  Is there a tension?

00:06:34,402 --> 00:06:35,838
SPEAKER_1:  or a trade-off between.

00:06:37,442 --> 00:06:39,742
SPEAKER_1:  our human civilization, our society.

00:06:40,194 --> 00:06:41,534
SPEAKER_1:  Helping the unlucky.

00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:43,294
SPEAKER_1:  versus rewarding.

00:06:44,802 --> 00:06:47,006
SPEAKER_1:  the skillful and the hardworking.

00:06:47,618 --> 00:06:48,542
SPEAKER_0:  I think you could do both.

00:06:48,802 --> 00:06:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  There's always a balance between the two.

00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:54,334
SPEAKER_0:  I think it would reward people who make innovations and...

00:06:54,562 --> 00:06:57,758
SPEAKER_0:  and we would improve lives for everyone through their innovations.

00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:03,934
SPEAKER_0:  by giving them even more consumption, even that level of inequality, while still making sure

00:07:04,546 --> 00:07:05,822
SPEAKER_0:  there's not people in.

00:07:06,146 --> 00:07:08,958
SPEAKER_0:  in poverty and suffering and while making sure that

00:07:09,282 --> 00:07:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  Hey, we're gonna...

00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:12,254
SPEAKER_0:  Give these people.

00:07:12,482 --> 00:07:14,302
SPEAKER_0:  who want to work.

00:07:14,754 --> 00:07:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  that extra 10 hours or 20 hours or want to apply.

00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:19,998
SPEAKER_0:  their hard work.

00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  Um, some, some extra.

00:07:22,306 --> 00:07:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  Benefits?

00:07:23,202 --> 00:07:25,278
SPEAKER_0:  but that these benefits would be.

00:07:25,986 --> 00:07:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  not the extreme disparities that you have today.

00:07:29,122 --> 00:07:29,566
SPEAKER_1:  So.

00:07:30,146 --> 00:07:31,230
SPEAKER_1:  at the core of

00:07:31,522 --> 00:07:33,918
SPEAKER_1:  socialism and maybe democratic socialism.

00:07:34,274 --> 00:07:37,694
SPEAKER_1:  is maybe a reallocation of wealth, reallocation of resources.

00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's wealth and resources, yes, but it's also power.

00:07:41,634 --> 00:07:43,614
SPEAKER_0:  And I guess one way to think about this is.

00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:46,430
SPEAKER_0:  Some thinkers on the right.

00:07:46,658 --> 00:07:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  like Hayek, they would say in their most generous moments talking about socialists and socialism.

00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:52,670
SPEAKER_0:  They would say...

00:07:53,026 --> 00:07:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  Socialists want.

00:07:55,106 --> 00:07:56,958
SPEAKER_0:  to trade some of your freedom.

00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:58,206
SPEAKER_0:  for equality.

00:07:59,426 --> 00:08:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  And that's them trying to just.

00:08:01,762 --> 00:08:04,606
SPEAKER_0:  accurately describe what socialism is trying to do.

00:08:04,898 --> 00:08:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  The way that I would put it is a little bit different.

00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:07,774
SPEAKER_0:  Socialist.

00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  are proposing a trade-off, but it's really a trade-off between freedom and freedom.

00:08:13,154 --> 00:08:14,142
SPEAKER_0:  And by that I mean...

00:08:14,658 --> 00:08:17,342
SPEAKER_0:  Let's say you set up a successful business.

00:08:18,242 --> 00:08:18,878
SPEAKER_0:  And you set up.

00:08:19,202 --> 00:08:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  business.

00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  right here in Austin, Texas.

00:08:22,146 --> 00:08:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  some sort of firm, it's producing some widget or whatever and it's producing

00:08:28,898 --> 00:08:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  a good that people really want and demand.

00:08:31,586 --> 00:08:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  but you have some competition.

00:08:33,602 --> 00:08:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  Um, you...

00:08:34,978 --> 00:08:37,982
SPEAKER_0:  decide to hire 20, 30 people to help you.

00:08:38,242 --> 00:08:40,638
SPEAKER_0:  you entered into a free contract with these people.

00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  who under capitalism of course, we're not living in feudalism, have the option to join any other firm, but they like you and they like this firm and they like your offer and you're paying them, that's a no problem.

00:08:52,514 --> 00:08:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  $20 an hour.

00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  for.

00:08:54,946 --> 00:08:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:08:55,746 --> 00:08:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  40 hours of work per week.

00:08:58,114 --> 00:08:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  Now.

00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  if the government comes along.

00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  and says...

00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:06,814
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, there's now a new minimum wage. Minimum wage is $22 an hour.

00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:09,502
SPEAKER_0:  And also there's a maximum workweek, 35.

00:09:09,922 --> 00:09:11,070
SPEAKER_0:  uh, our work week.

00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  And if you work someone over 35 hours, even if they agree, you have to pay them time and a half.

00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  Now.

00:09:18,146 --> 00:09:20,286
SPEAKER_0:  That, of course, is now an abridgment.

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  of your freedom as an entrepreneur, your freedom to set certain terms of employment.

00:09:25,282 --> 00:09:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  to engage in a contract with free people.

00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,878
SPEAKER_0:  but now your workers and other workers in the sector.

00:09:31,106 --> 00:09:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  Because if you did it unilaterally, you just get undercut by your competition.

00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  Now these people now have a few extra hours a week. They can do whatever they want with, you know, they could.

00:09:39,682 --> 00:09:40,478
SPEAKER_0:  Watch more.

00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:49,246
SPEAKER_0:  NFL with it, they could spend more time with their friends or family or whatever else, and they're still getting paid the same if not better because the wages also.

00:09:49,698 --> 00:09:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  went up.

00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  So it's really a question.

00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  Often.

00:09:52,898 --> 00:09:54,302
SPEAKER_0:  of trade-offs between.

00:09:54,562 --> 00:09:59,550
SPEAKER_0:  Whose freedom and autonomy are you going to prioritize? The freedom and autonomy.

00:09:59,778 --> 00:10:00,574
SPEAKER_0:  of the

00:10:00,802 --> 00:10:01,534
SPEAKER_0:  Entrepreneur.

00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  or the capitalists in this case, or the freedom of autonomy of

00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  ordinary workers.

00:10:06,818 --> 00:10:09,342
SPEAKER_0:  Now you could create a society that swings.

00:10:09,602 --> 00:10:11,486
SPEAKER_0:  so far in the direction of.

00:10:11,938 --> 00:10:12,574
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:19,742
SPEAKER_0:  prioritizing the freedom of one group or one class or whatever else compared to another, and you end up in some sort of tyranny.

00:10:20,034 --> 00:10:21,022
SPEAKER_0:  Now if the state said

00:10:21,858 --> 00:10:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  You know, you Lex.

00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:25,694
SPEAKER_0:  You're a capitalist, so you don't get the right to vote.

00:10:26,338 --> 00:10:27,230
SPEAKER_0:  or we're gonna take.

00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  away your private home or your ability to do.

00:10:31,426 --> 00:10:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  things we think are intrinsic human rights. Now this would be tyranny, this would be an abridgment.

00:10:36,546 --> 00:10:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  of your rights.

00:10:38,882 --> 00:10:41,438
SPEAKER_0:  but shaping your ability in the economic sphere.

00:10:41,794 --> 00:10:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  to be an economic actor.

00:10:43,714 --> 00:10:47,038
SPEAKER_0:  is, I think, within the realm and scope of democratic politics.

00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,038
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, so those are the extremes you're referring to and.

00:10:52,322 --> 00:10:56,734
SPEAKER_1:  One perspective I would like to take on socialism versus capitalism is

00:10:58,082 --> 00:11:02,750
SPEAKER_1:  under each system, the extremes of each system and the moderate versions of each system.

00:11:04,194 --> 00:11:06,046
SPEAKER_1:  How can people take advantage of it?

00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,542
SPEAKER_1:  So it seems like no matter what.

00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,078
SPEAKER_1:  part of human nature is.

00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:14,686
SPEAKER_1:  whatever the rules, whatever the framework, whatever the system, somebody's going to take advantage of it.

00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:15,934
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

00:11:16,386 --> 00:11:16,926
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:11:17,698 --> 00:11:21,886
SPEAKER_1:  That's the kind of pragmatic look at it in practice. What actually happens?

00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:23,102
SPEAKER_1:  Also.

00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:29,566
SPEAKER_1:  the incentives and the human behavior, what actually happens in practice under these systems.

00:11:29,954 --> 00:11:32,606
SPEAKER_1:  So if you have a higher and higher minimum wage.

00:11:33,122 --> 00:11:35,038
SPEAKER_1:  and people watch more and more NFL.

00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:40,030
SPEAKER_1:  How does that change their actual behavior as a productive member of society?

00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:41,918
SPEAKER_1:  And actually at the individual level.

00:11:42,722 --> 00:11:43,646
SPEAKER_1:  as somebody.

00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,942
SPEAKER_1:  As somebody who could be an Einstein...

00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:50,270
SPEAKER_1:  and chooses not to because NFL is so awesome to watch.

00:11:50,786 --> 00:11:54,494
SPEAKER_1:  So like, is both how do people, malicious people that want to take advantage?

00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:56,158
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe not malicious, but-

00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:57,950
SPEAKER_1:  people that

00:11:58,434 --> 00:12:01,342
SPEAKER_1:  like me are lazy and want to take advantage.

00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:03,230
SPEAKER_1:  uh... and people that

00:12:04,194 --> 00:12:07,710
SPEAKER_1:  Also, I think like me, like I tend to believe about myself that I have

00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,374
SPEAKER_1:  potential.

00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:10,846
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:12:11,074 --> 00:12:14,910
SPEAKER_1:  If I let my laziness naturally take over, which it often does.

00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:16,894
SPEAKER_1:  I won't materialize the potential.

00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:18,942
SPEAKER_1:  So if you...

00:12:19,682 --> 00:12:24,510
SPEAKER_1:  If you make life too easy for me, I feel like I will never get anything done. Me personally.

00:12:24,802 --> 00:12:26,942
SPEAKER_1:  Of course, there's a giant.

00:12:27,202 --> 00:12:28,894
SPEAKER_1:  set of circumstances of the.

00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:32,926
SPEAKER_1:  unlucky and the overburden and so on. Okay, so how can.

00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,638
SPEAKER_1:  People take advantage of each system, socialism, capitalism.

00:12:37,186 --> 00:12:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  So for one thing, people are going to take advantage of systems. They're going to find loopholes. They're going to find ways around. They're going to find ways to...

00:12:44,322 --> 00:12:44,798
SPEAKER_0:  to.

00:12:45,026 --> 00:12:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  at times dominate and coerce others even in systems meant to get rid of domination and coercion.

00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,174
SPEAKER_0:  That's why we need to design our systems in such a way that...

00:12:54,658 --> 00:12:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  that it eliminates as many of these things as possible. And also that's why we need democracy. We need freedom.

00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  So in a Soviet system, for instance.

00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  you had the rise of this authoritarian bureaucracy.

00:13:07,362 --> 00:13:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  dominating of course others in the name of socialism.

00:13:10,946 --> 00:13:11,454
SPEAKER_0:  now.

00:13:12,226 --> 00:13:12,926
SPEAKER_0:  that system.

00:13:13,154 --> 00:13:15,294
SPEAKER_0:  desperately could have used some.

00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  political democracy and some checks on what people were doing and some ability to reverse the power, right?

00:13:21,474 --> 00:13:28,414
SPEAKER_0:  And as soon as, of course, little elements of democracy was brought to that system, the system collapsed because

00:13:28,802 --> 00:13:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  there's starting to be outlets for dissent and for dissatisfaction.

00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:35,710
SPEAKER_0:  So I think we can't design a priori.

00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  A perfect system.

00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  We need to be committed to certain principles.

00:13:39,554 --> 00:13:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  that allow systems to be perfected.

00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,278
SPEAKER_0:  And for me, that's the importance of democracy.

00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:48,350
SPEAKER_0:  So even a few years ago, not to go on a tangent, but.

00:13:48,898 --> 00:13:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  Um, people are allowed in.

00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  Chinese authoritarianism and they're saying China's building this efficient system. The state runs so well. There's technocratic excellence.

00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  Plus there's just productivity and they're just working harder than Americans and whatever else.

00:14:04,482 --> 00:14:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  but look at in practice what really happened with COVID.

00:14:07,586 --> 00:14:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  both.

00:14:08,322 --> 00:14:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  the initial suppressing of information about what was happening in Wuhan and the outbreak for many gone vale

00:14:15,362 --> 00:14:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  ordinary Chinese workers and doctors and others were trying to get the word out and they were suppressed.

00:14:20,546 --> 00:14:30,910
SPEAKER_0:  by Communist Party officials locally in Wuhan, probably with the collusion naturally, nationally, and now with zero COVID policies and whatever else.

00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,254
SPEAKER_0:  I think that.

00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  that often we find that even though it seems like these are

00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:47,902
SPEAKER_0:  are weak systems and democracy makes us less competent technocratically and otherwise, I think it's kind of a necessity for systems to grow and evolve to have that freedom in civil society.

00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  But as for individuals...

00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:50,558
SPEAKER_0:  Now.

00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,582
SPEAKER_0:  The first part of it is, yeah, I think people should be free to make their own choices.

00:14:55,874 --> 00:14:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  you might have tremendous potential.

00:14:57,858 --> 00:15:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  but you might choose to spend it in leisure. And leisure doesn't-

00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  Only mean.

00:15:02,914 --> 00:15:10,558
SPEAKER_0:  doing, you know, sitting around at home, drinking a bunch of beers, kind of wasting your life away that way. Leisure might mean spending more time with your friends and family.

00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  building these sort of relationships that are gonna...

00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:20,862
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe not change the world in some meta sense, but we'll change the lives of the people around you and we'll change your community.

00:15:21,218 --> 00:15:22,238
SPEAKER_0:  for the better.

00:15:22,434 --> 00:15:28,734
SPEAKER_1:  I'm taking notes here because for me, Leisure just meant playing a lot of Skyrim. This whole family relationship that I'm going to have to-

00:15:29,442 --> 00:15:34,270
SPEAKER_1:  work on that. I didn't realize that's also including leisure. So I'm going to have to reconsider my whole life here.

00:15:34,562 --> 00:15:40,606
SPEAKER_0:  Hey, leisure should mean civic activity too, right? I mean, there's that famous book, the Robert Putnam one.

00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  bowling alone or whatever, which describe that for now. I mean, I'm, I'm, it was more 1989, I like.

00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  you know, video and computer games, you know.

00:15:49,538 --> 00:15:56,286
SPEAKER_0:  Um, so I definitely do that type of leisure too, but, uh, I found a lot more richness in my life when-

00:15:56,546 --> 00:16:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  In the last decade, a lot of my leisure has returned to going to the local bar for the couple drinks I have a week instead of doing it at home.

00:16:05,026 --> 00:16:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  alone watching TV or something, you know, because you get that random conversation, that sense of a place and belonging.

00:16:14,018 --> 00:16:14,846
SPEAKER_0:  I guess what's

00:16:15,554 --> 00:16:17,662
SPEAKER_0:  The undercurrent maybe of your question was...

00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  Now if you have a system...

00:16:20,002 --> 00:16:21,790
SPEAKER_0:  with lots of carrots, but not the whip.

00:16:22,338 --> 00:16:22,686
SPEAKER_0:  of

00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  Hey.

00:16:23,618 --> 00:16:27,838
SPEAKER_0:  You might be destitute, you might be unemployed, you might not be able to support.

00:16:28,482 --> 00:16:31,422
SPEAKER_0:  yourself unless you're you're working a certain amount.

00:16:32,002 --> 00:16:33,758
SPEAKER_0:  would we still be as...

00:16:34,146 --> 00:16:34,622
SPEAKER_0:  productive.

00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  would we still be able to generate?

00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,550
SPEAKER_0:  enough value for society.

00:16:39,938 --> 00:16:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:16:41,122 --> 00:16:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that that's a question that is.

00:16:44,482 --> 00:16:48,222
SPEAKER_0:  quite interesting. I think that we're living in a society now.

00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  with enough abundance?

00:16:50,338 --> 00:16:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  that we could afford?

00:16:52,898 --> 00:16:54,526
SPEAKER_0:  more people deciding to.

00:16:54,754 --> 00:16:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  Opt out.

00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,982
SPEAKER_0:  of the system out of production.

00:16:58,658 --> 00:17:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  and that the carrots...

00:17:00,418 --> 00:17:01,630
SPEAKER_0:  of staying in.

00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  you know, more money for consumption.

00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  more ability to do cool things, more just social rewards that comes from being successful or from providing.

00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:16,510
SPEAKER_0:  would be enough, but that's another thing that would have to be balanced in a system.

00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  So if we're seeing.

00:17:18,274 --> 00:17:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  Mass.

00:17:19,554 --> 00:17:23,422
SPEAKER_0:  unemployment by choice in a democratic socialist system.

00:17:24,162 --> 00:17:25,534
SPEAKER_0:  then you might need to.

00:17:25,762 --> 00:17:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  reconfigure the incentives. You might need to encourage people to go back into production.

00:17:30,338 --> 00:17:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  But that's something that again, you could do through.

00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  democracy and through good governance. You don't have to set the perfect blueprint.

00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:39,550
SPEAKER_0:  I'm in motion.

00:17:39,842 --> 00:17:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  Um, you know, write up a treatise now and 50 years from now, you know, try to follow it like it's scripture.

00:17:46,434 --> 00:17:51,358
SPEAKER_1:  So by the way, I do like how you said whip instead of stick in a carrot and stick.

00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:55,678
SPEAKER_1:  That's putting a weight on the scale of which is better.

00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:56,958
SPEAKER_1:  But yes.

00:17:58,274 --> 00:18:03,454
SPEAKER_1:  But I would actually argue to push back that wealthier we get as a society, as a world.

00:18:04,098 --> 00:18:05,534
SPEAKER_1:  that the more comfortable.

00:18:06,242 --> 00:18:07,646
SPEAKER_1:  the social nets become.

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,310
SPEAKER_1:  The...

00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:13,118
SPEAKER_1:  So the less of a whip or stick they become.

00:18:13,986 --> 00:18:18,590
SPEAKER_1:  Because one of the negative consequences, even if you're on welfare, is like, well, life is not going to be that great.

00:18:19,554 --> 00:18:20,126
SPEAKER_1:  But.

00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:22,782
SPEAKER_1:  the wealthier we become.

00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,246
SPEAKER_1:  the better the social programs become.

00:18:25,794 --> 00:18:28,190
SPEAKER_1:  the easier life becomes at the bottom.

00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:30,782
SPEAKER_1:  So you might not have this.

00:18:31,714 --> 00:18:32,670
SPEAKER_1:  Motivation

00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:34,110
SPEAKER_1:  financially.

00:18:34,434 --> 00:18:35,582
SPEAKER_1:  to get out from the bottom.

00:18:36,034 --> 00:18:38,206
SPEAKER_1:  That said, the pushback and the pushback.

00:18:38,594 --> 00:18:41,790
SPEAKER_1:  is that there is something about human nature in general, money aside.

00:18:42,178 --> 00:18:43,998
SPEAKER_1:  that strives for greatness.

00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:46,334
SPEAKER_1:  that strives to provide.

00:18:47,202 --> 00:18:47,646
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:51,006
SPEAKER_1:  A great life, a great middle class life for your family.

00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:51,774
SPEAKER_1:  So

00:18:52,258 --> 00:18:54,750
SPEAKER_1:  That's the motivator to get off from the bottom.

00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I think a lot of people who are stuck at the bottom of the labor market today.

00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:19:00,738 --> 00:19:03,550
SPEAKER_0:  One, these are people who are kind of are.

00:19:03,938 --> 00:19:09,246
SPEAKER_0:  are true philanthropists, because a lot of them are the ones who are working two jobs and are working 60 plus hours.

00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  and are providing.

00:19:11,202 --> 00:19:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  In this country, it's such a such a bargain for their labor because they're so underpaid.

00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  So many of the things that the rest of us use to to enjoy life and consumption or whatever else like

00:19:22,978 --> 00:19:34,270
SPEAKER_0:  I got here from downtown Austin, and I think my Lyft, you know, I did tip, but I think my Lyft was like eight bucks base or whatever else, you know, it's the...

00:19:34,594 --> 00:19:35,838
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

00:19:36,386 --> 00:19:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  We are all indebted to people who are working and we don't see it at various stages of the production process.

00:19:44,322 --> 00:19:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  from the workers in China and Taiwan producing.

00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:52,350
SPEAKER_0:  you know, technological things that we're recording this on.

00:19:52,578 --> 00:19:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  to, you know.

00:19:54,946 --> 00:20:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  growers and workers and agriculture in the US. So I think that one.

00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,702
SPEAKER_0:  working class people are already working. But as far as-

00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  getting out from under.

00:20:07,234 --> 00:20:09,470
SPEAKER_0:  poverty and desperation.

00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  We're in a society that-

00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:14,302
SPEAKER_0:  doesn't give people a lot of tools. So if you.

00:20:14,658 --> 00:20:17,182
SPEAKER_0:  don't have access to good public schools.

00:20:17,538 --> 00:20:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  from

00:20:18,626 --> 00:20:19,454
SPEAKER_0:  You know, age.

00:20:19,842 --> 00:20:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  five until 12, 13, it's going to be really hard to move from generations of your family being involved in manual labor.

00:20:29,314 --> 00:20:36,830
SPEAKER_0:  to doing other forms of labor. You're gonna be stuck at a certain part of our labor market as a result.

00:20:37,218 --> 00:20:40,478
SPEAKER_0:  if you don't have access to decent health care.

00:20:40,738 --> 00:20:45,214
SPEAKER_0:  you know, throughout your life, you might be already preordained to an early...

00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  grave by the time that something kicks in, you really want to change something in your life in your mid-20s. Obviously, it's a combination of agency.

00:20:54,434 --> 00:20:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  and all these other factors. They stole it!

00:20:57,122 --> 00:21:00,830
SPEAKER_0:  I think innately human, innately striving, than a lot of people.

00:21:01,122 --> 00:21:04,766
SPEAKER_0:  but we don't really give people in our current society the tools.

00:21:04,994 --> 00:21:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  to really be full participants in our society. We just take for granted, for example.

00:21:09,986 --> 00:21:14,110
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm from the Northeast, so I give excessively Northeast examples. We take for granted that-

00:21:14,562 --> 00:21:15,518
SPEAKER_0:  that someone from.

00:21:16,162 --> 00:21:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  you know, Hartford, Connecticut is gonna have...

00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:23,006
SPEAKER_0:  your average working class person in Harvard is going to have a very different life outcome.

00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,686
SPEAKER_0:  than someone born on the same day, the same hour.

00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:31,198
SPEAKER_0:  and in Greenwich, Connecticut. You know, we take for granted.

00:21:32,322 --> 00:21:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  accidents of birth are going to dictate.

00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,262
SPEAKER_0:  outcomes.

00:21:35,682 --> 00:21:36,510
SPEAKER_1:  So you mean like...

00:21:37,058 --> 00:21:39,774
SPEAKER_1:  depending on the conditions of where you grew up.

00:21:40,578 --> 00:21:44,030
SPEAKER_1:  There's going to be fundamentally different experience in terms of education.

00:21:44,546 --> 00:21:46,494
SPEAKER_1:  in terms of the resources available to you.

00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:48,574
SPEAKER_1:  to allow yourself to flourish.

00:21:49,122 --> 00:21:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, of course today in a rich-

00:21:51,202 --> 00:21:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  and Connecticut is great. It's highly, highly underrated. Both New Yorkers and people from Boston.

00:21:56,866 --> 00:21:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  Kind of have a

00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:09,598
SPEAKER_0:  colonial feeling about Connecticut where we make fun of it and we try to carve it up, you know, the West belongs to New York, the East to Boston, but you know, I'm here for, you know, Connecticut nationalism. I think it's a great place.

00:22:10,242 --> 00:22:10,622
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

00:22:12,002 --> 00:22:15,678
SPEAKER_1:  Can we actually step back a little bit on definitions? Because you said that.

00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:20,222
SPEAKER_1:  Some of the ideas practically that you're playing with is democratic socialism.

00:22:21,282 --> 00:22:23,358
SPEAKER_1:  We talked about the higher level.

00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:27,806
SPEAKER_1:  the higher kind of vision of socialism, the ideals, the philosophical ideas.

00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,830
SPEAKER_1:  but how does it all fit into the big picture historically?

00:22:33,122 --> 00:22:34,558
SPEAKER_1:  of ideas of Marxism.

00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,190
SPEAKER_1:  communism.

00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  and socialism as it was defined and experienced and implemented in the 20th century. So what's your key differences? Maybe even just like.

00:22:45,602 --> 00:22:46,750
SPEAKER_1:  Socialism Communism.

00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:47,646
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:22:47,778 --> 00:22:51,454
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I hate the no true Scotsman sort of response to this, which is

00:22:51,906 --> 00:22:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, that socialism is bad.

00:22:54,146 --> 00:22:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  So it wasn't really socialism. And my socialism is good, so it is socialism.

00:22:58,658 --> 00:23:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  But I think that.

00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:04,318
SPEAKER_0:  socialism and communism share a common ancestor.

00:23:04,994 --> 00:23:06,686
SPEAKER_0:  which is they both emerged.

00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  out of the turmoil and development of late.

00:23:10,914 --> 00:23:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  19th century capitalism.

00:23:13,858 --> 00:23:17,854
SPEAKER_0:  and the fact that there was all these workers parties that were organizing.

00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  across the capitalist world.

00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:20,414
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  So in Europe, for instance.

00:23:22,978 --> 00:23:26,942
SPEAKER_0:  you had this mass party called the German Social Democratic Party.

00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  And the became.

00:23:30,338 --> 00:23:36,766
SPEAKER_0:  probably the most important, the most vibrant party in Germany in the 1880s and 1890s, but they were locked out.

00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  a power because Germany at the time was...

00:23:39,746 --> 00:23:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  still mostly a Tarkic, you know, it had a parliamentary democracy, but it was a very

00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  undemocratic democracy. The Kaiser still ruled. These movements took root across.

00:23:51,874 --> 00:23:55,358
SPEAKER_0:  the capitalist world, but including in Russia and in conditions of illegality.

00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:56,638
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:23:57,154 --> 00:24:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  It was assumed for many, many years in the workers movement across Europe and among socialists of Europe.

00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  They call themselves social democrats, then.

00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  that.

00:24:06,562 --> 00:24:08,862
SPEAKER_0:  The revolution would first probably happen in Germany.

00:24:09,122 --> 00:24:10,910
SPEAKER_0:  in this developed growing hub.

00:24:11,234 --> 00:24:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  of industrial capitalism and not in semi-feudal.

00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:16,062
SPEAKER_0:  Russia.

00:24:16,962 --> 00:24:17,406
SPEAKER_0:  But then.

00:24:17,698 --> 00:24:18,878
SPEAKER_0:  Warfare 1 came.

00:24:19,202 --> 00:24:19,678
SPEAKER_0:  The.

00:24:19,906 --> 00:24:25,246
SPEAKER_0:  workers movement was split between parties that decided to either keep their head down or to

00:24:25,474 --> 00:24:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  implicitly support.

00:24:26,946 --> 00:24:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  The war.

00:24:27,778 --> 00:24:31,294
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and then, you know, support the war for now or keep your heads down. Don't get-

00:24:31,586 --> 00:24:34,974
SPEAKER_0:  ban, don't get arrested, then we'll just take power after.

00:24:35,426 --> 00:24:36,446
SPEAKER_0:  The war is over.

00:24:36,994 --> 00:24:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  and those like Russia.

00:24:38,498 --> 00:24:40,190
SPEAKER_0:  and also in the United States for that matter.

00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:43,038
SPEAKER_0:  that shows the path of resistance.

00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,286
SPEAKER_0:  to the war.

00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  and it was the Bolshevik faction of the Russian movement.

00:24:51,874 --> 00:24:58,878
SPEAKER_0:  Lenin's Bolshevik party that took power in Russia after a period of turmoil where it didn't seem to be a good thing. But it's a good thing that Lenin's Bolshevik party took power in Russia after a period

00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  Well, was it going to go to the fascist right, or was it going to go to the far left? There was a period of flux and turmoil.

00:25:04,738 --> 00:25:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  in Russia, but definitely the old regime was not able to stand.

00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,318
SPEAKER_0:  and these Russian social democrats, these Bolsheviks.

00:25:13,186 --> 00:25:13,534
SPEAKER_0:  said.

00:25:14,114 --> 00:25:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  Social democracy.

00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  Hesso betrayed the idea.

00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  of internationalism and brotherhood and progress that we're supposed to stand for, that we can't call ourselves social democrats anymore.

00:25:24,418 --> 00:25:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  We're going to go back to this old term that Marx used.

00:25:27,266 --> 00:25:28,734
SPEAKER_0:  we're gonna call ourselves communists.

00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  And that's where.

00:25:31,298 --> 00:25:32,030
SPEAKER_0:  official.

00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  of communism out of Russia emerged.

00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,310
SPEAKER_0:  other parts of Europe.

00:25:37,826 --> 00:25:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  parties were actually able to take power, some in the interwar period, but most in the postwar period.

00:25:43,586 --> 00:25:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  And they also came out of this.

00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  old social democratic movement.

00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  and these parties mostly just call themselves socialists.

00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:52,670
SPEAKER_0:  and a lot of them still on paper.

00:25:52,962 --> 00:25:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  wanted to go beyond capitalism, but in practice, they just managed capitalism better in the interest of workers.

00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  But they all had the same common ancestor.

00:26:03,426 --> 00:26:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  And in practice...

00:26:05,474 --> 00:26:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  to me.

00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:07,774
SPEAKER_0:  Social democracy.

00:26:08,322 --> 00:26:08,862
SPEAKER_0:  means

00:26:09,218 --> 00:26:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  trying to insert doses of socialism within capitalism.

00:26:13,218 --> 00:26:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  but maintaining capitalism.

00:26:15,138 --> 00:26:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  Communism meant this attempt to build a socialism outside of capitalism.

00:26:20,002 --> 00:26:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  and often.

00:26:21,026 --> 00:26:23,102
SPEAKER_0:  authoritarian ways, in part.

00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:24,158
SPEAKER_0:  Because of.

00:26:24,706 --> 00:26:32,542
SPEAKER_0:  the ideology of these communists, but in part because of the conditions in which they inherited. They were inheriting a democracy, they were inheriting a country that had been...

00:26:32,802 --> 00:26:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  Alright.

00:26:33,506 --> 00:26:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  A rule by the Tsar is for-

00:26:35,714 --> 00:26:36,638
SPEAKER_0:  you know, for centuries.

00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:47,102
SPEAKER_0:  And with very little condition, like a very weak working class, you know, very, you know, poor and devastated by war and so on where authoritarianism kind of landed itself.

00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,446
SPEAKER_0:  to those conditions.

00:26:49,154 --> 00:26:49,726
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:26:50,018 --> 00:26:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  Then there's me. Then there's democratic socialists and the way I would define it is

00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  We like a lot of what the social democrats accomplished.

00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  but we still believe in going beyond capitalism and not just building socialism within capitalism, but we believe in this ultimate vision of a world.

00:27:08,034 --> 00:27:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  capitalism.

00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:10,398
SPEAKER_1:  What is that world?

00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:14,366
SPEAKER_1:  look like and how is it different from communism? actually maybe we can linger

00:27:14,882 --> 00:27:17,470
SPEAKER_1:  Before we talk about your vision of democratic socialism.

00:27:18,434 --> 00:27:20,670
SPEAKER_1:  What was wrong with communism?

00:27:21,154 --> 00:27:25,470
SPEAKER_1:  Stalinism, implementation of communism in the Soviet Union. Why did it go wrong?

00:27:26,722 --> 00:27:30,142
SPEAKER_1:  So and in what ways did it not go wrong? In what ways did it succeed?

00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  Let me start with the second part of that question. And that's a very difficult one to answer in part because...

00:27:36,258 --> 00:27:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  I morally and ethically.

00:27:38,434 --> 00:27:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  I'm opposed to any form of authoritarianism or dictatorship.

00:27:42,754 --> 00:27:44,222
SPEAKER_0:  and often when you talk about.

00:27:44,674 --> 00:27:47,358
SPEAKER_0:  the successes of a government or what it did.

00:27:47,618 --> 00:27:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  developmentally that might have been positive.

00:27:49,986 --> 00:27:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  we have to abstract ourselves from what we morally believe and just kind of look at the record, right?

00:27:56,898 --> 00:27:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  I would say that

00:27:58,338 --> 00:27:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  The.

00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,926
SPEAKER_0:  Soviet experiment.

00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,366
SPEAKER_0:  Start it off.

00:28:02,946 --> 00:28:04,126
SPEAKER_0:  by in Lennon's time.

00:28:04,578 --> 00:28:05,118
SPEAKER_0:  as

00:28:05,826 --> 00:28:06,558
SPEAKER_0:  The attempt.

00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  to.

00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:09,150
SPEAKER_0:  kind of just a holding action.

00:28:09,858 --> 00:28:15,646
SPEAKER_0:  Hey, we don't really have the conditions to rule this country. We have the support of their working class, or most of it.

00:28:15,938 --> 00:28:17,438
SPEAKER_0:  for the working class is only.

00:28:17,826 --> 00:28:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  you know, 3% of the population.

00:28:20,226 --> 00:28:22,142
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the peasantry is really against us.

00:28:22,658 --> 00:28:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of this 3% of the population has died in war and half of them supported the Mensheviks and the more moderate socialists anyway.

00:28:31,298 --> 00:28:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  The alternative.

00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  in their minds was going to be.

00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  A far right reaction.

00:28:36,738 --> 00:28:37,662
SPEAKER_0:  You know, some sort of.

00:28:37,954 --> 00:28:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  general taking power in a coup or whatever else.

00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,038
SPEAKER_0:  or just them ending up.

00:28:43,778 --> 00:28:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  back in prison, because a lot of them were in prison under the Tsar, or just killed.

00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:28:48,162 --> 00:28:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  They figured.

00:28:49,538 --> 00:28:51,966
SPEAKER_0:  All right, we're going to have a holding action where we.

00:28:52,354 --> 00:28:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  maintain as much of this territory of

00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  the old Russian Empire as possible.

00:28:58,114 --> 00:28:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  We'll try to.

00:28:59,266 --> 00:29:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  slowly implement changes, re-stabilize the economy through something called the New Economic Program, which was kind of a...

00:29:05,826 --> 00:29:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  A form of...

00:29:07,362 --> 00:29:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  social democracy, if you will, is it allowed market exchange for the.

00:29:11,298 --> 00:29:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  peasants combined with state ownership of industries in the cities.

00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:16,830
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:29:17,954 --> 00:29:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  For a while it seemed to be working. The revolution never came that they were expecting in Western Europe.

00:29:22,978 --> 00:29:23,326
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  In Russia itself, they were able to restabilize things by the middle or end of the 1920s, and they were able to build more of a popular base for some of their policies because

00:29:33,186 --> 00:29:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  people who had seen.

00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  The chaos of-

00:29:35,586 --> 00:29:40,446
SPEAKER_0:  World War I and revolution and then civil war kind of just wanted stability.

00:29:40,674 --> 00:29:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:29:41,506 --> 00:29:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  after a decade plus of war, if you had a government that was able to...

00:29:45,602 --> 00:29:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  give you enough to eat and a job that was good enough for them.

00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  then stun.

00:29:51,618 --> 00:29:52,510
SPEAKER_0:  came into power.

00:29:53,026 --> 00:29:55,550
SPEAKER_0:  and he wanted to rapidly industrialize.

00:29:55,778 --> 00:29:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  And his logic was...

00:29:57,346 --> 00:29:59,198
SPEAKER_0:  The revolution's not gonna come in the West.

00:29:59,682 --> 00:30:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  We need to build socialism in one country.

00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  and we need to catch up with the West. We need to turn ourselves in an industrial powerhouse as quickly as possible.

00:30:08,034 --> 00:30:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  And that's where you got forced collectivization to try to increase.

00:30:11,842 --> 00:30:14,302
SPEAKER_0:  the productivity of Russian agriculture.

00:30:14,754 --> 00:30:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  through state ownership.

00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:19,870
SPEAKER_0:  of previously fragmented agricultural holdings.

00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  and through the...

00:30:21,506 --> 00:30:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:30:22,402 --> 00:30:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  implementation of mechanization. So bring in more machines to make agriculture more productive, all under state ownership.

00:30:29,858 --> 00:30:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  plus more ambitious attempts to build heavy industry through five-year plans.

00:30:35,842 --> 00:30:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  I say this kind of-

00:30:36,994 --> 00:30:39,230
SPEAKER_0:  But we know in practice what that meant.

00:30:39,618 --> 00:30:41,822
SPEAKER_0:  you know, force collectivization was a...

00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, first of all, I think was built on the faulty premise.

00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,078
SPEAKER_0:  that scale always equals more productivity when in fact.

00:30:50,594 --> 00:30:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  especially in agriculture, but in any field, it's a little bit more complicated than that.

00:30:54,466 --> 00:31:00,030
SPEAKER_0:  And it led to millions of deaths, you know, it led to famine, it led to a host of other problems.

00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,502
SPEAKER_0:  industrialization.

00:31:02,146 --> 00:31:09,054
SPEAKER_0:  in the way that it happened under Stalin, also kind of unbalanced the Soviet economy to lean too heavy towards heavy.

00:31:09,314 --> 00:31:12,350
SPEAKER_0:  industry, not enough for medium or light industry.

00:31:12,898 --> 00:31:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:31:13,986 --> 00:31:14,334
SPEAKER_0:  but.

00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  This.

00:31:16,258 --> 00:31:18,366
SPEAKER_0:  did mean especially the...

00:31:18,658 --> 00:31:20,638
SPEAKER_0:  the five-year plan and industrialization.

00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  Did.

00:31:22,434 --> 00:31:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  managed to put Russia on a different

00:31:25,826 --> 00:31:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  developmental trajectory.

00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  by the time the post-war period came.

00:31:32,578 --> 00:31:35,134
SPEAKER_0:  One, it might have gave them the ability to survive.

00:31:35,362 --> 00:31:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  the Nazi invasion to begin with. That's a complicated question. And then by the time the post-war period came...

00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  Russia had kind of jumped ahead of its developmental trajectory in a way that

00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:48,702
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of other countries didn't do. There are a few examples, like Japan is one.

00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  The banners too.

00:31:50,082 --> 00:31:50,846
SPEAKER_0:  if you kind of.

00:31:51,202 --> 00:31:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  ran a scenario where Japan would be in the 1870s, 1880s and ran it a hundred times.

00:31:57,602 --> 00:32:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  the Japan and post-war period is kind of one of the best outcomes, right?

00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that.

00:32:02,402 --> 00:32:03,582
SPEAKER_0:  that you could say that.

00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  about.

00:32:05,122 --> 00:32:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  Russian economic development.

00:32:07,234 --> 00:32:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  its ability to catch up at a certain level to the West.

00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,478
SPEAKER_0:  And then after that, of course, um...

00:32:13,538 --> 00:32:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  later on as

00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:32,254
SPEAKER_0:  economies got more complex as they kind of moved beyond regular heavy industry and as the main stable of the economy the Russian economy in its command system was unable to adapt and cope and ended up falling back behind the West again by the by the 1970s.

00:32:32,642 --> 00:32:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  So all this is a very long-

00:32:34,178 --> 00:32:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  story to say that

00:32:35,394 --> 00:32:40,734
SPEAKER_0:  A lot went wrong in Russia. The economic picture is actually a little bit more complicated. Politically, the economic picture is actually a little bit more complicated.

00:32:40,962 --> 00:32:42,526
SPEAKER_0:  I think it just.

00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  a small party without much popular support.

00:32:46,018 --> 00:32:50,366
SPEAKER_0:  but with real popular support in a couple of cities, and a lot without a lot of popular support.

00:32:50,658 --> 00:32:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  Empire Wide.

00:32:52,258 --> 00:32:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  took power.

00:32:53,922 --> 00:32:56,190
SPEAKER_0:  and they felt they couldn't get back power.

00:32:56,962 --> 00:32:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  and they kept holding on to power.

00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  and eventually among their ranks in these conditions.

00:33:02,882 --> 00:33:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

00:33:04,002 --> 00:33:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  One of history's great-

00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:09,406
SPEAKER_0:  The tyrants took power and was able to justify what he was doing.

00:33:09,858 --> 00:33:11,454
SPEAKER_0:  in the context of

00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  the Russian nation and development, but also all the threats that came from abroad.

00:33:16,738 --> 00:33:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  The Civil War wasn't just a Civil War, it was really an invasion by many imperial powers all around the world.

00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  as well. So I think a lot of it was conditions and circumstance.

00:33:29,122 --> 00:33:30,206
SPEAKER_0:  and I guess the-

00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  The question really is.

00:33:32,418 --> 00:33:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  to what role ideology played? Is there something within the socialist tradition that might have lent itself to authoritarianism? And that's something we should.

00:33:39,874 --> 00:33:42,910
SPEAKER_1:  You know, and that's really complicated human question.

00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,894
SPEAKER_1:  It does seem.

00:33:46,338 --> 00:33:46,910
SPEAKER_1:  that

00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:48,350
SPEAKER_1:  The rhetoric.

00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  the populism.

00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,190
SPEAKER_1:  of Workers Unite.

00:33:53,026 --> 00:33:55,678
SPEAKER_1:  We've been fucked over for way too long.

00:33:56,514 --> 00:33:57,694
SPEAKER_1:  Let's stand together.

00:33:58,626 --> 00:34:01,182
SPEAKER_1:  Somehow that message allows

00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:02,462
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:03,774
SPEAKER_1:  FLAWED

00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,078
SPEAKER_1:  or evil people to take power.

00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,638
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like the rhetoric...

00:34:09,058 --> 00:34:10,366
SPEAKER_1:  The idea is so good.

00:34:11,074 --> 00:34:14,430
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe the utopian nature of the idea is so good that it allows

00:34:14,914 --> 00:34:16,446
SPEAKER_1:  A great speaker to take power.

00:34:17,506 --> 00:34:18,910
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, is it's almost like.

00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:20,702
SPEAKER_1:  If the mission...

00:34:21,442 --> 00:34:21,950
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,806
SPEAKER_1:  Like come with me friends.

00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,342
SPEAKER_1:  Beyond the Horizon.

00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,390
SPEAKER_1:  A great land is waiting for us.

00:34:27,938 --> 00:34:29,886
SPEAKER_1:  uh... that encourages

00:34:30,274 --> 00:34:38,622
SPEAKER_1:  sort of yeah, dictators, authoritarians that take power. Is there something within the ideology that allows for that, for the sort of a...

00:34:39,266 --> 00:34:40,286
SPEAKER_1:  for lying to people.

00:34:40,802 --> 00:34:41,278
SPEAKER_1:  essentially.

00:34:42,562 --> 00:34:44,478
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I might surprise you with my answer, because I would say-

00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, maybe. But I think that-

00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  It's not just...

00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  Socialism.

00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:51,038
SPEAKER_0:  Any sort of...

00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  Ideology.

00:34:52,578 --> 00:34:53,534
SPEAKER_0:  that appeals.

00:34:53,986 --> 00:34:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  to...

00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  the collective and appeals to our long-term.

00:34:59,426 --> 00:35:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  Destiny.

00:35:00,418 --> 00:35:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  either as a species or as a nation or as a class or whatever else.

00:35:04,898 --> 00:35:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  can lend itself to authoritarianism.

00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:11,326
SPEAKER_0:  So you can see this in many of the nationalisms of the 20th century.

00:35:11,906 --> 00:35:13,694
SPEAKER_0:  Now some of these nationalisms.

00:35:14,274 --> 00:35:19,742
SPEAKER_0:  used incredibly lofty collective rhetoric like in Sweden.

00:35:20,098 --> 00:35:22,078
SPEAKER_0:  The Rhetoric of We're Gonna Create the People's Home.

00:35:22,466 --> 00:35:23,390
SPEAKER_0:  We're gonna make this.

00:35:23,618 --> 00:35:27,806
SPEAKER_0:  a country with dignity for all Swedes. We're going to make this a country that's more developed.

00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  more free, and so on.

00:35:30,018 --> 00:35:33,438
SPEAKER_0:  They managed to build a pretty excellent society in my estimation.

00:35:33,858 --> 00:35:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  From that.

00:35:34,946 --> 00:35:35,742
SPEAKER_0:  You know what I mean?

00:35:36,482 --> 00:35:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  countries like

00:35:37,474 --> 00:35:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  Fascist Germany and Italy, they managed to

00:35:40,226 --> 00:35:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  do horrendous things in Japan and horrendous things with that.

00:35:44,034 --> 00:35:50,750
SPEAKER_0:  in the US with national popular appeals, FDR was able to unite a nation to

00:35:50,978 --> 00:35:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  Elevate.

00:35:51,906 --> 00:35:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  ordinary working class people into a position where they felt like they had a real stake in the country.

00:35:57,314 --> 00:36:00,318
SPEAKER_0:  and I think did great things with the new deal.

00:36:00,674 --> 00:36:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:36:01,346 --> 00:36:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  And Russia, of course.

00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,118
SPEAKER_0:  this language was used.

00:36:05,474 --> 00:36:07,390
SPEAKER_0:  to trample upon individual rights.

00:36:08,034 --> 00:36:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  and to justify.

00:36:09,954 --> 00:36:11,006
SPEAKER_0:  hardship.

00:36:11,522 --> 00:36:12,190
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:36:12,578 --> 00:36:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  abuses of ordinary individual people in the name of a collective destiny. A destiny of course that was just decided by-

00:36:20,194 --> 00:36:25,598
SPEAKER_0:  party in power and during the 30s and 40s by just Don himself really.

00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  Now-

00:36:29,026 --> 00:36:29,598
SPEAKER_0:  I think that.

00:36:29,826 --> 00:36:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  that.

00:36:30,658 --> 00:36:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  That's really the case for...

00:36:33,634 --> 00:36:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  making sure that we have a bedrock of civil rights and democracy. And then on top of that, we can debate. We can debate different...

00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:40,670
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  national destinies. We can debate different appeals, different visions of the world.

00:36:46,978 --> 00:36:53,278
SPEAKER_0:  But as long as people have a say in what sacrifices they're being asked to do, and as long as those sacrifices

00:36:53,858 --> 00:36:57,022
SPEAKER_0:  don't take away what's fundamentally ours, which is.

00:36:57,442 --> 00:36:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  our life, which is our...

00:37:00,514 --> 00:37:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  you know, our basic.

00:37:02,146 --> 00:37:02,686
SPEAKER_0:  writes.

00:37:03,586 --> 00:37:04,158
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:37:04,898 --> 00:37:05,598
SPEAKER_1:  Voice.

00:37:06,082 --> 00:37:06,814
SPEAKER_1:  our voice.

00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,694
SPEAKER_1:  So this complicated picture.

00:37:10,818 --> 00:37:13,246
SPEAKER_1:  because help me understand.

00:37:14,306 --> 00:37:15,486
SPEAKER_1:  You mentioned that...

00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:17,982
SPEAKER_1:  Social Democracy.

00:37:18,818 --> 00:37:22,366
SPEAKER_1:  It's trying to have social policies within a capitalist system.

00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:23,518
SPEAKER_1:  and part.

00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:27,678
SPEAKER_1:  but your vision, your hope for a social democracy.

00:37:28,386 --> 00:37:30,302
SPEAKER_1:  is one that goes beyond that.

00:37:31,202 --> 00:37:33,086
SPEAKER_1:  How do you give everybody a voice?

00:37:34,146 --> 00:37:35,998
SPEAKER_1:  while not becoming the Soviet Union.

00:37:36,866 --> 00:37:38,142
SPEAKER_1:  while not becoming where...

00:37:38,402 --> 00:37:38,846
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

00:37:39,938 --> 00:37:43,518
SPEAKER_1:  Basically people are silenced either directly through violence or

00:37:43,874 --> 00:37:46,430
SPEAKER_1:  through the implied threat of violence and therefore fear.

00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  So I think you need to limit the scope.

00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:53,950
SPEAKER_0:  of where the state is and what the state can do and how the state functions. Uh no, first of all,

00:37:54,306 --> 00:37:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:37:55,074 --> 00:37:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  Now.

00:37:56,226 --> 00:37:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  For me.

00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  Social democracy.

00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:03,550
SPEAKER_0:  was like the equivalent of I'll give a football analogy.

00:38:04,514 --> 00:38:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  It was the equivalent of, you know, getting to the red zone.

00:38:07,042 --> 00:38:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  and then kicking a field goal.

00:38:08,322 --> 00:38:14,782
SPEAKER_0:  You'll take the three points, but you would have rather got a touchdown. And for me, socialism would be the touchdown. It's not a separate.

00:38:15,298 --> 00:38:16,350
SPEAKER_0:  different playing field.

00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:18,878
SPEAKER_1:  Some people would say socialism would be an interception.

00:38:19,618 --> 00:38:20,606
SPEAKER_0:  Sure, sure.

00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  No, and they would have the right to...

00:38:23,874 --> 00:38:27,262
SPEAKER_0:  to again, to say that and to say we shouldn't go.

00:38:27,554 --> 00:38:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  Go further.

00:38:28,546 --> 00:38:30,046
SPEAKER_1:  and most coaches would take.

00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  Come here.

00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:32,350
SPEAKER_1:  We take the safe route, right?

00:38:33,058 --> 00:38:34,142
SPEAKER_1:  See you going...

00:38:34,402 --> 00:38:41,726
SPEAKER_1:  You're going against the decision. Anyway, that she takes you for, but I understand. I understand. So for you, the goal is.

00:38:42,562 --> 00:38:43,422
SPEAKER_0:  for socialism.

00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  But I'll take the three points. You know, it's a part of, I just wanna march down the field. I want to get within scoring position. The reason why we should really move from this analogy, but the reason why I call myself a socialist is looking through

00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  on history and these examples of social democracy, you saw that

00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,702
SPEAKER_0:  they were able to give working class people.

00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  lots of rights and income and power in their society. But at the end of the day, capitalists still had the ultimate power, which is...

00:39:13,634 --> 00:39:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  to be ability.

00:39:14,722 --> 00:39:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  to withhold investment.

00:39:16,994 --> 00:39:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  So they could say...

00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:21,022
SPEAKER_0:  in the late 1960s and early 70s.

00:39:21,922 --> 00:39:24,222
SPEAKER_0:  Listen, I was fine with his arrangement 10 years ago.

00:39:24,994 --> 00:39:25,534
SPEAKER_0:  But now...

00:39:26,434 --> 00:39:27,678
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like I'm gonna...

00:39:27,938 --> 00:39:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  you know, take my money and I'm gonna go move to a different country or I'm just gonna not invest.

00:39:33,602 --> 00:39:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  because my workers are paid too much.

00:39:35,586 --> 00:39:42,110
SPEAKER_0:  I'm still making money, but I feel like I could be making more. I need more of an upper hand, right? To their economic power.

00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:43,422
SPEAKER_0:  is then.

00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  challenging the democratic mandate.

00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  of Swedish workers that were voting for the Social Democratic Party and were behind this

00:39:51,746 --> 00:39:52,510
SPEAKER_0:  this advance.

00:39:52,994 --> 00:39:55,166
SPEAKER_0:  So to me, what socialism is in part...

00:39:55,842 --> 00:39:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  is taking.

00:39:57,154 --> 00:40:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  the means of production, right, where this capitalist power is coming from.

00:40:00,706 --> 00:40:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  and making it socially owned so that

00:40:03,778 --> 00:40:08,830
SPEAKER_0:  ordinary workers can control their workplaces, can make investment decisions, and so on.

00:40:09,666 --> 00:40:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:11,198
SPEAKER_0:  Now

00:40:11,906 --> 00:40:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  does that mean total state ownership of everything or a planned economy? I don't think that.

00:40:16,546 --> 00:40:19,870
SPEAKER_0:  makes any sense. You know, I think that we should live in a society.

00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  in which markets are harnessed and regulated and so on.

00:40:25,314 --> 00:40:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  The problem is...

00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  capitalist ownership.

00:40:29,154 --> 00:40:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  In part.

00:40:30,018 --> 00:40:32,254
SPEAKER_0:  on normative grounds just because I think that

00:40:32,642 --> 00:40:37,566
SPEAKER_0:  It doesn't make sense that we celebrate democracy and all these other spheres, but we have workplaces.

00:40:38,178 --> 00:40:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  that are just.

00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:40,734
SPEAKER_0:  true to like tyrannies.

00:40:41,122 --> 00:40:41,598
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:40:42,242 --> 00:40:48,062
SPEAKER_0:  and in part because I think that ordinary workers would much prefer a system in which overtime

00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:48,958
SPEAKER_0:  day.

00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:57,342
SPEAKER_0:  accrued shares and ownership where they got, in addition to base kind of ways, they got dividends from their firm being successful.

00:40:58,178 --> 00:41:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  and that they figure it out how to.

00:41:00,642 --> 00:41:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  You know, large firms.

00:41:01,922 --> 00:41:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  They're not going to be making day-to-day decisions by democratic vote, right? But maybe you would elect representatives, elected managements, um, once every year or two, depending on your operating agreement and so on. That's kind of my, my vision.

00:41:15,746 --> 00:41:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  of a socialist society and this sounds

00:41:17,954 --> 00:41:18,462
SPEAKER_0:  I hope.

00:41:19,202 --> 00:41:20,606
SPEAKER_0:  Like, agree or disagree.

00:41:20,866 --> 00:41:24,158
SPEAKER_0:  Like it would not be a crazy leap into year zero.

00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:30,750
SPEAKER_0:  Right? This could be maybe a way in which we could take a lot of what's existing in society, but then just add this on top.

00:41:31,138 --> 00:41:32,382
SPEAKER_0:  But what it would mean is...

00:41:32,898 --> 00:41:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  a society.

00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  without a capitalist class.

00:41:36,802 --> 00:41:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  This class hasn't been.

00:41:38,786 --> 00:41:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  individually these people haven't been.

00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:45,790
SPEAKER_0:  taking to re-education camps or

00:41:46,018 --> 00:41:46,910
SPEAKER_0:  Whatever else.

00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  but they're just no longer in this position.

00:41:50,370 --> 00:42:00,606
SPEAKER_0:  and they're now part of the economy in other ways. They'll probably be the first set of highly competent technocrats and managers and so on. They'll probably be very well compensated for their.

00:42:00,834 --> 00:42:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  for their time and expertise and whatever else.

00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:04,894
SPEAKER_0:  But to me.

00:42:05,602 --> 00:42:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  both the practical end of things, like.

00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,454
SPEAKER_0:  taking away this ability to withhold investment.

00:42:11,874 --> 00:42:12,382
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  increasing our ability to democratically shape investment priorities.

00:42:17,154 --> 00:42:23,934
SPEAKER_0:  and to continue down the road of social democracy and on normative grounds by kind of egalitarian belief.

00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  that ordinary people should have more stake in their lives in the workplace.

00:42:30,338 --> 00:42:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  Um, leads me.

00:42:31,714 --> 00:42:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  beyond social democracy to socialism.

00:42:34,754 --> 00:42:36,318
SPEAKER_1:  So there is a tricky thing here.

00:42:36,546 --> 00:42:37,886
SPEAKER_1:  So in, in, uh...

00:42:38,338 --> 00:42:41,470
SPEAKER_1:  Ukraine especially, but in the Soviet Union, there's the cool ox.

00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:45,310
SPEAKER_1:  the possible trajectory of

00:42:45,634 --> 00:42:47,454
SPEAKER_1:  Fighting for the beautiful message.

00:42:48,322 --> 00:42:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  of respecting workers' rights.

00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:57,598
SPEAKER_1:  has this dynamic of making an enemy of the capitalist class.

00:42:58,274 --> 00:43:00,766
SPEAKER_1:  Too easily making an enemy of the capitalist class.

00:43:01,282 --> 00:43:02,238
SPEAKER_1:  with a central.

00:43:03,266 --> 00:43:03,934
SPEAKER_1:  leader.

00:43:04,418 --> 00:43:05,374
SPEAKER_1:  populist leader.

00:43:06,082 --> 00:43:06,974
SPEAKER_1:  that says...

00:43:07,778 --> 00:43:09,118
SPEAKER_1:  the rich and the powerful.

00:43:09,506 --> 00:43:11,006
SPEAKER_1:  they're taking advantage of you.

00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,686
SPEAKER_1:  We need to remove them, we need to put them in camps, perhaps?

00:43:15,362 --> 00:43:19,230
SPEAKER_1:  Not said explicitly until it happens it can happen overnight

00:43:19,618 --> 00:43:22,718
SPEAKER_1:  but just putting a giant pressure on that capitalist class.

00:43:23,106 --> 00:43:23,774
SPEAKER_1:  and again.

00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:26,206
SPEAKER_1:  the styling type figure takes hold.

00:43:26,818 --> 00:43:29,534
SPEAKER_1:  I'm trying to understand how the mechanism...

00:43:30,306 --> 00:43:30,974
SPEAKER_1:  prevent that.

00:43:32,066 --> 00:43:32,798
SPEAKER_1:  And perhaps...

00:43:33,122 --> 00:43:35,326
SPEAKER_1:  I'll also reveal my bias here.

00:43:35,554 --> 00:43:36,638
SPEAKER_1:  As I've been reading out

00:43:38,242 --> 00:43:41,470
SPEAKER_1:  I was gonna say too much, maybe not enough, but a lot about-

00:43:42,146 --> 00:43:47,070
SPEAKER_1:  you know, books like Stalin's War in Ukraine and just I've been reading a lot about the 30s and the 40s

00:43:47,586 --> 00:43:51,902
SPEAKER_1:  for personal reasons related to my travels in Ukraine and all that kind of stuff. ⍘ 10PAWES awesome drawUNDIES

00:43:52,226 --> 00:43:54,078
SPEAKER_1:  I have a little bit of a...

00:43:55,458 --> 00:44:04,510
SPEAKER_1:  focus on the historical implementations of communism currently without kind of an updated view of all the possible future implementation. So I just want to lay that out there, but.

00:44:04,738 --> 00:44:07,774
SPEAKER_1:  I worry about the slippery slope.

00:44:08,386 --> 00:44:10,430
SPEAKER_1:  into the authoritarian figure.

00:44:10,978 --> 00:44:12,734
SPEAKER_1:  that takes this sexy message.

00:44:13,346 --> 00:44:15,486
SPEAKER_1:  destroys everyone who is powerful.

00:44:15,746 --> 00:44:17,694
SPEAKER_1:  in the name of the working class.

00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:20,318
SPEAKER_1:  and then fucks the working class afterwards.

00:44:21,762 --> 00:44:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  First of all, I think it's worth remembering.

00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:37,662
SPEAKER_0:  the socialist movement had different outcomes across Western Europe and Eastern Europe. And in some of these countries in Western Europe, there wasn't actually democracy before the workers movement and before the socialists movement. so

00:44:38,946 --> 00:44:39,550
SPEAKER_0:  D.

00:44:39,842 --> 00:44:49,214
SPEAKER_0:  Battle in Sweden, for instance, was about establishing political democracy, establishing true representation for workers, and that's how the parties became popular. Same thing in Germany too.

00:44:49,986 --> 00:44:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  then it was the social democrats who were able to build

00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  political democracy. Then on top of that, add layers of economic.

00:44:57,762 --> 00:45:00,574
SPEAKER_0:  democracy, social democracy.

00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  the...

00:45:02,434 --> 00:45:03,934
SPEAKER_0:  Swedish Social Democrats are ruled.

00:45:04,258 --> 00:45:05,534
SPEAKER_0:  basically uninterrupted.

00:45:05,762 --> 00:45:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  from the early 1930s.

00:45:07,426 --> 00:45:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  until 1976.

00:45:09,762 --> 00:45:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  It's kind of crazy to think about, but they were just in government. They were the leading member of government. And a few different coalition partners would shift.

00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:18,814
SPEAKER_0:  Sometimes they were with the agrarians, sometimes they were with-

00:45:19,138 --> 00:45:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  the the communists briefly, but they ruled uninterrupted.

00:45:23,746 --> 00:45:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  and they lost an election in 1976 and they just left power.

00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  And then they got back into power in the 80s. So in other words, I-

00:45:30,754 --> 00:45:35,614
SPEAKER_0:  they created a democratic system, of course, with mass support of working class people.

00:45:35,874 --> 00:45:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  then they've truly honored the system because when they lost power they

00:45:39,714 --> 00:45:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  lost power. They left power. There's plenty of cases like that across

00:45:44,642 --> 00:45:52,254
SPEAKER_0:  Europe and the world and in other countries like Korea and elsewhere where the workers movements almost militant the most class centric workers

00:45:52,642 --> 00:45:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  South Africa is the same way. Created Democratic.

00:45:56,738 --> 00:45:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  systems.

00:45:58,562 --> 00:45:58,878
SPEAKER_0:  Now.

00:45:59,522 --> 00:46:04,094
SPEAKER_0:  Russia, I think a lot of what happened had to do with the fact that it was never a democratic country.

00:46:04,514 --> 00:46:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  It was ruled by a...

00:46:06,434 --> 00:46:06,846
SPEAKER_0:  party.

00:46:07,106 --> 00:46:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  and the party itself.

00:46:08,642 --> 00:46:12,030
SPEAKER_0:  was very easy to shift from a somewhat democratic party in Lenin's day.

00:46:12,418 --> 00:46:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  to an authoritarian one and...

00:46:14,466 --> 00:46:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  Russia, and there was no distinction then between the party and the state.

00:46:17,986 --> 00:46:19,582
SPEAKER_0:  your authoritarian party.

00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:23,774
SPEAKER_0:  then became authoritarian total control over the entirety of

00:46:24,034 --> 00:46:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  the state.

00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:25,566
SPEAKER_0:  Now.

00:46:26,338 --> 00:46:32,062
SPEAKER_0:  The fact that the Soviet system involved total state ownership of production meant

00:46:32,386 --> 00:46:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  that the authoritarianism of the party state

00:46:35,394 --> 00:46:40,190
SPEAKER_0:  could go even deeper into the lives of ordinary people compared to other horrific.

00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:43,838
SPEAKER_0:  Dictatorships like Pinochet's chili and so on

00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  when maybe you could find some solace.

00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:51,838
SPEAKER_0:  like just at home or whatever else. You didn't have the same sort of totalitarian, you know.

00:46:52,194 --> 00:46:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:46:53,698 --> 00:46:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  control of people's lives.

00:46:56,898 --> 00:47:01,822
SPEAKER_0:  but I would say that socialism itself has yielded different outcomes. Now on the question of polarization...

00:47:02,818 --> 00:47:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  I guess that implies that this polarization

00:47:06,146 --> 00:47:07,326
SPEAKER_0:  this distinction.

00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  Um, is a.

00:47:09,378 --> 00:47:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  distinction that isn't real in society.

00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:12,478
SPEAKER_0:  and that

00:47:12,834 --> 00:47:15,765
SPEAKER_0:  is kind of being manufacturer generated.

00:47:15,765 --> 00:47:18,622
SPEAKER_1:  You mean the capitalist class and the working class to clarify. Yeah. Okay.

00:47:18,818 --> 00:47:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  So in certain...

00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  populist distinctions.

00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:22,814
SPEAKER_0:  D.

00:47:24,226 --> 00:47:29,918
SPEAKER_0:  The division is basically arbitrary or made up, the us vs them polarization depending who the us and who the them are.

00:47:30,146 --> 00:47:32,254
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it's truly a...

00:47:32,546 --> 00:47:34,526
SPEAKER_0:  a something that's manufactured.

00:47:35,266 --> 00:47:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  but capitalism itself.

00:47:37,122 --> 00:47:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  as a system as a system.

00:47:39,266 --> 00:47:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  based on class.

00:47:40,738 --> 00:47:45,726
SPEAKER_0:  Division, whether you support or oppose it, I think we should acknowledge it's based on class division.

00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:49,246
SPEAKER_0:  That is the thing creating that polarization.

00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:53,822
SPEAKER_0:  Now, I think what a lot of what socialists try to do is we try to...

00:47:54,818 --> 00:47:55,198
SPEAKER_0:  Take.

00:47:55,778 --> 00:47:58,878
SPEAKER_0:  bits of working class opposition to capitalism.

00:47:59,266 --> 00:48:00,254
SPEAKER_0:  to their lives.

00:48:00,514 --> 00:48:02,974
SPEAKER_0:  to the way they're treated at work and so on.

00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  And yes, we do try to organize on those bases to.

00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  workers take collective action.

00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:10,494
SPEAKER_0:  to help them.

00:48:10,914 --> 00:48:12,606
SPEAKER_0:  organized and political.

00:48:13,186 --> 00:48:13,790
SPEAKER_0:  Parties.

00:48:14,114 --> 00:48:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  and someone to represent their interests economic.

00:48:17,378 --> 00:48:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  Otherwise.

00:48:19,394 --> 00:48:20,574
SPEAKER_0:  But the contradiction.

00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:23,102
SPEAKER_0:  exists to begin with, and if anything...

00:48:23,586 --> 00:48:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  this system, which I'm proposing democratic socialism.

00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  would be kind of a resolution of this conflict, this dilemma, this thing that has always existed since

00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:37,982
SPEAKER_0:  you know, chieftain and follower and so on. We've had class divisions since the Neolithic Revolution.

00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I think this is a democratic road out of that.

00:48:41,762 --> 00:48:47,806
SPEAKER_0:  that tension and that division of humanity into people who own and people who have nothing to give about their ability to work.

00:48:48,034 --> 00:48:56,766
SPEAKER_1:  So that sort of that idea is grounded in going all the way back to Marx that all of human history can be told through the lens of class struggle.

00:48:57,442 --> 00:49:01,150
SPEAKER_1:  Is there some sense, can you still man the case, that this class...

00:49:01,634 --> 00:49:03,614
SPEAKER_1:  difference is over exaggerated.

00:49:04,354 --> 00:49:04,734
SPEAKER_1:  That's.

00:49:05,634 --> 00:49:06,814
SPEAKER_1:  There's a difference.

00:49:07,874 --> 00:49:11,934
SPEAKER_1:  but it's not the difference of the abuser and the abused.

00:49:12,706 --> 00:49:14,494
SPEAKER_1:  It's more of a difference of.

00:49:15,618 --> 00:49:17,022
SPEAKER_1:  uh... people that were

00:49:17,442 --> 00:49:18,238
SPEAKER_1:  Successful.

00:49:18,658 --> 00:49:20,094
SPEAKER_1:  and people that were less successful.

00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:22,814
SPEAKER_0:  So I'll play Devil's Advocate, which is saying.

00:49:23,138 --> 00:49:24,094
SPEAKER_0:  But maybe...

00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  One could argue that in its purest, earliest stage...

00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  Capitalism was based on a Stark.

00:49:31,266 --> 00:49:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  difference.

00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  But then since then two things have happened.

00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:38,270
SPEAKER_0:  One, a bunch of socialists and workers have organized to...

00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:41,406
SPEAKER_0:  guarantees certain rights for working class people.

00:49:41,858 --> 00:49:42,814
SPEAKER_0:  certain protections.

00:49:43,234 --> 00:49:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  to the GNAR system now.

00:49:44,866 --> 00:49:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  there are certain safety nets.

00:49:46,882 --> 00:49:47,838
SPEAKER_0:  Less in the US.

00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:52,543
SPEAKER_0:  than in other countries, but in a lot of countries, are pretty extensive safety nets. Even like f*** illegible 상� Madame

00:49:52,543 --> 00:49:55,134
SPEAKER_1:  40 hour work week minimum wage.

00:49:55,586 --> 00:49:57,406
SPEAKER_1:  safety regulations

00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  All that kind of stuff. And all those things are.

00:50:00,738 --> 00:50:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  in my mind doses of socialism within capitalism because what you're doing

00:50:04,898 --> 00:50:05,886
SPEAKER_0:  as you are.

00:50:06,178 --> 00:50:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  taking the autonomy of capitalists to do whatever they want with the people contracted to them.

00:50:12,066 --> 00:50:14,302
SPEAKER_0:  and the only thing stopping them is them.

00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  potentially being able to go to another employer, but even then it's kind of a

00:50:18,754 --> 00:50:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  potentially erase to the bottom.

00:50:20,962 --> 00:50:23,006
SPEAKER_0:  You know, you can't get more than...

00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  $2 an hour from any employer in your market.

00:50:27,106 --> 00:50:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  You're gonna have to.

00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  You know, live with it.

00:50:29,474 --> 00:50:30,622
SPEAKER_0:  So one factor is.

00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  we have built in those protections.

00:50:33,602 --> 00:50:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  So we've.

00:50:34,594 --> 00:50:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  Taken.

00:50:35,554 --> 00:50:37,310
SPEAKER_0:  Enough socialism into capitalism.

00:50:37,922 --> 00:50:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  that.

00:50:38,626 --> 00:50:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  You could say that.

00:50:39,586 --> 00:50:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  At a certain point, maybe it makes a qualitative difference and not just a quantitative difference in people's lives.

00:50:45,154 --> 00:50:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  The other thing is...

00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:47,966
SPEAKER_0:  Over time we've gotten wealthier.

00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  and more productive as a society.

00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:53,502
SPEAKER_0:  So maybe at some point.

00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  the quantitative difference.

00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  of just more and more wealth.

00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  means that even if in the abstract...

00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  the division between.

00:51:01,538 --> 00:51:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  A worker in a capitalist is real.

00:51:03,554 --> 00:51:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  if that worker is earning a quarter million dollars a year and has a good life and only has to clock in 35 hours a week 30 hours a week

00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  and has

00:51:13,186 --> 00:51:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  you know, four weeks of vacation, then like...

00:51:15,682 --> 00:51:18,334
SPEAKER_0:  Isn't it just like an abstract or philosophical?

00:51:18,626 --> 00:51:19,038
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

00:51:19,586 --> 00:51:22,814
SPEAKER_0:  So I think you could level those two arguments. What I would say is that-

00:51:23,586 --> 00:51:24,094
SPEAKER_0:  One.

00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:28,510
SPEAKER_0:  a lot of these rights that we fought for.

00:51:28,834 --> 00:51:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  are constantly being eroded and they're under attack.

00:51:32,002 --> 00:51:34,814
SPEAKER_0:  in part because of the economic power that capitalists have.

00:51:35,234 --> 00:51:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  bleeds into R.

00:51:36,514 --> 00:51:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  democracy as well.

00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  There's constant lobbying for all sorts of...

00:51:41,282 --> 00:51:44,542
SPEAKER_0:  labor market deregulations and so on.

00:51:44,802 --> 00:51:46,782
SPEAKER_0:  I fundamentally believe.

00:51:48,994 --> 00:51:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  if tomorrow all those regulations went away.

00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  Capitalist wood.

00:51:53,410 --> 00:52:00,254
SPEAKER_0:  fight to pay people as little as possible and we'll be back in 19th century capitalism and not because they're bad people.

00:52:00,706 --> 00:52:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  because

00:52:01,538 --> 00:52:03,134
SPEAKER_0:  If I'm running a firm.

00:52:03,394 --> 00:52:09,854
SPEAKER_0:  And all of a sudden my competition is able to find a labor pool and is paying people less than me.

00:52:10,338 --> 00:52:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  I'm going to be undercut because I'll be able to take some of that extra savings and invest into new technology or whatever else and they'll gobble up my market share before long.

00:52:20,034 --> 00:52:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  And then also beyond that.

00:52:21,986 --> 00:52:24,222
SPEAKER_0:  I do think there is a normative question.

00:52:24,514 --> 00:52:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  hair, which is...

00:52:26,402 --> 00:52:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  Now.

00:52:27,202 --> 00:52:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  Do we believe?

00:52:29,058 --> 00:52:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  Ordinary people.

00:52:30,402 --> 00:52:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  Have a capacity.

00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  to

00:52:33,282 --> 00:52:37,342
SPEAKER_0:  be able to make certain decisions about their work. Do we believe they know more about their work?

00:52:37,762 --> 00:52:38,590
SPEAKER_0:  than their bosses.

00:52:38,946 --> 00:52:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  Um, now.

00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think that's not true at every level.

00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  But I think there is no doubt that

00:52:44,226 --> 00:52:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  In workplaces, workers know how to.

00:52:47,074 --> 00:52:47,966
SPEAKER_0:  productively.

00:52:48,258 --> 00:52:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  do their task in ways that their manager might not know. I think we've all been in workplaces where we've had managers who kind of don't know what you do or whatever else.

00:52:58,146 --> 00:52:58,558
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that collectively, if incentivized.

00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:02,590
SPEAKER_0:  We could.

00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  have them won instead of hoarding that information.

00:53:07,522 --> 00:53:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  Since they're getting a stake in production and so on, they'd be able to more freely share it and be able to reshape how their day-to-day work.

00:53:17,026 --> 00:53:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  happens?

00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:22,334
SPEAKER_0:  And also with with elected managers, you kind of take it up the chain. I think you would have.

00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:23,326
SPEAKER_0:  perfectly.

00:53:23,554 --> 00:53:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  Efficient.

00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  I'm market based.

00:53:26,274 --> 00:53:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  firms.

00:53:27,522 --> 00:53:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  Um, that.

00:53:29,218 --> 00:53:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  could exist without capitalists.

00:53:31,234 --> 00:53:32,766
SPEAKER_1:  So there's a, I mean, there's a lot of.

00:53:33,186 --> 00:53:33,630
SPEAKER_1:  uh

00:53:34,562 --> 00:53:35,326
SPEAKER_1:  things to say.

00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:39,614
SPEAKER_1:  maybe within just very, very low level question of.

00:53:39,906 --> 00:53:41,598
SPEAKER_1:  if the workers are running the show.

00:53:43,586 --> 00:53:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  There's a brutal truth.

00:53:45,538 --> 00:53:48,574
SPEAKER_1:  the fact that some people are better and the workers know this.

00:53:49,378 --> 00:53:52,862
SPEAKER_1:  That's the Steve Jobs A-Players. You want to have all the A-Players in the room.

00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:55,902
SPEAKER_1:  because one B player can poison the pool.

00:53:56,354 --> 00:53:58,526
SPEAKER_1:  because then everybody gets demotivated by...

00:53:58,882 --> 00:53:59,262
SPEAKER_1:  Like.

00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:00,126
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:04,158
SPEAKER_1:  by the nature of that.

00:54:05,794 --> 00:54:08,478
SPEAKER_1:  lack of excellence and competence.

00:54:08,898 --> 00:54:09,854
SPEAKER_1:  This is just a take.

00:54:10,178 --> 00:54:13,246
SPEAKER_1:  sort of a crude devil's advocate perspective.

00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:16,958
SPEAKER_1:  Are the workers going to be able to remove?

00:54:17,186 --> 00:54:18,750
SPEAKER_1:  the incompetent from the pool.

00:54:19,586 --> 00:54:24,798
SPEAKER_1:  in the goal of towards the mission of succeeding as a collective.

00:54:25,506 --> 00:54:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  So I think that any successful model of socialism that involves the market, you need two things.

00:54:31,106 --> 00:54:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  One is the micro level, you need the ability.

00:54:34,242 --> 00:54:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  to...

00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:37,374
SPEAKER_0:  uh, fire people and for them to exit.

00:54:37,698 --> 00:54:38,174
SPEAKER_0:  firms.

00:54:38,562 --> 00:54:40,542
SPEAKER_0:  which might be a slower process.

00:54:40,898 --> 00:54:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  in cooperative based firms than it is in a capitalist firm without a union.

00:54:45,826 --> 00:54:49,086
SPEAKER_0:  but it would be probably akin to the process that would happen in a capitalist firm.

00:54:49,314 --> 00:54:50,846
SPEAKER_0:  of which there are many with unions.

00:54:51,074 --> 00:54:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  So you need that. The macro level

00:54:54,338 --> 00:54:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  You need firm failure.

00:54:55,810 --> 00:55:00,926
SPEAKER_0:  you need to avoid a dilemma that happened in Soviet style economies.

00:55:01,218 --> 00:55:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  which was soft budget.

00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:03,550
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

00:55:03,906 --> 00:55:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  constraints and

00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  firms basically not being allowed to fail.

00:55:08,706 --> 00:55:16,606
SPEAKER_0:  because the government was committed to full employment, the firms employed people, so even inefficient firms were at the end of the day, they knew they were going to be propped up.

00:55:16,994 --> 00:55:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  by the government and they would be given all the resources they would need no matter how inefficiently they were using those resources to maintain employment. I think you need.

00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  You need both.

00:55:27,234 --> 00:55:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  Do you worry about?

00:55:28,546 --> 00:55:30,206
SPEAKER_1:  this idea of firing people.

00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:33,822
SPEAKER_1:  Man, I'm uncomfortable with the idea, I hate it.

00:55:34,114 --> 00:55:36,478
SPEAKER_1:  but I also know it's extremely necessary.

00:55:38,082 --> 00:55:41,214
SPEAKER_1:  So is there something about a collective, a socialist system?

00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:42,686
SPEAKER_1:  that makes firing.

00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:44,382
SPEAKER_1:  You said it might be slower.

00:55:44,866 --> 00:55:45,854
SPEAKER_1:  might it become.

00:55:46,146 --> 00:55:47,422
SPEAKER_1:  extremely slow.

00:55:47,938 --> 00:55:48,958
SPEAKER_1:  Too much friction.

00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:53,214
SPEAKER_1:  Isn't there a tension between respecting the rights of a human being?

00:55:53,794 --> 00:55:54,494
SPEAKER_1:  and saying

00:55:55,170 --> 00:56:01,214
SPEAKER_1:  Like you need to step up, maybe sort of deposit the carrot. Like you really like to really encourage.

00:56:01,634 --> 00:56:02,878
SPEAKER_1:  fellow workers know.

00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:06,718
SPEAKER_1:  when there's a person that's not pulling their side of the...

00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:09,854
SPEAKER_1:  doing as great of a job as it could be.

00:56:11,362 --> 00:56:13,662
SPEAKER_1:  Isn't the person that's not doing a great of a job.

00:56:14,146 --> 00:56:18,174
SPEAKER_1:  going to start to manipulate the system that slows the firing in their self interest.

00:56:18,946 --> 00:56:20,670
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I think that would be certain, so-

00:56:20,898 --> 00:56:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe another way to put it is think about like if you're a partner in a law firm, right?

00:56:25,122 --> 00:56:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  I don't really know how law firms work, so I probably shouldn't use this analogy.

00:56:29,186 --> 00:56:35,806
SPEAKER_0:  But correct me if I'm wrong, but let's say you're a partner, you kind of have equity in your law firm or something beyond your billable hours.

00:56:36,386 --> 00:56:38,174
SPEAKER_0:  And let's say you're...

00:56:38,434 --> 00:56:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  going to be fired from your law firm or they're laying off people or whatever else.

00:56:42,018 --> 00:56:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  They could just get rid of you.

00:56:43,746 --> 00:56:46,334
SPEAKER_0:  but they would also have to figure out how to kind of buy you out.

00:56:47,298 --> 00:56:48,382
SPEAKER_0:  after a certain point.

00:56:48,962 --> 00:56:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  So I think that like in a...

00:56:51,554 --> 00:56:54,046
SPEAKER_0:  cooperative firm, you probably have a system.

00:56:54,274 --> 00:56:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  Where?

00:56:55,106 --> 00:56:57,022
SPEAKER_0:  you after a certain point.

00:56:57,314 --> 00:57:01,278
SPEAKER_0:  of working productively. You probably have a period where you can get fired really quickly.

00:57:01,666 --> 00:57:04,030
SPEAKER_0:  no matter what, but once you have job security.

00:57:04,258 --> 00:57:05,886
SPEAKER_0:  kicks in, you would.

00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:07,934
SPEAKER_0:  be able to, um...

00:57:08,386 --> 00:57:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  you know, it would be a process. It would probably be like, you know.

00:57:12,066 --> 00:57:16,926
SPEAKER_0:  a day or two process to figure it out. Or maybe they would have a progressive discipline process, which is-

00:57:17,186 --> 00:57:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  First.

00:57:18,082 --> 00:57:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  You have to get a...

00:57:19,778 --> 00:57:21,246
SPEAKER_0:  verbal feedback.

00:57:21,602 --> 00:57:29,758
SPEAKER_0:  and then maybe a written performance review, then you could be fired. I mean, that's how it works in a lot of workplaces with either unions or with just basic job security.

00:57:30,242 --> 00:57:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:57:30,978 --> 00:57:35,870
SPEAKER_0:  in most countries, that's how it works, because there's not at will employment in most countries. So I think that...

00:57:36,994 --> 00:57:37,662
SPEAKER_0:  The real.

00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:38,718
SPEAKER_0:  TENSION

00:57:38,946 --> 00:57:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  is

00:57:40,162 --> 00:57:41,246
SPEAKER_0:  If you fire someone.

00:57:41,474 --> 00:57:43,646
SPEAKER_0:  if you're condemning them to destitution.

00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  then morally you'd really feel something there as you should as a human being concerned about other people.

00:57:50,242 --> 00:57:54,302
SPEAKER_0:  but in a social system or even basic social democratic system.

00:57:54,658 --> 00:57:57,022
SPEAKER_0:  there would be mechanisms to take care of that person.

00:57:57,346 --> 00:57:57,982
SPEAKER_0:  So one.

00:57:58,338 --> 00:58:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  if a firm is failing for any reason.

00:58:00,386 --> 00:58:02,878
SPEAKER_0:  they're getting out compete or whatever, whatever else.

00:58:03,458 --> 00:58:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  uh... those workers

00:58:05,378 --> 00:58:06,014
SPEAKER_0:  Where then...

00:58:06,242 --> 00:58:07,102
SPEAKER_0:  LAND.

00:58:07,362 --> 00:58:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  in the hands just for a little bit of the state, right?

00:58:10,242 --> 00:58:18,110
SPEAKER_0:  And there could be active labor market policies to retrain people to go into expanding sectors, or your sector is now obsolete, but here you have these skills.

00:58:18,338 --> 00:58:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  You're gonna be.

00:58:19,394 --> 00:58:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  trained and here are some resources to kind of help you along your training and then there's a bunch of firms hiring so

00:58:25,186 --> 00:58:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  on your way.

00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:28,286
SPEAKER_0:  then also just with an expanded welfare state.

00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  being destitute in certain countries.

00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:32,382
SPEAKER_0:  being unemployed in certain countries.

00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:37,150
SPEAKER_0:  is easier than in other countries or situations.

00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  you still can fall back on...

00:58:41,058 --> 00:58:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  that mechanism and also my vision of...

00:58:44,642 --> 00:58:45,214
SPEAKER_0:  Um

00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:48,030
SPEAKER_0:  A market socialism, a democratic socialism.

00:58:48,482 --> 00:58:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  there would be an expanded state sector.

00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not.

00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  Not anything you can imagine, but the way in which there's more of a state sector in countries like Norway or Denmark than there is in the US. There would be.

00:59:00,002 --> 00:59:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  you know, various forms of...

00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  state employment and whatever else.

00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  So, I mean, I think that.

00:59:06,914 --> 00:59:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  The real question is.

00:59:08,354 --> 00:59:09,630
SPEAKER_0:  should being bad at your job.

00:59:10,018 --> 00:59:10,430
SPEAKER_0:  or

00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  getting fired for any reason or getting laid off.

00:59:13,506 --> 00:59:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  Should that be a cause to have you?

00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:27,646
SPEAKER_0:  you know, totally lose your shirt, or maybe should you just have to rebound, maybe you have less money for consumption or whatever else, and you'll be on your way onto bigger and better things in a few months.

00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:29,214
SPEAKER_1:  So a strong social net.

00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:35,198
SPEAKER_1:  in many ways make it more efficient to fire people who are not good at their job.

00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:37,470
SPEAKER_1:  because then they won't be.

00:59:37,794 --> 00:59:38,302
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:59:38,818 --> 00:59:44,158
SPEAKER_1:  that won't actually significantly damage their quality of life and they have a chance to find a job at which they can flourish.

00:59:45,762 --> 00:59:47,486
SPEAKER_1:  to step out into the macro.

00:59:49,346 --> 00:59:50,014
SPEAKER_1:  The...

00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:55,422
SPEAKER_1:  There's a tension here as well. So you said that there's inequality between the classes.

00:59:56,226 --> 00:59:58,014
SPEAKER_1:  the capitalist class and the working class.

00:59:58,402 --> 01:00:06,110
SPEAKER_1:  And sort of, there's a lot of ways you can maybe correct me on the numbers, but you could say that the top 1% of Americans have more wealth than the bottom 50%.

01:00:06,498 --> 01:00:07,326
SPEAKER_1:  That's not talking about.

01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,726
SPEAKER_1:  perhaps capitalist class and um...

01:00:10,498 --> 01:00:13,406
SPEAKER_1:  in the working class, but it's a good sort of estimate, right?

01:00:14,178 --> 01:00:15,710
SPEAKER_1:  the flip side of that.

01:00:16,066 --> 01:00:17,182
SPEAKER_1:  If you just look...

01:00:17,794 --> 01:00:18,878
SPEAKER_1:  at countries.

01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:23,038
SPEAKER_1:  that have more economic freedom versus less economic freedom.

01:00:24,962 --> 01:00:27,486
SPEAKER_1:  more capitalism versus less capitalism.

01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:30,366
SPEAKER_1:  Their GDP seems to be significantly higher.

01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:32,350
SPEAKER_1:  So

01:00:32,866 --> 01:00:35,454
SPEAKER_1:  at the local level you might say that uh...

01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:37,310
SPEAKER_1:  there's an inequality.

01:00:37,858 --> 01:00:40,798
SPEAKER_1:  But if you look historically over decades, it seems like...

01:00:41,218 --> 01:00:46,686
SPEAKER_1:  the more capitalism there is, the higher the GDP grows, and therefore the level of GDP.

01:00:47,682 --> 01:00:50,846
SPEAKER_1:  uh... the quality of life in the base king come the basic wealth

01:00:51,362 --> 01:00:54,654
SPEAKER_1:  The average, even including the working class, goes up over time.

01:00:55,266 --> 01:00:57,278
SPEAKER_1:  Can you see both sides of this?

01:00:57,826 --> 01:00:59,710
SPEAKER_0:  So I could definitely accept some of that premise. Put yourselves in my shoes.

01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  Within capitalism, right?

01:01:02,338 --> 01:01:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:01:03,234 --> 01:01:04,638
SPEAKER_0:  you want a bigger pie.

01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:11,454
SPEAKER_0:  then if you divide up that pie, you know, you'll even if if the bottom 10% or the working class share.

01:01:11,874 --> 01:01:14,078
SPEAKER_0:  Let's say is, is, um...

01:01:14,722 --> 01:01:19,646
SPEAKER_0:  is less as a percentage, it's still more in raw terms. So it's better for.

01:01:19,906 --> 01:01:20,734
SPEAKER_0:  for everyone.

01:01:21,602 --> 01:01:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  The part that I would dispute is...

01:01:24,418 --> 01:01:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  more economic freedom versus less economic.

01:01:26,946 --> 01:01:29,182
SPEAKER_0:  So there's obviously some countries in which

01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  Capitalism doesn't work.

01:01:32,034 --> 01:01:33,598
SPEAKER_0:  and maybe.

01:01:33,922 --> 01:01:36,574
SPEAKER_0:  Economic freedom plays a role. Like if you're in a country.

01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  like Egypt or India with a highly or previously highly bureaucratic system. we need get

01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  licenses to do anything and you need to run things for the state or you need to bribe someone to get an incorporation done or whatever else.

01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  That's in case in which I would accept the premise of, okay, economic freedom to-

01:01:55,842 --> 01:01:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  to take entrepreneurial risks to start something new is limited.

01:01:59,170 --> 01:01:59,646
SPEAKER_0:  AVEN

01:02:00,354 --> 01:02:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  there's all sorts of factors in which it's too...

01:02:03,682 --> 01:02:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  and too difficult.

01:02:05,026 --> 01:02:06,686
SPEAKER_0:  to, um...

01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  to start a firm and it benefits.

01:02:10,402 --> 01:02:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  No one really, except for whatever bureaucracy might be.

01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,350
SPEAKER_0:  might be taking their 15%.

01:02:17,986 --> 01:02:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  But in general...

01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:22,686
SPEAKER_0:  I think in advanced economies, it doesn't really work that way.

01:02:23,074 --> 01:02:24,094
SPEAKER_0:  So think about it this way.

01:02:25,602 --> 01:02:26,334
SPEAKER_0:  If you're...

01:02:26,818 --> 01:02:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  Pretend like we're back.

01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  I'm sorry to go to Scandinavia again, but this is a good example.

01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  Let's say you're back in the 1970s in Scandinavia or whatever else. You're in a country with...

01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  extremely

01:02:40,322 --> 01:02:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:02:42,114 --> 01:02:43,070
SPEAKER_0:  powerful unions?

01:02:43,618 --> 01:02:44,190
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:02:44,514 --> 01:02:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  The unions have a lot of labor rights, the state has certain high taxation, certain guarantees on you too.

01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,574
SPEAKER_0:  But you're a capitalist there.

01:02:52,994 --> 01:02:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:54,974
SPEAKER_0:  Now.

01:02:55,234 --> 01:02:56,606
SPEAKER_0:  What would you do?

01:02:57,154 --> 01:02:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  If.

01:02:58,146 --> 01:03:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  your capitalist competitors in the US.

01:03:00,642 --> 01:03:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  We're able to pay.

01:03:02,562 --> 01:03:03,870
SPEAKER_0:  workers.

01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  $10 an hour and you have to pay them.

01:03:06,978 --> 01:03:07,454
SPEAKER_0:  20.

01:03:08,162 --> 01:03:08,766
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:03:09,826 --> 01:03:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  You would probably, and assuming you can't just flee or shut down or whatever else.

01:03:14,434 --> 01:03:18,142
SPEAKER_0:  you'd probably find ways to use labor-saving technology.

01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  that.

01:03:20,258 --> 01:03:20,830
SPEAKER_0:  Power.

01:03:21,346 --> 01:03:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  of the high wages might encourage you to invest more in technology and to utilize people's time is better so they're more productive at work, so they're not just sitting around or whatever else.

01:03:33,186 --> 01:03:34,974
SPEAKER_0:  This really happened in practice.

01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:40,126
SPEAKER_0:  in the Scandinavian countries, in part because it was combined with a certain type.

01:03:40,802 --> 01:03:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  of um...

01:03:42,786 --> 01:03:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  pattern wage bargaining.

01:03:48,002 --> 01:03:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  You're in a...

01:03:50,658 --> 01:03:51,358
SPEAKER_0:  sector.

01:03:52,002 --> 01:03:52,478
SPEAKER_0:  with

01:03:53,026 --> 01:03:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  Three different.

01:03:54,562 --> 01:03:55,230
SPEAKER_0:  companies.

01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  I would say on automotive sector. And I'll just say.

01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:02,558
SPEAKER_0:  One is GM, one is Ford, one is Chrysler.

01:04:03,842 --> 01:04:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  Now.

01:04:04,642 --> 01:04:06,942
SPEAKER_0:  all these workers in your sector.

01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:08,062
SPEAKER_0:  R

01:04:08,322 --> 01:04:09,502
SPEAKER_0:  All unionized.

01:04:09,826 --> 01:04:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  They're all.

01:04:10,594 --> 01:04:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  You know

01:04:11,682 --> 01:04:14,654
SPEAKER_0:  Swedish UAW, whatever the equivalent is, members.

01:04:15,106 --> 01:04:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  and they're all paid.

01:04:16,546 --> 01:04:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  the same and the union is setting through bargaining the union is setting the wages across the sector

01:04:22,786 --> 01:04:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  but the unions, and let's say GM is the most productive.

01:04:25,954 --> 01:04:26,430
SPEAKER_0:  out.

01:04:26,882 --> 01:04:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  of these companies. Forward is number two.

01:04:29,122 --> 01:04:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  Priceless number three.

01:04:31,362 --> 01:04:33,182
SPEAKER_0:  the unions would intentionally

01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:34,526
SPEAKER_0:  Set the wages.

01:04:35,074 --> 01:04:36,478
SPEAKER_0:  set their benchmark.

01:04:36,834 --> 01:04:37,758
SPEAKER_0:  to forward in the middle.

01:04:38,978 --> 01:04:44,766
SPEAKER_0:  So what that would do is say to Ford, okay, Ford will stay in business because they'll be able to meet the wage demands.

01:04:45,506 --> 01:04:47,390
SPEAKER_0:  Pricers might go out of business.

01:04:47,810 --> 01:04:50,462
SPEAKER_0:  because they won't be able to meet.

01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:57,694
SPEAKER_0:  the demands, or they'll have to really adapt really quickly, they might have to lay off people, they might have to restructure. So the union knows this in advance and all the auto workers.

01:04:58,018 --> 01:04:58,558
SPEAKER_0:  Now this.

01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  but the most efficient manufacturer, GM.

01:05:02,594 --> 01:05:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  now has excess profits.

01:05:04,866 --> 01:05:10,750
SPEAKER_0:  because if they were negotiating with just the GM workers, the GM workers might even have been able to demand more.

01:05:11,330 --> 01:05:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  But instead these workers are...

01:05:13,698 --> 01:05:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  are pegging their wage demands to Ford's level, and GM is, in theory, able to expand and employ more people and adopt new production techniques with their surplus.

01:05:24,642 --> 01:05:25,214
SPEAKER_0:  I then

01:05:25,858 --> 01:05:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  Those Chrysler workers.

01:05:27,426 --> 01:05:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  would be absorbed by the state by active labor market policies.

01:05:31,074 --> 01:05:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  then put back to work.

01:05:32,834 --> 01:05:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  for GM or for these expanding.

01:05:35,202 --> 01:05:35,966
SPEAKER_0:  you know, sectors.

01:05:36,386 --> 01:05:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  So in other words...

01:05:37,474 --> 01:05:45,918
SPEAKER_0:  You're now in a situation where the state has a pretty big role in your economy, taking a lot of your money and taxes. Things are really shaping.

01:05:46,178 --> 01:05:46,814
SPEAKER_0:  Your-

01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:52,414
SPEAKER_0:  your life as a capitalist far more than would happen in a country like the United States.

01:05:52,802 --> 01:05:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  And yet still...

01:05:54,082 --> 01:05:56,990
SPEAKER_0:  despite your more limited economic freedom.

01:05:57,314 --> 01:05:58,334
SPEAKER_0:  You're still creating.

01:05:58,946 --> 01:05:59,998
SPEAKER_0:  a more productive.

01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:01,086
SPEAKER_0:  economy.

01:06:01,602 --> 01:06:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  So it could work. It just has, the system has to be designed right. And I think social democracies were designed the right way. I think any future democratic socialism after social democracy would have to be designed the right way.

01:06:11,522 --> 01:06:15,486
SPEAKER_1:  Could you just link on that a little more the pattern wage bargaining?

01:06:16,002 --> 01:06:16,318
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:06:16,674 --> 01:06:17,374
SPEAKER_1:  GM.

01:06:17,634 --> 01:06:18,974
SPEAKER_1:  is the most efficient.

01:06:20,386 --> 01:06:21,918
SPEAKER_1:  and Ford is the second most.

01:06:22,434 --> 01:06:24,222
SPEAKER_1:  Can you explain to me how-

01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:26,462
SPEAKER_1:  Can you explain to me again the wages?

01:06:26,754 --> 01:06:28,446
SPEAKER_1:  setting the widgets to the forward level.

01:06:28,962 --> 01:06:30,494
SPEAKER_1:  how that is good for GM.

01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:33,429
SPEAKER_1:  So that encourages more.

01:06:33,429 --> 01:06:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  This is just um

01:06:35,426 --> 01:06:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  sectoral or actually in this case centralized wage.

01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:06:39,682 --> 01:06:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  bargaining. So,

01:06:41,698 --> 01:06:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

01:06:42,722 --> 01:06:45,950
SPEAKER_0:  setting the wages at a level that Ford can afford.

01:06:46,562 --> 01:06:51,230
SPEAKER_0:  but a level that would probably be too expensive for Chrysler in the automotive sector.

01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:52,670
SPEAKER_0:  would benefit GM.

01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:53,982
SPEAKER_0:  Because...

01:06:54,498 --> 01:06:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  their drawing.

01:06:56,386 --> 01:06:58,974
SPEAKER_0:  what we could call excess profits.

01:06:59,906 --> 01:07:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  because.

01:07:01,314 --> 01:07:05,118
SPEAKER_0:  GM, if the GM itself could potentially.

01:07:05,346 --> 01:07:05,758
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:09,054
SPEAKER_0:  have to deal with just the enterprise of GM workers?

01:07:09,410 --> 01:07:10,430
SPEAKER_0:  bargaining for wages?

01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  And if they saw their profitability was high, they would know their leverage. And they would say, pay us even more or else we're going to go on strike.

01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:18,654
SPEAKER_0:  But instead...

01:07:18,946 --> 01:07:20,670
SPEAKER_0:  They're accepting.

01:07:21,026 --> 01:07:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  slightly lower wages than they would have otherwise had.

01:07:24,386 --> 01:07:27,166
SPEAKER_0:  in return for the company having excess profits.

01:07:27,586 --> 01:07:29,310
SPEAKER_0:  that they're throughout the state.

01:07:29,794 --> 01:07:33,950
SPEAKER_0:  their union and sometimes there's worker councils or whatever else.

01:07:34,434 --> 01:07:37,566
SPEAKER_0:  they're playing a role in saying, okay, we're going to make sure this.

01:07:37,986 --> 01:07:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  excess profit is actually invested productively in order to expand employment and just output.

01:07:47,266 --> 01:07:50,910
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, can we talk about unions in general then?

01:07:51,298 --> 01:07:53,470
SPEAKER_1:  What are the pros and cons of unions?

01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:56,062
SPEAKER_1:  So the interest of the union.

01:07:57,922 --> 01:07:59,646
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong.

01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:04,254
SPEAKER_1:  I have a lot to learn both about the economics and the human experience of a union.

01:08:05,154 --> 01:08:07,518
SPEAKER_1:  the unions interest is to um

01:08:09,442 --> 01:08:10,846
SPEAKER_1:  What to protect.

01:08:11,522 --> 01:08:13,982
SPEAKER_1:  worker rights and to maximize.

01:08:14,242 --> 01:08:15,454
SPEAKER_1:  Worker happiness.

01:08:16,066 --> 01:08:16,766
SPEAKER_1:  NOT.

01:08:17,122 --> 01:08:20,222
SPEAKER_1:  the success and the productivity in the efficiency of a company, right?

01:08:21,282 --> 01:08:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  I would disagree.

01:08:22,178 --> 01:08:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  Um, so.

01:08:23,554 --> 01:08:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  I think a Union's...

01:08:25,154 --> 01:08:26,942
SPEAKER_0:  interest is in.

01:08:27,426 --> 01:08:28,542
SPEAKER_0:  with collectively bargaining.

01:08:28,898 --> 01:08:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  on behalf of workers.

01:08:30,434 --> 01:08:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  Because in certain cases...

01:08:32,002 --> 01:08:32,542
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:33,470
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I...

01:08:34,050 --> 01:08:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  I am right now a manager at

01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  the nation.

01:08:38,754 --> 01:08:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  Magazine.

01:08:40,386 --> 01:08:44,862
SPEAKER_0:  If I have a problem with my working conditions or I need a raise or whatever else.

01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:48,926
SPEAKER_0:  I could with my skill set, my background, my role in the company.

01:08:49,314 --> 01:08:50,494
SPEAKER_0:  I could go to my boss.

01:08:50,978 --> 01:08:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  the owner of the nation and say, okay, I need to renegotiate my contract.

01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:56,606
SPEAKER_0:  on these terms. I could bargain, right?

01:08:57,410 --> 01:08:57,886
SPEAKER_0:  Now

01:08:59,042 --> 01:09:01,342
SPEAKER_0:  if I was a ordinary worker.

01:09:01,634 --> 01:09:03,358
SPEAKER_0:  at like a CVS or something.

01:09:03,682 --> 01:09:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  If I didn't like my conditions and I went to my boss and said, Hey, I need a $2 raise and I need to...

01:09:11,938 --> 01:09:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  be home by 8 30 because you know I have I have obligations at home.

01:09:16,386 --> 01:09:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  The boss would probably say, I'm sorry, that's not.

01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  possible, right? You know, maybe try the right aid.

01:09:21,570 --> 01:09:22,238
SPEAKER_0:  down the street.

01:09:22,466 --> 01:09:24,158
SPEAKER_0:  or the Walgreens down the street or whatever.

01:09:24,962 --> 01:09:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:09:26,018 --> 01:09:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  now.

01:09:26,690 --> 01:09:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  if I went to...

01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  the boss in a place like CVS.

01:09:30,594 --> 01:09:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  or even better.

01:09:32,002 --> 01:09:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  F.

01:09:32,578 --> 01:09:36,734
SPEAKER_0:  all the pharmaceuticals, see that

01:09:37,442 --> 01:09:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  right-aid CBS Walgreens went to our bosses and said.

01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:42,302
SPEAKER_0:  Listen, um...

01:09:42,722 --> 01:09:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  you know, we collectively need to.

01:09:46,594 --> 01:09:47,038
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

01:09:47,522 --> 01:09:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  $2 more and better hours, shorter shifts or whatever else.

01:09:52,226 --> 01:09:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  then they would probably have no choice but to concede. You have to bargain collectively at any level.

01:09:58,178 --> 01:10:00,574
SPEAKER_0:  If you're in a ordinary

01:10:00,962 --> 01:10:01,534
SPEAKER_0:  worker.

01:10:02,018 --> 01:10:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  And there are some exceptions, but that's for certain highly skilled.

01:10:05,954 --> 01:10:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  workers but even in those cases, of course all workers are skilled. I mean just the technical definition.

01:10:12,354 --> 01:10:12,862
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:10:13,634 --> 01:10:17,214
SPEAKER_0:  Even in those cases, a lot of those workers have to bargain collectively.

01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:18,174
SPEAKER_0:  as well.

01:10:18,658 --> 01:10:25,086
SPEAKER_0:  in order to get more wealth, but they cannot make their demands so excessive.

01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  that their firm gets out of business. So the worker's only-

01:10:29,346 --> 01:10:32,382
SPEAKER_0:  our workers as long as they're gainfully employed.

01:10:32,642 --> 01:10:35,646
SPEAKER_0:  So often unions will try to

01:10:36,034 --> 01:10:36,958
SPEAKER_0:  select

01:10:37,282 --> 01:10:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  there.

01:10:38,146 --> 01:10:39,678
SPEAKER_0:  Waged demands is such a level.

01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:43,070
SPEAKER_0:  that it ensures that their firm will stay in business.

01:10:43,170 --> 01:10:48,158
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, but the problem is the way firms go out of business isn't by explosion.

01:10:48,866 --> 01:10:49,534
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhh...

01:10:49,762 --> 01:10:53,086
SPEAKER_1:  like the way popcorn starts getting cooked. like you

01:10:53,346 --> 01:10:55,838
SPEAKER_1:  at a certain moment it just is over.

01:10:56,674 --> 01:10:57,566
SPEAKER_1:  You can.

01:10:58,018 --> 01:11:04,830
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like the union can through collective bargaining keep increasing the wage keep increasing the interest.

01:11:05,602 --> 01:11:06,494
SPEAKER_1:  of the worker.

01:11:06,754 --> 01:11:11,774
SPEAKER_1:  until it suffocates the company that it doesn't die immediately, but it dies in like five years

01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:15,678
SPEAKER_1:  that might still serve the interest of the worker.

01:11:16,802 --> 01:11:20,734
SPEAKER_1:  but it doesn't serve the interest of society as a whole that's creating cool stuff.

01:11:21,058 --> 01:11:30,750
SPEAKER_1:  and increasing sort of a market that's operating and increasing cool stuff and constantly innovating and so on and creating more and more cool stuff and increasing the quality of life in general.

01:11:31,138 --> 01:11:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  I disagree with the premise because I think in your even taking your example that would be better for society

01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  If a firm.

01:11:38,466 --> 01:11:40,606
SPEAKER_0:  cannot pay its workers a living wage.

01:11:40,866 --> 01:11:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  but its competitors.

01:11:42,306 --> 01:11:42,654
SPEAKER_0:  can.

01:11:43,266 --> 01:11:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  than that firm.

01:11:44,546 --> 01:11:50,142
SPEAKER_0:  should, will either figure out a way to innovate, develop new techniques, new markets, new ways to be.

01:11:50,466 --> 01:11:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  productive or it should go out of business.

01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  and it would be better.

01:11:54,754 --> 01:11:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  for it to go out of business.

01:11:56,418 --> 01:11:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  than to stay in business.

01:11:57,954 --> 01:12:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  or to be artificially kept in business in any sort of way.

01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:07,710
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and yeah, so let me that's that's a Chrysler my old, um centralized

01:12:07,842 --> 01:12:11,486
SPEAKER_1:  Right, but then there is, you know, innovation costs money too.

01:12:12,098 --> 01:12:12,414
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:12:12,674 --> 01:12:13,822
SPEAKER_1:  the flip side of that.

01:12:15,650 --> 01:12:20,126
SPEAKER_1:  I think to play devil's advocate is that it incentivizes automotive industries.

01:12:20,354 --> 01:12:21,470
SPEAKER_1:  Probably a good example of that.

01:12:21,858 --> 01:12:23,134
SPEAKER_1:  It incentivizes.

01:12:23,874 --> 01:12:25,566
SPEAKER_1:  cutting costs everywhere.

01:12:26,146 --> 01:12:28,638
SPEAKER_1:  and sort of whatever has been making you money.

01:12:29,090 --> 01:12:29,662
SPEAKER_1:  currently.

01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:31,614
SPEAKER_1:  figuring out how to do that really well.

01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:35,454
SPEAKER_1:  without investing into the longterm future of the company for.

01:12:36,386 --> 01:12:37,086
SPEAKER_1:  all the different.

01:12:37,378 --> 01:12:44,830
SPEAKER_1:  ways it can pivot, all the different interesting things it could do, in terms of investing into R&D. Whenever there's more and more and more pressure, I'm paying.

01:12:45,282 --> 01:12:47,422
SPEAKER_1:  uh... a living wage for the workers

01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:48,670
SPEAKER_1:  It might not.

01:12:49,090 --> 01:12:51,454
SPEAKER_1:  again, it might suffocate and die.

01:12:51,682 --> 01:12:53,822
SPEAKER_1:  over the next 5, 10, 20 years.

01:12:54,658 --> 01:12:55,614
SPEAKER_1:  uh... which

01:12:55,842 --> 01:12:56,830
SPEAKER_1:  might be.

01:12:57,538 --> 01:13:00,478
SPEAKER_1:  a good destructive force from a capitalist perspective.

01:13:00,866 --> 01:13:08,062
SPEAKER_1:  but it might rob us of the Einstein of a company, of the flourishing that the company and the workers within it.

01:13:08,642 --> 01:13:11,267
SPEAKER_1:  can do over a period of 5, 10, 20 years.

01:13:11,267 --> 01:13:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  Well, this is just a problem with a lot of capitalism, which is about short-termism.

01:13:16,162 --> 01:13:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  because the same thing could be said from, you're starting a company, you have a plan for it to make a lot of money.

01:13:21,506 --> 01:13:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  but your investors want dividends right away.

01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  So you have to.

01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  Take away from your long term.

01:13:29,506 --> 01:13:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  R&D or other plans and deliver short-term.

01:13:32,834 --> 01:13:33,662
SPEAKER_0:  dividends.

01:13:34,018 --> 01:13:35,742
SPEAKER_0:  That's often why a lot of, I think.

01:13:36,002 --> 01:13:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  R&D is often rooted in state institutions and research and whatever else is being drawn on.

01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  And also I think that that's a reason why.

01:13:45,826 --> 01:13:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the state has some sort of role in fostering firms in either a, my version of a socialist economy or a capitalist economy or whatever else to help with these time horizons.

01:13:56,930 --> 01:13:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  problems.

01:13:57,890 --> 01:13:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  So I won't dispute that.

01:14:00,066 --> 01:14:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  workers could play a role or wage demands could play a role in time horizon problems.

01:14:04,738 --> 01:14:09,246
SPEAKER_0:  But more often than that, it's coming from investors, it's coming from

01:14:09,538 --> 01:14:12,862
SPEAKER_0:  just a host of other market pressures that people might have.

01:14:13,410 --> 01:14:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  And I would say that in the real world.

01:14:15,298 --> 01:14:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of investment funds don't come from just retained earnings.

01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:22,974
SPEAKER_0:  It comes from a lot of.

01:14:23,202 --> 01:14:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  you know, sources. So I think...

01:14:25,122 --> 01:14:27,166
SPEAKER_0:  This is a problem that could be solved through public.

01:14:27,394 --> 01:14:29,630
SPEAKER_0:  policy, but definitely exists today as well.

01:14:30,146 --> 01:14:31,614
SPEAKER_1:  So you meant a living wage.

01:14:32,322 --> 01:14:32,990
SPEAKER_1:  Is there?

01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:35,710
SPEAKER_1:  Is there a tension between a living wage?

01:14:36,514 --> 01:14:38,846
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe you could speak to what a living wage means.

01:14:39,426 --> 01:14:41,278
SPEAKER_1:  and the workers owning.

01:14:42,498 --> 01:14:44,222
SPEAKER_1:  all of the profit of the company.

01:14:45,666 --> 01:14:46,590
SPEAKER_1:  sort of a.

01:14:47,074 --> 01:14:48,254
SPEAKER_1:  this kind of spectrum.

01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:50,270
SPEAKER_1:  No, I guess the spectrum is from...

01:14:51,426 --> 01:14:51,806
SPEAKER_1:  like.

01:14:52,034 --> 01:14:52,670
SPEAKER_1:  No.

01:14:52,930 --> 01:14:54,046
SPEAKER_1:  No minimum wage.

01:14:54,306 --> 01:14:56,862
SPEAKER_1:  the lowest possible thing you could pay to a worker.

01:14:57,186 --> 01:14:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  then somewhere in that spectrum is a living wage.

01:15:00,002 --> 01:15:04,958
SPEAKER_1:  and then at the top is like all of the profit from the company is owned by the company or the medium that you're weakening that would you Chip Skinner

01:15:06,754 --> 01:15:07,422
SPEAKER_1:  So split.

01:15:07,810 --> 01:15:08,446
SPEAKER_1:  to the workers.

01:15:09,314 --> 01:15:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I think that any society is going to have to make.

01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  distributional.

01:15:14,274 --> 01:15:14,782
SPEAKER_0:  Choices?

01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:15,582
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:15:16,162 --> 01:15:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  you could have imagined a variety of capitalism in which...

01:15:19,426 --> 01:15:20,830
SPEAKER_0:  Workers are paid quite little.

01:15:21,154 --> 01:15:22,334
SPEAKER_0:  But this is extremely high.

01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:32,382
SPEAKER_0:  taxation and there's redistribution after the fact. You could imagine a system in which there's less taxation after the fact, but there's more guarantees and regulations on how much people are paid.

01:15:32,738 --> 01:15:33,438
SPEAKER_0:  before the fact.

01:15:34,562 --> 01:15:37,630
SPEAKER_0:  in my vision of a social society.

01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  there would be.

01:15:39,714 --> 01:15:48,158
SPEAKER_0:  similar way that unions work, in my example, the centralized bargaining unions would work that bargain at the sectoral level.

01:15:48,642 --> 01:15:51,262
SPEAKER_0:  and not just at the enterprise level like our unions do.

01:15:51,682 --> 01:15:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  do today.

01:15:52,546 --> 01:15:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  There could be benchmarks.

01:15:55,682 --> 01:15:55,998
SPEAKER_0:  Set.

01:15:56,610 --> 01:15:59,038
SPEAKER_0:  for different occupations or wages.

01:15:59,330 --> 01:16:03,390
SPEAKER_0:  And the reason why you would want to benchmark at a worker controlled firm.

01:16:03,650 --> 01:16:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  is that you don't want workers self-exporting themselves in order to gobble up market share or because you don't want them collectively deciding, okay, we're gonna invest in this longer term time horizon.

01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:16,574
SPEAKER_0:  and out-compete other people that way.

01:16:16,994 --> 01:16:20,062
SPEAKER_0:  So you might say, okay, if you do this sort of clerical work, you have to be paid.

01:16:20,642 --> 01:16:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  the equivalent of $15 an hour, and that's a minimum. But on top of that,

01:16:25,666 --> 01:16:26,942
SPEAKER_0:  you get.

01:16:27,394 --> 01:16:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  you get dividends from excess profits.

01:16:31,778 --> 01:16:34,398
SPEAKER_0:  And I think it would also have to be combined with.

01:16:34,786 --> 01:16:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:16:36,066 --> 01:16:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  Public financing.

01:16:37,506 --> 01:16:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  for expansions and for development.

01:16:39,906 --> 01:16:44,062
SPEAKER_0:  which could be done in quite a competitive way. So you could have a variety of-

01:16:44,514 --> 01:16:48,190
SPEAKER_0:  of banks, you know, my vision, you know, state-owned banks.

01:16:48,674 --> 01:16:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  But how would they decide?

01:16:51,042 --> 01:16:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  Hoodoo.

01:16:51,906 --> 01:16:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  invest in and who did not invest in, who to give a loan for expansion to and who not to.

01:16:57,634 --> 01:17:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  because you don't want it to be like, oh, I'm going to invest in my nephew's firm and not this other firm, or I'm going to invest in this guy's firm because he's an Italian, but not this guy's firm because he's Albanian or whatever else.

01:17:10,274 --> 01:17:10,878
SPEAKER_0:  Just make it.

01:17:11,650 --> 01:17:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  rational at the level of.

01:17:13,346 --> 01:17:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  Their goal is just like any other.

01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:17:17,122 --> 01:17:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  investment.

01:17:18,434 --> 01:17:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  person at a bank today.

01:17:20,066 --> 01:17:22,558
SPEAKER_0:  to maintain a certain risk profile.

01:17:22,914 --> 01:17:24,670
SPEAKER_0:  and to have an interest yield.

01:17:25,026 --> 01:17:31,806
SPEAKER_0:  and decide to invest on that basis. So there's a huge automotive firm that has been on business for 50 years.

01:17:32,130 --> 01:17:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  that needs a little operating cash.

01:17:33,826 --> 01:17:35,198
SPEAKER_0:  Like, yeah, they could get there.

01:17:35,426 --> 01:17:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  $50 million in a 3% loan. If you have some crazy blue sky idea and you manage to get it to that point, maybe you and your friends would get it at $50 million.

01:17:43,746 --> 01:17:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  you know, 12% or something closer to what a VC would offer today.

01:17:48,610 --> 01:17:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  I only kind of go into these details.

01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  Not because.

01:17:51,938 --> 01:17:52,414
SPEAKER_0:  to say that.

01:17:53,378 --> 01:17:55,774
SPEAKER_0:  A system doesn't have to in advance.

01:17:56,770 --> 01:17:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  map out all the different possibilities.

01:17:59,490 --> 01:18:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  but I think it does have to be.

01:18:02,018 --> 01:18:04,190
SPEAKER_0:  willing to accept a lot of things.

01:18:04,546 --> 01:18:07,902
SPEAKER_0:  we know today. I can't give you a version of socialism that's-

01:18:08,322 --> 01:18:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  Everything's going to be fine. We're going to live harmoniously and we won't have these sort of tensions and

01:18:14,402 --> 01:18:17,758
SPEAKER_0:  You know, you could hunt in the evening and fish in the...

01:18:18,050 --> 01:18:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  afternoon and write criticism, you know, whatever else.

01:18:21,922 --> 01:18:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  I do hope that there's horizons beyond this that we can aspire to. I do have those visions.

01:18:29,026 --> 01:18:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  But for now, I think.

01:18:30,434 --> 01:18:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  our task.

01:18:31,394 --> 01:18:36,414
SPEAKER_0:  as socialists is to imagine a, you know, five minutes after, you know, midnight.

01:18:37,442 --> 01:18:41,086
SPEAKER_0:  what can we do right away within our lifetime vision?

01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:42,590
SPEAKER_1:  So that means...

01:18:43,554 --> 01:18:48,318
SPEAKER_1:  through some level of central planning, reallocating resources to the workers.

01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  So I think.

01:18:50,178 --> 01:18:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  the primary mechanism in this private sector under

01:18:53,986 --> 01:18:58,526
SPEAKER_0:  Socialism would be a market mechanism, firms competing against each other to expand.

01:18:58,914 --> 01:19:00,574
SPEAKER_0:  are connected to a system of.

01:19:01,026 --> 01:19:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  public financing.

01:19:02,562 --> 01:19:05,662
SPEAKER_0:  But even at that level, the individual...

01:19:05,922 --> 01:19:10,046
SPEAKER_0:  bankers and public banks and so on would be operating based on their own.

01:19:10,402 --> 01:19:11,326
SPEAKER_0:  rationality.

01:19:11,874 --> 01:19:15,998
SPEAKER_0:  and the state would certainly shape investment decisions.

01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  but.

01:19:17,442 --> 01:19:18,910
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe no more than I do.

01:19:19,138 --> 01:19:24,030
SPEAKER_0:  in a lot of capitalist systems. The state might already today in a lot of countries decide to

01:19:24,770 --> 01:19:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  We want to invest in green technology. So it's going to be.

01:19:28,866 --> 01:19:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  favorable rates for people or tax credits for people investing in green technology. The state already shapes investment.

01:19:34,818 --> 01:19:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  I think what should be centrally planned, and this is where...

01:19:38,178 --> 01:19:42,302
SPEAKER_0:  I'm proud to sound like an old school socialist, is things like healthcare.

01:19:42,754 --> 01:19:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  Things like, um...

01:19:44,226 --> 01:19:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  transit.

01:19:45,346 --> 01:19:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  Things like our...

01:19:47,458 --> 01:19:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  natural monopolies of lots of types, I think can be done very well.

01:19:52,322 --> 01:19:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  through planning and we already have.

01:19:55,330 --> 01:19:58,878
SPEAKER_0:  plenty of examples, but a lot of this society, I think, would be.

01:19:59,234 --> 01:20:01,822
SPEAKER_0:  would be the private sphere of.

01:20:02,050 --> 01:20:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  worker controlled cooperatives.

01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  competing against each other.

01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  weak firms failing.

01:20:07,586 --> 01:20:09,054
SPEAKER_0:  Successful firms expanded.

01:20:09,410 --> 01:20:13,086
SPEAKER_1:  And the banks, you're saying publicly or privately owned? Publicly owned.

01:20:14,146 --> 01:20:20,382
SPEAKER_1:  let's just put it all on the table that it's almost guaranteed that every system has corruption so I guess the bigger question is

01:20:20,994 --> 01:20:22,686
SPEAKER_1:  which system has more corruption.

01:20:23,330 --> 01:20:23,902
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

01:20:24,674 --> 01:20:28,670
SPEAKER_1:  This one was central planning and worker cooperatives versus.

01:20:29,218 --> 01:20:30,846
SPEAKER_1:  unfettered capitalism.

01:20:31,234 --> 01:20:32,990
SPEAKER_1:  or any flavor of capitalism.

01:20:33,378 --> 01:20:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  I think any system has potential for corruption.

01:20:36,802 --> 01:20:45,079
SPEAKER_0:  I think it depends on how good your civil service is, how much oversight do you have to resolve a problem once it arises.

01:20:45,079 --> 01:20:46,814
SPEAKER_1:  corruption happening in social systems.

01:20:47,682 --> 01:20:51,870
SPEAKER_1:  So you have to, again, I apologize, but the large scale examples of it.

01:20:52,098 --> 01:20:52,638
SPEAKER_1:  So we can.

01:20:53,058 --> 01:20:55,678
SPEAKER_1:  We can look at Soviet Union, China and Sweden.

01:20:56,930 --> 01:20:59,294
SPEAKER_1:  are fundamentally different nations.

01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:03,806
SPEAKER_1:  and histories and peoples and economic systems and political systems.

01:21:04,162 --> 01:21:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  but all could be.

01:21:06,050 --> 01:21:06,590
SPEAKER_1:  called.

01:21:06,882 --> 01:21:08,030
SPEAKER_1:  in part socialist.

01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:10,142
SPEAKER_1:  And so what.

01:21:10,978 --> 01:21:11,582
SPEAKER_1:  You know, they're...

01:21:11,874 --> 01:21:16,158
SPEAKER_1:  There's a ridiculous almost caricature of corruption in the Soviet system.

01:21:16,610 --> 01:21:18,558
SPEAKER_1:  the gigantic bureaucracy that's built.

01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:19,934
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

01:21:20,226 --> 01:21:20,830
SPEAKER_1:  where...

01:21:21,442 --> 01:21:23,198
SPEAKER_1:  Somehow corruption seeps in.

01:21:24,642 --> 01:21:25,502
SPEAKER_1:  through kind of.

01:21:26,466 --> 01:21:28,222
SPEAKER_1:  dispersion of responsibility.

01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:31,422
SPEAKER_1:  that nobody's really responsible for the corruption?

01:21:32,194 --> 01:21:34,302
SPEAKER_1:  I just had a conversation with a college around.

01:21:34,626 --> 01:21:37,342
SPEAKER_1:  who fought the cartels in Mexico.

01:21:37,634 --> 01:21:45,470
SPEAKER_1:  And there is a huge amount of corruption in Mexico, but it's not like even seen as corruption. You understand when a cop pulls you over, you give this much money.

01:21:45,730 --> 01:21:46,142
SPEAKER_1:  and so on.

01:21:46,466 --> 01:21:51,518
SPEAKER_1:  And so that kind of seems to happen in certain systems, and it seems to have happened in social systems.

01:21:52,034 --> 01:21:53,502
SPEAKER_1:  more than...

01:21:53,762 --> 01:21:55,870
SPEAKER_1:  in capitalist systems in the 20th century.

01:21:56,290 --> 01:21:57,246
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe I'm wrong in that.

01:21:57,634 --> 01:22:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  I think in a lot of countries it's seen as the cost of doing business.

01:22:02,018 --> 01:22:02,366
SPEAKER_0:  Now.

01:22:02,754 --> 01:22:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  in particular countries built on a system of central planning or just state allocation resources where the state both produces and allocates and things run through.

01:22:13,858 --> 01:22:14,718
SPEAKER_0:  bureaucracies.

01:22:15,522 --> 01:22:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  then I think you're much more apt to have corruption.

01:22:19,234 --> 01:22:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  than in a system with just a smaller sphere for the state.

01:22:23,874 --> 01:22:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  So for example, if you're in a hypothetical version of the US.

01:22:27,746 --> 01:22:34,110
SPEAKER_0:  you might see a lot more corruption in the post office, but you wouldn't have that corruption in your workplace. So you kind of learn to-

01:22:34,402 --> 01:22:35,294
SPEAKER_0:  Go around.

01:22:35,810 --> 01:22:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  that.

01:22:36,706 --> 01:22:37,054
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:22:37,986 --> 01:22:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  For one thing, even in state sectors.

01:22:40,162 --> 01:22:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  you can have, and this often is the case in democratic countries.

01:22:43,938 --> 01:22:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  you have...

01:22:45,858 --> 01:22:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  a transparent civil service.

01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  where people who are corrupt

01:22:50,306 --> 01:22:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  prosecuted.

01:22:51,202 --> 01:22:54,334
SPEAKER_0:  by judges where it's frowned upon and it just

01:22:54,978 --> 01:22:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  Over time, it goes away.

01:22:56,962 --> 01:23:01,758
SPEAKER_0:  you go from having political machines that were tied to certain, you know, had friends at certain police.

01:23:01,986 --> 01:23:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  precincts and whatever else in the US in the 19th century and early 20th century to now today that would be a huge scandal and unheard of. Right. For time having a

01:23:12,450 --> 01:23:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  a um

01:23:14,370 --> 01:23:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  Independent court system having a...

01:23:18,434 --> 01:23:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  Truly meritocratic civil service can be implemented anywhere.

01:23:22,114 --> 01:23:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  I think though in the Soviet Union the extra

01:23:25,122 --> 01:23:25,726
SPEAKER_0:  little bit.

01:23:26,082 --> 01:23:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  that happened was...

01:23:27,490 --> 01:23:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  You had a bureaucracy that just had so much power because...

01:23:30,946 --> 01:23:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  that bureaucracy was producing and distributing everything. And everyone was relying on the bureaucracy with jobs.

01:23:36,738 --> 01:23:38,078
SPEAKER_0:  The way to social advancement.

01:23:38,530 --> 01:23:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  was through the bureaucracy so you end up with people like Khrushchev.

01:23:42,562 --> 01:23:47,678
SPEAKER_0:  people going from peasants to supreme leaders of countries just through.

01:23:47,970 --> 01:23:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  getting hooked up in the bureaucracy and advancing within it.

01:23:52,162 --> 01:24:00,414
SPEAKER_0:  And not all these were bad people. I don't think Khrushchev was that bad of a person or Gorbachev. But this is their mechanism to advancement in systems like this.

01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  in

01:24:02,274 --> 01:24:04,734
SPEAKER_0:  the vision of democratic socialism that I propose.

01:24:05,538 --> 01:24:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  The state doesn't have that overriding.

01:24:07,746 --> 01:24:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  power to begin with. But I think in either case, you know, corruption has arose in many different systems and has been successfully.

01:24:15,682 --> 01:24:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  dealt with.

01:24:17,090 --> 01:24:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  I think on the developmental trajectory of even countries today that we think of as being very corrupt.

01:24:22,466 --> 01:24:23,006
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:24:23,458 --> 01:24:24,286
SPEAKER_0:  Corruption will.

01:24:24,578 --> 01:24:25,534
SPEAKER_0:  Well, um...

01:24:25,826 --> 01:24:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  You know, fade away.

01:24:27,138 --> 01:24:27,742
SPEAKER_0:  as well.

01:24:28,130 --> 01:24:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  but you definitely need.

01:24:30,018 --> 01:24:32,350
SPEAKER_0:  a system in which...

01:24:32,674 --> 01:24:33,630
SPEAKER_0:  individuals.

01:24:34,626 --> 01:24:34,974
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:24:35,330 --> 01:24:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  individual are incentivized to act rationally.

01:24:38,722 --> 01:24:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  So if you're in a system...

01:24:40,770 --> 01:24:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  in which...

01:24:41,762 --> 01:24:42,814
SPEAKER_0:  cops who are corrupt.

01:24:43,106 --> 01:24:43,518
SPEAKER_0:  are.

01:24:44,034 --> 01:24:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  prosecuted.

01:24:44,898 --> 01:24:50,558
SPEAKER_0:  and investigated and there's internal controls, a civilian board review and kind of an internal.

01:24:50,850 --> 01:24:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  investigators within police departments or whatever else, there will be less corruption over time if people are

01:24:57,538 --> 01:24:57,982
SPEAKER_0:  Punished.

01:24:58,498 --> 01:25:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  if you're in a system in which

01:25:01,026 --> 01:25:04,542
SPEAKER_0:  If you're running a firm, you're the manager of a firm and elected manager.

01:25:04,994 --> 01:25:08,574
SPEAKER_0:  and everyone at that firm is trying for more efficiency and trying for more

01:25:08,898 --> 01:25:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  excess profits or whatever else at the end of the day, you know, dividends at the end of the day, then if you try to hire your nephew and he's not good at your job.

01:25:16,418 --> 01:25:18,878
SPEAKER_0:  you're not gonna win re-election, right? see you shouldn't

01:25:19,778 --> 01:25:21,246
SPEAKER_0:  I think no system should rely on.

01:25:21,794 --> 01:25:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  a change in culture.

01:25:23,746 --> 01:25:25,566
SPEAKER_0:  that come naturally or some sort of.

01:25:25,794 --> 01:25:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  individual altruism, I think the systems have to be constructed in such a way that it's not rational to behave.

01:25:32,290 --> 01:25:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  poorly.

01:25:33,154 --> 01:25:35,966
SPEAKER_1:  in sort of from a theoretical perspective.

01:25:36,802 --> 01:25:39,262
SPEAKER_1:  Either a socialist or capitalist system can have.

01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:41,694
SPEAKER_1:  can have either culture.

01:25:42,882 --> 01:25:44,606
SPEAKER_1:  But it seems like...

01:25:44,994 --> 01:25:47,870
SPEAKER_1:  if you prioritize meritocracy.

01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:51,454
SPEAKER_1:  If the people that are good...

01:25:51,714 --> 01:25:52,926
SPEAKER_1:  whatever the good means.

01:25:53,218 --> 01:25:56,574
SPEAKER_1:  In terms of integrity, in terms of performance, in terms of competence.

01:25:57,026 --> 01:25:58,526
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like...

01:25:58,882 --> 01:26:00,798
SPEAKER_1:  That leads to a less corrupt system.

01:26:01,218 --> 01:26:03,006
SPEAKER_1:  and it seems like capitalism.

01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:05,182
SPEAKER_1:  There's all kinds of flavors of capitalism.

01:26:06,018 --> 01:26:08,990
SPEAKER_1:  capitalism because it does prioritize meritocracy.

01:26:10,242 --> 01:26:12,222
SPEAKER_1:  more often leads to less corruption.

01:26:12,866 --> 01:26:16,446
SPEAKER_1:  So that's not a question of political or economic systems, it's a question of-

01:26:16,930 --> 01:26:20,305
SPEAKER_1:  What kind of stuff do you talk about that leads to a culture of less?

01:26:20,305 --> 01:26:20,702
SPEAKER_0:  option.

01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:22,654
SPEAKER_0:  First of all, I think it.

01:26:23,330 --> 01:26:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  Theory, maybe capitals and birds.

01:26:25,378 --> 01:26:26,174
SPEAKER_0:  Meritocracy.

01:26:26,850 --> 01:26:28,926
SPEAKER_0:  But I think in practice...

01:26:29,346 --> 01:26:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  Anyone watching this or you and me would think of some of the people we know that were

01:26:34,018 --> 01:26:39,646
SPEAKER_0:  the hardest and they're often, you know, working class people working the food service industry or whatever else, right?

01:26:39,906 --> 01:26:42,686
SPEAKER_0:  I think we don't have...

01:26:43,202 --> 01:26:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  In practice, I don't think we actually live in a society that rewards.

01:26:47,234 --> 01:26:50,782
SPEAKER_0:  people for hard work. I think we reward people for a combination.

01:26:51,298 --> 01:26:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  of accidents of birth.

01:26:53,410 --> 01:26:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  plus hardware.

01:26:54,562 --> 01:26:56,437
SPEAKER_0:  So now.

01:26:56,437 --> 01:26:59,614
SPEAKER_1:  back because yes so I agree with you

01:27:00,130 --> 01:27:03,294
SPEAKER_1:  But let me push back on a subtle point because I like to.

01:27:03,522 --> 01:27:05,374
SPEAKER_1:  to draw a difference between hard work.

01:27:06,082 --> 01:27:07,582
SPEAKER_1:  in meritocracy.

01:27:08,098 --> 01:27:09,694
SPEAKER_1:  as a person who works really hard.

01:27:09,986 --> 01:27:10,622
SPEAKER_1:  Like I work.

01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:11,550
SPEAKER_1:  Crazy Hard.

01:27:12,130 --> 01:27:15,230
SPEAKER_1:  but I've also worked with a lot of people, they're just much better.

01:27:16,290 --> 01:27:17,150
SPEAKER_1:  It's a hard work.

01:27:17,506 --> 01:27:18,718
SPEAKER_1:  does not equal.

01:27:19,106 --> 01:27:19,646
SPEAKER_1:  skill.

01:27:19,874 --> 01:27:20,286
SPEAKER_1:  Good.

01:27:20,738 --> 01:27:21,406
SPEAKER_1:  productive.

01:27:21,666 --> 01:27:24,798
SPEAKER_1:  I just want to kind of draw that distinction, but I agree with you.

01:27:25,378 --> 01:27:27,614
SPEAKER_1:  I don't think our society rewards.

01:27:28,418 --> 01:27:29,534
SPEAKER_1:  uh... directly

01:27:29,762 --> 01:27:30,494
SPEAKER_1:  Hard work.

01:27:30,786 --> 01:27:31,710
SPEAKER_1:  or even

01:27:31,970 --> 01:27:34,526
SPEAKER_1:  high skill. There's many examples at least we can see.

01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:35,998
SPEAKER_1:  that it does not do so.

01:27:36,290 --> 01:27:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  So we have an unequal distribution of talent.

01:27:38,882 --> 01:27:39,230
SPEAKER_0:  course.

01:27:39,586 --> 01:27:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  So if we lived in society in which...

01:27:41,730 --> 01:27:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  There was.

01:27:42,722 --> 01:27:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  some level of acceptable.

01:27:44,674 --> 01:27:49,022
SPEAKER_0:  inequality and it's a normative kind of the question of how much we would say is acceptable, right?

01:27:49,666 --> 01:27:54,878
SPEAKER_0:  And that inequality was based on this unequal distribution of talent.

01:27:55,522 --> 01:27:56,030
SPEAKER_0:  then.

01:27:56,322 --> 01:27:57,022
SPEAKER_0:  I think that would be it.

01:27:57,250 --> 01:27:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  Fine with me.

01:27:58,114 --> 01:27:59,870
SPEAKER_0:  Right? That would actually be a meritocracy.

01:28:00,354 --> 01:28:02,046
SPEAKER_0:  What I see in the US is often.

01:28:02,946 --> 01:28:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, so if you are a upper middle class or rich kid.

01:28:06,434 --> 01:28:07,390
SPEAKER_0:  and you.

01:28:07,842 --> 01:28:10,238
SPEAKER_0:  get a good education, you know, K through 12.

01:28:10,882 --> 01:28:11,454
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:28:12,258 --> 01:28:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  Out of those people, there will be some that work extra hard and go on to do incredible things or are very successful and there will be other people that...

01:28:19,906 --> 01:28:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:28:21,058 --> 01:28:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  Do not.

01:28:21,858 --> 01:28:24,478
SPEAKER_0:  Right, and decide for whatever reason or...

01:28:24,738 --> 01:28:25,726
SPEAKER_0:  Go down a different path.

01:28:26,306 --> 01:28:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  And you could say maybe among that group or the upper middle class, there is a meritocracy.

01:28:32,386 --> 01:28:45,022
SPEAKER_0:  they're actually given those opportunities to make their own decisions and to fail, whereas many, many other people, the vast majority of American society, I would say, 60 plus percent don't really get those opportunities to make those choices too.

01:28:45,346 --> 01:28:45,950
SPEAKER_0:  to begin with.

01:28:46,178 --> 01:28:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  And I would aspire to the type of world, at least as a first step.

01:28:50,370 --> 01:28:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  in which our

01:28:52,514 --> 01:28:54,846
SPEAKER_0:  Only inequalities are based on.

01:28:55,138 --> 01:28:59,614
SPEAKER_0:  the unequal, innate distributions of talent.

01:29:00,066 --> 01:29:03,294
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I guess a lot of people worry that when you have a

01:29:03,778 --> 01:29:06,686
SPEAKER_1:  a socialist in any degree central.

01:29:07,106 --> 01:29:08,958
SPEAKER_1:  planning, or perhaps a collective.

01:29:09,282 --> 01:29:10,110
SPEAKER_1:  of workers.

01:29:10,466 --> 01:29:15,038
SPEAKER_1:  that it won't result in that kind of meritocracy that you're talking about. But you're saying that no.

01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:17,141
SPEAKER_1:  it's possible to have that kind of merit talk.

01:29:17,141 --> 01:29:18,302
SPEAKER_0:  Think about it this way.

01:29:18,818 --> 01:29:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  The workers themselves are incentivized and are shaped by

01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:31,806
SPEAKER_0:  market forces too, right? They're trying to respond to consumer needs and preferences. They're trying to expand market share. They're trying to make money. So it requires no kind of leap into.

01:29:32,194 --> 01:29:35,166
SPEAKER_0:  these people are going to be more altruistic or whatever else, even on

01:29:35,394 --> 01:29:37,566
SPEAKER_0:  purely bourgeois terms the same way you would

01:29:37,954 --> 01:29:41,822
SPEAKER_0:  maybe justify in a competitive capitalist firms. I think you could just buy this.

01:29:42,242 --> 01:29:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  this system as long as you think that.

01:29:44,994 --> 01:29:48,190
SPEAKER_0:  people elected management can perform just as well. I think the

01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  based on the experiences of cooperatives, we've seen that they... they can?

01:29:52,898 --> 01:29:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  than at the state level.

01:29:54,658 --> 01:29:59,326
SPEAKER_0:  state bureaucracies have their own sort of sets of incentives.

01:30:00,834 --> 01:30:04,318
SPEAKER_0:  in most systems that already have extensive state bureaucracies.

01:30:04,674 --> 01:30:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  These people at high levels are appointed or elected, they're held to certain standards.

01:30:10,402 --> 01:30:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  at the national level, a national government.

01:30:13,506 --> 01:30:15,390
SPEAKER_0:  wants to maintain, you know...

01:30:15,618 --> 01:30:22,110
SPEAKER_0:  the tax revenue that they need to pay for services. We already, I think, have incentive structures that you could say that...

01:30:23,010 --> 01:30:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  Some people might just, I think, disagree with the normative thing of like...

01:30:26,146 --> 01:30:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  Why would people have to?

01:30:28,226 --> 01:30:31,870
SPEAKER_0:  own their own means of production, control their workplaces, or whatever else.

01:30:32,322 --> 01:30:34,430
SPEAKER_0:  Why do we need this level of equality?

01:30:34,786 --> 01:30:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:30:35,682 --> 01:30:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  Can't we just get by with our existing system, but just like...

01:30:39,650 --> 01:30:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  make things a little bit easier for capitalists to make money than everyone will benefit or whatever else. That's a normative question.

01:30:45,058 --> 01:30:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  And my vision of socialism, there'll be plenty of, you know.

01:30:48,258 --> 01:30:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  multiple parties with different views and perspectives trying to either

01:30:51,938 --> 01:30:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  Pushes deeper.

01:30:53,346 --> 01:30:56,702
SPEAKER_0:  into more radical forms of socialism or on the other hand to kind of

01:30:56,994 --> 01:31:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  roll back to more capitalist forms of government. So I think that, again,

01:31:02,466 --> 01:31:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  You can't try to make up a perfect system and try to implement it.

01:31:06,754 --> 01:31:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  you have to, you know.

01:31:08,770 --> 01:31:09,118
SPEAKER_0:  Do it.

01:31:09,506 --> 01:31:10,494
SPEAKER_0:  as a process.

01:31:10,754 --> 01:31:12,414
SPEAKER_0:  democratically and so on.

01:31:12,546 --> 01:31:15,038
SPEAKER_1:  So just philosophically in your gut.

01:31:15,874 --> 01:31:17,950
SPEAKER_1:  You're more concerned about the innate.

01:31:18,754 --> 01:31:20,702
SPEAKER_1:  equal value of human beings.

01:31:21,282 --> 01:31:27,614
SPEAKER_1:  versus the efficiency of this wonderful mechanism that we call human civilization at producing cool stuff.

01:31:28,322 --> 01:31:29,214
SPEAKER_1:  Just like a gut.

01:31:29,890 --> 01:31:31,998
SPEAKER_1:  if we're sitting at a bar, that's where the gut.

01:31:32,450 --> 01:31:33,118
SPEAKER_1:  feeling.

01:31:33,442 --> 01:31:34,174
SPEAKER_1:  you come with.

01:31:34,658 --> 01:31:37,662
SPEAKER_1:  course your mind is open but you want to protect.

01:31:37,922 --> 01:31:39,166
SPEAKER_1:  the equal value of humans.

01:31:41,314 --> 01:31:49,214
SPEAKER_0:  So I don't want to fight the hypothetical, so I'll say equality. I am concerned with equality, but I don't think the two are necessarily always in tension.

01:31:49,858 --> 01:31:54,174
SPEAKER_0:  But also, when you think about all the great things that human beings...

01:31:54,786 --> 01:31:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  have produced.

01:31:56,642 --> 01:31:57,278
SPEAKER_0:  Often.

01:31:57,858 --> 01:32:01,278
SPEAKER_0:  I think people today just look at the end outcome. Like we go.

01:32:01,698 --> 01:32:03,390
SPEAKER_0:  to the pyramids.

01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  and we'll marvel at the.

01:32:05,986 --> 01:32:10,014
SPEAKER_0:  pyramids and the human achievement that it took to make it happen, but we won't.

01:32:10,754 --> 01:32:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  gonna stop to think about all the suffering that went into the making of that thing.

01:32:15,554 --> 01:32:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  So I think we kind of lean in the opposite direction, where we marvel at our achievements, but we don't often think about.

01:32:22,082 --> 01:32:22,526
SPEAKER_0:  Beep.

01:32:22,850 --> 01:32:26,942
SPEAKER_0:  suffering or exploitation that went into certain human achievements. I would love a society in which-

01:32:27,810 --> 01:32:30,622
SPEAKER_0:  we could marvel at things and...

01:32:30,914 --> 01:32:31,294
SPEAKER_0:  NOT.

01:32:31,906 --> 01:32:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  to worry about the exploitation that was involved because there was no exploitation or oppression involved. There was just...

01:32:37,570 --> 01:32:40,670
SPEAKER_0:  human ingenuity and creativity and collaboration.

01:32:41,090 --> 01:32:45,694
SPEAKER_1:  and to the degree, which you may disagree, to the degree there's a tension between the two.

01:32:45,922 --> 01:32:48,958
SPEAKER_1:  at least give equal weight to the consideration of the suffering.

01:32:49,858 --> 01:32:55,189
SPEAKER_1:  and don't just marvel at the beauty of the creations. To the degree there is a tension between the two.

01:32:55,189 --> 01:33:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  What Stalin did, actually, too, it's not just capitalism, what Stalin did was he sacrificed whole generations.

01:33:00,578 --> 01:33:02,366
SPEAKER_0:  because he thought that he was building something.

01:33:02,786 --> 01:33:07,454
SPEAKER_0:  for the future, for future Russians to enjoy for future people of the world to

01:33:07,874 --> 01:33:08,862
SPEAKER_0:  to enjoy.

01:33:09,154 --> 01:33:11,582
SPEAKER_0:  and actually that analogy that I just gave about the pyramids.

01:33:12,034 --> 01:33:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  was, um...

01:33:13,858 --> 01:33:16,510
SPEAKER_0:  was written by Karl Kotzke, the German.

01:33:16,834 --> 01:33:19,134
SPEAKER_0:  a socialist, an anti-Stalinist.

01:33:19,426 --> 01:33:19,742
SPEAKER_0:  critic.

01:33:20,194 --> 01:33:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  when he was complaining about US journalists and others.

01:33:23,298 --> 01:33:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  going to Russia in the 1930s and marveling at all the new industries.

01:33:27,138 --> 01:33:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  Are these people blind to the suffering behind these things they're marveling about?

01:33:32,354 --> 01:33:34,302
SPEAKER_1:  Speaking of which, I think you mentioned...

01:33:34,946 --> 01:33:36,478
SPEAKER_1:  in the context of uh...

01:33:37,218 --> 01:33:40,158
SPEAKER_1:  a social democracy that freedom of speech and freedom of the press

01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:44,318
SPEAKER_1:  or basically the freedom of people to have a voice is an important component.

01:33:44,802 --> 01:33:45,950
SPEAKER_1:  which I think is something that.

01:33:46,242 --> 01:33:50,814
SPEAKER_1:  caught my ear a little bit because if you think about the Soviet Union, one of the ways.

01:33:51,426 --> 01:33:51,902
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

01:33:52,418 --> 01:33:55,966
SPEAKER_1:  that the authoritarian regime was able to control.

01:33:56,994 --> 01:34:02,046
SPEAKER_1:  It's almost part of the central planning is you have to control the message and you have to limit the freedom of the press.

01:34:02,722 --> 01:34:05,182
SPEAKER_1:  There's a kind of notion, especially in like...

01:34:06,434 --> 01:34:10,014
SPEAKER_1:  ideas or maybe caricatures of the ideas of cultural Marxism.

01:34:10,786 --> 01:34:13,182
SPEAKER_1:  sometimes caricatured even further as wokeism.

01:34:13,858 --> 01:34:19,422
SPEAKER_1:  that you want to be careful with speech. You want to censor speech because some speech hurts people.

01:34:20,578 --> 01:34:22,750
SPEAKER_1:  So in some sense you want to respect.

01:34:23,106 --> 01:34:25,406
SPEAKER_1:  the value, the equality of human beings.

01:34:25,986 --> 01:34:27,678
SPEAKER_1:  by being careful with the words you say.

01:34:28,098 --> 01:34:28,542
SPEAKER_1:  So.

01:34:28,802 --> 01:34:30,622
SPEAKER_1:  What is their attention there for you?

01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  I think there's no tension.

01:34:32,866 --> 01:34:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  And in part, I think that

01:34:34,946 --> 01:34:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  It is very condescending or patronizing for-

01:34:38,242 --> 01:34:39,774
SPEAKER_0:  to assume that people can't.

01:34:40,258 --> 01:34:41,886
SPEAKER_0:  take debate that people.

01:34:42,114 --> 01:34:43,262
SPEAKER_0:  can't.

01:34:43,714 --> 01:34:45,630
SPEAKER_0:  either as a society or individuals.

01:34:45,986 --> 01:34:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  visually be, um...

01:34:47,842 --> 01:34:49,918
SPEAKER_0:  engaged in the exchange of ideas.

01:34:50,146 --> 01:34:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  without or even very vigorous debate.

01:34:53,986 --> 01:34:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  without um...

01:34:55,586 --> 01:34:57,918
SPEAKER_0:  being broken by it. It's just not the case.

01:34:59,042 --> 01:35:03,966
SPEAKER_0:  I'm basically a free speech absolutist. I mean, I would draw the line and obviously.

01:35:04,482 --> 01:35:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  direct incitements of violence or certain other speech like that, but in general.

01:35:09,282 --> 01:35:11,518
SPEAKER_1:  You think a lot of people would be surprised to hear that?

01:35:12,866 --> 01:35:17,310
SPEAKER_0:  No, I mean, not people who know my work. I mean, more generally, I think a lot of people on the right.

01:35:17,602 --> 01:35:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:35:18,754 --> 01:35:20,670
SPEAKER_0:  Even in the center I think might have the idea.

01:35:20,898 --> 01:35:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  that a lot of this far left.

01:35:22,786 --> 01:35:24,222
SPEAKER_0:  wants to censor them.

01:35:24,738 --> 01:35:30,974
SPEAKER_0:  I think some of the center-left wants to censor them, but I think a lot on the far left, on the Marxist or socialist left.

01:35:31,458 --> 01:35:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  I think that...

01:35:33,058 --> 01:35:36,830
SPEAKER_0:  you know, free speech is more or less.

01:35:37,314 --> 01:35:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  the norm.

01:35:38,594 --> 01:35:39,934
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, where is the...

01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:42,782
SPEAKER_1:  the imperative the sense are coming from.

01:35:43,234 --> 01:35:44,414
SPEAKER_1:  Is this just some?

01:35:44,802 --> 01:35:47,646
SPEAKER_1:  Small subset of the left on Twitter.

01:35:47,970 --> 01:35:48,798
SPEAKER_1:  Is there some?

01:35:49,154 --> 01:35:51,710
SPEAKER_1:  philosophical idea behind certain groups that

01:35:52,226 --> 01:35:55,646
SPEAKER_1:  like if we were to steal man the case and which group actually has it.

01:35:56,226 --> 01:35:58,878
SPEAKER_1:  the interests of humanity in mind.

01:35:59,458 --> 01:36:01,822
SPEAKER_1:  uh... in wanting to sensor speech

01:36:02,178 --> 01:36:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  I think we might need to just take it case by case for an example.

01:36:05,794 --> 01:36:07,678
SPEAKER_0:  by example, because honestly I-

01:36:08,674 --> 01:36:09,790
SPEAKER_0:  I would have to.

01:36:10,018 --> 01:36:12,766
SPEAKER_0:  think about a particular case, but let's just say generally that

01:36:13,410 --> 01:36:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  a lot of.

01:36:14,434 --> 01:36:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  American liberalism.

01:36:16,802 --> 01:36:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  rightly sees.

01:36:18,562 --> 01:36:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  the, um...

01:36:20,258 --> 01:36:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  revolution around the civil rights and later the extension of this rights revolution

01:36:25,570 --> 01:36:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  for gay rights and so on as being...

01:36:29,730 --> 01:36:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  a very positive achievement in the last half century and I completely

01:36:33,378 --> 01:36:33,758
SPEAKER_0:  Agree.

01:36:35,138 --> 01:36:35,966
SPEAKER_0:  Now for me.

01:36:36,738 --> 01:36:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  now that we won those rights.

01:36:38,978 --> 01:36:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  a lot of our battle for change needs to go beyond the representational realm.

01:36:43,778 --> 01:36:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  and needs to really reground itself.

01:36:47,042 --> 01:36:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  in.

01:36:47,874 --> 01:36:52,510
SPEAKER_0:  the material bread and butter struggles of ordinary people trying to survive.

01:36:52,898 --> 01:36:54,622
SPEAKER_0:  of the battle for.

01:36:54,978 --> 01:36:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  good healthcare for all Americans and so on. These are my immediate demands.

01:36:59,234 --> 01:37:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  I think there's a segment of American liberalism that doesn't want to go in that confrontational economic direction and wants to skirt away.

01:37:07,106 --> 01:37:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  from battles over things like universal healthcare and so on.

01:37:11,682 --> 01:37:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  and really are just still caught.

01:37:14,562 --> 01:37:16,670
SPEAKER_0:  this battle over rights and representation.

01:37:17,218 --> 01:37:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:37:18,562 --> 01:37:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  It's devolved in such a way that they feel like they need to make change. The way they make change is only through interventions and culture.

01:37:26,786 --> 01:37:28,542
SPEAKER_0:  because they don't really have the same sense of.

01:37:28,898 --> 01:37:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  class and class struggle that agree or disagree.

01:37:31,778 --> 01:37:33,662
SPEAKER_0:  With it, it's a very material plane.

01:37:34,274 --> 01:37:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  So instead...

01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:40,542
SPEAKER_0:  You know, they look at comedians who said the wrong thing, or they look at, um...

01:37:41,026 --> 01:37:43,038
SPEAKER_0:  and all sorts of other ways to make

01:37:43,490 --> 01:37:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  change, it's not really making a change, it's just making them look bad and making our culture worse.

01:37:50,082 --> 01:37:53,598
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that's where a lot of it comes from.

01:37:54,114 --> 01:37:55,198
SPEAKER_0:  I think that a lot of-

01:37:55,714 --> 01:38:00,062
SPEAKER_0:  Even the left that's much more into battles over...

01:38:00,322 --> 01:38:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  Um, you know.

01:38:01,858 --> 01:38:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  race and lots of other stuff like real serious anti-racist on the left. Of course I'm an anti-racist, but a lot of my

01:38:08,162 --> 01:38:09,214
SPEAKER_0:  My work is focused.

01:38:09,602 --> 01:38:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  on the primacy of class.

01:38:11,426 --> 01:38:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  But even these people are very concerned about material struggles and issues, and they don't really care about

01:38:16,642 --> 01:38:17,022
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

01:38:17,794 --> 01:38:19,678
SPEAKER_0:  these issues they think are.

01:38:19,938 --> 01:38:22,206
SPEAKER_0:  um, ephemeral kind of issues.

01:38:22,530 --> 01:38:23,870
SPEAKER_1:  See, when you focus...

01:38:24,386 --> 01:38:27,358
SPEAKER_1:  exclusively on language that somehow leads you astray.

01:38:27,682 --> 01:38:30,558
SPEAKER_1:  like on being concerned about language without a.

01:38:31,202 --> 01:38:31,614
SPEAKER_1:

01:38:32,034 --> 01:38:33,150
SPEAKER_1:  Like deeper.

01:38:33,698 --> 01:38:35,742
SPEAKER_1:  economic inequalities and so on.

01:38:36,002 --> 01:38:39,742
SPEAKER_1:  You just become an asshole. That's on Twitter pointing out how everything-

01:38:41,026 --> 01:38:41,502
SPEAKER_1:  how.

01:38:41,762 --> 01:38:46,174
SPEAKER_1:  how racist everyone is. So the anti-racism becomes a caricature of anti-racism.

01:38:46,338 --> 01:38:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  Exactly, because...

01:38:47,554 --> 01:38:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  Anti-racism was really about the struggle of people for

01:38:51,170 --> 01:38:54,494
SPEAKER_0:  equal rights and voting. It was about the struggle for people.

01:38:54,786 --> 01:38:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  who were trapped into.

01:38:57,250 --> 01:39:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  you know, bad neighborhoods because they were, they couldn't get decent jobs and their neighborhoods were redlined or whatever else. It was really like a struggle for survival. And what was the main-

01:39:06,370 --> 01:39:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  demands, like the language of this. х1

01:39:08,802 --> 01:39:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  It was the march for jobs and freedom.

01:39:12,194 --> 01:39:19,390
SPEAKER_0:  It was the slogan, I am a man, asserting the kind of universal dignity of people. This is what the civil rights movement was.

01:39:19,810 --> 01:39:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  was about and it wasn't surprise there was a lot of

01:39:22,498 --> 01:39:27,774
SPEAKER_0:  self-described socialists, people like Bayard Rustin, A. Philip Randolph.

01:39:28,162 --> 01:39:29,886
SPEAKER_0:  Martin Luther King Jr.

01:39:30,722 --> 01:39:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  I mean these were people who...

01:39:32,514 --> 01:39:33,342
SPEAKER_0:  Who were?

01:39:33,858 --> 01:39:36,990
SPEAKER_0:  Ella Baker, they were socialists.

01:39:37,442 --> 01:39:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  I think a lot of Americans agree with them.

01:39:40,002 --> 01:39:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  third.

01:39:40,738 --> 01:39:42,526
SPEAKER_0:  immediate demands, even though they weren't.

01:39:42,946 --> 01:39:43,838
SPEAKER_0:  themselves.

01:39:44,098 --> 01:39:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  a socialist but it was a very materialistic.

01:39:46,914 --> 01:39:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  struggle and I think a lot of this has been co-opted into

01:39:50,530 --> 01:39:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  Just some sort of vague and...

01:39:52,610 --> 01:39:52,926
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

01:39:53,922 --> 01:39:56,286
SPEAKER_0:  disconcerting complaints about

01:39:56,706 --> 01:39:59,230
SPEAKER_0:  language or culture and so on.

01:39:59,682 --> 01:40:04,574
SPEAKER_1:  Martin Luther King was a socialist? To what degree was he a socialist? I would love to learn about that.

01:40:04,866 --> 01:40:09,950
SPEAKER_0:  Martin Luther King, I think, broadly called himself, at various points in his life, a Christian socialist.

01:40:10,242 --> 01:40:11,102
SPEAKER_0:  or Democratic.

01:40:11,490 --> 01:40:12,094
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:40:12,546 --> 01:40:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  Socialist, especially after...

01:40:15,618 --> 01:40:20,926
SPEAKER_0:  his speech against the Vietnam War and the Riverside Church. I think that was 67.

01:40:21,378 --> 01:40:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  last years of his life.

01:40:22,786 --> 01:40:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  He became much more involved in struggles against the war and also struggles.

01:40:27,458 --> 01:40:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:40:28,322 --> 01:40:31,582
SPEAKER_0:  for workers' rights. You know, he was assassinated when he was.

01:40:31,874 --> 01:40:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  at a rally at workers' rights. So we thought the next battle was going to be an economic battle.

01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  He had this famous line where he said,

01:40:39,266 --> 01:40:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  I don't just want to integrate.

01:40:41,730 --> 01:40:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  the lunch counter, if it means that

01:40:44,290 --> 01:40:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  we can't afford to order a burger while we're there. That was the line along those lines. And I think that got to this point where the civil rights struggle was part of a step.

01:40:53,090 --> 01:40:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  building some sort of wider movement.

01:40:55,106 --> 01:41:01,278
SPEAKER_0:  So he and these other civil rights leaders were very much interested in working with organized labor, the actions of myös the

01:41:01,698 --> 01:41:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  the left as it was constructed then and building some sort of mass space for not just rights, but redistribution.

01:41:09,538 --> 01:41:10,430
SPEAKER_1:  It's fascinating.

01:41:10,722 --> 01:41:14,293
SPEAKER_1:  It's fascinating which figures self-identified They realize what you're stewwoing at.

01:41:14,293 --> 01:41:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  Socialists. Einstein was one.

01:41:16,546 --> 01:41:21,246
SPEAKER_0:  Albert Einstein wrote an article for the first issue of this.

01:41:21,826 --> 01:41:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:41:22,722 --> 01:41:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  left-wing magazines actually still publishing today called Monthly Review and I think 1949 his article is called Why Socialism?

01:41:31,682 --> 01:41:36,222
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think it's paywalled, so people should check it out. But yeah, Einstein was one.

01:41:36,578 --> 01:41:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  Huh.

01:41:38,114 --> 01:41:38,558
SPEAKER_1:  Huh.

01:41:39,138 --> 01:41:43,550
SPEAKER_1:  Probably the central idea is the pacifist, the anti-war idea for him.

01:41:44,482 --> 01:41:44,990
SPEAKER_1:  Or no?

01:41:45,282 --> 01:41:50,590
SPEAKER_0:  Honestly, it's been so many years since I read it. I think it was more about, um...

01:41:51,362 --> 01:41:55,487
SPEAKER_0:  I think it was actually more economically focused, but I would need to go back and. But is.

01:41:55,487 --> 01:41:58,142
SPEAKER_1:  is war in general apart.

01:41:59,106 --> 01:42:05,822
SPEAKER_1:  of the fundamental ideas that socialists are against, democratic socialists are against. Like what's the relation between socialism and war?

01:42:06,562 --> 01:42:10,206
SPEAKER_0:  So I think that traditionally in the socialist movement, war was associated with

01:42:10,658 --> 01:42:13,598
SPEAKER_0:  capitalist competition and inter-

01:42:13,826 --> 01:42:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  national competition and you can look at what we're one is very much a case where

01:42:18,434 --> 01:42:33,214
SPEAKER_0:  different nations were competing with each other and developing quite violent rivalries that was in part based on competition and the periphery over access to markets and colonies and and whatever else so it was very easy to draw a direct correlation.

01:42:34,050 --> 01:42:34,526
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:42:35,330 --> 01:42:36,926
SPEAKER_0:  I am opposed to.

01:42:38,018 --> 01:42:38,686
SPEAKER_0:

01:42:38,978 --> 01:42:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  war, I'm opposed to imperialism, the domination of strong nations, you know, dominating smaller nations.

01:42:46,466 --> 01:42:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:42:47,554 --> 01:42:54,142
SPEAKER_0:  I wouldn't call myself a pacifist. I think most socialists wouldn't call themselves pacifists because there are some struggles that are worth fighting for. You know, there is.

01:42:54,370 --> 01:42:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  national liberation struggles and so on where.

01:42:57,058 --> 01:43:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  If there's no democratic avenue for change, positive change has been made through.

01:43:02,210 --> 01:43:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  through armed revolts around colonialism and whatnot, but we're living in an age where hopefully-

01:43:07,650 --> 01:43:08,190
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:43:08,418 --> 01:43:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  I know neither of us have children.

01:43:10,530 --> 01:43:13,694
SPEAKER_0:  our children or children, children in the future.

01:43:14,146 --> 01:43:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  won't have to live through war. And that is one thing that adds.

01:43:18,626 --> 01:43:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  countries have gotten more developed.

01:43:21,154 --> 01:43:28,414
SPEAKER_0:  Um, as the world has changed, we've actually seen less and less war. Like I won't dispute Pinker on, on this. I think it's true.

01:43:28,994 --> 01:43:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  Obviously, Putin's invasion of

01:43:31,650 --> 01:43:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  Ukraine and the conflict in Ethiopia is kind of an exception, but on the whole, I think we're going in that.

01:43:39,650 --> 01:43:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  in that.

01:43:40,482 --> 01:43:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  direction. I think it's always been, you know, a major.

01:43:44,194 --> 01:43:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  organizing Plank of Socialists against war and against this sense of

01:43:49,858 --> 01:43:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  right-wing nationalism and national identity that often leads to

01:43:54,306 --> 01:43:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  More.

01:43:54,882 --> 01:43:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  And obviously not everyone on the right has embraced that. A lot of libertarians are consistently anti-war.

01:44:00,066 --> 01:44:01,822
SPEAKER_0:  as well but I think.

01:44:02,498 --> 01:44:03,038
SPEAKER_0:  The right.

01:44:03,426 --> 01:44:08,350
SPEAKER_0:  ideologically has been associated with war, even if some advocates of capitalism have been...

01:44:09,186 --> 01:44:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  Then there's the military industrial complex, which is the financial machine of the whole thing.

01:44:13,922 --> 01:44:15,038
SPEAKER_1:  I presume...

01:44:16,866 --> 01:44:17,310
SPEAKER_1:  Well...

01:44:18,146 --> 01:44:20,222
SPEAKER_1:  Well, since a lot of that is government.

01:44:20,482 --> 01:44:22,750
SPEAKER_1:  What's the relation to socialism and

01:44:23,042 --> 01:44:24,574
SPEAKER_1:  the Military Industrial Complex.

01:44:25,314 --> 01:44:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  Well, a lot of it's government contracts, but it's privately produced, right? My company's a Glocky, Martin, and things like that.

01:44:31,810 --> 01:44:38,750
SPEAKER_0:  You could draw a very crude materialist connection between any of these things and to kind of prove an ideological

01:44:39,426 --> 01:44:45,534
SPEAKER_0:  But we could produce just as many arms and then just bury them or never fire them off or whatever whatever else

01:44:46,114 --> 01:44:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  Obviously there are companies that have a vested interest in...

01:44:51,138 --> 01:44:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  heightening up.

01:44:52,002 --> 01:44:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  tensions, or saying that we need to buy a new weapon system to be prepared for conventional war with China, Russia.

01:44:58,850 --> 01:45:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  Meanwhile, I think we all know that if there's gonna be conventional war between these countries like it's gonna

01:45:04,386 --> 01:45:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  you know, it's going to lead to something worse.

01:45:07,458 --> 01:45:08,894
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and.

01:45:09,346 --> 01:45:12,606
SPEAKER_0:  and you know, no amount of advanced fighter jets is gonna make a...

01:45:12,834 --> 01:45:14,046
SPEAKER_0:  make a difference.

01:45:14,530 --> 01:45:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  but I try to avoid.

01:45:16,354 --> 01:45:17,182
SPEAKER_0:  TOOTER

01:45:17,762 --> 01:45:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  Causal connections even though there are relationships like

01:45:21,666 --> 01:45:22,334
SPEAKER_0:  It's kind of like.

01:45:23,138 --> 01:45:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  the old slogan which was

01:45:24,962 --> 01:45:27,454
SPEAKER_0:  Quite an effective slogan in the early 2000s.

01:45:27,714 --> 01:45:33,534
SPEAKER_0:  At my first anti-war marches when I was a teenager, I definitely have shouted at the kind of no war for oil.

01:45:33,986 --> 01:45:34,686
SPEAKER_0:  I both is.

01:45:35,170 --> 01:45:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  like correct in that it gets to what people senses of like what's going on, how it's bad.

01:45:39,970 --> 01:45:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  but also like.

01:45:41,058 --> 01:45:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  Analytically, it's kind of wanting to explain.

01:45:44,290 --> 01:45:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  what really happened or why we ended up in the Middle East, which is like a much more complex geopolitical story.

01:45:51,266 --> 01:45:56,830
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, and it is a story of geopolitics. Perhaps less a story of capitalism.

01:45:57,410 --> 01:45:58,430
SPEAKER_1:  or socialism.

01:45:58,978 --> 01:46:00,478
SPEAKER_1:  It's a story.

01:46:01,090 --> 01:46:07,966
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, it's a geopolitical story that I think actually operates outside of the economic system of individual nations.

01:46:08,514 --> 01:46:09,502
SPEAKER_1:  It has to do more with it.

01:46:10,754 --> 01:46:13,182
SPEAKER_1:  Honestly, in part, egos of leaders.

01:46:14,594 --> 01:46:15,070
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:46:15,650 --> 01:46:18,910
SPEAKER_1:  And there's a international battle for resources.

01:46:19,650 --> 01:46:20,775
SPEAKER_1:  But surely there's alternative.

01:46:20,775 --> 01:46:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  alternatives.

01:46:22,050 --> 01:46:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, definitely, and I think that...

01:46:24,002 --> 01:46:25,982
SPEAKER_0:  part of what being a socialist is.

01:46:26,370 --> 01:46:31,070
SPEAKER_0:  is about dreaming in the long term about a different sort of world without.

01:46:31,714 --> 01:46:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  In my mind, needless divisions of people into nations withstanding armies. You know, I'm sure we'll still have pride about where we're from and there's still a lot of people who are going to contribute distinct cultural features and so on about where we're from.

01:46:43,586 --> 01:46:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:46:44,514 --> 01:46:45,342
SPEAKER_0:  We definitely.

01:46:46,274 --> 01:46:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  at least for the foreseeable future, be divided into.

01:46:50,178 --> 01:46:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  places as like administrative units.

01:46:52,418 --> 01:46:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  but the idea that there should be a...

01:46:54,850 --> 01:47:03,486
SPEAKER_0:  Mexican army and an American army and a Russian army and a Ukrainian army is just on the face of it. The long run will be seen as ridiculous.

01:47:04,098 --> 01:47:06,846
SPEAKER_0:  just like we see it as ridiculous today looking back.

01:47:07,106 --> 01:47:09,310
SPEAKER_0:  at the idea that, you know, um...

01:47:10,082 --> 01:47:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  a

01:47:11,842 --> 01:47:16,830
SPEAKER_0:  Lord from London would be engaged in civil strife with a lord from...

01:47:17,506 --> 01:47:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  like Liverpool and a bunch of peasants would die, you know, just kind of on the face of it just seems kind of ridiculous that these different places would have their own.

01:47:24,898 --> 01:47:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  Banners and lords and armies. I think in the long run you might have to zoom out a thousand years, but in the long run...

01:47:31,106 --> 01:47:33,534
SPEAKER_0:  People will say the same about nation states.

01:47:33,762 --> 01:47:35,358
SPEAKER_0:  and standing armies and...

01:47:35,810 --> 01:47:36,926
SPEAKER_0:  BATTLE'S OVER!

01:47:37,218 --> 01:47:39,646
SPEAKER_0:  you know, specs of, of, of-

01:47:40,002 --> 01:47:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  dirt that mean nothing in a cosmic sense?

01:47:43,234 --> 01:47:46,622
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, no, for sure aliens would laugh at us, or humans that go

01:47:47,010 --> 01:47:48,030
SPEAKER_1:  Far beyond Earth.

01:47:48,994 --> 01:47:50,206
SPEAKER_1:  and look at the history.

01:47:52,930 --> 01:47:54,558
SPEAKER_1:  or most of the history will be forgotten.

01:47:55,714 --> 01:47:56,382
SPEAKER_1:  Because...

01:47:56,610 --> 01:47:59,198
SPEAKER_1:  if humans successfully expand on to the universe.

01:47:59,458 --> 01:48:01,950
SPEAKER_1:  Just the scale of civilization will grow so fast.

01:48:02,402 --> 01:48:03,902
SPEAKER_1:  that the bickering.

01:48:04,578 --> 01:48:08,734
SPEAKER_1:  of the first few thousand years of human history will be significant.

01:48:08,866 --> 01:48:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  There's a...

01:48:09,826 --> 01:48:11,038
SPEAKER_0:  Very Marxist idea.

01:48:11,362 --> 01:48:15,326
SPEAKER_0:  that I both appreciate in one way, but on the other hand, it's kind of scary, which is that.

01:48:16,034 --> 01:48:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  You know, um...

01:48:16,994 --> 01:48:18,462
SPEAKER_0:  Human history is only now beginning.

01:48:18,786 --> 01:48:20,190
SPEAKER_0:  before we're in prehistory.

01:48:20,482 --> 01:48:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. But in the future.

01:48:21,954 --> 01:48:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  like will be in kind of real history.

01:48:25,154 --> 01:48:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  I think that a lot of...

01:48:27,490 --> 01:48:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  really important history has already happened.

01:48:30,658 --> 01:48:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  And I think posterity will remember it.

01:48:33,506 --> 01:48:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that it will be easier to assign.

01:48:37,922 --> 01:48:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  certain people the role of like villains, the people...

01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  You know not to

01:48:42,818 --> 01:48:44,062
SPEAKER_0:  engage in the contentious.

01:48:44,290 --> 01:48:48,446
SPEAKER_0:  topic off topic of Ukraine or whatever else, but the idea that, you know.

01:48:48,770 --> 01:48:55,230
SPEAKER_0:  one government or bad would launch a war to recover or to take.

01:48:55,490 --> 01:48:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  you know, several hundred square miles of territory.

01:48:58,562 --> 01:49:05,022
SPEAKER_0:  and tens of thousands of people die, I think seems absurd to us many people today, luckily, but it would not have seemed absurd.

01:49:05,634 --> 01:49:11,582
SPEAKER_0:  50, 60 years ago would have just been a normal thing, right? These kind of territorial disputes and so on. I think projecting the future.

01:49:11,938 --> 01:49:14,206
SPEAKER_0:  I think within our lifetimes, we'll live to see.

01:49:14,498 --> 01:49:14,942
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:49:15,234 --> 01:49:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  that kind of conflict be.

01:49:16,994 --> 01:49:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  out

01:49:18,018 --> 01:49:19,646
SPEAKER_0:  eradicated and in part

01:49:20,098 --> 01:49:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  You could say that.

01:49:21,858 --> 01:49:29,630
SPEAKER_0:  Like why? I think it's because of popular pressure in organizations. So you could say kind of the pro-worker socialist organizing part of it, making it less.

01:49:29,922 --> 01:49:32,126
SPEAKER_0:  normal if you're a capitalist you could say

01:49:32,450 --> 01:49:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  while markets are more interlinked, so war is even more irrational.

01:49:36,706 --> 01:49:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  I don't really have a firm answer, whatever it is. I think it's a good thing.

01:49:41,666 --> 01:49:45,918
SPEAKER_1:  You mentioned Marx's view of history. It's kind of interesting to just briefly talk about.

01:49:46,178 --> 01:49:48,798
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think of it? What do you think of this?

01:49:49,506 --> 01:49:53,950
SPEAKER_1:  Marx's view of how the different systems evolve from the perspective of

01:49:54,626 --> 01:49:56,350
SPEAKER_1:  Class struggle is what we're talking about.

01:49:57,090 --> 01:50:00,670
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I fundamentally, I'm a Marxist, I fundamentally believe in...

01:50:01,058 --> 01:50:04,158
SPEAKER_0:  the broad contours of historical materialism.

01:50:05,442 --> 01:50:07,006
SPEAKER_0:  But I think we should be clear on what.

01:50:08,002 --> 01:50:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  Marxist theory tells us and what it doesn't tell us.

01:50:10,850 --> 01:50:12,606
SPEAKER_0:  I think Marxist theory tells us...

01:50:12,994 --> 01:50:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  pertinent things about how societies evolve, about how the distribution of resources work in any given society.

01:50:20,322 --> 01:50:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  I'm who owns.

01:50:21,954 --> 01:50:22,718
SPEAKER_0:  Who doesn't?

01:50:23,010 --> 01:50:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  How?

01:50:24,002 --> 01:50:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:50:24,930 --> 01:50:32,542
SPEAKER_0:  the conflict, distributional conflicts and so on. I think Marxism can tell us a lot. How surplus is distributed. Exactly, exactly

01:50:33,602 --> 01:50:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  What it can tell us is like...

01:50:35,554 --> 01:50:36,126
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:50:36,578 --> 01:50:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  As a friend put it, like, the...

01:50:38,338 --> 01:50:44,981
SPEAKER_0:  a sex appeal of blue jeans or whatever else. That's beyond what Marxism is meant to do.

01:50:44,981 --> 01:50:47,231
SPEAKER_1:  The economic system can tell us about the sex appeal of blue-

01:50:47,231 --> 01:50:49,278
SPEAKER_0:  No economic system, but

01:50:49,538 --> 01:50:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  socialism in the soviet sense when it was turned into

01:50:53,314 --> 01:50:59,550
SPEAKER_0:  the Soviet style dialectical materialism was meant to tell us everything from...

01:50:59,874 --> 01:51:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

01:51:00,738 --> 01:51:09,118
SPEAKER_0:  explain genetics and agriculture and whatever else in a very disastrous way. I definitely don't believe in the-

01:51:09,858 --> 01:51:19,262
SPEAKER_0:  application of these ideas in an extremely wide way. And also I'm a Marxist because it's a framework that helps me understand.

01:51:19,842 --> 01:51:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  Facts About the World.

01:51:22,210 --> 01:51:22,686
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:51:23,714 --> 01:51:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  At some point, I no longer think the framework is doing that. I will not be a Marxist.

01:51:29,346 --> 01:51:30,590
SPEAKER_0:  But I'm a socialist.

01:51:31,202 --> 01:51:32,702
SPEAKER_0:  on normative grounds.

01:51:33,090 --> 01:51:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  because I have certain beliefs about.

01:51:35,170 --> 01:51:41,150
SPEAKER_0:  the equality of people because I believe we should have a society with liberty, with equality, with fraternity.

01:51:41,954 --> 01:51:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  and that.

01:51:43,394 --> 01:51:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  I hope.

01:51:44,258 --> 01:51:48,414
SPEAKER_0:  I'll always be a socialist until the day I die, but it's kind of a very un-

01:51:48,642 --> 01:51:50,814
SPEAKER_0:  scientific or unserious thing to say.

01:51:51,298 --> 01:51:54,718
SPEAKER_0:  This is my framework from beginning to end, you know, the rest of my life.

01:51:54,850 --> 01:51:59,358
SPEAKER_1:  But from a perspective of history, you should say that Sir Mark says that you go through

01:51:59,650 --> 01:52:01,726
SPEAKER_1:  societies go through different stages.

01:52:02,594 --> 01:52:05,918
SPEAKER_1:  could be crudely summarized as primitive communism.

01:52:06,978 --> 01:52:07,870
SPEAKER_1:  Apealism.

01:52:08,162 --> 01:52:10,014
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe slave society, feudalism.

01:52:11,330 --> 01:52:13,726
SPEAKER_1:  defined by mercadilism.

01:52:14,402 --> 01:52:15,710
SPEAKER_1:  than capitalism.

01:52:16,066 --> 01:52:16,958
SPEAKER_1:  and socialism.

01:52:17,410 --> 01:52:18,366
SPEAKER_1:  And finally...

01:52:18,914 --> 01:52:19,454
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

01:52:19,682 --> 01:52:21,598
SPEAKER_1:  stateless communism.

01:52:22,050 --> 01:52:23,925
SPEAKER_1:  cause am I dare ma Am I? Did I miss something?

01:52:23,925 --> 01:52:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I think that was that was close enough. I mean, I think that's definitely.

01:52:27,426 --> 01:52:30,334
SPEAKER_0:  true of of Marxist theory that

01:52:30,754 --> 01:52:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  the contradictions of capitalism.

01:52:33,602 --> 01:52:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  the fact that it has brought together.

01:52:36,578 --> 01:52:37,630
SPEAKER_0:  all these workers.

01:52:38,242 --> 01:52:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

01:52:39,042 --> 01:52:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  all these materials and whatever else and it's now allowing us to socially create wealth on a mass scale.

01:52:45,698 --> 01:52:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  But that wealth is that.

01:52:47,810 --> 01:52:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  process is being privately directed.

01:52:51,202 --> 01:52:52,766
SPEAKER_0:  and also the surplus.

01:52:53,058 --> 01:52:55,358
SPEAKER_0:  is being privately kind of appropriated.

01:52:55,714 --> 01:52:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  is a contradiction.

01:52:57,218 --> 01:52:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  And that would lead to.

01:52:58,690 --> 01:53:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  some sort of rebellion or revolution or change and will have and eventually this contradiction would be a Federon production too so we would have to move.

01:53:06,786 --> 01:53:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  I'm Into Socialist.

01:53:08,258 --> 01:53:09,022
SPEAKER_0:  society.

01:53:09,154 --> 01:53:11,230
SPEAKER_1:  but exe is at the backtrack so

01:53:11,554 --> 01:53:19,614
SPEAKER_1:  In terms of contradiction, so it starts when we're in a village hunter-gatherers. That's what you call primitive communism where everyone is kind of equal.

01:53:20,098 --> 01:53:21,534
SPEAKER_1:  It's kind of a collective.

01:53:21,986 --> 01:53:29,118
SPEAKER_1:  Right? All right, maybe you could just, just let me, hold on a second. And then inequalities form of different flavors. So that's what imperialism is.

01:53:29,346 --> 01:53:35,294
SPEAKER_1:  One dude rises to the top and has some control of different flavor. That's what feudalism with

01:53:35,618 --> 01:53:37,054
SPEAKER_1:  when you have one dude at the top.

01:53:37,538 --> 01:53:42,782
SPEAKER_1:  and you have merchants doing some trading and so on. And then that leads to capitals when you have.

01:53:43,074 --> 01:53:50,238
SPEAKER_1:  private ownership of companies and they result in some kind of class inequality. Eventually Hargo

01:53:50,914 --> 01:53:54,686
SPEAKER_1:  that results in a revolution that says no, that's.

01:53:55,234 --> 01:54:00,926
SPEAKER_1:  this inequality is not okay, it's not natural, it doesn't respect the value of human beings and therefore it goes to socialism.

01:54:01,506 --> 01:54:02,366
SPEAKER_1:  where there is...

01:54:03,234 --> 01:54:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  Under Marx's view.

01:54:05,410 --> 01:54:07,006
SPEAKER_1:  I guess some role for the state.

01:54:08,258 --> 01:54:10,078
SPEAKER_1:  State is doing some redistribution.

01:54:10,402 --> 01:54:11,198
SPEAKER_1:  and then the pure.

01:54:11,490 --> 01:54:12,254
SPEAKER_1:  communism.

01:54:12,706 --> 01:54:13,406
SPEAKER_1:  at the end.

01:54:13,922 --> 01:54:14,814
SPEAKER_1:  is when it's.

01:54:15,362 --> 01:54:15,806
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

01:54:17,602 --> 01:54:21,406
SPEAKER_1:  It's a collective where there's no state centralized power.

01:54:22,466 --> 01:54:25,077
SPEAKER_1:  So, what's part of that is wrong?

01:54:25,077 --> 01:54:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  I think broadly the Marxist theory...

01:54:28,514 --> 01:54:29,438
SPEAKER_0:  of history.

01:54:30,434 --> 01:54:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  is about different.

01:54:32,354 --> 01:54:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  types, different modes of.

01:54:35,010 --> 01:54:37,310
SPEAKER_0:  production that existed various.

01:54:37,698 --> 01:54:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  times.

01:54:38,914 --> 01:54:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:54:39,778 --> 01:54:43,550
SPEAKER_0:  based on material conditions. So in the early times...

01:54:44,002 --> 01:54:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  in this theory.

01:54:46,082 --> 01:54:51,294
SPEAKER_0:  There was not much surplus being generated, right? There was generally egalitarian societies.

01:54:52,098 --> 01:54:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  And then...

01:54:53,282 --> 01:54:54,270
SPEAKER_0:  Um, as.

01:54:54,594 --> 01:54:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  We became agricultural as society developed. There was more surplus being produced.

01:55:00,578 --> 01:55:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  At then there was a group of people.

01:55:02,562 --> 01:55:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  the ruling classes of their age.

01:55:05,698 --> 01:55:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  that controlled and distributed.

01:55:09,506 --> 01:55:11,006
SPEAKER_0:  controlled that division of labor.

01:55:11,234 --> 01:55:14,814
SPEAKER_0:  and appropriated more of that surplus for themselves. They weren't involved.

01:55:15,106 --> 01:55:16,126
SPEAKER_0:  in productive labor.

01:55:16,482 --> 01:55:19,454
SPEAKER_0:  In an early print of society, everybody's involved in productive labor.

01:55:20,162 --> 01:55:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  Later on, you had casts of

01:55:22,338 --> 01:55:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  priests who do nothing but pray and write and lecture people all day, right?

01:55:27,330 --> 01:55:28,702
SPEAKER_0:  and you had...

01:55:29,058 --> 01:55:35,614
SPEAKER_0:  kings and rulers and bureaucrats and traders and so on. You have a more complex division of labor, but also more inequity.

01:55:35,842 --> 01:55:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  um, driving.

01:55:37,890 --> 01:55:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  Out of that.

01:55:39,074 --> 01:55:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:55:40,578 --> 01:55:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  Capitalism was a revolutionary system.

01:55:43,170 --> 01:55:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  because it took away one that made us tremendously more productive.

01:55:47,394 --> 01:55:51,070
SPEAKER_0:  it expanded production beyond our wildest imaginations.

01:55:51,746 --> 01:55:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  but it also no longer bound.

01:55:54,146 --> 01:56:02,366
SPEAKER_0:  workers to their lord or manor or whatever else. They were now free to move, free to engage in contracts with employers and-

01:56:02,722 --> 01:56:03,710
SPEAKER_0:  and so on.

01:56:04,898 --> 01:56:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  But even though workers are now producing all this tremendous wealth.

01:56:09,154 --> 01:56:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  and even though productive forces had been matured in such a way.

01:56:12,738 --> 01:56:14,014
SPEAKER_0:  They were.

01:56:14,306 --> 01:56:15,230
SPEAKER_0:  ultimately.

01:56:15,458 --> 01:56:16,350
SPEAKER_0:  taken away.

01:56:16,834 --> 01:56:17,310
SPEAKER_0:  from.

01:56:17,634 --> 01:56:19,870
SPEAKER_0:  all the wealth they were created. They got some of it back.

01:56:20,130 --> 01:56:21,438
SPEAKER_0:  They were in wealthy societies.

01:56:22,018 --> 01:56:24,990
SPEAKER_0:  but they were all there collectively together producing this well.

01:56:25,634 --> 01:56:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  And that was a potent force. So Marx theorized that would lead to...

01:56:30,146 --> 01:56:33,182
SPEAKER_0:  revolution or change in a socialist direction.

01:56:33,762 --> 01:56:35,742
SPEAKER_0:  I think in fact what we saw was that

01:56:37,826 --> 01:56:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, workers are dependent.

01:56:39,586 --> 01:56:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  on.

01:56:40,834 --> 01:56:43,134
SPEAKER_0:  on capitalists are dependent on workers.

01:56:44,578 --> 01:56:45,438
SPEAKER_0:  That depends, see?

01:56:45,698 --> 01:56:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  is um

01:56:47,778 --> 01:56:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  obviously symmetrical in the sense that workers are also dependent on capitalists, but in fact, it's an asymmetrical dependency and that ordinary workers need their jobs more than capitalists need the...

01:56:58,402 --> 01:56:59,710
SPEAKER_0:  contribution of.

01:57:00,194 --> 01:57:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  individual.

01:57:01,282 --> 01:57:01,790
SPEAKER_0:  Workers.

01:57:02,466 --> 01:57:04,158
SPEAKER_0:  So it became kind of a collective action.

01:57:04,418 --> 01:57:04,894
SPEAKER_0:  problem.

01:57:05,666 --> 01:57:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  Where...

01:57:06,530 --> 01:57:14,110
SPEAKER_0:  You would need the mass of workers to get together to decide to change things, but also people would be afraid because they'd be dependent on their jobs for their livelihood and so on.

01:57:14,466 --> 01:57:14,814
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:57:15,042 --> 01:57:16,030
SPEAKER_0:  Revolution became.

01:57:16,450 --> 01:57:17,438
SPEAKER_0:  A lot harder.

01:57:17,730 --> 01:57:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  than people thought, especially in-

01:57:19,650 --> 01:57:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  Democratic.

01:57:20,514 --> 01:57:21,022
SPEAKER_0:  countries.

01:57:21,410 --> 01:57:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  where workers had certain outlets and certain powers and rights and responsibility. You know, it's no surprise that-

01:57:27,362 --> 01:57:29,886
SPEAKER_0:  where you did have socialist revolutions where we're in places like

01:57:30,306 --> 01:57:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  the third world, post-colonial states trying to emerge out of colonialism.

01:57:35,394 --> 01:57:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  They were in places like

01:57:37,666 --> 01:57:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  China and Russia, autocratic countries, and never in advance.

01:57:43,650 --> 01:57:44,222
SPEAKER_0:  Capitalists.

01:57:44,674 --> 01:57:45,022
SPEAKER_0:  country.

01:57:45,890 --> 01:57:46,206
SPEAKER_0:  Now.

01:57:47,650 --> 01:57:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  in Marxist theory of history.

01:57:50,562 --> 01:57:54,718
SPEAKER_0:  even as interpreted by a lot of smart Marxists like G.A. Cohen and others.

01:57:55,650 --> 01:57:56,030
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:57:56,674 --> 01:57:58,526
SPEAKER_0:  there is a certain inevitability.

01:57:58,914 --> 01:58:00,414
SPEAKER_0:  to socialism after.

01:58:00,706 --> 01:58:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  capitalism.

01:58:01,794 --> 01:58:02,878
SPEAKER_0:  the way that I would.

01:58:03,458 --> 01:58:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  put it myself.

01:58:04,802 --> 01:58:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  is I kind of have a more...

01:58:06,786 --> 01:58:11,454
SPEAKER_0:  you could say like Kantian view of it. Like I think socialism is something that ought to happen.

01:58:12,130 --> 01:58:15,006
SPEAKER_0:  But it's not something that necessarily

01:58:15,266 --> 01:58:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  will happen.

01:58:16,834 --> 01:58:20,510
SPEAKER_0:  and we'll need to organize and persuade.

01:58:20,930 --> 01:58:22,942
SPEAKER_0:  and also potentially again.

01:58:23,522 --> 01:58:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  the key part of any social system.

01:58:25,826 --> 01:58:27,198
SPEAKER_0:  that's democratic is

01:58:27,650 --> 01:58:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  You have to.

01:58:28,738 --> 01:58:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  allow for the possibility of a democratic revision to a different sort of system.

01:58:33,538 --> 01:58:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  So I'd be more than happy in my vision of socialism for there to be capitalist parties.

01:58:39,234 --> 01:58:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  getting, you know, hopefully 3, 4, 5% of the vote, maybe a lot more.

01:58:43,810 --> 01:58:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  in the same way that in the US or a public.

01:58:46,338 --> 01:58:50,558
SPEAKER_0:  we could right now have a monarchist party. no one's going to support a monarchist party in the-

01:58:50,946 --> 01:58:52,414
SPEAKER_0:  in the US in Sirius.

01:58:52,642 --> 01:58:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:58:53,314 --> 01:58:55,486
SPEAKER_1:  numbers. That's gaining popularity.

01:58:55,874 --> 01:58:57,982
SPEAKER_1:  in europe or else no and i

01:58:58,690 --> 01:59:00,862
SPEAKER_1:  Isn't there in the anarchist?

01:59:01,442 --> 01:59:03,710
SPEAKER_1:  tradition, isn't there? Aren't they saying that?

01:59:04,034 --> 01:59:11,038
SPEAKER_1:  One of the ways you can have a leaders in monarchy because they're more directly responsible to the citizens. If you have a leader.

01:59:11,618 --> 01:59:13,374
SPEAKER_1:  it's healthier to have a monarch.

01:59:13,634 --> 01:59:16,318
SPEAKER_1:  and I'm not familiar with this but I have heard this.

01:59:16,450 --> 01:59:20,382
SPEAKER_0:  stated. In the left-wing anarchist traditions, like, uh,

01:59:20,738 --> 01:59:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  anarchist in the close and whatever else

01:59:22,850 --> 01:59:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  that their slogan is kind of.

01:59:24,898 --> 01:59:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  Um, no kings.

01:59:26,850 --> 01:59:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  no gods, no masters or whatever, so no bosses. they definitely would not agree with that, but I'm, you know.

01:59:33,794 --> 01:59:39,419
SPEAKER_0:  Not familiar enough. Anarchism runs a gamut from left to right in interesting ways.

01:59:39,419 --> 01:59:43,294
SPEAKER_1:  I'll have to ask about that. I'll have to ask you about that. But yeah, okay, so you're

01:59:43,650 --> 01:59:49,182
SPEAKER_1:  You're not, you don't believe Marx's theory of history in the sense that.

01:59:49,698 --> 01:59:56,574
SPEAKER_1:  it everything every stage in a natural consequence of every other stage of course he would predict that somebody like you must exist

01:59:57,186 --> 02:00:00,894
SPEAKER_1:  in order for those stages to go from one to the next.

02:00:01,122 --> 02:00:03,070
SPEAKER_1:  because you have to believe art.

02:00:03,746 --> 02:00:07,121
SPEAKER_1:  in order for action to be taken to inspire the populace to take action.

02:00:07,121 --> 02:00:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  So

02:00:08,674 --> 02:00:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  things. One is I do

02:00:10,594 --> 02:00:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  I just broadly believe in Marxist theory of history because it's just explaining how

02:00:15,234 --> 02:00:21,150
SPEAKER_0:  productive forces develop in the relations of production in any given system.

02:00:21,858 --> 02:00:23,806
SPEAKER_0:  I guess there's a theory of transition.

02:00:24,322 --> 02:00:28,702
SPEAKER_0:  from capitalism to socialism that Marx didn't really spell out, but it was kind of implied.

02:00:29,186 --> 02:00:32,382
SPEAKER_0:  it would naturally happen. And Marx was living in an era of-

02:00:32,610 --> 02:00:37,118
SPEAKER_0:  tremendous upheaval. You know, Marx himself actually saw when he was living in London.

02:00:37,506 --> 02:00:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  in the 1870s.

02:00:38,978 --> 02:00:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  the Paris Commune.

02:00:40,226 --> 02:00:48,222
SPEAKER_0:  when workers took over for just a few months, but they took over the producers of Paris, took over the city, basically created their own government, their own system.

02:00:48,738 --> 02:00:51,614
SPEAKER_0:  and so on. So he was living through an era of

02:00:51,906 --> 02:00:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  people.

02:00:52,610 --> 02:00:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  and angles especially.

02:00:55,522 --> 02:00:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  Oversawn was the mentor to all these rising...

02:00:59,170 --> 02:00:59,550
SPEAKER_0:  uh...

02:00:59,874 --> 02:01:01,886
SPEAKER_0:  socialist parties, so he was very...

02:01:02,114 --> 02:01:09,790
SPEAKER_0:  closely collaborating with socialists in places like Britain and Germany when they were drafting their first programs.

02:01:10,498 --> 02:01:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  for the Social Democratic Party. So

02:01:14,274 --> 02:01:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  It felt like this was going to happen. It felt like this rising working class.

02:01:19,042 --> 02:01:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  would take power.

02:01:20,642 --> 02:01:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  but I think.

02:01:21,826 --> 02:01:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  the stability of the system.

02:01:24,002 --> 02:01:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  was underestimated.

02:01:25,314 --> 02:01:30,206
SPEAKER_0:  It's easy to see the contradictions in the system, but can you see its mechanisms of stability?

02:01:30,722 --> 02:01:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  the way in which...

02:01:32,770 --> 02:01:35,550
SPEAKER_0:  Mass collective action or revolution is more the exception.

02:01:35,906 --> 02:01:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  or the norm. Could you have imagined if you're a marksman?

02:01:39,042 --> 02:01:40,542
SPEAKER_0:  not only how much wealth the system would.

02:01:40,770 --> 02:01:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  produce over time.

02:01:42,114 --> 02:01:43,710
SPEAKER_0:  which I think you could have imagined.

02:01:44,642 --> 02:01:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  also developments like the welfare state.

02:01:46,946 --> 02:01:49,246
SPEAKER_0:  and mass democracy and universal suffrage.

02:01:49,666 --> 02:01:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  which might have changed how workers...

02:01:52,578 --> 02:01:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  relate to the system or operate.

02:01:54,562 --> 02:01:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:01:55,394 --> 02:01:58,014
SPEAKER_0:  within it. So I think it's just it's just the transition part.

02:01:58,594 --> 02:02:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  that I think wasn't spelled out.

02:02:00,450 --> 02:02:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  Properly, but I think in either case.

02:02:03,010 --> 02:02:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  as socialists.

02:02:04,322 --> 02:02:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  We can assume.

02:02:06,306 --> 02:02:08,958
SPEAKER_0:  History is working in our favor. We just need our kind of.

02:02:09,186 --> 02:02:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  hold out and wait for the inevitable revolution.

02:02:13,058 --> 02:02:14,782
SPEAKER_0:  We have to convince people.

02:02:15,042 --> 02:02:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  of both one, the struggle for day-to-day reforms and why it's important to be politically organized, why it's important to be a member of a union or to advocate for...

02:02:24,226 --> 02:02:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  Things like

02:02:25,122 --> 02:02:30,174
SPEAKER_0:  universal healthcare or whatever else to try to kind of build the cohesion and sense of self.

02:02:30,658 --> 02:02:31,870
SPEAKER_0:  of the class.

02:02:32,578 --> 02:02:33,854
SPEAKER_0:  than ultimately.

02:02:34,914 --> 02:02:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  for the desirability once we accomplish it, once we build social democracy of going beyond social democracy, which is, of course,

02:02:41,634 --> 02:02:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  the challenge. Now I don't think it requires leadership from the outside.

02:02:45,090 --> 02:02:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

02:02:46,050 --> 02:02:51,006
SPEAKER_0:  There are plenty of organic leaders that have emerged from the working class that have advocated for

02:02:51,298 --> 02:02:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  for socialism.

02:02:52,578 --> 02:02:53,406
SPEAKER_0:  from

02:02:53,698 --> 02:02:56,094
SPEAKER_0:  the working class and.

02:02:56,706 --> 02:03:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  If you look at the class composition during the glory days of the European socialist parties

02:03:02,690 --> 02:03:03,390
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, this was...

02:03:03,650 --> 02:03:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  very much a working class.

02:03:06,562 --> 02:03:11,614
SPEAKER_0:  parties and organizations. It's only been the last 30 years it's been taken over by professionals and

02:03:11,906 --> 02:03:12,606
SPEAKER_0:  You know, not.

02:03:13,474 --> 02:03:16,222
SPEAKER_0:  Un-coincidentally, you know, they have, um...

02:03:16,770 --> 02:03:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  accomplished very little in those 30 years.

02:03:20,066 --> 02:03:23,646
SPEAKER_1:  So that's the practical and the pragmatic. Can we actually jump to the.

02:03:24,450 --> 02:03:25,822
SPEAKER_1:  to the, at the horizon.

02:03:26,722 --> 02:03:33,182
SPEAKER_1:  As you mentioned, uh, as a social democratic, you focus on the policies of today, but you also have a vision and dream of a future.

02:03:33,570 --> 02:03:37,150
SPEAKER_1:  And so Marx did as well, so the perfect communism at the end.

02:03:37,698 --> 02:03:39,774
SPEAKER_1:  Can you describe that world?

02:03:40,194 --> 02:03:40,574
SPEAKER_1:  That was the-

02:03:40,834 --> 02:03:42,494
SPEAKER_1:  Is there elements to that world that's...

02:03:43,330 --> 02:03:44,510
SPEAKER_1:  that has elements of

02:03:44,738 --> 02:03:45,662
SPEAKER_1:  Anarchism?

02:03:46,178 --> 02:03:49,502
SPEAKER_1:  So like I said, there's Michael Malice next door.

02:03:49,826 --> 02:03:52,318
SPEAKER_1:  So, like a narco-communism.

02:03:52,770 --> 02:03:54,686
SPEAKER_1:  I don't even know if I'm using that term correctly.

02:03:55,298 --> 02:03:57,502
SPEAKER_1:  basically no central control.

02:03:57,762 --> 02:03:58,887
SPEAKER_1:  Can you describe what that world looks like?

02:03:58,887 --> 02:04:00,702
SPEAKER_0:  looks like. Very traditional.

02:04:01,314 --> 02:04:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  Socialist vision.

02:04:02,850 --> 02:04:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  of kind of, if you want to call it full communism, would be very similar to the anarchist.

02:04:07,426 --> 02:04:07,838
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:04:08,514 --> 02:04:08,958
SPEAKER_0:  vision.

02:04:09,282 --> 02:04:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  of a world without.

02:04:10,978 --> 02:04:13,310
SPEAKER_0:  uh, coercion, mass abundance, and so on.

02:04:13,666 --> 02:04:15,678
SPEAKER_0:  I myself don't share that vision.

02:04:16,322 --> 02:04:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:04:17,730 --> 02:04:18,782
SPEAKER_0:  I believe.

02:04:19,394 --> 02:04:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  that we will always need to have a state in some form.

02:04:24,386 --> 02:04:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  as awaited.

02:04:26,210 --> 02:04:27,486
SPEAKER_0:  One, um...

02:04:28,386 --> 02:04:32,510
SPEAKER_0:  even just mediate difference. I think traditionally a lot of Marxists have

02:04:33,122 --> 02:04:33,470
SPEAKER_0:  caught.

02:04:34,082 --> 02:04:36,990
SPEAKER_0:  that after you remove the primary contradiction,place.

02:04:37,410 --> 02:04:38,078
SPEAKER_0:  of class.

02:04:38,722 --> 02:04:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  that all other political questions would be.

02:04:42,082 --> 02:04:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  Resolved.

02:04:42,946 --> 02:04:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that's a lot behind a lot of the thinking of, we're going to have a full communism after politics.

02:04:48,578 --> 02:04:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think there will be an after politics, I think.

02:04:51,618 --> 02:04:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  For one thing, let's say...

02:04:53,058 --> 02:04:57,342
SPEAKER_0:  I'll give you another Northeast example. Let's say me and you were trying to.

02:04:57,602 --> 02:05:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  with different groups of people. We're trying to figure out how to build a crossing of the Hudson River.

02:05:02,306 --> 02:05:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  And for various reasons, you and the people around you want to build a bridge.

02:05:06,722 --> 02:05:09,886
SPEAKER_0:  Me and the people around me need to want to build a tunnel.

02:05:10,242 --> 02:05:10,718
SPEAKER_0:  Mm-hmm.

02:05:11,202 --> 02:05:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  That's a question that you will probably need a mediation for, right? You'll need...

02:05:16,226 --> 02:05:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  One, it's a big project, so there'll be a very complex division of labor and so on, but even beyond that, just politically.

02:05:22,018 --> 02:05:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:05:22,786 --> 02:05:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  You will need the state to mediate the difference. Show me that Hababolt.

02:05:26,690 --> 02:05:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  have a vote that people trust, have institutions that people trust.

02:05:30,338 --> 02:05:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  and so on to make a decision.

02:05:32,674 --> 02:05:35,943
SPEAKER_0:  society is never going to go beyond that decision making.

02:05:35,943 --> 02:05:38,046
SPEAKER_1:  I don't think it's possible outside of the state to...

02:05:38,306 --> 02:05:39,230
SPEAKER_1:  it stable.

02:05:39,714 --> 02:05:40,894
SPEAKER_1:  voting mechanisms.

02:05:41,698 --> 02:05:43,838
SPEAKER_1:  Or is human nature gonna always seep into that?

02:05:44,642 --> 02:05:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  I just wonder why we would have to.

02:05:47,618 --> 02:05:51,998
SPEAKER_0:  If the state is democratic and responsive, the state is an authoritarian.

02:05:52,930 --> 02:05:55,358
SPEAKER_1:  So it might not be called a state, but it would function as a state.

02:05:55,554 --> 02:05:59,966
SPEAKER_0:  But why not just call it a state? But in other words, if you don't have something like that...

02:06:00,226 --> 02:06:07,134
SPEAKER_0:  then don't you have a greater risk of tyranny or a tyrant emerging in the vacuum? so i think people's fear of this state

02:06:07,586 --> 02:06:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  is

02:06:08,450 --> 02:06:19,006
SPEAKER_0:  what would happen if the state had too much power. And I think that's legitimate fair. That's why we have democratic kind of checks on state power and certain guarantees of freedom and so on.

02:06:21,442 --> 02:06:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I guess I just wonder.

02:06:22,946 --> 02:06:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  I'm more afraid of the vacuum and-

02:06:25,122 --> 02:06:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  not having a democratic responsive state and what the world would turn into. Also, I'm just not a utopian thinker, if that makes sense.

02:06:33,186 --> 02:06:37,054
SPEAKER_0:  I like to think that I'm an egalitarian thinker.

02:06:37,506 --> 02:06:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  I'm a-

02:06:38,466 --> 02:06:39,230
SPEAKER_0:  Socialist.

02:06:39,906 --> 02:06:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

02:06:41,090 --> 02:06:42,814
SPEAKER_0:  my mind just goes to like, you know.

02:06:43,106 --> 02:06:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  I can see.

02:06:44,482 --> 02:06:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  a vision of the future that I would like like 50, 60 years from now. Um, maybe.

02:06:49,922 --> 02:06:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  there's some sort of future of superabundance and

02:06:53,250 --> 02:06:54,302
SPEAKER_0:  Automation.

02:06:54,658 --> 02:06:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  and there's some sort of.

02:06:55,874 --> 02:06:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  techno utopian future we don't want.

02:06:58,594 --> 02:06:59,902
SPEAKER_0:  some of those things that-

02:07:00,162 --> 02:07:01,342
SPEAKER_0:  would exist in my

02:07:01,570 --> 02:07:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:07:02,690 --> 02:07:07,070
SPEAKER_0:  you know, five minutes from now, vision of socialism, but I just...

02:07:07,842 --> 02:07:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  don't see it and in general I'm-

02:07:10,018 --> 02:07:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  kind of.

02:07:10,690 --> 02:07:11,678
SPEAKER_0:  wary of.

02:07:12,258 --> 02:07:13,822
SPEAKER_0:  Visions of change that seem...

02:07:14,978 --> 02:07:15,454
SPEAKER_0:  They're not.

02:07:15,714 --> 02:07:16,510
SPEAKER_0:  built off.

02:07:16,770 --> 02:07:22,942
SPEAKER_0:  little thing pieces that we have now and not built off of history and experience and whatever else. A year is zero.

02:07:23,362 --> 02:07:26,782
SPEAKER_0:  I don't even like the term prehistory because I think there's a lot.

02:07:27,682 --> 02:07:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  in history that I want, you know?

02:07:29,858 --> 02:07:35,134
SPEAKER_0:  I want Shakespeare under socialism. You know, I want a lot of things that I think we should be grateful for.

02:07:35,426 --> 02:07:35,902
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:07:36,578 --> 02:07:37,854
SPEAKER_0:  There's a part of tradition.

02:07:38,114 --> 02:07:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  that I think that exists.

02:07:39,842 --> 02:07:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  that's hierarchical and exploitative and whatever else, but there's another part of tradition that's our sense of place and belonging and our connection with the past.

02:07:47,746 --> 02:07:50,782
SPEAKER_0:  and hopefully the future, and I want to keep that.

02:07:51,682 --> 02:07:52,807
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, so you're-

02:07:52,807 --> 02:07:53,854
SPEAKER_1:  worried about.

02:07:54,242 --> 02:07:58,078
SPEAKER_1:  revolution or otherwise a vacuum being created and you're worried about the

02:07:59,234 --> 02:08:02,238
SPEAKER_1:  the things that might fill that vacuum. So the anarchist...

02:08:02,498 --> 02:08:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  often worry.

02:08:04,098 --> 02:08:05,118
SPEAKER_1:  about the...

02:08:06,370 --> 02:08:09,118
SPEAKER_1:  the same mechanism of the state that controls voting.

02:08:10,114 --> 02:08:12,766
SPEAKER_1:  or keeps voting robust and resilient and stable.

02:08:13,346 --> 02:08:16,126
SPEAKER_1:  The same mechanism also having a monopoly on violence.

02:08:17,442 --> 02:08:21,470
SPEAKER_1:  That's the tension. So they get very nervous about it.

02:08:22,114 --> 02:08:24,670
SPEAKER_1:  a central place having a monopoly on violence.

02:08:25,154 --> 02:08:25,726
SPEAKER_0:  Whereas...

02:08:25,954 --> 02:08:28,734
SPEAKER_0:  if there is going to be a place for the monopoly on violence.

02:08:29,058 --> 02:08:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  Let's just say we temporarily take that for granted.

02:08:32,482 --> 02:08:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  Should it not be a place?

02:08:34,530 --> 02:08:36,478
SPEAKER_0:  with a skilled...

02:08:37,282 --> 02:08:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  elected, accountable, transparent civil service.

02:08:40,482 --> 02:08:41,790
SPEAKER_0:  with a Democratic mandate.

02:08:42,082 --> 02:08:42,910
SPEAKER_0:  and so on.

02:08:44,258 --> 02:08:48,350
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, yeah, well put. Speaking of AI, just to go on that tangent.

02:08:48,610 --> 02:08:51,358
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think it's possible to have a future world without the use of 50 years?

02:08:52,002 --> 02:08:53,150
SPEAKER_1:  50 hundred years.

02:08:55,106 --> 02:08:56,702
SPEAKER_1:  where AI

02:08:57,474 --> 02:08:59,966
SPEAKER_1:  there's an AI sort of central planning.

02:09:01,058 --> 02:09:01,406
SPEAKER_1:  sort of.

02:09:01,634 --> 02:09:07,294
SPEAKER_1:  We removed some of the human elements that I think get us into a lot of trouble.

02:09:07,778 --> 02:09:08,606
SPEAKER_1:  Like you could.

02:09:08,866 --> 02:09:13,246
SPEAKER_1:  You can take a perspective on the Soviet Union and the flaws of the system there.

02:09:13,666 --> 02:09:16,510
SPEAKER_1:  have less to do with the different ideologies and more to do with.

02:09:17,026 --> 02:09:21,598
SPEAKER_1:  the humans and the vacuums and how humans fill vacuums and the corrupting nature of power and so on.

02:09:22,082 --> 02:09:24,030
SPEAKER_1:  If we have AI that's...

02:09:24,354 --> 02:09:26,782
SPEAKER_1:  that's more data-driven and is not susceptible.

02:09:27,522 --> 02:09:32,254
SPEAKER_1:  to the human elements, is that possible to imagine such a world? Almost like a from a sci-fi perspective.

02:09:32,418 --> 02:09:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe in the future you can imagine certain calculation problems that arose during central planning solved through advanced computing.

02:09:40,866 --> 02:09:41,278
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

02:09:41,858 --> 02:09:42,494
SPEAKER_0:  I would.

02:09:42,978 --> 02:09:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  Say that.

02:09:43,842 --> 02:09:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  There's another whole set of problems with the system that were incentive problems.

02:09:47,490 --> 02:09:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm not sure how that advanced.

02:09:49,602 --> 02:09:51,902
SPEAKER_0:  computing would solve the incentive problems of

02:09:52,514 --> 02:09:55,070
SPEAKER_0:  How do you get people to actually produce?

02:09:55,714 --> 02:09:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  things that other people want.

02:09:57,378 --> 02:10:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  kind of that informational question, and how do you communicate?

02:10:00,834 --> 02:10:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  without endless meetings or someone reading your brain. Yeah. And reward we actually want

02:10:05,634 --> 02:10:10,142
SPEAKER_0:  So there's that kind of informational question, but then there's the incentive of.

02:10:10,594 --> 02:10:14,846
SPEAKER_0:  you know, how do you get people to work efficiently at work and how do you get

02:10:15,138 --> 02:10:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  affirms to

02:10:16,738 --> 02:10:17,310
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:10:17,826 --> 02:10:18,398
SPEAKER_0:  to.

02:10:18,658 --> 02:10:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  use their resources that they're getting.

02:10:21,570 --> 02:10:23,262
SPEAKER_0:  more efficiently and I think

02:10:25,218 --> 02:10:27,038
SPEAKER_0:  solving the calculation problem solved.

02:10:27,298 --> 02:10:28,958
SPEAKER_0:  some of these questions but not.

02:10:29,218 --> 02:10:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  All of them.

02:10:30,882 --> 02:10:32,382
SPEAKER_0:  But you know, that's kind of a...

02:10:32,898 --> 02:10:35,966
SPEAKER_0:  Who knows, but if your vision of the future requires some sort of

02:10:36,898 --> 02:10:40,606
SPEAKER_0:  leap into a technological unknown that's very hard to advocate for today.

02:10:40,706 --> 02:10:44,478
SPEAKER_1:  It's exciting to consider the possibility of technology empowering.

02:10:45,122 --> 02:10:47,550
SPEAKER_1:  a better reallocation of resources.

02:10:47,842 --> 02:10:48,574
SPEAKER_1:  If you...

02:10:48,802 --> 02:10:50,078
SPEAKER_1:  care about of kind of.

02:10:50,914 --> 02:10:57,214
SPEAKER_1:  the innate value of human beings and think of the mechanism of reallocation resource is a good way to

02:10:57,698 --> 02:10:59,998
SPEAKER_1:  empower that equality.

02:11:00,418 --> 02:11:04,734
SPEAKER_1:  that it's nice to remove the human element from that. Like if you work really hard.

02:11:05,410 --> 02:11:07,326
SPEAKER_1:  and you're really good at your job.

02:11:07,714 --> 02:11:11,742
SPEAKER_1:  It's nice to be really data-driven and allocating more resources to you.

02:11:13,218 --> 02:11:13,662
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:11:14,466 --> 02:11:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  Kind of, like I kind of think that.

02:11:16,578 --> 02:11:18,782
SPEAKER_0:  the agency part requires.

02:11:19,938 --> 02:11:22,398
SPEAKER_0:  human beings and conscious human activity.

02:11:22,914 --> 02:11:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  So I think if you have a sort of.

02:11:25,442 --> 02:11:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  planning system that works.

02:11:27,138 --> 02:11:27,550
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:11:27,906 --> 02:11:30,462
SPEAKER_0:  and let's say the technology is there for it to work.

02:11:31,234 --> 02:11:32,894
SPEAKER_0:  I would want it to be democratic.

02:11:33,250 --> 02:11:37,566
SPEAKER_0:  planning in such a way that there's a human element, there is some debate and deliberation between finds and occupations.

02:11:38,050 --> 02:11:39,902
SPEAKER_0:  and also even in my vision of socialism.

02:11:40,770 --> 02:11:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  the state sector and state investments and so on.

02:11:43,618 --> 02:11:49,342
SPEAKER_0:  I want there to be more public discussion and debate about certain things so it's not just left to technocrats because

02:11:49,954 --> 02:11:56,126
SPEAKER_0:  You'd want to live in society where you just find out the next day that there's some massive infrastructure project that you haven't.

02:11:56,738 --> 02:11:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

02:11:57,314 --> 02:11:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  had a chance to.

02:11:59,202 --> 02:12:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  Think about or debate or feel like you're participating.

02:12:02,754 --> 02:12:03,879
SPEAKER_0:  in..

02:12:03,879 --> 02:12:07,550
SPEAKER_1:  And debate is not just facts and logic. That's why.

02:12:07,906 --> 02:12:12,670
SPEAKER_1:  If the whole universe was about facts and logic, computers could do a better job of that. There's something about-

02:12:13,282 --> 02:12:14,590
SPEAKER_1:  humans debating each other.

02:12:14,882 --> 02:12:18,014
SPEAKER_1:  that goes into the difficult gray areas of.

02:12:18,882 --> 02:12:23,294
SPEAKER_1:  of what it means to be human and what it means to have a life that's worth living.

02:12:23,906 --> 02:12:24,318
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:12:25,090 --> 02:12:26,398
SPEAKER_1:  that requires humanity.

02:12:27,106 --> 02:12:32,094
SPEAKER_1:  And I'm also worried about, while I'm excited about the possibility of AI controlling everything.

02:12:32,834 --> 02:12:33,502
SPEAKER_1:  Have Joking.

02:12:34,466 --> 02:12:37,342
SPEAKER_1:  The reason I'm really terrified of that is because

02:12:37,698 --> 02:12:38,494
SPEAKER_1:  Usually.

02:12:38,978 --> 02:12:41,982
SPEAKER_1:  there's a possibility of a human taking control of that system.

02:12:42,402 --> 02:12:45,246
SPEAKER_1:  to you now start to get the same kind of authoritarian thing.

02:12:45,762 --> 02:12:46,078
SPEAKER_1:  Wow.

02:12:46,722 --> 02:12:51,294
SPEAKER_1:  I am a human, I'm smart enough to be able to control this AI system.

02:12:51,554 --> 02:12:54,526
SPEAKER_1:  and I will do based on what this AI system says.

02:12:55,042 --> 02:12:56,350
SPEAKER_1:  what's good for you.

02:12:56,674 --> 02:13:03,459
SPEAKER_1:  It's kind of like talking down to people and then use that AI system to now have the same kind of thing as Hall and Moore in 1930s.

02:13:03,459 --> 02:13:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  And also our preferences might change. So an AI.

02:13:07,074 --> 02:13:12,798
SPEAKER_0:  system might say the goal of humanity is to just increase infinitely efficiency.

02:13:13,058 --> 02:13:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  or increase output.

02:13:15,298 --> 02:13:17,310
SPEAKER_0:  whereas we might collectively decide that...

02:13:18,082 --> 02:13:18,750
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we...

02:13:19,426 --> 02:13:21,438
SPEAKER_0:  We have enough and we want to, you know.

02:13:21,730 --> 02:13:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  have a trade off, right? And I think that-

02:13:24,066 --> 02:13:26,974
SPEAKER_0:  You know, we need a system that allows for people to make.

02:13:27,682 --> 02:13:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  certain.

02:13:28,930 --> 02:13:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  trade-offs.

02:13:30,338 --> 02:13:31,678
SPEAKER_1:  and have more.

02:13:32,290 --> 02:13:39,582
SPEAKER_1:  of this leisure that I've been learning about from you. This is a very interesting concept, leisure. I don't know how you spell that.

02:13:39,970 --> 02:13:41,310
SPEAKER_1:  All right, so.

02:13:43,362 --> 02:13:43,934
SPEAKER_1:  If we can...

02:13:44,162 --> 02:13:49,854
SPEAKER_1:  step into the practical. We're talking about historical and philosophical into the practical of today.

02:13:51,426 --> 02:13:57,118
SPEAKER_1:  What are some of the exciting policies that represent democratic socialism today?

02:13:57,954 --> 02:14:02,302
SPEAKER_1:  I think you mentioned some of them, Medicare for All or Universal Healthcare.

02:14:03,138 --> 02:14:03,518
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:14:04,002 --> 02:14:06,558
SPEAKER_1:  something you haven't mentioned is tuition free college.

02:14:07,362 --> 02:14:09,310
SPEAKER_1:  Increase in minimum wage.

02:14:09,538 --> 02:14:11,614
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe stronger unions like we talked about.

02:14:12,514 --> 02:14:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  What are some ideas here?

02:14:13,826 --> 02:14:17,086
SPEAKER_1:  What are some ideas, especially policy, especially exciting to you?

02:14:17,986 --> 02:14:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I think that...

02:14:18,978 --> 02:14:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  Hours reduction has always been an important demand for socialists.

02:14:23,362 --> 02:14:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:14:24,098 --> 02:14:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:14:24,770 --> 02:14:28,542
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's been a reality in certain countries like France in recent

02:14:29,154 --> 02:14:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  Decades.

02:14:30,754 --> 02:14:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  where...

02:14:31,554 --> 02:14:32,542
SPEAKER_0:  Part of the logic is...

02:14:33,346 --> 02:14:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  If you have a bunch of people working for 40 plus hours.

02:14:36,674 --> 02:14:37,182
SPEAKER_0:  a week.

02:14:37,698 --> 02:14:40,894
SPEAKER_0:  And you also have some unemployed people who would like more employment.

02:14:41,282 --> 02:14:43,518
SPEAKER_0:  then it's not a zero sum game. You could.

02:14:43,970 --> 02:14:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  reduce hours to 35 hours.

02:14:46,338 --> 02:14:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  and still maintain the same output by employing more people.

02:14:49,858 --> 02:14:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  to kind of fill the...

02:14:51,138 --> 02:14:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  the slack in hours.

02:14:53,826 --> 02:14:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  So one, I think it's a solidaristic thing in working class movements, being unemployed.

02:14:58,978 --> 02:14:59,934
SPEAKER_0:  and employed.

02:15:00,322 --> 02:15:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  Workers, I also think that, yeah, it gives people more time.

02:15:04,546 --> 02:15:09,310
SPEAKER_0:  So Marx was a big advocate in his day of a 10-hour.

02:15:09,602 --> 02:15:11,710
SPEAKER_0:  a bill in the UK.

02:15:12,098 --> 02:15:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  that would have reduced the hours of working time.

02:15:15,970 --> 02:15:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  and reduce child or eliminate or reduce child labor and other things as well.

02:15:21,250 --> 02:15:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  And part of it was...

02:15:23,042 --> 02:15:27,358
SPEAKER_0:  This is a radical demand because it's reducing the sphere as you saw of exploitation.

02:15:27,906 --> 02:15:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  So it's putting limits on.

02:15:29,634 --> 02:15:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  on how much time the capitalists can take from ordinary workers and how much freedom they would have.

02:15:35,490 --> 02:15:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:15:36,610 --> 02:15:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  with.

02:15:37,666 --> 02:15:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  Healthcare one, I just think it's a.

02:15:39,842 --> 02:15:40,766
SPEAKER_0:  A government.

02:15:41,090 --> 02:15:47,902
SPEAKER_0:  healthcare system. You could tell me that you don't want it in the US, but you can't tell me it doesn't work because we've seen it work in

02:15:48,290 --> 02:15:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  every other major industrial system in different forms.

02:15:51,106 --> 02:15:54,206
SPEAKER_1:  So what is that usually involved? What is universal healthcare involved?

02:15:54,754 --> 02:15:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  So there's different varieties in the UK.

02:15:57,378 --> 02:15:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  For instance.

02:15:58,306 --> 02:15:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  they have a National Health Service.

02:16:00,418 --> 02:16:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  and which

02:16:01,346 --> 02:16:06,174
SPEAKER_0:  medical personnel and hospitals are run directly by the state.

02:16:06,530 --> 02:16:09,374
SPEAKER_0:  It's almost like a mini Soviet system to be honest, but just for healthcare.

02:16:09,666 --> 02:16:10,430
SPEAKER_0:  And it works pretty well.

02:16:10,690 --> 02:16:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  Just for-

02:16:11,586 --> 02:16:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  healthcare.

02:16:12,738 --> 02:16:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:16:14,146 --> 02:16:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  And I think it's one example of the way in which you could actually take the market. So I give you a vision of socialism that involves a lot of market, but I think there's certain spheres where you could remove the market from.

02:16:24,418 --> 02:16:25,822
SPEAKER_0:  and still have.

02:16:26,050 --> 02:16:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  and efficient system.

02:16:27,554 --> 02:16:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  in part because

02:16:29,314 --> 02:16:30,782
SPEAKER_0:  You know, this is a...

02:16:31,906 --> 02:16:33,854
SPEAKER_0:  area in which we

02:16:35,618 --> 02:16:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  People don't have.

02:16:37,954 --> 02:16:40,734
SPEAKER_0:  Obviously for cosmetic procedures, whatever they have preferences.

02:16:40,994 --> 02:16:44,158
SPEAKER_0:  or for most routine things that people do in healthcare.

02:16:44,418 --> 02:16:45,150
SPEAKER_0:  They just need a...

02:16:45,538 --> 02:16:46,302
SPEAKER_0:  See a doctor.

02:16:46,562 --> 02:16:48,062
SPEAKER_0:  You know, they need to get diagnosed.

02:16:48,386 --> 02:16:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:16:49,666 --> 02:16:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  Some of these systems have had trouble with waitlists for specialists or whatever. That's more of like an allocation problem of.

02:16:55,042 --> 02:16:56,478
SPEAKER_0:  If you want more specialists, you pay.

02:16:56,738 --> 02:16:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  Specialist More.

02:16:57,698 --> 02:16:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  Like this is, this problems that could be solved by.

02:17:00,066 --> 02:17:01,630
SPEAKER_0:  like through the mechanisms of.

02:17:02,018 --> 02:17:06,206
SPEAKER_0:  planning and government run healthcare. That's that's kind of the most.

02:17:06,722 --> 02:17:10,174
SPEAKER_0:  left wing that you could get is what the system of the United Kingdom.

02:17:11,074 --> 02:17:11,518
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:17:12,386 --> 02:17:14,718
SPEAKER_0:  Beyond that, you have a system like Medicare for All, where you say...

02:17:15,330 --> 02:17:19,582
SPEAKER_0:  All right, most of the doctors, besides for public hospitals, in fact would already exist."

02:17:19,842 --> 02:17:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  are gonna be.

02:17:20,994 --> 02:17:22,014
SPEAKER_0:  privately employed.

02:17:22,274 --> 02:17:22,654
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

02:17:22,882 --> 02:17:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  hospitals. The hospitals are going to be

02:17:25,026 --> 02:17:25,438
SPEAKER_0:  private.

02:17:26,626 --> 02:17:27,838
SPEAKER_0:  but...

02:17:28,418 --> 02:17:30,590
SPEAKER_0:  instead of having all these different insurance carriers.

02:17:30,850 --> 02:17:32,030
SPEAKER_0:  We're just gonna have one.

02:17:32,354 --> 02:17:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  National.

02:17:33,506 --> 02:17:35,742
SPEAKER_0:  insurance carrier that we're all gonna pay into.

02:17:36,130 --> 02:17:38,974
SPEAKER_0:  that national insurance carrier is going to negotiate.

02:17:39,394 --> 02:17:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  the price of healthcare with doctors, a price of...

02:17:43,394 --> 02:17:46,814
SPEAKER_0:  of drugs with pharmaceutical companies and so on to hopefully reduce.

02:17:47,394 --> 02:17:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:17:48,674 --> 02:17:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  prices and to implement a

02:17:51,810 --> 02:17:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  different little bit of planning.

02:17:53,570 --> 02:17:59,166
SPEAKER_0:  into the system because if there's only one big national insurance company that

02:17:59,394 --> 02:18:01,790
SPEAKER_0:  that company has a lot of weight and power.

02:18:02,146 --> 02:18:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  But you can still visit your same doctor. And there's still some.

02:18:08,354 --> 02:18:13,982
SPEAKER_0:  it's not as radical of a shift in that direction. And that's the dominant demand of Bernie Sanders.

02:18:14,466 --> 02:18:15,454
SPEAKER_0:  and the left right now.

02:18:15,874 --> 02:18:19,454
SPEAKER_0:  There's 30 plus million people in the US that would be insured.

02:18:19,970 --> 02:18:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  currently aren't insured if we move to this system. There's a lot of other people that are underinsured or worried about how to pay copays or premiums involved. I think it would be a net benefit.

02:18:29,858 --> 02:18:31,806
SPEAKER_0:  for the vast majority of the US.

02:18:32,098 --> 02:18:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  population.

02:18:33,122 --> 02:18:36,734
SPEAKER_0:  even if it was offset by certain taxes, we spend a lot of money out of

02:18:37,090 --> 02:18:41,150
SPEAKER_0:  pocket with health insurance. Menace in a man also this like widely popular.

02:18:41,538 --> 02:18:42,110
SPEAKER_0:  So for me.

02:18:42,882 --> 02:18:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  It's almost like if you're trying to build support for something like socialism, we were talking this lofty vision of socialism after capitalism or what worker.

02:18:52,322 --> 02:18:57,758
SPEAKER_0:  ownership the means of production would look like in practice and so on. By the way, you're one of the few interviewers who...

02:18:57,986 --> 02:19:04,286
SPEAKER_0:  ever asked me any of the details. So it's good that I had a, I've been thinking of a rough sketch in my head for the last, you know.

02:19:04,546 --> 02:19:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  Whatever, 16 years, I've been a socialist.

02:19:09,602 --> 02:19:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  but we have to start in the hair now.

02:19:11,778 --> 02:19:13,150
SPEAKER_0:  And if you can't convince...

02:19:13,538 --> 02:19:14,014
SPEAKER_0:  people.

02:19:14,434 --> 02:19:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  that the state could play a bigger role in their health insurance.

02:19:17,794 --> 02:19:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  and you can't convince Americans in a whole host of other sectors.

02:19:21,282 --> 02:19:23,838
SPEAKER_0:  that they should be living in something closer to a social democracy?

02:19:24,642 --> 02:19:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  How are you gonna convince those people that there should be worker ownership at the means of production? It's kind of ridiculous.

02:19:30,050 --> 02:19:30,750
SPEAKER_0:  Like, leap.

02:19:31,042 --> 02:19:33,598
SPEAKER_0:  if you don't have the credibility as.

02:19:34,146 --> 02:19:40,062
SPEAKER_0:  The group of people organizing for universal healthcare, organizing for a $15 minimum wage, and able to get the goods.

02:19:40,674 --> 02:19:43,614
SPEAKER_0:  and also in practice as we fight for these reforms.

02:19:44,290 --> 02:19:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  Ordinary people will have.

02:19:45,986 --> 02:19:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  A better sense?

02:19:47,618 --> 02:19:51,646
SPEAKER_0:  Lisa, my hope is of what it means to be involved with politics and what.

02:19:51,938 --> 02:19:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  politics can do for their lives, it's positive.

02:19:55,266 --> 02:19:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  Because right now, when we talk about politics, it often just seems that we're talking about...

02:20:00,322 --> 02:20:00,830
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:20:01,506 --> 02:20:02,750
SPEAKER_0:  Like a very glib.

02:20:03,266 --> 02:20:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  cultural.

02:20:04,450 --> 02:20:05,118
SPEAKER_0:  conflict.

02:20:05,410 --> 02:20:08,542
SPEAKER_0:  remove from the things that are important in our lives.

02:20:08,898 --> 02:20:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  Whereas in truth, I think politics can be a tool for us to make our lives.

02:20:15,138 --> 02:20:22,974
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, and there's like deep ideas here where in some sense, universal healthcare and worker collectives are not so radically different.

02:20:23,490 --> 02:20:24,574
SPEAKER_1:  that there is just a...

02:20:25,186 --> 02:20:29,790
SPEAKER_1:  There's philosophical ideas to explore and accept. And also, from my perspective at least.

02:20:31,810 --> 02:20:34,910
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe I'm wrong on this, but it seems like with a lot of things.

02:20:35,714 --> 02:20:38,398
SPEAKER_1:  at the core of politics, the right answer.

02:20:39,266 --> 02:20:40,638
SPEAKER_1:  from an alien perspective.

02:20:41,122 --> 02:20:41,982
SPEAKER_1:  is not clear.

02:20:42,818 --> 02:20:45,054
SPEAKER_1:  Like everybody's very certain of what's the right answer.

02:20:45,570 --> 02:20:48,126
SPEAKER_1:  Everyone's certain universal healthcare is terrible or...

02:20:48,354 --> 02:20:51,774
SPEAKER_1:  In the case of universal healthcare, the majority of people think it's a good idea.

02:20:52,194 --> 02:20:53,438
SPEAKER_1:  I don't think anyone knows.

02:20:54,658 --> 02:20:57,278
SPEAKER_1:  because I think that depends on cultural history.

02:20:57,538 --> 02:21:00,862
SPEAKER_1:  on the particular dynamics of a country of a political system.

02:21:01,282 --> 02:21:03,902
SPEAKER_1:  on the dynamics of the economic system in this country.

02:21:04,226 --> 02:21:05,758
SPEAKER_1:  of the changing world.

02:21:06,242 --> 02:21:09,470
SPEAKER_1:  The 21st century is different than the 20th century.

02:21:09,986 --> 02:21:12,766
SPEAKER_1:  may be the failures of communism of the 20th century.

02:21:13,058 --> 02:21:15,070
SPEAKER_1:  will not be repeated in the 21st century.

02:21:15,522 --> 02:21:19,518
SPEAKER_1:  or the flip side of that maybe capitalism will actually truly flourish.

02:21:20,354 --> 02:21:23,166
SPEAKER_1:  with the help of automation in the 21st century.

02:21:23,394 --> 02:21:24,478
SPEAKER_1:  I don't think anyone knows.

02:21:25,058 --> 02:21:27,582
SPEAKER_1:  So like you people like you are basically saying like.

02:21:28,130 --> 02:21:29,246
SPEAKER_1:  arguing for ideas.

02:21:29,506 --> 02:21:31,486
SPEAKER_1:  and we'll have to explore those ideas together.

02:21:32,066 --> 02:21:32,510
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

02:21:33,698 --> 02:21:36,446
SPEAKER_1:  Why do you think if universal health care is popular?

02:21:37,762 --> 02:21:39,486
SPEAKER_1:  Why don't we have universal healthcare?

02:21:39,714 --> 02:21:40,894
SPEAKER_1:  in the United States.

02:21:41,218 --> 02:21:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  Well.

02:21:42,562 --> 02:21:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  Democracy is a great thing.

02:21:43,906 --> 02:21:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  Political democracy is wonderful.

02:21:45,538 --> 02:21:46,430
SPEAKER_0:  It came from...

02:21:46,690 --> 02:21:49,950
SPEAKER_0:  the struggles of ordinary people to expand suffrage and so on.

02:21:50,594 --> 02:21:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

02:21:51,490 --> 02:21:54,622
SPEAKER_0:  the economic sphere, entrenched power in the economic sphere.

02:21:54,882 --> 02:21:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  bleeds into our political democracy.

02:21:57,218 --> 02:22:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  So I think there's a lot of people with a vested interest in not having universal healthcare.

02:22:01,986 --> 02:22:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  There's large industries with the best interest in not having universal healthcare.

02:22:06,626 --> 02:22:07,582
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, day.

02:22:07,842 --> 02:22:11,230
SPEAKER_0:  Pay for ads, pay lobbyists, they influence.

02:22:11,618 --> 02:22:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  government and they have made it very difficult. So you can't get universal health care.

02:22:16,386 --> 02:22:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:22:17,186 --> 02:22:25,694
SPEAKER_0:  done without the bill, even if you pass something and you're trying to make a change. Like, Obamacare was supposed to have a public option. Everybody's been running on a public option in the Democratic Party for—

02:22:26,050 --> 02:22:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  12, 13 years, why don't we have a public option?

02:22:28,610 --> 02:22:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  People know that if people have the choice.

02:22:31,266 --> 02:22:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  a bombing into government plan, they might just.

02:22:34,210 --> 02:22:37,374
SPEAKER_0:  that might be the slow road to really having Universal.

02:22:37,634 --> 02:22:39,614
SPEAKER_0:  So I think a lot of it's opposition.

02:22:40,450 --> 02:22:42,238
SPEAKER_1:  Do you like that idea? The public option.

02:22:42,914 --> 02:22:45,886
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe you can like, because isn't there complexities?

02:22:46,274 --> 02:22:48,062
SPEAKER_1:  like pre-existing conditions.

02:22:49,186 --> 02:22:50,910
SPEAKER_1:  So isn't a public option?

02:22:52,610 --> 02:22:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  mean you cannot have any insurance.

02:22:55,074 --> 02:22:56,222
SPEAKER_1:  until you get to trouble.

02:22:56,898 --> 02:22:57,566
SPEAKER_1:  And then you can...

02:22:57,954 --> 02:23:03,038
SPEAKER_1:  If it covers pre-existing conditions, just start paying for insurance then. Therefore, young people don't pay for insurance.

02:23:03,298 --> 02:23:04,222
SPEAKER_1:  Isn't it better?

02:23:04,674 --> 02:23:06,270
SPEAKER_1:  to go full in.

02:23:06,914 --> 02:23:14,558
SPEAKER_0:  I don't support a public option in part because I think if we allow politicians to just say, hey, I support a public option, it's just kind of a way to...

02:23:15,074 --> 02:23:22,270
SPEAKER_0:  signal your support for universal health care, but give us nothing. And I think that's what we saw under, with Biden and a lot of other politicians that have supported.

02:23:22,690 --> 02:23:27,838
SPEAKER_0:  public option. I think in practice if a public option is defined in such a way that it just means

02:23:29,186 --> 02:23:30,558
SPEAKER_0:  You, you, um...

02:23:31,106 --> 02:23:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  You know, by default.

02:23:32,546 --> 02:23:36,734
SPEAKER_0:  can just opt in to a public plan. And let's say hypothetically, you don't even have to pay for it.

02:23:37,250 --> 02:23:49,086
SPEAKER_0:  then it's just a back door to universal healthcare really quickly. Because I think the vast majority of people who aren't currently covered, and also a lot of employers, to be honest, would probably drop their private coverage if they knew their employees can just get.

02:23:49,698 --> 02:23:53,950
SPEAKER_0:  a public option and maybe would only provide supplemental insurance or whatever else.

02:23:54,530 --> 02:23:55,006
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:23:56,738 --> 02:24:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  I think the broad overarching point of all these demands is to say that

02:24:01,506 --> 02:24:03,742
SPEAKER_0:  Socialists need to be really connected.

02:24:04,386 --> 02:24:07,390
SPEAKER_0:  to the day-to-day struggles of people that just improve their lives.

02:24:08,162 --> 02:24:14,078
SPEAKER_0:  So if you're feeling like you're paying $400, $500 on the Obamacare market for health insurance

02:24:14,338 --> 02:24:17,182
SPEAKER_0:  and that's hampering your ability to do what you want to do in your life.

02:24:17,666 --> 02:24:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  then maybe you would support a candidate.

02:24:20,130 --> 02:24:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  for universal healthcare.

02:24:22,050 --> 02:24:23,326
SPEAKER_0:  if you feel like you're...

02:24:23,554 --> 02:24:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  struggling to find work that you could afford to pay your...

02:24:27,714 --> 02:24:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  with or whatever else. Maybe I'll support a candidate.

02:24:30,402 --> 02:24:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  committed to.

02:24:32,482 --> 02:24:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  all sorts of mechanisms to reduce housing prices or increase your power as a tenant.

02:24:40,066 --> 02:24:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  and whatever else. I think it's like these day to day concerns.

02:24:44,450 --> 02:24:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  need to be connected to the more abstract and lofty vision of change.

02:24:48,578 --> 02:24:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  Otherwise our politics just becomes like this.

02:24:51,362 --> 02:24:52,446
SPEAKER_0:  This fantasy world?

02:24:53,026 --> 02:24:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  Ding.

02:24:53,730 --> 02:24:54,686
SPEAKER_0:  That's, that's.

02:24:55,202 --> 02:24:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  you know, nice ideas to think about or debate.

02:24:57,858 --> 02:24:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  but really...

02:24:59,170 --> 02:25:01,086
SPEAKER_0:  won't make much of a difference in people's lives.

02:25:02,594 --> 02:25:04,062
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think about Free College?

02:25:04,482 --> 02:25:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  should college be free.

02:25:06,658 --> 02:25:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  So...

02:25:07,906 --> 02:25:11,198
SPEAKER_0:  I would say free college is not at the top of my list of.

02:25:11,746 --> 02:25:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  priorities, but it definitely should be for you in my vision of adjust.

02:25:14,690 --> 02:25:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:25:15,458 --> 02:25:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  Just society.

02:25:16,418 --> 02:25:19,793
SPEAKER_1:  What is it that you're talking about? Just to clarify, is the universal health care...

02:25:19,793 --> 02:25:26,046
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, universal health care is probably far higher in my priorities than free college. I think right now the way our system is built.

02:25:27,266 --> 02:25:28,446
SPEAKER_0:  when someone goes to college.

02:25:28,802 --> 02:25:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  They're given credentials, they're given the degree they carry with them for the rest of their life. It gives them a chance to join.

02:25:35,490 --> 02:25:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  kind of a.

02:25:36,770 --> 02:25:40,190
SPEAKER_0:  a privileged part of the labor market, right? It's not a zero sum game.

02:25:40,418 --> 02:25:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  I don't want.

02:25:41,506 --> 02:25:43,166
SPEAKER_0:  college-educated people to think that.

02:25:43,458 --> 02:25:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  non-college educated people are their enemies and vice versa because a lot of them are just

02:25:48,898 --> 02:25:50,846
SPEAKER_0:  ordinary working class people trying to survive.

02:25:51,554 --> 02:25:53,406
SPEAKER_0:  and they're in different areas, they're in different sectors.

02:25:53,890 --> 02:25:55,710
SPEAKER_0:  You know, some of them are in...

02:25:56,066 --> 02:25:59,294
SPEAKER_0:  nursing sectors where they need a college degree and so on.

02:26:01,058 --> 02:26:03,486
SPEAKER_0:  if you just make college tuition free.

02:26:03,938 --> 02:26:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  but you don't also bake.

02:26:05,666 --> 02:26:08,542
SPEAKER_0:  trade skills and other things.

02:26:08,834 --> 02:26:14,142
SPEAKER_0:  to which free for someone to learn how to become an electrician or a plumber or whatever else.

02:26:14,850 --> 02:26:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  then.

02:26:15,618 --> 02:26:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  To some degree, you're privileging one sector of the labor market over another.

02:26:20,450 --> 02:26:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:26:21,282 --> 02:26:22,878
SPEAKER_0:  So I would advocate just.

02:26:23,554 --> 02:26:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  If you're going to make something like that free, you just have to make sure that you're doing it in an egalitarian way.

02:26:28,002 --> 02:26:29,054
SPEAKER_0:  And that one.

02:26:29,346 --> 02:26:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  the options, the routes, to college or more.

02:26:32,226 --> 02:26:32,798
SPEAKER_0:  More equal?

02:26:33,378 --> 02:26:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  So there's more investment in K through 12 education. So that.

02:26:38,466 --> 02:26:45,534
SPEAKER_0:  more kids in rough neighborhoods have the chance to go to college and for those that choose the trade route from from any

02:26:45,922 --> 02:26:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  any part of the country.

02:26:47,266 --> 02:26:50,046
SPEAKER_0:  that they're given the skills and resources.

02:26:50,466 --> 02:26:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  for vocational.

02:26:52,514 --> 02:26:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  trainings and those are also free. And it just feels like in terms of order of operation, I would just start with.

02:26:58,818 --> 02:27:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  K-12 education, improving it, and whatever else.

02:27:03,010 --> 02:27:03,550
SPEAKER_0:  Aden.

02:27:04,322 --> 02:27:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  college after, but I'm not opposed to it.

02:27:06,402 --> 02:27:14,878
SPEAKER_1:  So does that improving K-12 education, does that mean investing more into it? Is it as simple as just increasing the amount of money that's invested?

02:27:15,394 --> 02:27:16,958
SPEAKER_1:  in public education.

02:27:17,282 --> 02:27:23,166
SPEAKER_0:  in general when it comes to the public sector or any sphere that you're investing in, obviously it's not just as simple as throwing money.

02:27:23,778 --> 02:27:26,782
SPEAKER_0:  at a problem. I do think we have a lot of schools.

02:27:27,298 --> 02:27:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  that are underfunded.

02:27:29,826 --> 02:27:37,310
SPEAKER_0:  But we have other schools that are adequately funded, but the conditions in which those schools are, like the neighborhoods they're in and what's going on in society.

02:27:38,018 --> 02:27:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:27:38,818 --> 02:27:46,334
SPEAKER_0:  the problems are so deep that it's impossible for just education to solve everything. And I think especially a lot of liberals think that education should be the panacea.

02:27:46,882 --> 02:27:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  Best in education, you'll help people.

02:27:49,346 --> 02:27:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  if kids are living in poverty.

02:27:51,810 --> 02:27:55,198
SPEAKER_0:  if they go into school hungry or whatever else.

02:27:55,874 --> 02:27:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  Education's not gonna give them.

02:27:59,458 --> 02:28:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  everything they need to succeed. Sometimes we, I think, put too much weight on...

02:28:04,802 --> 02:28:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  on education.

02:28:06,370 --> 02:28:09,470
SPEAKER_1:  And of course you can define education more broadly, which is like...

02:28:10,530 --> 02:28:11,486
SPEAKER_1:  The care.

02:28:12,258 --> 02:28:14,302
SPEAKER_1:  of the flourishing of the young mind.

02:28:15,618 --> 02:28:16,510
SPEAKER_1:  Whatever that is.

02:28:16,770 --> 02:28:19,262
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, a lot of it starts early.

02:28:19,714 --> 02:28:22,558
SPEAKER_0:  So in New York City at least, we do have...

02:28:23,074 --> 02:28:25,726
SPEAKER_0:  universal pre-k, so from age three onward.

02:28:25,954 --> 02:28:27,806
SPEAKER_0:  You have the option for that, I mean...

02:28:28,354 --> 02:28:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  It's important for kids socialization, you know, their parents are now able to.

02:28:33,314 --> 02:28:41,342
SPEAKER_0:  know that they could go to work or do something else and have their kids taken care of. There's a lot of measures like that that we could do to.

02:28:42,082 --> 02:28:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  to equalize things, and again...

02:28:45,186 --> 02:28:48,190
SPEAKER_0:  for libertarians in the audience, some of this stuff is scary.

02:28:48,482 --> 02:28:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  because it's obviously.

02:28:49,954 --> 02:28:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  more state involved, state involved in pre-k.

02:28:53,826 --> 02:28:55,966
SPEAKER_0:  date. So ready, you're very involved in K through 12.

02:28:56,386 --> 02:28:59,166
SPEAKER_0:  more investment into state institutions like...

02:28:59,586 --> 02:29:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  our state universities and in college.

02:29:02,946 --> 02:29:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  But for me, it's not a question of state versus non-state. It's a question of...

02:29:07,586 --> 02:29:08,254
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:29:08,834 --> 02:29:09,214
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

02:29:09,762 --> 02:29:13,630
SPEAKER_0:  good outcomes for people. And it just happens to be.

02:29:14,050 --> 02:29:14,718
SPEAKER_0:  That for...

02:29:15,074 --> 02:29:15,934
SPEAKER_0:  working class.

02:29:16,386 --> 02:29:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  people.

02:29:17,218 --> 02:29:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:29:19,106 --> 02:29:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  having the collective power to elect representatives.

02:29:21,922 --> 02:29:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  that will build a broader safety net.

02:29:24,322 --> 02:29:25,150
SPEAKER_0:  is in their interest.

02:29:25,410 --> 02:29:27,646
SPEAKER_0:  for upper-middle class people, for others.

02:29:27,906 --> 02:29:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  They could afford to pay for their own provisioning either directly or through like Obamacare-like schemes where you just get a subsidy and you pay the rest yourself.

02:29:35,650 --> 02:29:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  and whatever.

02:29:36,610 --> 02:29:42,814
SPEAKER_0:  This is for really the bottom 40% plus of the population. They really don't have any options, so they prioritize other things.

02:29:43,234 --> 02:29:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  and they end up with...

02:29:44,674 --> 02:29:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  some sort of injury or health problem or whatever else. And it's bad for everyone in society, but especially bad for the people at the bottom of the labor market.

02:29:52,258 --> 02:29:57,054
SPEAKER_1:  So I saw various estimates for socialist programs like Social Security expansion, free college.

02:29:57,794 --> 02:29:59,678
SPEAKER_1:  Medicare for all will cost.

02:30:00,226 --> 02:30:02,782
SPEAKER_1:  upwards of $40 trillion over 10 years.

02:30:03,394 --> 02:30:04,062
SPEAKER_1:  for zero.

02:30:04,578 --> 02:30:08,094
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, they could argue with those numbers and so on. But so there's a cost.

02:30:09,218 --> 02:30:10,782
SPEAKER_1:  there's a taxpayer cost.

02:30:11,330 --> 02:30:12,062
SPEAKER_1:  What are...

02:30:14,210 --> 02:30:15,774
SPEAKER_1:  given the weight of that cost.

02:30:16,738 --> 02:30:21,630
SPEAKER_1:  Can you still make the case for these programs and then can you try to make the case against them?

02:30:22,082 --> 02:30:23,358
SPEAKER_1:  that the cost is too high.

02:30:23,682 --> 02:30:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  So I will.

02:30:25,474 --> 02:30:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  Not argue with you on the numbers, because you just threw out random numbers. I do think universal health here.

02:30:30,114 --> 02:30:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  If done right, can be basically cost neutral. I think it's an exception.

02:30:33,602 --> 02:30:39,710
SPEAKER_0:  because we spend a tremendous amount of money on healthcare, a huge percentage of our GDP, so I think it could be done.

02:30:39,938 --> 02:30:41,662
SPEAKER_0:  in a way that's close to, um...

02:30:42,274 --> 02:30:43,399
SPEAKER_0:  class neutral.

02:30:43,399 --> 02:30:50,014
SPEAKER_1:  But can you argue on the numbers without arguing on the numbers? So you're saying just your gut says that there's a lot of...

02:30:50,370 --> 02:30:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  depending on how these programs are done.

02:30:52,706 --> 02:30:55,331
SPEAKER_1:  there's a lot of variance in how much it will actually.

02:30:55,331 --> 02:31:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  There's a lot of bureaucracy in billing right now in our healthcare sector. For example, there would be...

02:31:00,546 --> 02:31:01,278
SPEAKER_0:  eliminated.

02:31:01,634 --> 02:31:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:31:02,498 --> 02:31:09,342
SPEAKER_0:  there's a lot of costs that are spiraling upward, a provider cost from both doctors, hospitals, but also pharmaceuticals to drug costs.

02:31:09,922 --> 02:31:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  that insurance companies shoulder because their market share is too fragmented to really negotiate it hard.

02:31:17,026 --> 02:31:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:31:17,858 --> 02:31:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  Medicare can sometimes negotiate better rates, but Medicare for all would negotiate even better rates. The cost spiral that we can adjust with more government.

02:31:25,954 --> 02:31:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  involvement and there's a reason why we spend a bigger share of our GDP on healthcare than other?

02:31:30,946 --> 02:31:31,422
SPEAKER_0:  places.

02:31:32,418 --> 02:31:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  But let me just accept the broad premise that...

02:31:35,010 --> 02:31:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  Social programs cost money.

02:31:36,578 --> 02:31:36,990
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:31:38,626 --> 02:31:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  Now.

02:31:40,258 --> 02:31:41,086
SPEAKER_0:  I think that.

02:31:41,474 --> 02:31:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  That one.

02:31:42,658 --> 02:31:43,518
SPEAKER_0:  for ordinary.

02:31:43,746 --> 02:31:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  people.

02:31:44,962 --> 02:31:45,790
SPEAKER_0:  Most of them.

02:31:46,786 --> 02:31:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  the trade off of even hypothetically if taxes on lower middle class and working class people in certain cases go up.

02:31:56,002 --> 02:31:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  that trade-off would still be in their benefit.

02:31:58,402 --> 02:32:00,926
SPEAKER_0:  because they're the ones who currently who-

02:32:01,314 --> 02:32:04,798
SPEAKER_0:  would be consuming more of those goods and also our

02:32:05,154 --> 02:32:07,422
SPEAKER_0:  tax system and whatnot is progressive.

02:32:07,746 --> 02:32:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  so that the rich will pay more.

02:32:10,786 --> 02:32:12,894
SPEAKER_0:  the majority will consume.

02:32:13,122 --> 02:32:13,822
SPEAKER_0:  more of them.

02:32:14,402 --> 02:32:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  Also, I think a lot of these programs are the bedrock of a healthy society.

02:32:19,714 --> 02:32:20,286
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:32:20,578 --> 02:32:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  One reason, for example.

02:32:21,922 --> 02:32:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  that we have.

02:32:23,842 --> 02:32:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  So much crime.

02:32:25,058 --> 02:32:28,670
SPEAKER_0:  and violence in the US. There's lots of cultural and other.

02:32:28,898 --> 02:32:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  causes with our level of gun ownership, American history, and so on.

02:32:33,890 --> 02:32:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  one really important factor is just the level of.

02:32:37,922 --> 02:32:48,286
SPEAKER_0:  poverty and inequality in the US compared to other countries that combined with guns and other factors means that we live in more violent unequal societies.

02:32:48,898 --> 02:32:50,558
SPEAKER_0:  would be shocked by the fact that.

02:32:51,074 --> 02:32:59,006
SPEAKER_0:  in even some of our nicest areas and our city isn't elsewhere because there's not a real violence to it's just normal to have gun

02:32:59,586 --> 02:33:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  violence is normal to have.

02:33:01,858 --> 02:33:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  drug-related violence, you know, the...

02:33:04,770 --> 02:33:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  We have.

02:33:06,050 --> 02:33:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  what, like four or five hundred people some years in like Baltimore, a city of under a million getting getting killed.

02:33:12,226 --> 02:33:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:33:13,538 --> 02:33:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  These are all recipes for a society in which

02:33:16,770 --> 02:33:18,110
SPEAKER_0:  won the public sphere.

02:33:18,338 --> 02:33:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  is is drunk like crazy.

02:33:20,386 --> 02:33:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  because you're not gonna go wander out for an evening stroll in a park if you live in a dangerous area or whatever else.

02:33:26,786 --> 02:33:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  that the rot goes very deep.

02:33:28,642 --> 02:33:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  And a welfare state is one way to.

02:33:31,170 --> 02:33:35,262
SPEAKER_0:  live in a better society for everyone. There's been plenty of.

02:33:35,618 --> 02:33:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  of studies. There's one book called The Spirit Level on

02:33:39,586 --> 02:33:44,926
SPEAKER_0:  on inequality that was quite popular that just notes that inequality is really terrible for the psyches.

02:33:45,282 --> 02:33:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:33:46,178 --> 02:33:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  of the rich too, not just for

02:33:48,546 --> 02:33:49,950
SPEAKER_0:  for the poor. So I think.

02:33:50,434 --> 02:33:53,950
SPEAKER_0:  Spending some more money living in a more just society is doable.

02:33:54,402 --> 02:33:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  There's different ways to address certain costs.

02:33:57,602 --> 02:33:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  spirals.

02:33:58,882 --> 02:34:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  One reason why our welfare states are getting more and more expensive is in part just because our population is aging.

02:34:06,690 --> 02:34:09,278
SPEAKER_0:  but many of the same people who say we can't afford.

02:34:09,954 --> 02:34:12,382
SPEAKER_0:  more in our welfare states because um

02:34:12,642 --> 02:34:16,702
SPEAKER_0:  you know, we're already spending so much on social security and all these other entitlements are the same people.

02:34:16,930 --> 02:34:17,758
SPEAKER_0:  Also for...

02:34:18,306 --> 02:34:26,782
SPEAKER_0:  one, closing borders so immigrants can't come in to help build the economy and to fill gaps in the economy.

02:34:27,234 --> 02:34:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  and also who aren't for things that will make it easier to have kids.

02:34:32,226 --> 02:34:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  I'm 33 years old.

02:34:33,698 --> 02:34:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  I have a lot of friends who...

02:34:36,546 --> 02:34:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  have been putting off having kids until they save up.

02:34:39,266 --> 02:34:42,814
SPEAKER_0:  X amount of dollars, even though they have someone they could, you know,

02:34:43,842 --> 02:34:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  raise children with.

02:34:45,506 --> 02:34:46,142
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:34:46,370 --> 02:34:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  because they can't afford the cost of childcare. They can't, you know, their job probably won't give them more than four, six weeks of family leave or whatever else. Like this is not the case.

02:34:56,770 --> 02:35:00,318
SPEAKER_0:  in other countries. So I think there's all sorts of benefits from.

02:35:00,642 --> 02:35:01,502
SPEAKER_0:  having a bigger...

02:35:01,858 --> 02:35:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  welfare state.

02:35:03,490 --> 02:35:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  But yes, there are.

02:35:04,866 --> 02:35:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  costs and there are going to be certain trade-offs. It's not a magical thing where you could just open it out and just legalize it, which is just completely fair.

02:35:10,146 --> 02:35:12,254
SPEAKER_0:  you know, have everything without trade-offs.

02:35:12,418 --> 02:35:14,302
SPEAKER_1:  So in a progressive tech system.

02:35:15,586 --> 02:35:16,446
SPEAKER_1:  is there.

02:35:17,858 --> 02:35:19,838
SPEAKER_1:  to push back on the costs here.

02:35:20,834 --> 02:35:24,830
SPEAKER_1:  Is there a point at which taxing the rich?

02:35:25,922 --> 02:35:31,390
SPEAKER_1:  It's kind of productive in the long term. So in the short term, there might be a net benefit of increasing taxes

02:35:32,258 --> 02:35:37,278
SPEAKER_1:  Um, because the programs, the middle class, the lower middle class gets is more beneficial.

02:35:38,562 --> 02:35:39,326
SPEAKER_1:  Is there?

02:35:39,714 --> 02:35:42,014
SPEAKER_1:  Is there a negative side to taxing the rich?

02:35:43,042 --> 02:35:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  In theory, yes, of course. So one would be if you tax the rich so much.

02:35:48,002 --> 02:35:49,950
SPEAKER_0:  They change their consumption patterns.

02:35:50,210 --> 02:35:52,958
SPEAKER_0:  and that has negative impacts on the economy as a whole.

02:35:53,282 --> 02:35:58,238
SPEAKER_0:  that you would have to really model it out, but there would be a certain point in which...

02:35:58,626 --> 02:35:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  that.

02:35:59,458 --> 02:36:00,606
SPEAKER_0:  consumption changes.

02:36:00,930 --> 02:36:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  Might have net.

02:36:02,178 --> 02:36:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  detrimental effects.

02:36:03,874 --> 02:36:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  I think that's.

02:36:05,282 --> 02:36:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  more unlikely and the more likely scenario is

02:36:08,866 --> 02:36:12,478
SPEAKER_0:  UTACs, corporations and other.

02:36:13,026 --> 02:36:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  out.

02:36:14,050 --> 02:36:17,278
SPEAKER_0:  wealthy people in society to the point that...

02:36:17,922 --> 02:36:18,654
SPEAKER_0:  They have.

02:36:18,946 --> 02:36:22,046
SPEAKER_0:  potentially less money for productive investment.

02:36:22,498 --> 02:36:26,334
SPEAKER_0:  because you're in a capitalist society, you're reliant on capitalists to invest.

02:36:26,978 --> 02:36:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  So you kind of don't want to be in the worst of both worlds, where you've gone too far for capitalism, but not far enough for socialism?

02:36:33,698 --> 02:36:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:36:34,754 --> 02:36:35,870
SPEAKER_0:  MI Vision, of course.

02:36:36,290 --> 02:36:40,606
SPEAKER_0:  of socialism, that's one reason why we'd have to take the investment function.

02:36:41,058 --> 02:36:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  away from capitals. There has to be if you're going to make it so hard for them.

02:36:45,666 --> 02:36:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  that they can't invest.

02:36:47,170 --> 02:36:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  or they can't employ labor the way they're employing now, you have to create another mechanism.

02:36:52,354 --> 02:36:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  for supply to be created.

02:36:54,050 --> 02:36:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  And that's why.

02:36:55,170 --> 02:36:56,926
SPEAKER_0:  That's the transition point. Yes.

02:36:57,314 --> 02:36:57,886
SPEAKER_1:  Um

02:36:58,274 --> 02:37:02,078
SPEAKER_1:  What about longer term de-incentivizing young people that are...

02:37:02,370 --> 02:37:04,286
SPEAKER_1:  dreaming of becoming entrepreneurs.

02:37:04,866 --> 02:37:08,030
SPEAKER_1:  and realizing that there's a huge tax on being wealthy.

02:37:08,706 --> 02:37:12,414
SPEAKER_1:  So if you take these big risks, which is what's required to be an entrepreneur.

02:37:13,250 --> 02:37:15,326
SPEAKER_1:  and you are lucky enough to succeed.

02:37:15,586 --> 02:37:17,054
SPEAKER_1:  and good enough to succeed.

02:37:17,730 --> 02:37:20,190
SPEAKER_1:  that the government will take most of your money away.

02:37:21,314 --> 02:37:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  I think realistically that's not a disincentive for most people.

02:37:25,218 --> 02:37:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:37:26,338 --> 02:37:33,982
SPEAKER_0:  First of all, we already have a progressive taxation system. The government does take a bunch of the money away and people are still striving to become.

02:37:34,210 --> 02:37:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  Britch.

02:37:35,010 --> 02:37:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  a lot of what people want when they dream of...

02:37:37,762 --> 02:37:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  Success.

02:37:38,914 --> 02:37:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  is they want accolades, they want respect, and of course they want.

02:37:43,298 --> 02:37:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  Some.

02:37:44,258 --> 02:37:45,726
SPEAKER_0:  more wealth.

02:37:45,986 --> 02:37:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  Well, they consume...

02:37:47,426 --> 02:37:49,278
SPEAKER_0:  luxury goods with or whatever else.

02:37:49,826 --> 02:37:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  but at a certain point.

02:37:51,970 --> 02:37:55,582
SPEAKER_0:  it becomes better for the state to...

02:37:56,034 --> 02:37:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  to tax.

02:37:57,026 --> 02:37:58,142
SPEAKER_0:  and either redistribute.

02:37:58,434 --> 02:38:00,382
SPEAKER_0:  directly or through social programs.

02:38:00,738 --> 02:38:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  or

02:38:01,794 --> 02:38:03,006
SPEAKER_0:  redirect that money.

02:38:03,426 --> 02:38:09,342
SPEAKER_0:  through tax credits and other ways to shape investment towards productive investment. We don't want a society in which

02:38:09,666 --> 02:38:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  a bunch of rich people fly around in helicopters going from club to club while the productive economy.

02:38:16,898 --> 02:38:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  does nothing, right? At that point, I think a lot of-

02:38:20,066 --> 02:38:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  ordinary rich people might prefer.

02:38:22,530 --> 02:38:23,966
SPEAKER_0:  the government to come in.

02:38:24,194 --> 02:38:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  to tax them and to try to spur investment in certain productive.

02:38:28,386 --> 02:38:30,942
SPEAKER_0:  sectors.

02:38:31,202 --> 02:38:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  Just

02:38:31,970 --> 02:38:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  Just depends, but I honestly believe that.

02:38:34,210 --> 02:38:35,582
SPEAKER_0:  that most people...

02:38:36,354 --> 02:38:47,966
SPEAKER_0:  don't necessarily want to be rich for the sake of being rich. They want to be successful. And there's many different dynamics to that. And accolades and social respect is an important one of them. And it's also why.

02:38:48,418 --> 02:38:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  People just become.

02:38:49,634 --> 02:38:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  filthy, rich, often.

02:38:51,906 --> 02:38:54,622
SPEAKER_0:  The first thing they do is start out philanthropic.

02:38:55,298 --> 02:39:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  trust and try to give away their money because they want the social respect and accolades and whatever else they don't want just their money.

02:39:02,978 --> 02:39:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  On that topic, sort of a little bit of a tangent.

02:39:06,082 --> 02:39:08,222
SPEAKER_1:  There's a lot of folks in the...

02:39:08,738 --> 02:39:10,142
SPEAKER_1:  in the left community.

02:39:11,138 --> 02:39:14,014
SPEAKER_1:  a far left community, socialist community that...

02:39:14,306 --> 02:39:17,310
SPEAKER_1:  I think are at the source of a kind of derision towards.

02:39:17,954 --> 02:39:19,678
SPEAKER_1:  the B-Ward, the billionaires.

02:39:20,514 --> 02:39:23,166
SPEAKER_1:  Does it bother you or do you think that's in part?

02:39:23,554 --> 02:39:24,414
SPEAKER_1:  justified.

02:39:24,770 --> 02:39:28,158
SPEAKER_1:  a kind of using the word billionaire as a dirty word.

02:39:28,770 --> 02:39:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's perfectly justified in that it's a populist shorthand, right?

02:39:32,674 --> 02:39:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  So obviously when I talk about inequality, I often talk about

02:39:36,418 --> 02:39:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  power dynamics right between.

02:39:38,914 --> 02:39:41,726
SPEAKER_0:  workers and bosses and so on.

02:39:42,370 --> 02:39:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  Billionaire is just the 99%-1% version of it. It's just a popular shorthand to just explain.

02:39:48,994 --> 02:39:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  The fact that

02:39:50,498 --> 02:39:51,230
SPEAKER_0:  There's

02:39:51,586 --> 02:39:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:39:52,802 --> 02:39:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  a lot of people who have accumulated obscene.

02:39:56,834 --> 02:39:57,342
SPEAKER_0:  wealth.

02:39:57,794 --> 02:39:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:39:59,138 --> 02:40:00,926
SPEAKER_0:  These people aren't in my mind.

02:40:01,474 --> 02:40:06,334
SPEAKER_0:  parasites, you know in the in the kind of very very old-school

02:40:06,690 --> 02:40:07,646
SPEAKER_0:  Socialist rhetoric.

02:40:08,130 --> 02:40:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  End that.

02:40:09,858 --> 02:40:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  Of course.

02:40:10,914 --> 02:40:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  Um

02:40:11,938 --> 02:40:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  Kappas.

02:40:13,058 --> 02:40:16,350
SPEAKER_0:  provide employment, take entrepreneurial risks.

02:40:16,674 --> 02:40:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  come up with new ideas sometimes themselves, sometimes directly manage work and whatever.

02:40:22,210 --> 02:40:22,942
SPEAKER_0:  Whatever else.

02:40:23,650 --> 02:40:24,158
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:40:24,706 --> 02:40:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  but.

02:40:25,570 --> 02:40:31,006
SPEAKER_0:  They exert so much power over the lives of not just their workers, but society as a whole.

02:40:31,554 --> 02:40:33,214
SPEAKER_0:  taking away some of their wealth.

02:40:33,474 --> 02:40:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  and power.

02:40:34,658 --> 02:40:36,734
SPEAKER_0:  is a way to just empower.

02:40:37,058 --> 02:40:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  others.

02:40:38,082 --> 02:40:38,782
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:40:39,106 --> 02:40:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  And again...

02:40:40,322 --> 02:40:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  These things have policy trade-offs.

02:40:43,650 --> 02:40:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  if you just snap your fingers and say...

02:40:46,370 --> 02:40:46,878
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:40:47,362 --> 02:40:49,342
SPEAKER_0:  Elon Musk, you're now...

02:40:49,602 --> 02:40:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  all your wealth is gone, you're now on food stamps or whatever else in that kind of arbitrary way, you'd be a totally disincentivized people from trusting.

02:40:58,498 --> 02:41:03,806
SPEAKER_0:  the rules of the game as they've been set up in a capitalist society and I think that would have negative consequences for workers.

02:41:04,354 --> 02:41:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  But saying that...

02:41:05,762 --> 02:41:08,254
SPEAKER_0:  Hey, this person has too much power and too much wealth.

02:41:08,706 --> 02:41:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  and has

02:41:09,858 --> 02:41:13,662
SPEAKER_0:  too much ability to dictate things about the lives of others.

02:41:13,954 --> 02:41:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's just simply...

02:41:15,906 --> 02:41:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  a fact. And an

02:41:18,498 --> 02:41:20,958
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's true in the cases of people who are good people.

02:41:21,346 --> 02:41:28,583
SPEAKER_0:  and have risen to this position. And it's true in the cases of people who are maybe not so good people and who have risen to these positions.

02:41:28,583 --> 02:41:33,886
SPEAKER_1:  So I agree with you in part, but I have to push back here. So one of the problems I see...

02:41:34,274 --> 02:41:39,806
SPEAKER_1:  is using billionaires as shorthand to talk about power inequality and wealth inequality.

02:41:40,930 --> 02:41:41,598
SPEAKER_1:  Often.

02:41:41,922 --> 02:41:44,542
SPEAKER_1:  dismisses the fact that some of these folks

02:41:45,410 --> 02:41:48,542
SPEAKER_1:  are some of the best members of our society.

02:41:48,930 --> 02:41:53,278
SPEAKER_1:  So outside of the, however the system has created inequalities.

02:41:54,050 --> 02:41:55,454
SPEAKER_1:  a young person today.

02:41:56,738 --> 02:41:59,134
SPEAKER_1:  should dream to build cool stuff.

02:41:59,394 --> 02:42:00,510
SPEAKER_1:  Not for the wealth.

02:42:01,154 --> 02:42:03,646
SPEAKER_1:  Not for the power, the fame.

02:42:04,738 --> 02:42:06,718
SPEAKER_1:  to be part of building cool stuff.

02:42:07,298 --> 02:42:11,806
SPEAKER_1:  Now there's a lot of examples of billionaires that have gotten there in shady ways and so on.

02:42:12,642 --> 02:42:13,790
SPEAKER_1:  and you can point that out.

02:42:14,850 --> 02:42:16,702
SPEAKER_1:  in the same way we celebrate.

02:42:17,218 --> 02:42:20,222
SPEAKER_1:  great artists and great athletes and great.

02:42:20,706 --> 02:42:21,342
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhhh...

02:42:21,666 --> 02:42:23,678
SPEAKER_1:  literary icons and sort of

02:42:24,002 --> 02:42:26,174
SPEAKER_1:  writers and poets and musicians and

02:42:26,786 --> 02:42:29,982
SPEAKER_1:  uh... engineers and scientists we should sell we should

02:42:30,274 --> 02:42:31,326
SPEAKER_1:  sort of separate.

02:42:32,162 --> 02:42:33,662
SPEAKER_1:  the human creator.

02:42:34,274 --> 02:42:36,862
SPEAKER_1:  from the wealth that the system has given them.

02:42:37,570 --> 02:42:39,774
SPEAKER_1:  That's what I worry about.

02:42:40,066 --> 02:42:40,606
SPEAKER_1:  is like...

02:42:41,346 --> 02:42:44,350
SPEAKER_1:  in our system, some of the greatest humans.

02:42:44,962 --> 02:42:47,806
SPEAKER_1:  are the ones that have become rich. And so we sometimes mix up.

02:42:48,610 --> 02:42:50,942
SPEAKER_1:  that if you want to criticize.

02:42:51,458 --> 02:42:52,158
SPEAKER_1:  the wealth.

02:42:52,738 --> 02:42:54,910
SPEAKER_1:  We sometimes criticize the human.

02:42:55,426 --> 02:42:56,286
SPEAKER_1:  and the creator.

02:42:56,514 --> 02:42:59,358
SPEAKER_1:  while that should actually be the person we aspire to be.

02:43:00,898 --> 02:43:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I would agree with that.

02:43:02,146 --> 02:43:06,686
SPEAKER_0:  LeBron James, if he's not already in his lifetime, will be a billionaire.

02:43:07,330 --> 02:43:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  And he got his money largely through just

02:43:11,394 --> 02:43:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  being an incredible athlete.

02:43:13,346 --> 02:43:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  Excelling in his field more than anyone's, you know.

02:43:16,770 --> 02:43:20,734
SPEAKER_0:  Besides for Michael Jordan, I think he's my number two. He might be my number one. We'll see.

02:43:21,122 --> 02:43:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I'm willing to keep keeping open mind about the LeBron vs. Jordan conversation

02:43:26,818 --> 02:43:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:43:29,378 --> 02:43:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  he got that through his merit and he's been rewarded and apart he's getting rewarded because he's created vast amounts of wealth beyond what he's getting. This is just his share, you know, it's the salary cap league whenever he's doing an endorsement. Obviously that company is just thinking that he's worth more than what they're paying him for that endorsement and so on.

02:43:47,426 --> 02:43:48,126
SPEAKER_0:  and to the

02:43:48,482 --> 02:43:51,134
SPEAKER_0:  extent with Elon Musk, people see...

02:43:51,362 --> 02:43:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  innovation and they see someone who...

02:43:55,298 --> 02:44:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  put himself out there with sometimes crazy ideas because he's trying to think about the future.

02:44:00,706 --> 02:44:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  and trying to just.

02:44:02,562 --> 02:44:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  push things forward instead of just sitting on whatever money he has now and just investing it earning 6% return for the rest of his life.

02:44:11,394 --> 02:44:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  I think that that's a positive thing.

02:44:13,858 --> 02:44:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  but I think it doesn't get to the broader.

02:44:16,994 --> 02:44:22,526
SPEAKER_0:  policy question. When people invoke billionaires, they're invoking the specter of inequality and power.

02:44:23,074 --> 02:44:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:44:25,378 --> 02:44:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  It's not.

02:44:26,178 --> 02:44:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  Normally the rhetoric that I use because I propose

02:44:28,802 --> 02:44:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  and I use more traditional

02:44:32,066 --> 02:44:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  Socialist.

02:44:32,866 --> 02:44:34,462
SPEAKER_0:  rhetoric and terms.

02:44:34,850 --> 02:44:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  but I think it gets at something real.

02:44:36,642 --> 02:44:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  So often with these sorts of shorthands we use in politics.

02:44:39,906 --> 02:44:41,278
SPEAKER_0:  There are...

02:44:42,178 --> 02:44:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  You know, der.

02:44:43,138 --> 02:44:43,838
SPEAKER_0:  Imperfect.

02:44:44,418 --> 02:44:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  but they speak to a real thing.

02:44:47,746 --> 02:44:53,214
SPEAKER_1:  And they feed a little bit of fun that folks like AOC and Elon have with each other. It creates.

02:44:53,570 --> 02:44:57,246
SPEAKER_1:  it feeds, it inspires, it serves as a catalyst for.

02:44:57,730 --> 02:44:58,270
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

02:44:58,498 --> 02:44:59,678
SPEAKER_1:  productive discourse.

02:44:59,938 --> 02:45:01,118
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, speaking of which...

02:45:01,474 --> 02:45:03,230
SPEAKER_1:  You said you're a fan of Bernie Sanders.

02:45:03,906 --> 02:45:12,414
SPEAKER_1:  Would you classify yourself as a Bernie bro? What's the technical definition of a Bernie? Is that a very it's a subset? No, no, no, I'm sorry. You're a sophisticated philosopher.

02:45:12,802 --> 02:45:13,822
SPEAKER_1:  uh, writer.

02:45:14,338 --> 02:45:17,713
SPEAKER_1:  uh... economic and political thinker of course you would not call yourself

02:45:17,713 --> 02:45:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  I'm fine with calling myself a Bernie bro. That's it was made up by liberal journalist to smear Bernie and his supporters during the 2016

02:45:26,818 --> 02:45:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:45:27,554 --> 02:45:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  Campaign.

02:45:28,706 --> 02:45:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  Even though disproportionately his supporters were

02:45:31,778 --> 02:45:34,654
SPEAKER_0:  like young women in their 20s, you know, at them.

02:45:36,354 --> 02:45:41,979
SPEAKER_0:  Whatever, I think I'll ride for Bernie. There's worse things in the world being called a bro.

02:45:41,979 --> 02:45:44,830
SPEAKER_1:  What what do you like a Bob Ernie Sanders and?

02:45:45,378 --> 02:45:48,062
SPEAKER_1:  to what degree this represents ideas of socialism.

02:45:48,290 --> 02:45:49,566
SPEAKER_1:  to what degree this he.

02:45:50,082 --> 02:45:51,390
SPEAKER_1:  I'll represent.

02:45:52,066 --> 02:45:54,366
SPEAKER_1:  the more traditional sort of liberal ideas.

02:45:54,594 --> 02:45:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  I love Bernie.

02:45:55,842 --> 02:45:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  Oh.

02:45:57,090 --> 02:46:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  Most of all, I like his clarity. He's by far the best communicator we have on the left.

02:46:01,666 --> 02:46:03,070
SPEAKER_0:  He speaks with a moral.

02:46:03,426 --> 02:46:03,966
SPEAKER_0:  force.

02:46:04,546 --> 02:46:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, he's...

02:46:05,858 --> 02:46:06,494
SPEAKER_0:  Relatable.

02:46:06,818 --> 02:46:09,918
SPEAKER_0:  And he's taken a lot of socialist rhetoric.

02:46:10,338 --> 02:46:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  from Academia.

02:46:11,618 --> 02:46:17,118
SPEAKER_0:  and brought it down to its core in a way that's comprehensible for ordinary people and speaks their daily lives.

02:46:17,762 --> 02:46:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  So when Bernie does a speech, people can finish his lines, because they know what he's going to say.

02:46:21,666 --> 02:46:23,934
SPEAKER_0:  You know, they know what points he's gonna hit.

02:46:24,802 --> 02:46:25,310
SPEAKER_0:  because.

02:46:25,634 --> 02:46:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  Socialism.

02:46:26,882 --> 02:46:27,646
SPEAKER_0:  in my mind.

02:46:28,002 --> 02:46:36,030
SPEAKER_0:  should not be a complicated thing. Now, when we get to more abstract discussions about what a future system would look like, when we get to the policy trade-offs today, I think...

02:46:36,418 --> 02:46:38,526
SPEAKER_0:  We need to put on a different hat we should embrace.

02:46:39,298 --> 02:46:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  all sorts of nuance and contradiction and complication.

02:46:43,394 --> 02:46:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  when it comes to the core moral and ethical appeal.

02:46:46,882 --> 02:46:49,278
SPEAKER_0:  I think Bernie grasped that and how to...

02:46:49,506 --> 02:46:50,110
SPEAKER_0:  Communicate it.

02:46:50,882 --> 02:46:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  Now.

02:46:52,258 --> 02:46:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  Bernie Sanders was politicized.

02:46:54,562 --> 02:47:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  a very long time ago. I actually once told him, I've only met him a few times, but one time I joked that-

02:47:00,898 --> 02:47:01,982
SPEAKER_0:  in his

02:47:02,402 --> 02:47:03,870
SPEAKER_0:  In his book, he mentioned that

02:47:04,418 --> 02:47:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  one.

02:47:05,154 --> 02:47:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  politicizing moment in his life was when...

02:47:08,770 --> 02:47:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  the Brooklyn Dodgers left town and he was devastated because he was a Dodgers fan, you know, from Brooklyn.

02:47:13,858 --> 02:47:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  And I said, this is like.

02:47:15,266 --> 02:47:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  2020 campaign, this may be 2019, I said, Bernie, you're running for president. You do not need to keep reminding people your age. Yeah.…

02:47:24,002 --> 02:47:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

02:47:24,642 --> 02:47:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  Hee.

02:47:26,050 --> 02:47:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  he was politicized through

02:47:27,842 --> 02:47:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  the Young People's Socialist League.

02:47:30,018 --> 02:47:35,550
SPEAKER_0:  which was an old offshoot of the Norm Thomas Socialist Party of America. It's a very old school socialist tradition.

02:47:36,162 --> 02:47:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  Then he was engaged in labor struggles in the 60s.

02:47:40,034 --> 02:47:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  He was engaged in the civil rights movement. So he came from this.

02:47:43,714 --> 02:47:45,438
SPEAKER_0:  old left generation.

02:47:45,954 --> 02:47:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  that I think just had a more plain-spoken, more rooted way of understanding change and socialism.

02:47:51,682 --> 02:47:52,254
SPEAKER_0:  It wasn't.

02:47:52,546 --> 02:47:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  in my mind polluted by academia and by some of the

02:47:56,034 --> 02:47:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  The turn towards...

02:47:57,954 --> 02:48:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  issues of culture and an excessive focus on representation or whatever else. It was rooted. It was really rooted in something.

02:48:05,378 --> 02:48:06,398
SPEAKER_0:  Economic in a way.

02:48:07,298 --> 02:48:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  Then obviously he had

02:48:08,610 --> 02:48:18,046
SPEAKER_0:  all his ideas and he was also a product of the left and that he went to Vermont, he kind of did the back to the land thing. He was basically like a, not quite a hippie and affect, but he was.

02:48:18,466 --> 02:48:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  out there trying to farm or whatever and you know.

02:48:21,954 --> 02:48:23,902
SPEAKER_0:  Hold this hell, Northern Vermont.

02:48:24,610 --> 02:48:25,086
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:48:25,858 --> 02:48:27,038
SPEAKER_0:  then he decided to...

02:48:27,586 --> 02:48:33,438
SPEAKER_0:  to do politics, do electoral politics, and he failed for a long time. He did third party politics, he kept losing races.

02:48:33,794 --> 02:48:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  Eventually he became, by savvy and luck and things he learned, the mayor of Burlington, Vermont.

02:48:40,130 --> 02:48:41,150
SPEAKER_0:  and he just...

02:48:41,698 --> 02:48:45,118
SPEAKER_0:  with the same message. In my book, I talk about...

02:48:45,538 --> 02:48:47,422
SPEAKER_0:  I quote, I think a Bernie speech.

02:48:47,874 --> 02:48:48,510
SPEAKER_0:  from...

02:48:48,930 --> 02:48:53,406
SPEAKER_0:  1970s, one of his early campaigns, and I compared it to a Bernie speech.

02:48:53,666 --> 02:49:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  during his 2016 campaign. It was virtually identical. Millionaires were swapped with millionaires and billionaires, speaking of billionaires, which is beautiful. I think there's something great to what he offered American politics and also all around the world.

02:49:09,986 --> 02:49:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  there's a socialist poll in politics, whether you agree with it or not, and all these countries in Europe, and any rich country, Japan and so on.

02:49:18,274 --> 02:49:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  And the US really didn't have that. The furthest left you could go was like.

02:49:21,826 --> 02:49:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  you know, Chris Hayes and MSNBC or whatever.

02:49:26,306 --> 02:49:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  I'm very glad that there's a socialist poll and I think we have Bernie to...

02:49:31,778 --> 02:49:32,446
SPEAKER_0:  to thank for it.

02:49:33,058 --> 02:49:34,654
SPEAKER_0:  to the extent that a lot of

02:49:34,882 --> 02:49:35,294
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

02:49:35,650 --> 02:49:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  Self-described socialists don't think Bernie is a real socialist.

02:49:38,722 --> 02:49:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  It's in part because he stays grounded in people's day-to-day lives and struggles.

02:49:43,362 --> 02:49:44,862
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think he thinks often.

02:49:45,378 --> 02:49:46,174
SPEAKER_0:  the way that

02:49:46,978 --> 02:49:51,262
SPEAKER_0:  I do and other people more disconnected or step or move from day to day politics.

02:49:51,746 --> 02:49:53,662
SPEAKER_0:  think about the future.

02:49:54,210 --> 02:49:56,766
SPEAKER_0:  contours of a social society and so on.

02:49:56,994 --> 02:49:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  but I think he's morally committed.

02:49:58,978 --> 02:50:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  to a egalitarian different sort of.

02:50:02,082 --> 02:50:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  future.

02:50:03,170 --> 02:50:05,566
SPEAKER_1:  And I don't think he, at least I haven't heard him.

02:50:06,402 --> 02:50:11,934
SPEAKER_1:  talk about sort of this big broad history and future, so the Marxist ideology and so on.

02:50:12,354 --> 02:50:14,814
SPEAKER_1:  Not that he's afraid of it or something, that's just not how he thinks about it.

02:50:15,330 --> 02:50:19,582
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I think he's a practical thinker and also, yeah, he is running, even if he, he, he...

02:50:19,842 --> 02:50:22,302
SPEAKER_0:  He should be afraid of it too because he is a...

02:50:22,594 --> 02:50:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  You know, he's...

02:50:23,650 --> 02:50:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  is a major politician running for president. I think what people...

02:50:27,042 --> 02:50:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  want is they want.

02:50:29,154 --> 02:50:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:50:30,562 --> 02:50:32,350
SPEAKER_0:  They want the left wing of the possible.

02:50:32,802 --> 02:50:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  or at least the segment of the party that was voting for him, the Democratic party that was voting for him. They wanted something that was a step or two removed from what they had now.

02:50:41,762 --> 02:50:42,686
SPEAKER_0:  and was visionary.

02:50:43,234 --> 02:50:48,030
SPEAKER_0:  but not so far removed that it seemed like a scary leap. And I think we...

02:50:48,354 --> 02:50:52,446
SPEAKER_0:  We lost a chance in 2016 to elect someone that I think...

02:50:52,962 --> 02:50:55,806
SPEAKER_0:  would have beaten Trump or at the very least would have

02:50:56,290 --> 02:50:56,606
SPEAKER_0:  Good luck with your day.

02:50:57,378 --> 02:50:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  Been close?

02:50:58,402 --> 02:51:00,062
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think the Democrats screwed him over?

02:51:01,122 --> 02:51:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, not in the way of-

02:51:02,786 --> 02:51:04,606
SPEAKER_0:  deliberate or direct vote-working.

02:51:06,210 --> 02:51:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  They put their thumb in the scale.

02:51:07,714 --> 02:51:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  for sure.

02:51:08,898 --> 02:51:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, it's not even conspiracy theory. There's all this stuff in the debates about.

02:51:14,050 --> 02:51:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  Clinton being Clinton's people being fed questions and and whatever else and just the tone of the media

02:51:20,162 --> 02:51:22,238
SPEAKER_0:  the media was extremely dismissive and hostile.

02:51:22,850 --> 02:51:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  to him.

02:51:23,874 --> 02:51:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  I love that Bernie still does the Fox News town hall.

02:51:26,914 --> 02:51:27,390
SPEAKER_0:  with us.

02:51:27,650 --> 02:51:30,654
SPEAKER_0:  They're just him speaking to the people, and he's not afraid of...

02:51:30,914 --> 02:51:33,662
SPEAKER_0:  of going on, you know, any sort of...

02:51:34,050 --> 02:51:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  outlet in making his case, but I think a lot of the liberal media in particular.

02:51:39,618 --> 02:51:41,493
SPEAKER_0:  always had it out for Bernie Sanders.

02:51:41,493 --> 02:51:43,262
SPEAKER_1:  What was that? Because that was really annoying.

02:51:43,842 --> 02:51:46,270
SPEAKER_1:  That was really annoying how dismissive they were.

02:51:46,754 --> 02:51:49,406
SPEAKER_1:  I've seen that in some other candidates, like, um...

02:51:49,986 --> 02:51:54,206
SPEAKER_1:  They were dismissive towards Andrew Yang in that same way. So forget the ideology.

02:51:54,946 --> 02:51:58,270
SPEAKER_1:  Why are they so smug sometimes towards certain candidates?

02:51:58,850 --> 02:52:00,990
SPEAKER_1:  What is that? Because I think that's actually at the core.

02:52:01,538 --> 02:52:04,318
SPEAKER_1:  to a degree if Democrats or any party fails.

02:52:04,866 --> 02:52:06,270
SPEAKER_1:  that it's that smugness.

02:52:06,658 --> 02:52:07,774
SPEAKER_1:  because people see through that.

02:52:08,706 --> 02:52:09,982
SPEAKER_0:  I think a lot of these people are.

02:52:10,402 --> 02:52:18,366
SPEAKER_0:  friends, even if they don't know each other, they're friends because they went to the same schools, they know the same people, they have the same broad just...

02:52:18,626 --> 02:52:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  Ideology in Worldview.

02:52:20,290 --> 02:52:27,550
SPEAKER_0:  So they had a sense of what the Democratic Party should be and who should be running and who was going to win and also what was serious and unserious.

02:52:27,810 --> 02:52:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  So Bernie would say some things about...

02:52:30,338 --> 02:52:31,198
SPEAKER_0:  the world that.

02:52:31,906 --> 02:52:33,918
SPEAKER_0:  objectively to a lot of people seem.

02:52:34,146 --> 02:52:34,462
SPEAKER_0:  Correct.

02:52:34,818 --> 02:52:35,294
SPEAKER_0:  or at least.

02:52:36,130 --> 02:52:36,990
SPEAKER_0:  Pretty close to correct.

02:52:37,442 --> 02:52:43,998
SPEAKER_0:  and a journalist would just look at him like he's from outer space. To some extent, this also happens to people on the right. People on the right.

02:52:44,610 --> 02:52:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  often say things that I find.

02:52:46,690 --> 02:52:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  repulsive or

02:52:49,346 --> 02:52:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  Just run.

02:52:50,594 --> 02:52:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  but.

02:52:51,810 --> 02:52:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  There's parts of the media.

02:52:53,442 --> 02:52:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  that would describe their certain views as.

02:52:56,610 --> 02:53:00,606
SPEAKER_0:  illegitimate or outside the boundaries of acceptable conversation.

02:53:00,930 --> 02:53:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  I think there should be a few things outside.

02:53:03,042 --> 02:53:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  the boundary of acceptance.

02:53:04,290 --> 02:53:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  conversation, you know, hate speech and so on.

02:53:07,682 --> 02:53:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:53:08,962 --> 02:53:10,686
SPEAKER_0:  Like, there's this attempt to say...

02:53:11,554 --> 02:53:12,350
SPEAKER_0:  their views.

02:53:12,738 --> 02:53:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  are illegitimate and therefore anyone who votes for them for any reason is illegitimate too.

02:53:17,346 --> 02:53:19,550
SPEAKER_0:  And that's one reason why I think it's fueled a lot of

02:53:20,098 --> 02:53:22,878
SPEAKER_0:  resentment, and it will ultimately end up fueling

02:53:23,106 --> 02:53:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:53:24,226 --> 02:53:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  the extremes of American politics that people feel like, you know, they're not being listened to.

02:53:29,026 --> 02:53:32,990
SPEAKER_1:  And some of it is also style of speaking and personality.

02:53:33,730 --> 02:53:37,790
SPEAKER_1:  or if you're not willing to sort of play kind of a game of civility.

02:53:38,498 --> 02:53:41,598
SPEAKER_1:  or there's like a proper way of speaking if you're a Democrat.

02:53:42,146 --> 02:53:45,374
SPEAKER_1:  If you're not doing that kind of proper way of speaking, then people dismiss you.

02:53:45,602 --> 02:53:48,510
SPEAKER_1:  I think in certain sense, whatever you feel about him.

02:53:49,506 --> 02:53:51,646
SPEAKER_1:  People dismiss Donald Trump for the same reason.

02:53:52,482 --> 02:53:54,622
SPEAKER_1:  where it's the style of speaking.

02:53:55,010 --> 02:53:58,654
SPEAKER_1:  the personality of the person. He's not playing by the rules of-

02:53:59,330 --> 02:54:00,926
SPEAKER_1:  Polite society of polite.

02:54:01,410 --> 02:54:02,846
SPEAKER_1:  and so on.

02:54:03,682 --> 02:54:04,734
SPEAKER_1:  And that's really...

02:54:05,602 --> 02:54:08,126
SPEAKER_1:  that troubles me because it feels like solutions.

02:54:08,514 --> 02:54:09,694
SPEAKER_1:  the great leaders.

02:54:11,138 --> 02:54:11,742
SPEAKER_1:  will not.

02:54:12,770 --> 02:54:13,214
SPEAKER_1:  polite.

02:54:14,050 --> 02:54:17,886
SPEAKER_1:  in the way they're not going to behave in the way they're supposed to behave.

02:54:18,402 --> 02:54:19,774
SPEAKER_1:  and I just wish the media.

02:54:20,226 --> 02:54:21,854
SPEAKER_1:  I was at least open-minded to that.

02:54:22,914 --> 02:54:25,758
SPEAKER_1:  which I guess gives me hope about the new media, which is like...

02:54:25,986 --> 02:54:27,966
SPEAKER_1:  more distributed citizen media, right?

02:54:28,290 --> 02:54:30,974
SPEAKER_1:  that they're more open-minded and revolutionary.

02:54:32,162 --> 02:54:33,118
SPEAKER_1:  to the...

02:54:33,634 --> 02:54:36,030
SPEAKER_1:  outsiders, right? I actually first...

02:54:36,834 --> 02:54:39,038
SPEAKER_1:  I really like Bernie Sanders.

02:54:40,002 --> 02:54:41,534
SPEAKER_1:  I first heard him

02:54:42,818 --> 02:54:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  on In Conversation with Tom Hartman.

02:54:46,370 --> 02:54:46,878
SPEAKER_1:  cut.

02:54:47,266 --> 02:54:48,190
SPEAKER_1:  He had these like...

02:54:48,738 --> 02:54:52,382
SPEAKER_1:  like weekly conversations and just the authenticity.

02:54:52,802 --> 02:55:00,254
SPEAKER_1:  from the guy. I didn't even know any context. I didn't even know honestly he was a democratic socialist or anything. The authenticity of the human being was really refreshing.

02:55:00,674 --> 02:55:03,550
SPEAKER_1:  And we, I guess, decided to run for president.

02:55:04,130 --> 02:55:04,958
SPEAKER_1:  That was really s-

02:55:05,186 --> 02:55:08,926
SPEAKER_1:  I was like, surely this person has no chance.

02:55:09,474 --> 02:55:12,158
SPEAKER_1:  Just like he seemed too authentic, he seemed too...

02:55:12,994 --> 02:55:21,118
SPEAKER_1:  like he's not going to be effective of playing the game of politics. So it was very inspiring to me to see that you don't necessarily need to be good at playing the game of politics.

02:55:21,570 --> 02:55:23,038
SPEAKER_1:  you can actually have a chance of winning.

02:55:23,394 --> 02:55:25,022
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, that was really inspiring to see.

02:55:26,146 --> 02:55:26,750
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:55:27,970 --> 02:55:28,542
SPEAKER_1:  What about...

02:55:29,090 --> 02:55:29,950
SPEAKER_1:  some of the other.

02:55:30,882 --> 02:55:33,118
SPEAKER_1:  popular candidates. What do you think about AOC?

02:55:33,986 --> 02:55:36,611
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if she self-identifies as a socialist or not.

02:55:36,611 --> 02:55:39,774
SPEAKER_0:  She does self-identify as a democratic socialist.

02:55:40,770 --> 02:55:48,510
SPEAKER_0:  I think she was a very inspiring figure for a lot of people. She was kind of out of this burning wave with the first set of...

02:55:49,026 --> 02:55:53,630
SPEAKER_0:  Bernie candidates in 2018 that identified with him instead of the Democratic Party establishment?

02:55:54,978 --> 02:55:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  I think that...

02:55:56,898 --> 02:55:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  She is.

02:55:57,794 --> 02:56:03,070
SPEAKER_0:  still developing as a politician. It's very difficult when you're in a deep blue district.

02:56:04,002 --> 02:56:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:56:05,474 --> 02:56:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  when...

02:56:06,946 --> 02:56:09,118
SPEAKER_0:  you don't often have to.

02:56:09,474 --> 02:56:12,318
SPEAKER_0:  worry about re-election or talk to...

02:56:12,578 --> 02:56:15,550
SPEAKER_0:  but modulate your rhetoric to win over swing voters in your district.

02:56:15,906 --> 02:56:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  but then you're immediately a national and cultural figure.

02:56:19,426 --> 02:56:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  So AOC basically goes from.

02:56:21,954 --> 02:56:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  her views.

02:56:23,362 --> 02:56:24,254
SPEAKER_0:  which are compelling.

02:56:24,514 --> 02:56:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  in my mind a lot of her programmatic views are compelling.

02:56:28,130 --> 02:56:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  Wins her district, then has her own rhetoric

02:56:31,682 --> 02:56:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  which to me compared to Bernie, owes itself more.

02:56:34,946 --> 02:56:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  to the academic left in the way that a lot of the left has learned to talk.

02:56:40,034 --> 02:56:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, academic in the sense that she's like a Marxist or whatever else, but academic in the way that

02:56:45,282 --> 02:56:46,046
SPEAKER_0:  She may be.

02:56:47,266 --> 02:56:51,870
SPEAKER_0:  using at times confusing language to convey basic points when she gets into like...

02:56:52,642 --> 02:56:56,767
SPEAKER_0:  the language of intersectionality and whatever else. Especially in

02:56:56,767 --> 02:56:58,974
SPEAKER_1:  in the context of cultural issues and stuff.

02:56:59,138 --> 02:57:03,262
SPEAKER_0:  Exactly, instead of just a plain spoken Bernie, like yeah, discrimination is wrong.

02:57:03,490 --> 02:57:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  If you ask me about a cultural issue, I'll come down on the same side as AOC, I'm sure, nine plus ten times out of ten.

02:57:11,266 --> 02:57:11,838
SPEAKER_0:  but I'll

02:57:12,258 --> 02:57:15,966
SPEAKER_0:  Try to root it into just basic, like, yeah, treat people with respect.

02:57:16,226 --> 02:57:18,750
SPEAKER_0:  you know, and they'll treat you with respect and that's a way we should

02:57:19,010 --> 02:57:24,702
SPEAKER_0:  government or civic sphere, you know, and we don't need to talk about, about intersectionality to, to I think get that.

02:57:26,306 --> 02:57:27,166
SPEAKER_0:  So there's that rhetoric.

02:57:28,290 --> 02:57:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  But she's not just a regular congressperson in a deep blue district, she's also a national and international.

02:57:34,754 --> 02:57:38,270
SPEAKER_0:  cultural and political figure, so she's now a spokesperson.

02:57:38,850 --> 02:57:44,318
SPEAKER_0:  because of large like a media event of her surprising upset election and her being

02:57:44,642 --> 02:57:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  you know, young and...

02:57:47,138 --> 02:57:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  being really connected to this post-Bernie.

02:57:49,698 --> 02:57:50,110
SPEAKER_0:  Moment.

02:57:50,914 --> 02:57:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  And I think.

02:57:52,162 --> 02:57:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  amid these constant attacks on her from the right.

02:57:55,522 --> 02:57:57,278
SPEAKER_0:  and also this media attention.

02:57:57,794 --> 02:57:59,454
SPEAKER_0:  And there's notoriety.

02:57:59,938 --> 02:58:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  she hasn't really modulated or adjusted her audience.

02:58:04,322 --> 02:58:07,614
SPEAKER_0:  her rhetoric and how do you win over someone who...

02:58:08,674 --> 02:58:13,630
SPEAKER_0:  really hates a lot of your ideas, but might actually believe in some of your policies.

02:58:14,722 --> 02:58:15,838
SPEAKER_0:  and...

02:58:16,258 --> 02:58:17,342
SPEAKER_0:  I think she's been.

02:58:18,146 --> 02:58:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:58:18,850 --> 02:58:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  ineffective, quite frankly, in the last year making that transition, whereas I think other politicians who are not so far left.

02:58:26,050 --> 02:58:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:58:26,818 --> 02:58:29,310
SPEAKER_0:  who don't identify as socialists, let's say at John Federman.

02:58:29,634 --> 02:58:37,278
SPEAKER_0:  has managed to become more effective. And I don't think it's a question of character or whatever else. And I like AOC, so I don't want to put it so...

02:58:37,602 --> 02:58:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  Harshly.

02:58:38,626 --> 02:58:43,646
SPEAKER_0:  But I think a lot of it has to do with her being a congressperson in a deep blue district and Federman.

02:58:44,226 --> 02:58:46,750
SPEAKER_0:  being running for statewide office in a...

02:58:47,042 --> 02:58:48,926
SPEAKER_0:  in a quote unquote purple state.

02:58:49,410 --> 02:58:49,822
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

02:58:50,370 --> 02:58:54,846
SPEAKER_0:  But at her best, at her best she does it. But it's like glimmers. It's kind of like, um...

02:58:55,394 --> 02:58:59,491
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, what sport are you biggest fan of? I'll give you a sports analogy. laughs

02:58:59,491 --> 02:59:04,478
SPEAKER_1:  I like the NFL. I mean, NFL is up there. If soccer is up there, but probably UFC.

02:59:04,770 --> 02:59:09,118
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, well, I can't give you a good analogy for any of those, but it's like a raw prospect.

02:59:09,602 --> 02:59:10,974
SPEAKER_0:  Like, you know, someone who...

02:59:11,618 --> 02:59:19,678
SPEAKER_0:  show is glimmers of hope so they were drafted really high and then they bounced from team to team and you're like I'm clinging on to my AOC stock but um

02:59:20,002 --> 02:59:20,862
SPEAKER_0:  But I think that...

02:59:21,602 --> 02:59:28,030
SPEAKER_0:  that she needs to be self-critical enough and her team needs to be self-critical enough to know that the goal is not merely to be a...

02:59:28,418 --> 02:59:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  national cultural figure.

02:59:30,210 --> 02:59:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  and win a re-election near Deep Blue District, the goal has to be to become.

02:59:33,890 --> 02:59:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  truly a national political figure which will require

02:59:37,474 --> 02:59:37,982
SPEAKER_0:  changes.

02:59:38,786 --> 02:59:39,902
SPEAKER_1:  A unifier.

02:59:40,130 --> 02:59:43,518
SPEAKER_1:  an inspiring figure about the ideas that she represents.

02:59:43,746 --> 02:59:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  Definitely, and she has other things against her like

02:59:46,434 --> 02:59:48,414
SPEAKER_0:  I'm obviously class focused, but there's no...

02:59:48,802 --> 02:59:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  denying I think that some of the hostility to her is sexism. It's rooted in I think people.

02:59:54,370 --> 02:59:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:59:55,042 --> 02:59:57,406
SPEAKER_0:  wanting to see her fail or whatever else, but that's only if-

02:59:57,634 --> 03:00:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  Some of it. Otherwise, it's her.

03:00:00,770 --> 03:00:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  struggling to relate to people who don't have a lot of her, her, you know, starting points as far as moral and ethical beliefs.

03:00:09,474 --> 03:00:13,886
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, but she's actually great at flourishing in all the all the

03:00:14,242 --> 03:00:19,867
SPEAKER_1:  attacks she's getting. She's doing a good job with that. And a lot of those attacks will break me if I'm being honest.

03:00:19,867 --> 03:00:21,367
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, that's- that's- that's the demon-

03:00:21,367 --> 03:00:22,814
SPEAKER_1:  of fire she's under.

03:00:23,458 --> 03:00:30,846
SPEAKER_1:  But you don't want that to become a drug to where you just get good at being a national figure that's constantly in the fights.

03:00:31,298 --> 03:00:34,718
SPEAKER_1:  and are using that for attention and so on, you still want to be the unifier.

03:00:35,074 --> 03:00:35,934
SPEAKER_1:  And that's the tricky.

03:00:36,162 --> 03:00:38,878
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think there's a chance there's a world?

03:00:39,394 --> 03:00:41,886
SPEAKER_1:  in which she's able to modulate it enough.

03:00:42,338 --> 03:00:44,254
SPEAKER_1:  to be a unifier and run for president.

03:00:46,146 --> 03:00:46,718
SPEAKER_1:  And when?

03:00:47,426 --> 03:00:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  I think she's very far away from being able to do that.

03:00:51,138 --> 03:00:52,734
SPEAKER_0:  I think that...

03:00:54,018 --> 03:00:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  even other politicians that are also polarizing within the squ-

03:00:58,178 --> 03:01:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  squad in terms of what they say or their ideas or whatever else.

03:01:01,762 --> 03:01:05,886
SPEAKER_0:  are very effective communicators like Ilhan Omar and others.

03:01:07,042 --> 03:01:07,422
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

03:01:07,682 --> 03:01:08,542
SPEAKER_0:  I think AOC.

03:01:08,834 --> 03:01:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, that's my hope, right? My hope is that someone like AOC could.

03:01:13,186 --> 03:01:15,646
SPEAKER_0:  The last year plus have not

03:01:15,906 --> 03:01:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  is not.

03:01:16,546 --> 03:01:16,990
SPEAKER_0:  been.

03:01:17,218 --> 03:01:20,414
SPEAKER_0:  extremely promising in my mind in part because

03:01:20,898 --> 03:01:24,478
SPEAKER_0:  She's continued to position herself as a lightning rod.

03:01:25,378 --> 03:01:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  cultural.

03:01:26,914 --> 03:01:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  speaker.

03:01:28,514 --> 03:01:31,902
SPEAKER_0:  Whereas, I think a national political figure needs to

03:01:32,322 --> 03:01:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  Pick their spots.

03:01:33,858 --> 03:01:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  and also pick their moment for changing their rhetoric and adjusting to their audience. And I think she does it in certain environments, but that needs to be your national.

03:01:43,106 --> 03:01:44,222
SPEAKER_0:  message when you're out there.

03:01:44,738 --> 03:01:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  You need to be speaking towards

03:01:47,394 --> 03:01:48,606
SPEAKER_0:  than not already.

03:01:48,962 --> 03:01:50,078
SPEAKER_0:  Um, converted.

03:01:50,658 --> 03:01:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  And I think Bernie does that. Bernie strips his politics down to the basics.

03:01:55,810 --> 03:01:57,054
SPEAKER_1:  So I agree with you.

03:01:57,698 --> 03:02:03,134
SPEAKER_1:  spiritually, but we also have an example of Donald Trump winning the presidency.

03:02:03,906 --> 03:02:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  isn't.

03:02:04,770 --> 03:02:05,470
SPEAKER_1:  some.

03:02:06,754 --> 03:02:10,910
SPEAKER_1:  isn't some of the game of politics that's separate from the policy?

03:02:11,746 --> 03:02:16,350
SPEAKER_1:  Being able to engage in rhetoric that leads to outrage.

03:02:16,802 --> 03:02:19,102
SPEAKER_1:  and then walking through that fire with grace.

03:02:21,090 --> 03:02:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  First of all, I think Trump is kind of a unique personality in American history, so it's hard to.

03:02:26,242 --> 03:02:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  to.

03:02:27,426 --> 03:02:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  to compare anyone to.

03:02:30,178 --> 03:02:33,758
SPEAKER_1:  But don't you think AOC is comparable in terms of the uniqueness?

03:02:34,466 --> 03:02:36,446
SPEAKER_1:  in the political system we're in or no.

03:02:36,898 --> 03:02:38,023
SPEAKER_1:  I think I think Trump.

03:02:38,023 --> 03:02:41,822
SPEAKER_0:  more of a firebrand anti-establishment force.

03:02:42,114 --> 03:02:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:02:43,970 --> 03:02:44,478
SPEAKER_0:  End that.

03:02:44,866 --> 03:02:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  And I mean this negatively.

03:02:46,242 --> 03:02:48,734
SPEAKER_0:  for what it's worth because I disagree with Trump.

03:02:49,122 --> 03:02:52,158
SPEAKER_0:  but he was willing to set fire to the Republican.

03:02:52,802 --> 03:02:53,278
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:02:53,794 --> 03:02:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  establishment, right?

03:02:55,234 --> 03:03:00,414
SPEAKER_0:  He was able to self-fund largely his campaign and he already was a media figure without them.

03:03:00,898 --> 03:03:09,342
SPEAKER_0:  AOC has been much more cautious with the Democratic Party establishment, in part because she is not trying to run a national political campaign right now.

03:03:09,570 --> 03:03:16,126
SPEAKER_0:  for the outside, like a 5% chance they're gonna be president. Let me set fire to everything. She's trying to help people and help her constituents.

03:03:16,450 --> 03:03:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  through the game of getting committee appointments and...

03:03:19,842 --> 03:03:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  you know, getting wins in the margins.

03:03:21,826 --> 03:03:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  And I think that's understandable.

03:03:23,842 --> 03:03:24,446
SPEAKER_0:  for what it's worth.

03:03:25,090 --> 03:03:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  But in the process, I think.

03:03:27,490 --> 03:03:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  What's the difference between AOC?

03:03:30,050 --> 03:03:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  and a progressive Democrat.

03:03:32,066 --> 03:03:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  During 2016, it used to be pretty easy to say the difference between the Bernie Krauts and a progressive Democrat, right? Because we were establishing our own.

03:03:39,138 --> 03:03:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  outside.

03:03:40,322 --> 03:03:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  Third force in American politics.

03:03:42,754 --> 03:03:50,846
SPEAKER_0:  were, you know, you could knock on the door of a lot of people who would end up voting for Trump and they would say, oh, I have a lot of respect for Bernie or whatever. They're still going to not vote for him.

03:03:52,482 --> 03:03:56,190
SPEAKER_0:  he wasn't considered part of the Democratic Party milieu.

03:03:56,642 --> 03:03:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:03:57,890 --> 03:04:04,094
SPEAKER_0:  I think now with AOC, there's a much closer association of AOC in our policies with ordinary AOC.

03:04:04,418 --> 03:04:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  Democrats.

03:04:06,178 --> 03:04:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  where she needs to draw stronger distinctions. She doesn't need to do it like Trump did with just...

03:04:11,874 --> 03:04:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  Man, I forgot all of them, though I found some of them amusing in the moment. Like all his nicknames about Lion Ted Cruz and then the rest, you know?

03:04:18,850 --> 03:04:19,294
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:04:20,066 --> 03:04:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  but I do feel like she needs to.

03:04:22,914 --> 03:04:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, differentiate herself a bit more, but then also just keep her language simple.

03:04:29,090 --> 03:04:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  Trump.

03:04:30,434 --> 03:04:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  was more complex than Bernie.

03:04:32,578 --> 03:04:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  in his literal language.

03:04:35,586 --> 03:04:39,902
SPEAKER_0:  but he was repetitive and there was kind of a rhythm and a cadence to Trump's speech.

03:04:40,322 --> 03:04:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  I think AOC needs to like Bernie.

03:04:43,106 --> 03:04:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  reduce her rhetoric down.

03:04:45,378 --> 03:04:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  to a couple key lines and signatures and focus her politics not on 20 issues, but on...

03:04:51,714 --> 03:04:52,478
SPEAKER_0:  three or four.

03:04:52,706 --> 03:04:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  most important issues and have that message discipline.

03:04:55,522 --> 03:04:58,046
SPEAKER_0:  Bernie will do an interview with you and he'll write down.

03:04:59,042 --> 03:05:00,990
SPEAKER_0:  I hope you do interview Bernie.

03:05:01,314 --> 03:05:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

03:05:01,954 --> 03:05:06,398
SPEAKER_0:  He'll write down like five things and I yeah, I'm only gonna talk about these five things

03:05:06,754 --> 03:05:09,379
SPEAKER_0:  Ask me about this? Okay, I'm talking about these five things.

03:05:09,379 --> 03:05:13,694
SPEAKER_1:  That's the message discipline that Bernie has been exemplary on. Yeah.

03:05:13,954 --> 03:05:15,079
SPEAKER_1:  But I think that's learned.

03:05:15,079 --> 03:05:17,982
SPEAKER_0:  And that could be developed. I think she could develop it. Listen, I hope-

03:05:18,274 --> 03:05:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  I'm answering your question, I think, not the way I should answer it.

03:05:21,378 --> 03:05:22,718
SPEAKER_0:  being someone, you know.

03:05:23,170 --> 03:05:24,574
SPEAKER_0:  Broadcasting too.

03:05:24,834 --> 03:05:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:05:25,730 --> 03:05:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  to people on the left and, you know, elsewhere.

03:05:30,882 --> 03:05:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:05:31,682 --> 03:05:33,310
SPEAKER_0:  I hope AOC goes in that direction.

03:05:33,762 --> 03:05:34,238
SPEAKER_0:  I just-

03:05:34,530 --> 03:05:35,134
SPEAKER_0:  Think that.

03:05:35,458 --> 03:05:37,822
SPEAKER_0:  she has a lot going against her just because she's...

03:05:38,178 --> 03:05:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  already a national figure.

03:05:41,122 --> 03:05:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  and she's in a deeper blue district.

03:05:43,842 --> 03:05:48,126
SPEAKER_0:  But we need to root our politics then in working class people and a lot of districts.

03:05:48,418 --> 03:05:48,862
SPEAKER_0:  Dead.

03:05:49,506 --> 03:05:51,006
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, the type of...

03:05:51,618 --> 03:05:53,470
SPEAKER_0:  Kitchen table conversations are...

03:05:53,698 --> 03:05:59,070
SPEAKER_0:  I hate that cliche, but I just used it. But a lot of these conversations are just different in their tone.

03:05:59,522 --> 03:06:09,278
SPEAKER_0:  and cadence and it's not just a question of, you know, Fetterman or Tim Ryan in Ohio and kind of just white working class voters. I mean, working class voters of any race.

03:06:09,730 --> 03:06:14,270
SPEAKER_0:  There's their day-to-day needs and the day-to-day things they want to talk about.

03:06:14,530 --> 03:06:15,230
SPEAKER_0:  It's just...

03:06:15,746 --> 03:06:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  at a different plane.

03:06:17,570 --> 03:06:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  Then...

03:06:18,498 --> 03:06:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  You know, uh...

03:06:19,682 --> 03:06:21,790
SPEAKER_0:  a Met Gala cultural statement.

03:06:22,754 --> 03:06:27,006
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, I mean it's clear that you respect and love her and would like to see how.

03:06:27,778 --> 03:06:32,958
SPEAKER_1:  different ways. I mean, she's young, so the different trajectories that she could develop that would ultimately

03:06:33,346 --> 03:06:35,742
SPEAKER_1:  make her a good candidate. I'm just looking odds here.

03:06:36,386 --> 03:06:40,382
SPEAKER_1:  and I disagree with them. I'm buying AOC stock here, given these odds.

03:06:40,866 --> 03:06:41,950
SPEAKER_1:  So.

03:06:42,178 --> 03:06:43,614
SPEAKER_1:  in terms of democratic.

03:06:43,906 --> 03:06:45,822
SPEAKER_1:  who's going to win the 2024 election.

03:06:46,050 --> 03:06:47,550
SPEAKER_1:  So that includes running and winning.

03:06:47,906 --> 03:06:51,550
SPEAKER_1:  On the Democrat side is 18% chance for Biden

03:06:51,970 --> 03:06:56,318
SPEAKER_1:  7% chance for Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom at 6%.

03:06:56,738 --> 03:06:59,358
SPEAKER_1:  Michelle Obama at 3%.

03:06:59,586 --> 03:07:03,838
SPEAKER_1:  Hillary Clinton at 2% and AOC at 1.5%.

03:07:04,258 --> 03:07:06,878
SPEAKER_1:  and then Bernie at 1%. So...

03:07:07,394 --> 03:07:10,590
SPEAKER_0:  I would not buy AOC at that mark. I would buy Biden like crazy though.

03:07:11,170 --> 03:07:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not a gambling man, but I would totally toss a...

03:07:15,170 --> 03:07:16,926
SPEAKER_0:  toss a G at Biden at that amount.

03:07:17,698 --> 03:07:19,870
SPEAKER_1:  AOC at 1.5% chance?

03:07:19,970 --> 03:07:22,846
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's I think it's I don't think she runs.

03:07:23,170 --> 03:07:25,045
SPEAKER_1:  You don't think she runs? Yeah, okay.

03:07:25,045 --> 03:07:28,542
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think Bernie will primary Biden either. I mean, he...

03:07:28,802 --> 03:07:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  And if Biden doesn't run, then obviously it's an open field. But I just feel like.

03:07:33,122 --> 03:07:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  Do you think Biden runs?

03:07:34,850 --> 03:07:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, I think Biden.

03:07:36,674 --> 03:07:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  properly runs.

03:07:39,650 --> 03:07:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

03:07:40,642 --> 03:07:46,334
SPEAKER_0:  He's an incumbent president, so it's very hard to imagine another Democrat being able to do better than him.

03:07:47,362 --> 03:07:49,790
SPEAKER_1:  All right, what about the competition?

03:07:50,626 --> 03:07:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  I think Donald Trump is the best thing for the Democrats.

03:07:54,530 --> 03:07:59,550
SPEAKER_0:  period just because it would create this turnout mechanism, this excitement around we have to stop Donald Trump.

03:08:00,258 --> 03:08:02,974
SPEAKER_0:  He's attacking DeSantis, I mean, already he's-

03:08:03,522 --> 03:08:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  He's trying to.

03:08:04,674 --> 03:08:07,358
SPEAKER_0:  you know, the sanctimonious thing.

03:08:08,226 --> 03:08:09,118
SPEAKER_0:  but yeah.

03:08:09,442 --> 03:08:14,814
SPEAKER_0:  He's, I kinda like, Trump's kinda like the Don King of American politics, you know?

03:08:15,362 --> 03:08:15,710
SPEAKER_1:  Heh.

03:08:15,938 --> 03:08:20,318
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's interesting what kind of dynamic chaos he's created.

03:08:21,026 --> 03:08:23,774
SPEAKER_1:  It probably led to more people being interested.

03:08:24,642 --> 03:08:25,662
SPEAKER_1:  in politics.

03:08:26,594 --> 03:08:31,646
SPEAKER_1:  Well, almost guaranteed it'll add to more people being interested in politics, but maybe not in a healthy way.

03:08:32,194 --> 03:08:35,166
SPEAKER_1:  maybe it created an unhealthy relationship with politics.

03:08:35,394 --> 03:08:37,246
SPEAKER_1:  where it created more partisanship.

03:08:38,178 --> 03:08:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  For me, I don't have a problem with partnership. It's what kind of partnership?

03:08:42,786 --> 03:08:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  So I think Trump has cultivated a lot of right populists, a relationship with his.

03:08:47,906 --> 03:08:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  supporters. It's almost like a leader follower relationship.

03:08:52,034 --> 03:08:56,606
SPEAKER_0:  in a way that doesn't actually enhance people's knowledge of politics and the issues.

03:08:56,834 --> 03:08:59,774
SPEAKER_0:  but actually just leads them to follow the party line.

03:09:00,450 --> 03:09:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  Ideally, I think socialist politics and politics on the left should be something different. Of course, there can be things that may and cannot be done in organized argument but I

03:09:07,298 --> 03:09:16,350
SPEAKER_0:  the great American socialist leader of the late 19th and early 20th century used to say, you know, I'm not your Moses. I can't promise to lead you to the.

03:09:16,674 --> 03:09:17,182
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:09:17,506 --> 03:09:18,206
SPEAKER_0:  Promise land.

03:09:18,882 --> 03:09:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  because if I can lead you there and you just follow me there, someone's just gonna lead you straight out as soon as I'm gone.

03:09:24,514 --> 03:09:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  And I think there's something nice about that kind of anti...

03:09:29,090 --> 03:09:29,438
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

03:09:29,730 --> 03:09:34,974
SPEAKER_0:  blind following leader follower kind of dynamic on the left at its best.

03:09:36,162 --> 03:09:37,790
SPEAKER_1:  That said, in the way.

03:09:38,626 --> 03:09:39,550
SPEAKER_1:  The...

03:09:39,938 --> 03:09:42,846
SPEAKER_1:  at least the political race in the United States, as turned out.

03:09:43,202 --> 03:09:44,478
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like.

03:09:44,706 --> 03:09:46,654
SPEAKER_1:  it's turned into a bit of entertainment.

03:09:47,298 --> 03:09:48,510
SPEAKER_1:  and they're having...

03:09:49,058 --> 03:09:52,798
SPEAKER_1:  personalities and characters is really important.

03:09:53,314 --> 03:09:58,526
SPEAKER_1:  So in terms of policy and actual leadership, yes, maybe having a leader.

03:09:59,426 --> 03:09:59,902
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:10:01,026 --> 03:10:03,678
SPEAKER_1:  Like an authoritarian big leader is not good.

03:10:03,970 --> 03:10:05,502
SPEAKER_1:  But maybe for the race it is.

03:10:06,210 --> 03:10:09,118
SPEAKER_1:  for the drama of it. You just want to have.

03:10:09,698 --> 03:10:11,230
SPEAKER_1:  drama and attention.

03:10:11,650 --> 03:10:14,206
SPEAKER_1:  on people who are actually going to turn out to be good leaders.

03:10:14,498 --> 03:10:15,934
SPEAKER_1:  That's a weird balance to strike.

03:10:16,258 --> 03:10:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, earned media is what they always talk about right and political campaigns like, you know, the more you could get on TV

03:10:22,754 --> 03:10:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:10:23,714 --> 03:10:24,158
SPEAKER_0:  The better.

03:10:24,386 --> 03:10:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  I really like Federman, he just won his campaign.

03:10:29,154 --> 03:10:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  but a good part of his early campaign.

03:10:31,202 --> 03:10:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  he had pivoted from talking about issues.

03:10:33,346 --> 03:10:35,774
SPEAKER_0:  to just talking about Dr. Oz living in New Jersey.

03:10:36,098 --> 03:10:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  and kind of having the troll campaign against him, which I found amusing.

03:10:39,650 --> 03:10:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  But also it was effective, obviously, one.

03:10:43,010 --> 03:10:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  Um, but it, you know, it's a bit.

03:10:44,770 --> 03:10:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  depressing because I would have rather a whole campaign cycle about

03:10:49,058 --> 03:10:52,478
SPEAKER_0:  healthcare and jobs and other issues.

03:10:53,730 --> 03:11:02,238
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, yeah, and the hope is that people just get better at that kind of social media communication. So I do actually think.

03:11:02,498 --> 03:11:05,406
SPEAKER_1:  There's something about doing political speeches.

03:11:05,762 --> 03:11:07,422
SPEAKER_1:  that makes you sound less authentic.

03:11:08,322 --> 03:11:09,534
SPEAKER_1:  because you have to like...

03:11:10,626 --> 03:11:11,774
SPEAKER_1:  to so many of them.

03:11:12,674 --> 03:11:17,054
SPEAKER_1:  It must be exhausting to like day after day after day, to make the speech.

03:11:17,730 --> 03:11:18,974
SPEAKER_1:  You're going to start.

03:11:19,490 --> 03:11:24,894
SPEAKER_1:  uh... to replaying the same stuff over and over as opposed to actually thinking about the words that are coming out of your mouth.

03:11:25,282 --> 03:11:28,766
SPEAKER_1:  and then the public will know that you're not really being that authentic.

03:11:29,026 --> 03:11:31,486
SPEAKER_1:  Even though you believe those things, it's just tough.

03:11:31,938 --> 03:11:33,598
SPEAKER_1:  I just wish they didn't have to do...

03:11:33,954 --> 03:11:35,079
SPEAKER_1:  I constantly do speeches.

03:11:35,079 --> 03:11:35,870
SPEAKER_0:  So I think that

03:11:36,226 --> 03:11:37,566
SPEAKER_0:  The fact that Bernie's.

03:11:38,434 --> 03:11:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  speeches very clearly came out of, if not directly, his own pen, but his own rhetoric over the years. And he kind of wrote it seemed authentic. Yes. Even if he was repeating it.

03:11:46,882 --> 03:11:51,134
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and then Trump has just wild improvisation. I think people found.

03:11:51,746 --> 03:11:58,622
SPEAKER_0:  real, you know, in a certain way. And I would love for the left more generally to tap into some of that anti-establishment.

03:11:59,010 --> 03:11:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  sentiment.

03:12:00,290 --> 03:12:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  but obviously do in a way that's productive that doesn't blame immigrants or whatever else for problems.

03:12:05,762 --> 03:12:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  you know, it is kind of built on a different basis, but.

03:12:09,282 --> 03:12:13,310
SPEAKER_0:  People are fed up for good reason with a lot of conventional politics and we

03:12:13,890 --> 03:12:15,134
SPEAKER_0:  Need to speak to that.

03:12:15,522 --> 03:12:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  Otherwise it'll only be the right that is taking advantage of.

03:12:19,170 --> 03:12:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  those people's anger.

03:12:21,698 --> 03:12:26,974
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I almost forgot to ask you about China. So both historically we talked about the Soviet Union.

03:12:27,522 --> 03:12:31,294
SPEAKER_1:  But what lessons do you draw from the implementation of socialism and communism?

03:12:31,682 --> 03:12:32,126
SPEAKER_1:  in

03:12:32,674 --> 03:12:35,454
SPEAKER_1:  Maoist China and modern China.

03:12:35,810 --> 03:12:37,342
SPEAKER_1:  What's the good and the bad?

03:12:38,018 --> 03:12:41,246
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I think it's very similar to the Soviet case.

03:12:41,506 --> 03:12:41,918
SPEAKER_0:  and that.

03:12:42,658 --> 03:12:44,510
SPEAKER_0:  Socialism came to China.

03:12:44,738 --> 03:12:45,246
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:12:46,626 --> 03:12:48,702
SPEAKER_0:  through not a base of organized.

03:12:49,250 --> 03:12:53,630
SPEAKER_0:  workers and a capitalist country at a certain level of development and so on.

03:12:54,146 --> 03:12:56,062
SPEAKER_0:  but it came through the countryside.

03:12:56,482 --> 03:12:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  and in conditions.

03:12:58,274 --> 03:12:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:12:59,042 --> 03:13:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  Civil War.

03:13:00,802 --> 03:13:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  strife, your Japanese invasion, and whatever else. And Mao built his base in the peasantry.

03:13:06,338 --> 03:13:07,870
SPEAKER_0:  I then came down to the city.

03:13:08,450 --> 03:13:09,150
SPEAKER_0:  to govern.

03:13:10,114 --> 03:13:11,678
SPEAKER_0:  Try to build a bass and rule over.

03:13:11,970 --> 03:13:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  workers.

03:13:13,090 --> 03:13:15,294
SPEAKER_0:  So it was kind of an inversion of classic.

03:13:15,906 --> 03:13:16,606
SPEAKER_0:  Socialist.

03:13:16,866 --> 03:13:17,598
SPEAKER_0:  theory.

03:13:18,562 --> 03:13:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  Now, the same thing that I said before about Stalin and assessing the Soviet Union has to apply here.

03:13:23,426 --> 03:13:26,942
SPEAKER_0:  Because obviously, I oppose authoritarianism and I...

03:13:27,394 --> 03:13:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  Obviously, there's all sorts of more I can-

03:13:29,442 --> 03:13:32,126
SPEAKER_0:  Condemnations, I should do.

03:13:32,642 --> 03:13:33,022
SPEAKER_0:  But.

03:13:33,570 --> 03:13:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  to look at.

03:13:34,402 --> 03:13:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  What

03:13:35,490 --> 03:13:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  the Chinese Communist Party.

03:13:37,154 --> 03:13:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  actually accomplished.

03:13:39,138 --> 03:13:40,446
SPEAKER_0:  I think we kind of need to take aim.

03:13:40,930 --> 03:13:41,918
SPEAKER_0:  Step backwards.

03:13:42,466 --> 03:13:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  from our moral opposition to the means in which they accomplish it and just look at it developmentally.

03:13:48,802 --> 03:13:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  China.

03:13:49,922 --> 03:13:50,718
SPEAKER_0:  benefited.

03:13:51,170 --> 03:13:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  greatly.

03:13:52,162 --> 03:13:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  from the Communist Party's implementation of

03:13:55,778 --> 03:13:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  basic education and healthcare.

03:13:58,722 --> 03:14:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  So in a lot of China, you had one of the conditions women were absolutely terrible. There was still foot binding and all sorts of like terrible backward practice.

03:14:08,802 --> 03:14:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  You had a huge vast majority of the population that was illiterate without any access to basic education and you had no

03:14:15,202 --> 03:14:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  health access, especially on the country side.

03:14:17,922 --> 03:14:20,222
SPEAKER_0:  So those are the three good things that China did.

03:14:20,450 --> 03:14:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  improve their...

03:14:22,146 --> 03:14:23,550
SPEAKER_0:  status of women.

03:14:23,842 --> 03:14:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  get everyone into primary education and improve the lot of healthcare.

03:14:31,138 --> 03:14:32,574
SPEAKER_0:  Besides for that.

03:14:33,154 --> 03:14:39,710
SPEAKER_0:  Their agricultural campaign was a failure, just like Stalin's for many of the same reasons I mentioned before.

03:14:40,258 --> 03:14:40,798
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:14:41,218 --> 03:14:46,334
SPEAKER_0:  the Great Leap Forward and crash industrialization didn't really work.

03:14:47,266 --> 03:14:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  Either.

03:14:48,354 --> 03:14:48,958
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:14:49,346 --> 03:14:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  in a way is trying to better.

03:14:52,002 --> 03:14:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  than India or other.

03:14:54,274 --> 03:14:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  um, contras.

03:14:57,154 --> 03:15:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  didn't have the basic education and the strong state authority and and

03:15:02,466 --> 03:15:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  the health improvements and whatever.

03:15:05,474 --> 03:15:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  I think maybe.

03:15:06,882 --> 03:15:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  But I think that's why we need this.

03:15:08,706 --> 03:15:10,206
SPEAKER_0:  sometimes go beyond just...

03:15:10,818 --> 03:15:11,646
SPEAKER_0:  Economic.

03:15:11,874 --> 03:15:13,086
SPEAKER_0:  Measures of success.

03:15:13,890 --> 03:15:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  Because if you told me tomorrow, the US will grow at 3% if we maintain democracy.

03:15:20,162 --> 03:15:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  but it'll grow at eight, nine percent. Everyone will be wealthier if we move to some sort of authoritarian government.

03:15:26,114 --> 03:15:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  I think.

03:15:27,362 --> 03:15:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  you're asking the wrong question if you're gonna make your decision based on growth, right? Because it has to be based on some sort of principle.

03:15:33,378 --> 03:15:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  but the same dynamic of.

03:15:35,522 --> 03:15:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  from the beginning of the Chinese Communist Party.

03:15:37,634 --> 03:15:42,526
SPEAKER_0:  ruling over people emerging from the outside through armed conflicts and ruling over

03:15:42,786 --> 03:15:45,214
SPEAKER_0:  ordinary Chinese people have continued.

03:15:45,954 --> 03:15:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  Since Deng Xiaoping, the policies have been better economically.

03:15:49,922 --> 03:15:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  Often at times.

03:15:51,170 --> 03:15:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  Not always.

03:15:52,194 --> 03:15:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  The technocratic governance has been...

03:15:54,434 --> 03:15:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  You know, quite good.

03:15:55,778 --> 03:15:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  But that doesn't.

03:15:56,642 --> 03:15:57,246
SPEAKER_0:  Mean that.

03:15:57,986 --> 03:16:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  the party has a democratic mandate or has the

03:16:01,730 --> 03:16:04,958
SPEAKER_0:  should have the right to govern as they see fit.

03:16:05,442 --> 03:16:12,478
SPEAKER_0:  because clearly it doesn't have that mandate in swaths of the country or in places like kong kong or elsewhere.

03:16:13,122 --> 03:16:13,694
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:16:14,146 --> 03:16:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  but.

03:16:14,754 --> 03:16:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  to me.

03:16:17,186 --> 03:16:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  nothing the Chinese Communist Party does has anything to do with socialism. I think even by their own definition today, it really doesn't.

03:16:23,810 --> 03:16:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  Um, it's a-

03:16:25,442 --> 03:16:26,526
SPEAKER_0:  sort of nationalists.

03:16:27,010 --> 03:16:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  Authoritarian Developmental State.

03:16:29,410 --> 03:16:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  that has done.

03:16:30,754 --> 03:16:33,982
SPEAKER_0:  some good things to improve the living standards of the Chinese people.

03:16:34,530 --> 03:16:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  other things that were counterproductive.

03:16:36,674 --> 03:16:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  And, um...

03:16:38,114 --> 03:16:39,742
SPEAKER_0:  you know, as a democratic socialist.

03:16:40,354 --> 03:16:40,894
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I...

03:16:41,186 --> 03:16:42,494
SPEAKER_0:  I certainly don't support.

03:16:42,914 --> 03:16:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  that state but I also hope that.

03:16:45,154 --> 03:16:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  the US and Biden will find a way to

03:16:47,586 --> 03:16:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  Avoid

03:16:49,826 --> 03:16:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  you know, intense rivalry and competition economically, spilling over into

03:16:54,498 --> 03:16:55,166
SPEAKER_0:  Something worse.

03:16:55,810 --> 03:16:58,142
SPEAKER_1:  from a democratic socialist perspective.

03:16:58,850 --> 03:17:01,150
SPEAKER_1:  What's one policy or?

03:17:01,666 --> 03:17:05,790
SPEAKER_1:  one or two ways you could fix, if you could fix china, if you took over china.

03:17:06,114 --> 03:17:07,239
SPEAKER_1:  Or would you like to see the change?

03:17:07,239 --> 03:17:14,558
SPEAKER_0:  Well, the democratic part comes before the socialist part. So I would say there needs to be multi-party elections in China.

03:17:14,914 --> 03:17:15,582
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:17:15,874 --> 03:17:16,958
SPEAKER_0:  state.

03:17:17,218 --> 03:17:20,478
SPEAKER_0:  censorship and control over the press, in other words, needs to be.

03:17:20,930 --> 03:17:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  be done with.

03:17:22,370 --> 03:17:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  As far as her.

03:17:23,394 --> 03:17:24,670
SPEAKER_0:  immediate economic.

03:17:24,898 --> 03:17:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  um, policy.

03:17:26,818 --> 03:17:28,702
SPEAKER_0:  I think the idea of maintaining...

03:17:28,930 --> 03:17:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  strong state control of certain, you know, commanding heights of the economy while liberalizing other spheres

03:17:35,138 --> 03:17:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  has done quite well.

03:17:36,898 --> 03:17:39,870
SPEAKER_0:  in China's case, lifting people out of poverty.

03:17:40,450 --> 03:17:41,086
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:17:41,666 --> 03:17:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  But again, you know.

03:17:43,618 --> 03:17:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  there's something really lost in society, even if it's getting wealthier.

03:17:47,650 --> 03:17:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  If you're a great

03:17:50,114 --> 03:17:52,670
SPEAKER_0:  if ordinary people don't have the ability to.

03:17:53,154 --> 03:17:53,694
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:17:53,922 --> 03:17:55,358
SPEAKER_0:  participate in.

03:17:55,842 --> 03:17:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  dissent, really.

03:17:57,826 --> 03:18:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  and the Chinese authorities have allowed some, you know, it's not North Korea. It's not a totally totalitarian state.

03:18:03,682 --> 03:18:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  There's been workplace protests, there have been all sorts of local anti-corruption protests and things like that.

03:18:10,466 --> 03:18:14,398
SPEAKER_0:  but it's up to the government to decide what's permitted and what's not at what particular moment.

03:18:14,978 --> 03:18:17,438
SPEAKER_0:  And I think the long run.

03:18:18,146 --> 03:18:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  even if it can survive.

03:18:19,874 --> 03:18:20,446
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:18:21,442 --> 03:18:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  there's a better way to do things, which is quite simply a democracy.

03:18:27,234 --> 03:18:29,278
SPEAKER_1:  The thing is though, the lessons of history...

03:18:29,634 --> 03:18:30,974
SPEAKER_1:  China is looking at

03:18:31,554 --> 03:18:33,086
SPEAKER_1:  This is Dark Aspect.

03:18:33,954 --> 03:18:37,566
SPEAKER_1:  So building on top of the fact that it seems like under Stalin.

03:18:38,018 --> 03:18:42,302
SPEAKER_1:  and under Mao, under Stalin the Soviet Union and under Mao China.

03:18:42,626 --> 03:18:44,254
SPEAKER_1:  has seen a lot of economic growth.

03:18:45,122 --> 03:18:47,934
SPEAKER_1:  and then one dark aspect of that.

03:18:48,706 --> 03:18:51,262
SPEAKER_1:  while under the great leap forward you've...

03:18:51,490 --> 03:18:51,838
SPEAKER_1:  You know?

03:18:52,226 --> 03:18:54,590
SPEAKER_1:  upwards of 70 million people dead.

03:18:57,282 --> 03:18:58,046
SPEAKER_1:  today.

03:18:58,338 --> 03:19:02,590
SPEAKER_1:  I think there's a large number of people who admire Stalin and admire Mao.

03:19:03,906 --> 03:19:05,918
SPEAKER_0:  What they admire is the stability.

03:19:06,242 --> 03:19:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  and the strong leadership.

03:19:07,746 --> 03:19:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  So, and there's a lot of people who miss the Soviet Union.

03:19:10,882 --> 03:19:11,198
SPEAKER_0:  Right.

03:19:11,714 --> 03:19:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  The reason why they miss it is that

03:19:13,954 --> 03:19:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  It was a system they knew.

03:19:15,458 --> 03:19:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  it provided the basics of their livelihood.

03:19:18,498 --> 03:19:25,310
SPEAKER_0:  Then afterwards, look at Russia in the 90s, people were in chaos. The communist party had a huge amount of support democratically.

03:19:25,538 --> 03:19:28,894
SPEAKER_0:  anti-democratic measures had to be taken ironically against the Communist Party.

03:19:29,602 --> 03:19:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  to keep it from regaining more of a foothold in Russia.

03:19:36,706 --> 03:19:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  We don't need that trade-off.

03:19:38,370 --> 03:19:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  you know, we could have a form of.

03:19:41,634 --> 03:19:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:19:43,010 --> 03:19:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  Imagine if Russia went to a system.

03:19:45,602 --> 03:19:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  closer to social democracy.

03:19:47,650 --> 03:19:49,246
SPEAKER_0:  that maintained.

03:19:49,474 --> 03:19:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  the stability that people wanted, the welfare state that people wanted, but restructured the economy in not a shock way, but in a way that...

03:19:58,082 --> 03:20:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  that made sense and that ordinary people felt ownership of instead of just oligarchs who were former Communist Party bureaucracy just dividing up the country for themselves.

03:20:06,370 --> 03:20:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:20:07,138 --> 03:20:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  I think the same thing in China.

03:20:08,994 --> 03:20:09,342
SPEAKER_0:  Thank you.

03:20:09,570 --> 03:20:10,558
SPEAKER_0:  First of all, certainly from...

03:20:11,362 --> 03:20:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  the West.

03:20:13,378 --> 03:20:14,782
SPEAKER_0:  you know, the US government.

03:20:15,074 --> 03:20:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  and people in the US should have no say over what should happen in China.

03:20:20,546 --> 03:20:25,150
SPEAKER_0:  the Chinese Communist Party has more authentic authority than any of us.

03:20:25,410 --> 03:20:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  do in the country.

03:20:26,882 --> 03:20:27,422
SPEAKER_0:  But

03:20:28,578 --> 03:20:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I think that...

03:20:30,242 --> 03:20:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  the fears and stability that a lot of Chinese people have.

03:20:33,346 --> 03:20:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  why I would imagine that even in a democratic election.

03:20:36,738 --> 03:20:40,862
SPEAKER_0:  the Communist Party might have majority support.

03:20:41,666 --> 03:20:46,430
SPEAKER_0:  is because they fear the unknown, they fear collapse. That was one of the big lessons of the Soviet.

03:20:46,786 --> 03:20:47,486
SPEAKER_0: RLAPS, right?

03:20:48,162 --> 03:20:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  Do you want trying to divide it into five, six?

03:20:51,106 --> 03:20:58,110
SPEAKER_0:  states, you know, do you want economic turmoil? Do you want mass immediate privatization? Do you want

03:20:58,338 --> 03:21:00,606
SPEAKER_0:  whatever welfare state you have.

03:21:01,186 --> 03:21:02,398
SPEAKER_0:  destroyed, and so on.

03:21:03,170 --> 03:21:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  I think people are right to have those fears.

03:21:05,698 --> 03:21:07,134
SPEAKER_0:  but there's a different route.

03:21:07,490 --> 03:21:08,830
SPEAKER_0:  towards democratization.

03:21:09,218 --> 03:21:14,078
SPEAKER_0:  that maintain stability, right? There's different routes that you could have.

03:21:14,658 --> 03:21:15,646
SPEAKER_0:  democracy.

03:21:15,874 --> 03:21:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  Not every country had to go down the route of Yugoslavia and the USSR and so on.

03:21:24,002 --> 03:21:27,966
SPEAKER_1:  You are the founder of the magazine Jacobin.

03:21:28,642 --> 03:21:30,110
SPEAKER_1:  of which I am a subsc...

03:21:30,562 --> 03:21:34,814
SPEAKER_1:  I recommend everybody subscribe whether you're on the left or the right.

03:21:35,458 --> 03:21:38,558
SPEAKER_1:  The magazine does tend to lean left.

03:21:38,946 --> 03:21:40,821
SPEAKER_1:  Does it officially say it's socialist?

03:21:40,821 --> 03:21:49,822
SPEAKER_0:  We're a socialist publication. We try to be interesting. So we try to have articles that have debates and contestation and whatever else. We're definitely.

03:21:50,050 --> 03:21:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  We're all socialists.

03:21:52,034 --> 03:21:56,478
SPEAKER_1:  Well, it's a lot of really interesting articles, so I definitely recommend that people subscribe.

03:21:56,706 --> 03:21:57,406
SPEAKER_1:  support.

03:21:57,826 --> 03:21:58,878
SPEAKER_1:  I only...

03:21:59,554 --> 03:22:01,822
SPEAKER_1:  like the, like, uh...

03:22:02,050 --> 03:22:05,374
SPEAKER_1:  The product of the 21st century. Only subscribe to the digital version.

03:22:05,666 --> 03:22:06,791
SPEAKER_1:  But I guess there's also people.

03:22:06,791 --> 03:22:10,046
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, there's like 70,000 subscribers in print.

03:22:10,498 --> 03:22:11,230
SPEAKER_1:  in print.

03:22:11,714 --> 03:22:15,839
SPEAKER_1:  does it come back on a scroll i don't even know the paper do they know wallpaper

03:22:15,839 --> 03:22:24,926
SPEAKER_0:  I'm going to mail you a bunch of copies. No, it's perfect bound. It's long issues. Our Jackman's publisher, RoommateK4, recently did a redesign.

03:22:25,474 --> 03:22:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  of the publication, so it looks really good. It's up there in the design.

03:22:30,754 --> 03:22:31,294
SPEAKER_0:  award.

03:22:31,554 --> 03:22:33,429
SPEAKER_0:  Competition range. It's nice. It's sec.

03:22:33,429 --> 03:22:34,174
SPEAKER_1:  See

03:22:34,562 --> 03:22:36,894
SPEAKER_1:  I can show it off to all my friends, look.

03:22:37,250 --> 03:22:39,125
SPEAKER_0:  Put it in your coffee table, you don't even have to read it.

03:22:39,125 --> 03:22:43,454
SPEAKER_1:  First I need to get a coffee table, but yes, I'll get both. That's what respectable do- listen.

03:22:43,746 --> 03:22:45,374
SPEAKER_1:  I've upgraded my life.

03:22:45,954 --> 03:22:48,062
SPEAKER_1:  I haven't had a couch, I don't think ever.

03:22:48,418 --> 03:22:54,942
SPEAKER_1:  So I got a couch recently because somebody told me that serious adults have a couch. And I also got a TV because serious adults...

03:22:55,234 --> 03:23:00,510
SPEAKER_1:  have a couch and a TV and as you see, it's been here for many months and I still haven't like unboxed it so...

03:23:00,930 --> 03:23:04,734
SPEAKER_1:  I'm trying to learn how to be an adult looking up.

03:23:05,314 --> 03:23:07,998
SPEAKER_1:  on YouTube how to be an adult and learning slowly.

03:23:08,546 --> 03:23:15,913
SPEAKER_1:  After that, I'll look into this whole leisure thing. Anyway, what's the origin of Jacobin? What was the idea? What's the mission and what's the origin?

03:23:15,913 --> 03:23:17,982
SPEAKER_0:  So I started Jackman when I was

03:23:18,434 --> 03:23:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  between my sophomore and junior year of college.

03:23:21,730 --> 03:23:26,462
SPEAKER_0:  Basically, I was already a socialist. I was involved in the Democratic Socialist of America. I was, um...

03:23:27,618 --> 03:23:29,726
SPEAKER_0:  in the youth section, the young democratic socialists.

03:23:30,242 --> 03:23:35,326
SPEAKER_0:  I was editing their youth online magazine called The Activists back then.

03:23:36,034 --> 03:23:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  And to be honest, I had my ideology, I had my views, I had a group of people around me.

03:23:41,698 --> 03:23:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  we would debate together and occasionally write for this other publication, The Activist, and so on.

03:23:47,618 --> 03:23:48,190
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:23:49,218 --> 03:23:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, just a product of creative ignorance in the sense that.

03:23:52,482 --> 03:23:57,694
SPEAKER_0:  I knew I had the capacity to maybe pull off an issue or two. I just had no idea how long I would keep doing it.

03:23:57,986 --> 03:24:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  you know, and I'd just eventually consume my life slowly.

03:24:01,186 --> 03:24:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  But Shirley, like I had...

03:24:03,170 --> 03:24:07,454
SPEAKER_0:  different plans for my future, kind of, you know, but I ended up, um...

03:24:08,130 --> 03:24:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  just being a magazine publisher. I literally didn't know what a magazine publisher was.

03:24:12,194 --> 03:24:14,069
SPEAKER_0:  but it just kinda happened. what's so hard about

03:24:14,069 --> 03:24:15,838
SPEAKER_1:  hardest part about running a magazine.

03:24:17,314 --> 03:24:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  Well, the hardest part is obviously the things, just like any enterprise, right? The things beyond your control, like you could put out something that you think is great.

03:24:26,210 --> 03:24:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  or interesting, but then you need the feedback of people actually subscribing.

03:24:32,354 --> 03:24:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  and you occasionally encounter periods where you feel like you're doing your best work, but you're not getting there.

03:24:37,218 --> 03:24:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  the audience response?

03:24:39,138 --> 03:24:40,862
SPEAKER_0:  And I think you just need the kind of.

03:24:42,306 --> 03:24:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  the self-confidence to just keep.

03:24:44,802 --> 03:24:45,310
SPEAKER_0:  Doing it?

03:24:45,922 --> 03:24:46,494
SPEAKER_0:  And obviously...

03:24:46,946 --> 03:24:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  If you're...

03:24:48,194 --> 03:24:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  Totally obscure and crazy and way off the mark. You're never gonna build that.

03:24:52,066 --> 03:24:52,798
SPEAKER_0:  That audience.

03:24:53,474 --> 03:25:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  But I think a lot of publications have tried to, same thing I guess goes with YouTube shows, whatever else, they try to adapt to what everyone else is doing right away when they don't achieve success.

03:25:03,426 --> 03:25:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  Whereas for me, the early issues of Jackman got very little resonance and took a while for it to...

03:25:08,226 --> 03:25:09,406
SPEAKER_0:  build into something.

03:25:09,858 --> 03:25:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  but a lot of it was just the confidence to just keep going and keep publishing what I would wanna read and just hope that I'm not so much of a weirdo.

03:25:17,090 --> 03:25:17,982
SPEAKER_0:  that I'm the only one.

03:25:19,010 --> 03:25:19,614
SPEAKER_1:  uh

03:25:20,162 --> 03:25:24,190
SPEAKER_1:  Is there some pressure that you could speak to of audience capture?

03:25:24,834 --> 03:25:26,974
SPEAKER_1:  because it is a socialist publication.

03:25:27,650 --> 03:25:28,958
SPEAKER_1:  You have a fan base.

03:25:29,474 --> 03:25:30,590
SPEAKER_1:  A readership base.

03:25:31,522 --> 03:25:36,062
SPEAKER_1:  Is there times you feel pressured not to say a certain thing, not to call out bullshit?

03:25:36,738 --> 03:25:37,342
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:25:37,666 --> 03:25:39,134
SPEAKER_1:  not to criticize.

03:25:39,682 --> 03:25:41,598
SPEAKER_1:  certain candidates, all that kind of stuff.

03:25:42,498 --> 03:25:44,926
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, definitely. Of course. You know, I, um...

03:25:45,378 --> 03:25:50,558
SPEAKER_0:  I myself am looser on the self-censorship than other people. It's only because I-

03:25:51,682 --> 03:25:53,790
SPEAKER_0:  gotten this far.

03:25:54,338 --> 03:26:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  just shooting from the hip or whatever. And occasionally, you know, you'll come to a rash judgment, right? You'll speak too soon or complain about something too soon and you'll-

03:26:03,874 --> 03:26:04,638
SPEAKER_0:  have to kinda...

03:26:04,962 --> 03:26:09,598
SPEAKER_0:  either apologize or reconsider whatever else. But on a host of issues.

03:26:10,114 --> 03:26:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I have views that maybe not all of the left.

03:26:13,058 --> 03:26:16,350
SPEAKER_0:  has, but I know that the core of my politics is.

03:26:16,642 --> 03:26:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  politics against.

03:26:18,562 --> 03:26:22,014
SPEAKER_0:  Oppression against exploitation against all the things that we we talked about

03:26:22,242 --> 03:26:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  And if you know that's at the core of your politics.

03:26:24,450 --> 03:26:25,630
SPEAKER_0:  then you could maybe say...

03:26:26,338 --> 03:26:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  You know what, I don't think.

03:26:27,906 --> 03:26:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  the left should...

03:26:30,306 --> 03:26:36,478
SPEAKER_0:  should respond to the real racism that's still around in the world by adopting like an excessively racialized rhetoric if that makes sense.

03:26:36,962 --> 03:26:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  the guy fundamentally just...

03:26:38,690 --> 03:26:40,862
SPEAKER_0:  I'm a Universalist and I believe that

03:26:41,762 --> 03:26:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  people, no matter where their backgrounds are and so on, kind of want the same things themselves and for their

03:26:47,938 --> 03:26:48,670
SPEAKER_0:  for their families.

03:26:49,410 --> 03:26:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  And I feel like a lot of the...

03:26:52,770 --> 03:26:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  left or some of the left, not even the far left, more like the center left.

03:26:57,154 --> 03:26:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  has adopted.

03:26:58,882 --> 03:27:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  of a stand saying, oh, we need to talk about white privilege or...

03:27:03,010 --> 03:27:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

03:27:03,810 --> 03:27:12,606
SPEAKER_0:  white Karens or white guys or old white guys doing this or whatever else. To me, it's not only wrong in a moral sense, but it's counterproductive.

03:27:12,994 --> 03:27:15,070
SPEAKER_0:  Because the last thing I want is a young...

03:27:15,554 --> 03:27:16,862
SPEAKER_0:  White teenager.

03:27:17,570 --> 03:27:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  who, um...

03:27:19,266 --> 03:27:21,598
SPEAKER_0:  you know, feels unrepresented politically.

03:27:21,826 --> 03:27:24,126
SPEAKER_0:  and wants to be a part of maybe even the left.

03:27:24,578 --> 03:27:25,982
SPEAKER_0:  to feel like...

03:27:26,594 --> 03:27:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  like, oh, I should think more about my identity. No, the whole point of anti-racist politics is that we want to live in a world where...

03:27:33,442 --> 03:27:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

03:27:34,338 --> 03:27:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:27:35,362 --> 03:27:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  You know, me and you can go around the corner and get a bear, and we're not, you know, people of two different races getting a bear with just two.

03:27:42,722 --> 03:27:45,630
SPEAKER_0:  you know guys in America eating bear you know it just we're trying to get

03:27:46,178 --> 03:27:49,758
SPEAKER_0:  have the type of society in which there's less of that sort of.

03:27:50,242 --> 03:27:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  communal or racialized identity.

03:27:53,058 --> 03:27:56,030
SPEAKER_0:  And that was a whole point of a whole generation of anti-racist struggle.

03:27:56,514 --> 03:27:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  But now...

03:27:57,570 --> 03:27:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  we seem to be.

03:28:00,642 --> 03:28:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  Reifying it in the media and in culture and in politics and that's that's one issue where I've been kind of Banging the drum on this to the point that it's it's annoying in certain parts of the left. I don't think there's

03:28:11,810 --> 03:28:22,014
SPEAKER_0:  maybe extreme opposition among socialists, but it's more like a, why do you keep focusing on this? Let's focus on our real enemy, the right, instead of criticizing, you know, this part of.

03:28:22,210 --> 03:28:25,790
SPEAKER_1:  No, I think it's really, I'm really glad you exist. I'm really-

03:28:26,082 --> 03:28:27,678
SPEAKER_1:  glad you're beating that drum because

03:28:28,130 --> 03:28:30,238
SPEAKER_1:  I think that's one of the...

03:28:31,170 --> 03:28:34,910
SPEAKER_1:  one of the reasons that the left has not had a broader impact.

03:28:35,490 --> 03:28:37,758
SPEAKER_1:  or is not heard by more people.

03:28:38,338 --> 03:28:39,486
SPEAKER_1:  could hear its message.

03:28:39,810 --> 03:28:41,310
SPEAKER_1:  is because the othering.

03:28:41,922 --> 03:28:43,166
SPEAKER_1:  The other thing of...

03:28:43,490 --> 03:28:45,150
SPEAKER_1:  Like as if there's a...

03:28:45,538 --> 03:28:48,414
SPEAKER_1:  there's two teams as if it's black and white.

03:28:48,770 --> 03:28:52,542
SPEAKER_1:  as opposed to having there's a common humanity and a common struggle amongst all of us.

03:28:53,186 --> 03:28:55,038
SPEAKER_1:  uh... you you also wrote

03:28:56,226 --> 03:28:59,230
SPEAKER_1:  the book that we mentioned a few times, The Socialist Manifesto.

03:29:00,034 --> 03:29:03,454
SPEAKER_1:  the case for radical politics in an era of extreme inequality.

03:29:03,682 --> 03:29:05,534
SPEAKER_1:  What's the framework? What are the caddies of the book?

03:29:06,370 --> 03:29:09,694
SPEAKER_0:  So a lot of it's a look at socialism's past.

03:29:09,954 --> 03:29:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:29:10,754 --> 03:29:15,582
SPEAKER_0:  present and future, basically. So a lot of it is historical. The opening chapter.

03:29:16,034 --> 03:29:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  uses a...

03:29:18,114 --> 03:29:23,614
SPEAKER_0:  Pasta sauce factory is a way to explain certain Marxist concepts, but also a theory of change like how we get

03:29:24,354 --> 03:29:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  from.

03:29:25,218 --> 03:29:26,110
SPEAKER_0:  Let's say pure.

03:29:26,370 --> 03:29:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  Capitalism to more regulated.

03:29:28,930 --> 03:29:31,614
SPEAKER_0:  unionized and social democratic systems.

03:29:32,130 --> 03:29:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  and then beyond social democracy into my vision of socialism. That's kind of the first little bit. It's like a visionary.

03:29:38,690 --> 03:29:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  Kind of like, look at that.

03:29:40,514 --> 03:29:41,758
SPEAKER_0:  The future of socialism.

03:29:42,274 --> 03:29:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  But then I try to explain why some of the past social movements have gone wrong.

03:29:46,818 --> 03:29:51,838
SPEAKER_0:  because I think we can't take for granted. I think a lot of people want to live in a different or better society.

03:29:52,386 --> 03:29:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  but they look at past examples and they're skeptical.

03:29:54,658 --> 03:29:56,958
SPEAKER_0:  And I think there's good reason for skepticism.

03:29:57,218 --> 03:29:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  So.

03:29:58,114 --> 03:29:59,902
SPEAKER_0:  I tried to explain both.

03:30:00,450 --> 03:30:03,358
SPEAKER_0:  the successes of certain systems like social democracy.

03:30:03,586 --> 03:30:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  but also what happened in Russia, China.

03:30:05,986 --> 03:30:08,862
SPEAKER_0:  and kind of more of a historical overview.

03:30:09,666 --> 03:30:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  are then.

03:30:11,650 --> 03:30:12,862
SPEAKER_0:  The book kind of ends in the present.

03:30:13,122 --> 03:30:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  It ends with looking at the Bernie Sanders campaign, why it resonated.

03:30:16,642 --> 03:30:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  looking at some of the problems facing.

03:30:18,818 --> 03:30:19,262
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:30:19,778 --> 03:30:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  the US, the UK, other advanced economies.

03:30:22,818 --> 03:30:27,390
SPEAKER_0:  and why I think the socialist message is still.

03:30:27,650 --> 03:30:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  Relevant.

03:30:28,354 --> 03:30:31,582
SPEAKER_0:  because for the longest time, I'm 33, I became a socialist.

03:30:31,970 --> 03:30:33,086
SPEAKER_0:  as like a teenager.

03:30:33,506 --> 03:30:43,038
SPEAKER_0:  And for the longest time, it seemed like I was just a member of the historical society, you know, keeping alive an idea that nobody was interested in anymore. And now, you know, it's heartening to see.

03:30:43,330 --> 03:30:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  more young people interested in the idea.

03:30:45,762 --> 03:30:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  but we actually need to.

03:30:47,682 --> 03:30:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  I think have a...

03:30:49,538 --> 03:30:57,278
SPEAKER_0:  clearer sense of what we stand for and how we make our movement more rooted in the working class. So if anyone...

03:30:57,762 --> 03:30:58,718
SPEAKER_0:  Rewinds the tape.

03:30:59,042 --> 03:31:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  They go to when we first started talking about.

03:31:01,570 --> 03:31:02,526
SPEAKER_0:  Early Socialism.

03:31:02,914 --> 03:31:07,326
SPEAKER_0:  when I was talking about the German social democratic workers movement or.

03:31:07,650 --> 03:31:09,790
SPEAKER_0:  all these different early parties.

03:31:10,370 --> 03:31:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  I think at various points I use a word.

03:31:13,154 --> 03:31:14,846
SPEAKER_0:  worker and socialist movement.

03:31:15,170 --> 03:31:16,030
SPEAKER_0:  interchangeably.

03:31:16,514 --> 03:31:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  because in fact the time was pretty interchangeable.

03:31:20,290 --> 03:31:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:31:21,538 --> 03:31:28,926
SPEAKER_0:  Socialism was the ideology that had the appeal of the working-class movement. You know, you couldn't really separate between the two

03:31:29,346 --> 03:31:31,102
SPEAKER_0:  Um, now, obviously-

03:31:31,458 --> 03:31:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  Socialism is like a fringe ideological concurrent among a very small minority of the working class.

03:31:37,730 --> 03:31:42,238
SPEAKER_0:  which is fine, but we need to get to the point, I think, ideally, where when people talk about...

03:31:42,626 --> 03:31:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  unions and people protesting and social boobins and socialism, they all kind of are.

03:31:47,746 --> 03:31:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  one in the same as part of the same broad, broad movement.

03:31:51,106 --> 03:31:52,542
SPEAKER_1:  How did you become a socialist?

03:31:52,898 --> 03:31:56,670
SPEAKER_1:  What was the personal story or the idea that took hold in your mind?

03:31:57,058 --> 03:32:01,886
SPEAKER_0:  So I'm the youngest of five. I was the only one on my family born in the United States.

03:32:02,242 --> 03:32:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  So it was very obvious to me.

03:32:04,194 --> 03:32:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  that my life outcomes were very different than life outcomes of my siblings.

03:32:08,322 --> 03:32:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  So my three oldest siblings didn't go to college after high school, some of them got their degrees.

03:32:15,842 --> 03:32:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  much later on as adults.

03:32:18,178 --> 03:32:18,814
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:32:19,362 --> 03:32:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  But I was.

03:32:20,578 --> 03:32:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  from a pretty young age had access to a great public school district. And

03:32:24,866 --> 03:32:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:32:25,986 --> 03:32:26,878
SPEAKER_0:  was put on the track.

03:32:27,202 --> 03:32:30,558
SPEAKER_0:  that you're gonna go to college, you know, this is kind of the outcome.

03:32:31,074 --> 03:32:33,854
SPEAKER_0:  And like I said, even my grandmother was illiterate.

03:32:34,370 --> 03:32:39,230
SPEAKER_0:  My mom didn't have a lot of educational opportunities early.

03:32:39,458 --> 03:32:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  you know, in her life. She actually graduated from college the same year I did. So she later got her kind of degrees and whatever else, but.

03:32:49,090 --> 03:32:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:32:50,530 --> 03:32:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  But to me, it was obvious that...

03:32:52,066 --> 03:32:57,758
SPEAKER_0:  So much of my life outcomes weren't just a product of hard work or my family sacrifices, of course.

03:32:58,210 --> 03:32:58,974
SPEAKER_0:  I the same.

03:32:59,362 --> 03:33:01,950
SPEAKER_0:  family as my my siblings

03:33:02,306 --> 03:33:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  but.

03:33:02,946 --> 03:33:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  the product of state institutions helping out, evening things out.

03:33:06,722 --> 03:33:07,070
SPEAKER_0:  dab.

03:33:07,458 --> 03:33:09,246
SPEAKER_0:  Public School District, Public Library.

03:33:09,762 --> 03:33:15,710
SPEAKER_0:  like all sorts of after school programs, all that was the domain of the state that really benefited from it.

03:33:16,194 --> 03:33:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  So yeah, no.

03:33:17,826 --> 03:33:20,542
SPEAKER_0:  Essence, my core was the social democratic belief.

03:33:20,834 --> 03:33:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  The state should.

03:33:22,434 --> 03:33:25,886
SPEAKER_0:  We distribute a bit, build public institutions, to be an equalizer.

03:33:26,242 --> 03:33:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  Now how I became a Marxist and a socialist?

03:33:28,514 --> 03:33:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  It was much more random, I was just intellectually interested in it.

03:33:31,618 --> 03:33:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  and eventually I kind of merge the two together.

03:33:34,178 --> 03:33:35,998
SPEAKER_0:  where I merged together mine.

03:33:37,026 --> 03:33:38,622
SPEAKER_0:  more pragmatic and practical.

03:33:39,330 --> 03:33:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  interest in day-to-day concerns and reforms and so on.

03:33:42,850 --> 03:33:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  with my loftier intellectual interests in Marxism into the politics I have today, which I try to kind of...

03:33:49,250 --> 03:33:51,358
SPEAKER_0:  balance and do both. And I think a lot of

03:33:51,938 --> 03:33:56,446
SPEAKER_0:  Socialists in the organization that I joined as a teenager the Democratic Socialists of America

03:33:56,866 --> 03:33:57,534
SPEAKER_0:  And elsewhere.

03:33:57,890 --> 03:34:01,342
SPEAKER_0:  try to do the two, try to maintain some sort of balance between.

03:34:01,666 --> 03:34:04,254
SPEAKER_0:  here and our vision of the future.

03:34:04,866 --> 03:34:07,902
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think Marx would say if he were to read your book?

03:34:08,162 --> 03:34:10,494
SPEAKER_1:  socialist manifesto and do a review.

03:34:11,906 --> 03:34:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  So, I think Marx would say that

03:34:14,786 --> 03:34:18,142
SPEAKER_0:  my vision of a socialism after capitalism.

03:34:19,682 --> 03:34:22,686
SPEAKER_0:  maintains key elements of what he would.

03:34:23,234 --> 03:34:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  Wow.

03:34:24,802 --> 03:34:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  commodity form. So a lot of what Marx was concerned about was

03:34:28,674 --> 03:34:29,310
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:34:30,498 --> 03:34:32,702
SPEAKER_0:  what markets do to human relationships.

03:34:33,122 --> 03:34:38,270
SPEAKER_0:  in a negative sense. His early writings especially focus a lot on the alienation of labor.

03:34:39,010 --> 03:34:39,614
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:34:39,842 --> 03:34:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  my vision of socialism, at least in the near term.

03:34:43,266 --> 03:34:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  A lot about it is about decommodifying certain sectors, so reducing the market in certain sectors and reducing alienation.

03:34:50,786 --> 03:34:51,710
SPEAKER_0:  but not eliminating it.

03:34:52,098 --> 03:34:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  It is about eliminating exploitation and oppression.

03:34:55,394 --> 03:35:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  So knowing Marx and knowing how critical he was of certain other socialist strands and tendencies and he would often write very snarky notes and letters to people like Engels being like

03:35:06,402 --> 03:35:09,150
SPEAKER_0:  This guy, Sal, he's a total asshole.

03:35:09,506 --> 03:35:17,694
SPEAKER_0:  then he would send a separate note to LaSalle saying, hey, can I borrow five grand? This is actually true. He did the both, I think the same like, um...

03:35:18,050 --> 03:35:19,175
SPEAKER_0:  the same month.

03:35:19,175 --> 03:35:21,425
SPEAKER_1:  So he would be really good at Twitter is what you said.

03:35:21,425 --> 03:35:27,582
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, he would be the best at Twitter. And also he used to be a, he was a journalist before with his work for the New York Tribune.

03:35:27,938 --> 03:35:38,174
SPEAKER_0:  uh... he was very clever very starkey he'd be awesome at at where i think him and you know i would have a good back and forth but i think it'd be critical some parts but i think that

03:35:38,850 --> 03:35:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  the strangest part.

03:35:40,674 --> 03:35:44,286
SPEAKER_0:  for him would be reading the historical sections and seeing the way in which

03:35:44,930 --> 03:35:48,382
SPEAKER_0:  His ideas, which was fundamentally ideas about human emancipation.

03:35:48,610 --> 03:35:48,958
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:35:50,530 --> 03:35:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  were used for...

03:35:51,842 --> 03:35:54,494
SPEAKER_0:  for evil, for hardship, you know, for, in ways that-

03:35:54,722 --> 03:35:59,742
SPEAKER_0:  did the opposite of emancipated, but in some cases, you know, enslaved people. I think he would have.

03:36:00,386 --> 03:36:02,334
SPEAKER_0:  Definitely not want to be associated with them.

03:36:02,562 --> 03:36:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  He probably would rather be associated with me than them, but...

03:36:06,050 --> 03:36:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  Even then.

03:36:07,298 --> 03:36:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  Only, but gradually.

03:36:09,218 --> 03:36:10,430
SPEAKER_0: GE lag

03:36:11,042 --> 03:36:11,870
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhhhhh...

03:36:12,354 --> 03:36:15,038
SPEAKER_1:  What advice would you give to young folks?

03:36:17,090 --> 03:36:18,110
SPEAKER_1:  in high school.

03:36:18,402 --> 03:36:19,390
SPEAKER_1:  in college.

03:36:19,714 --> 03:36:23,038
SPEAKER_1:  how to have a career they can be proud of how to change the world

03:36:23,810 --> 03:36:25,630
SPEAKER_0:  I think B, intellectually curious.

03:36:25,858 --> 03:36:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:36:27,042 --> 03:36:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  you know, read outside your current beliefs and...

03:36:30,594 --> 03:36:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  understand and read authors on their own terms.

03:36:33,762 --> 03:36:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  So the worst thing in the world to do is to read anything, especially work of fiction, but anything.

03:36:38,018 --> 03:36:39,294
SPEAKER_0:  and try to deduce.

03:36:39,586 --> 03:36:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  the authors.

03:36:41,058 --> 03:36:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

03:36:41,634 --> 03:36:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  backgrounds or politics or whatever else. You read it on its own terms.

03:36:44,930 --> 03:36:45,406
SPEAKER_0:  First.

03:36:45,634 --> 03:36:49,694
SPEAKER_0:  then you could reread it and kind of do other examinations or whatever else.

03:36:50,114 --> 03:36:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  and also read a lot of history.

03:36:51,458 --> 03:36:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  So I started off reading.

03:36:53,666 --> 03:36:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  books like Eric Hopp's Bombs.

03:36:56,514 --> 03:37:05,374
SPEAKER_0:  four books on history going from the 1700s all the way to 1994. The last book is Age of Extremes.

03:37:06,082 --> 03:37:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  But I think understanding history gives you a bird's eye view of everything, sociology.

03:37:12,226 --> 03:37:17,438
SPEAKER_0:  economics, everything. So these big sweeping historical books are really...

03:37:18,050 --> 03:37:20,318
SPEAKER_0:  useful to know. Everybody should know basically.

03:37:20,770 --> 03:37:30,302
SPEAKER_0:  you know, what year or at least like what decade, you know, serfdom was abolished, what century Magna Carta was, you know.

03:37:30,562 --> 03:37:32,702
SPEAKER_0:  When the Roman Empire fell, even though it's kind of...

03:37:32,962 --> 03:37:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  debated when the Roman Empire fell. All these, I think, like-

03:37:36,290 --> 03:37:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  being a person with a general knowledge and general sense of history and whatever else just makes you more eclectic and interesting and it's way better than just

03:37:44,578 --> 03:37:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  Like especially a lot of my Indian friends, you know, that...

03:37:47,362 --> 03:37:49,758
SPEAKER_0:  not just Indians, but the hyper focus on like...

03:37:49,986 --> 03:37:52,734
SPEAKER_0:  You gotta specialize and you have to like focus on

03:37:53,154 --> 03:37:57,726
SPEAKER_0:  on math or engineering, whatever you want to do. You just know your field really well, but nothing else.

03:37:58,498 --> 03:37:59,934
SPEAKER_0:  I think there's something really to...

03:38:00,290 --> 03:38:05,182
SPEAKER_0:  Whether you're getting in school or you're just going to do it by yourself, giving yourself kind of a liberal arts education.

03:38:06,050 --> 03:38:13,118
SPEAKER_1:  I think there's a lot of power to sort of having the facts of history in terms of in time when stuff happened but also really powerful is knowing

03:38:13,474 --> 03:38:15,230
SPEAKER_1:  spatially, like the geography.

03:38:15,778 --> 03:38:16,446
SPEAKER_1:  the word.

03:38:16,802 --> 03:38:25,790
SPEAKER_1:  There were a point on a map and there's interesting dynamics that happen throughout history of all the different nations in Europe, of all the different military conflicts and the expansions.

03:38:26,338 --> 03:38:27,806
SPEAKER_1:  and the wars.

03:38:28,290 --> 03:38:32,702
SPEAKER_1:  and the empires and all that kind of stuff. It really puts into context how

03:38:33,570 --> 03:38:46,334
SPEAKER_1:  how human history has led to the place we are today, because all the different geopolitical conflicts we have today, even the politics of the day, is grounded in history. Maybe less so for the United States, because it has a very young history.

03:38:46,722 --> 03:38:48,958
SPEAKER_1:  But that history, even from the United States, is still there.

03:38:49,218 --> 03:38:50,590
SPEAKER_1:  right from the civil war.

03:38:51,106 --> 03:38:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  and understanding that.

03:38:53,282 --> 03:38:56,318
SPEAKER_1:  gives you context to when you tweet random stuff about.

03:38:56,994 --> 03:39:00,798
SPEAKER_1:  uh, this or that person or politician and so on.

03:39:01,506 --> 03:39:01,950
SPEAKER_1:  I

03:39:02,242 --> 03:39:03,358
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, very true.

03:39:04,514 --> 03:39:06,718
SPEAKER_1:  Very true. One of the regrets I have currently is...

03:39:07,138 --> 03:39:10,046
SPEAKER_1:  I have perhaps been too focused on the 20th century.

03:39:10,946 --> 03:39:11,902
SPEAKER_1:  in terms of history.

03:39:12,930 --> 03:39:14,686
SPEAKER_1:  the present and the 20th century.

03:39:15,298 --> 03:39:17,438
SPEAKER_1:  A lot of people write to me that...

03:39:17,794 --> 03:39:20,670
SPEAKER_1:  There's a lot of lessons to be learned in ancient history as well.

03:39:21,346 --> 03:39:25,342
SPEAKER_1:  So not just even American history, but just looking farther and farther and farther back.

03:39:27,202 --> 03:39:28,702
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, that feels like...

03:39:29,762 --> 03:39:36,126
SPEAKER_1:  It's another time, it's another place, it totally has no lessons, but then you remind yourself that it's the same human beings, right?

03:39:36,674 --> 03:39:40,734
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, and also we're no smarter than them. We just have more crude knowledge in part because of them.

03:39:41,058 --> 03:39:44,478
SPEAKER_0:  But they were just as clever as us.

03:39:45,314 --> 03:39:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think is the meaning of this whole experiment we have going on on Earth?

03:39:50,498 --> 03:39:51,934
SPEAKER_1:  Now what's the meaning of life?

03:39:53,026 --> 03:39:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I think there's no broad meaning of life.

03:39:56,546 --> 03:39:57,374
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it was an accident.

03:39:58,178 --> 03:40:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  we ourselves need to make our own meeting.

03:40:00,386 --> 03:40:01,182
SPEAKER_0:  and for me.

03:40:01,762 --> 03:40:03,870
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of it is about.

03:40:04,482 --> 03:40:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  Posterity, trying to do something worthwhile.

03:40:07,554 --> 03:40:08,254
SPEAKER_0:  while on Earth.

03:40:08,802 --> 03:40:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  but also...

03:40:09,762 --> 03:40:17,950
SPEAKER_0:  leaving something behind. It could just be relationships with friends or family. In the future, maybe having a family and then kind of leaving behind that sort of.

03:40:18,626 --> 03:40:21,694
SPEAKER_0:  legacy, little bits of yourself, but also.

03:40:22,050 --> 03:40:22,430
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

03:40:23,458 --> 03:40:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  them being able to learn the same way I have little bits of my parents and my grandparents and me.

03:40:29,346 --> 03:40:30,750
SPEAKER_0:  And then also, I think in a...

03:40:31,330 --> 03:40:34,814
SPEAKER_0:  social sense zooming out from just the individual The family Minnie

03:40:35,298 --> 03:40:35,806
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:40:36,194 --> 03:40:37,374
SPEAKER_0:  leaving the world.

03:40:38,018 --> 03:40:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  behind a little.

03:40:39,298 --> 03:40:39,646
SPEAKER_0:  Better.

03:40:39,874 --> 03:40:41,918
SPEAKER_0:  you know, I would love to.

03:40:42,658 --> 03:40:47,358
SPEAKER_0:  be a part of a movement that created a world with a little bit less suffering, a little bit less.

03:40:47,618 --> 03:40:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  oppression or exploitation or whatever else.

03:40:51,490 --> 03:40:52,542
SPEAKER_0:  That's really why I'm uh...

03:40:52,802 --> 03:40:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  why I'm a socialist, you know, it's not about.

03:40:55,458 --> 03:40:59,166
SPEAKER_0:  snapping your fingers and curing the world of everything in one go.

03:40:59,714 --> 03:41:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  but it is about, I think.

03:41:02,050 --> 03:41:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  putting our lives, giving our lives some sort of meaning and purpose. And you don't have to be a socialist to do that. You could just do it at the...

03:41:08,514 --> 03:41:09,406
SPEAKER_0:  You know, at the...

03:41:09,986 --> 03:41:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  micro level on your own day to day interactions, but I just feel like life.

03:41:15,042 --> 03:41:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  has no good meaning without.

03:41:17,634 --> 03:41:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  without thinking of posterity in the future.

03:41:20,578 --> 03:41:23,102
SPEAKER_1:  And I have to say thank you for doing so.

03:41:24,194 --> 03:41:28,318
SPEAKER_1:  Thank you for caring about the struggle of the people in the world through ideas that

03:41:28,834 --> 03:41:29,758
SPEAKER_1:  are bold.

03:41:30,338 --> 03:41:32,382
SPEAKER_1:  and I think challenging for a lot of people.

03:41:32,738 --> 03:41:34,750
SPEAKER_1:  in a time when socialism...

03:41:35,714 --> 03:41:42,302
SPEAKER_1:  is something that can be attacked aggressively by large numbers of people still persevering and still exploring those ideas.

03:41:42,754 --> 03:41:47,038
SPEAKER_1:  and seeing what of those ideas can make for a better world, that's beautiful to see.

03:41:47,554 --> 03:41:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  Baska, thank you so much for talking today. Thank you for all the work you do. I can't wait to see what you do next.

03:41:52,418 --> 03:41:59,934
SPEAKER_0:  I appreciate it. And yeah, thanks for keeping open mind with these conversations and to your audience too. You know, it's nice to have a space where.

03:42:00,802 --> 03:42:05,150
SPEAKER_0:  People can debate and think at length and don't have to worry about soundbite culture.

03:42:05,346 --> 03:42:05,822

03:42:07,170 --> 03:42:09,886

03:42:18,018 --> 03:42:18,814
SPEAKER_1:  Democracy.

03:42:19,138 --> 03:42:19,902
SPEAKER_1:  It's the road.

03:42:20,386 --> 03:42:21,214
