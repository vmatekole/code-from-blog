00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:22,014
SPEAKER_1:  There's no question.

00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,318
SPEAKER_1:  that he has a deep love for humanity.

00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,462

SPEAKER_1:  in a ridiculous outfit.

00:00:43,362 --> 00:00:44,318
SPEAKER_1:  without coordinating.

00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:45,790
SPEAKER_1:  for the chaos.

00:00:46,018 --> 00:00:47,006

SPEAKER_1:  this year.

00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,526
SPEAKER_0:  Well that's interesting one of the

00:01:23,298 --> 00:01:27,166
SPEAKER_0:  People in the book, Granville Hicks, his autobiography starts with, I was a good boy.

00:01:27,682 --> 00:01:29,278
SPEAKER_0:  and he wasn't a very good boy.

00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:01:30,242 --> 00:01:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  On a scale of 1 to 10.

00:01:33,058 --> 00:01:35,230
SPEAKER_0:  I'm trying to think of what bad things I've done.

00:01:35,682 --> 00:01:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, okay, there's that. Okay, wait. That's not that was not that that's all right. I would say nine

00:01:41,858 --> 00:01:43,038
SPEAKER_0:  Nine! yeah

00:01:43,522 --> 00:01:44,606
SPEAKER_0:  I try to do the right thing.

00:01:45,378 --> 00:01:47,934
SPEAKER_0:  What about you? Is it going to be 1 or 0?

00:01:48,034 --> 00:01:51,454
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, no, I'm extremely self-critical. I push to zero. Okay.

00:01:52,002 --> 00:01:53,246
SPEAKER_0:  I reach for the zero.

00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,198
SPEAKER_0:  Well, mission accomplished.

00:01:55,714 --> 00:01:57,662
SPEAKER_1:  So this episode.

00:01:58,178 --> 00:01:59,646
SPEAKER_1:  is announcing the release.

00:02:00,098 --> 00:02:02,398
SPEAKER_1:  of The White Pill, a book you wrote.

00:02:02,754 --> 00:02:03,838
SPEAKER_1:  I've gotten

00:02:04,194 --> 00:02:08,437
SPEAKER_1:  the honor, the privilege, the pleasure of being one of the first people to read it.

00:02:08,437 --> 00:02:12,862
SPEAKER_0:  So I'm really, I don't know if nervous is the word, but you are the first.

00:02:13,346 --> 00:02:16,702
SPEAKER_0:  person who has read it that I am speaking to about it.

00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:20,414
SPEAKER_1:  My first, my last, my everything. Yes. I'm gonna say that to all the girls.

00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:22,389
SPEAKER_0:  but I'll take it. All the fembunts?

00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:23,742
SPEAKER_1:  Oh the fun buds.

00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,438
SPEAKER_1:  But yeah, it was a truly incredible book.

00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:29,342
SPEAKER_1:  It's basically a story of evil in the 20th century.

00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,134
SPEAKER_1:  and throughout.

00:02:31,682 --> 00:02:32,126
SPEAKER_1:  it.

00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,686
SPEAKER_1:  you reveal a thread that gives us hope.

00:02:35,074 --> 00:02:36,478
SPEAKER_1:  And that's the idea of the white pill.

00:02:36,962 --> 00:02:38,782
SPEAKER_1:  So there's the blue pill and the red pill.

00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,046
SPEAKER_1:  There's the black pill, which is a kind of deeply cynical.

00:02:42,978 --> 00:02:43,326
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:02:43,778 --> 00:02:46,046
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe apathetic, just giving up on the world.

00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:49,086
SPEAKER_1:  given that you see behind the curtain and you...

00:02:49,698 --> 00:02:54,878
SPEAKER_1:  Given that you don't like what you see, given that there's so much suffering in the world, you give up. There's a science in slaughter of life, I was a fight of life silicon, having to have

00:02:55,298 --> 00:02:59,582
SPEAKER_1:  I suppose is even though you acknowledge that there's evil in the world, you don't give up.

00:03:00,194 --> 00:03:01,054
SPEAKER_1:  Yes.

00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,195
SPEAKER_1:  If you're listening to this and you're a fan of this podcast.

00:03:04,195 --> 00:03:06,142

00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:13,470
SPEAKER_1:  So for people who also don't know.

00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,558
SPEAKER_1:  My Komalis.

00:03:15,074 --> 00:03:16,638
SPEAKER_1:  is not just a troll.

00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:19,678
SPEAKER_1:  Not just a hilarious, comedic.

00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:20,734
SPEAKER_1:  genius.

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,438
SPEAKER_1:  who hosts his own podcast, but he is an incredible, brilliant author. Dear reader, the uh...

00:03:25,698 --> 00:03:27,870
SPEAKER_1:  unauthorized autobiography Kim Jong Il.

00:03:28,322 --> 00:03:33,054
SPEAKER_1:  So that's a story of North Korea, the new right to journey to the fringe of American politics.

00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,046
SPEAKER_1:  That's...

00:03:34,722 --> 00:03:35,550
SPEAKER_1:  The story.

00:03:36,194 --> 00:03:37,950
SPEAKER_1:  of the extremes.

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,582
SPEAKER_1:  of the United States.

00:03:39,906 --> 00:03:40,446
SPEAKER_1:  uh

00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:47,806
SPEAKER_1:  political movements and then the anarchist handbook that's talking about the ideologies, the different flavors of ideologies of anarchism.

00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,918
SPEAKER_1:  But on top of that, you're now rev-

00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:50,750
SPEAKER_1:  going in.

00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,862
SPEAKER_1:  going into the darkest.

00:03:54,082 --> 00:03:59,262
SPEAKER_1:  aspects of the twentieth century with the soviet union and uh... communism with white pill song

00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,230
SPEAKER_1:  Let me ask you, let's start at the beginning.

00:04:03,554 --> 00:04:10,206
SPEAKER_1:  At the end of the 19th century, as you write, the terms socialist, communist, and anarchist were used somewhat loosely and interchangeably.

00:04:10,498 --> 00:04:15,838
SPEAKER_1:  because the prophesied Marxist society was one in which the state had famously withered away.

00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,910
SPEAKER_1:  There was a great disagreement about what a social system would do.

00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,566
SPEAKER_1:  looked like in practice, but two things were clear.

00:04:21,986 --> 00:04:25,694
SPEAKER_1:  First, that socialism was both inevitable and scientific.

00:04:26,018 --> 00:04:27,710
SPEAKER_1:  the way of the future and second.

00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:33,758
SPEAKER_1:  that the capitalist ruling class were not going down without a fight. So what are the key points?

00:04:34,082 --> 00:04:35,550
SPEAKER_1:  of disagreement between.

00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,430
SPEAKER_1:  the socialists, the anarchists, the communists along that.

00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:39,806
SPEAKER_1:  at that time.

00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:43,422
SPEAKER_1:  at the end of the 19th century, at the beginning of the 20th century.

00:04:43,938 --> 00:04:48,766
SPEAKER_1:  The possibility of the century laid before us that eventually led to the first and the second world war.

00:04:49,346 --> 00:05:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  The idea when the Industrial Revolution came and Marx was very much a product of Industrial Revolutionary thinking was, okay, now that we have technology, now that we have science, we can scientifically manage society.

00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,486
SPEAKER_0:  We saw this very much with Woodrow Wilson.

00:05:03,778 --> 00:05:07,326
SPEAKER_0:  and this kind of idea of progressivism that, you know, we could use some,

00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,630
SPEAKER_0:  technology and kind of not.

00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:16,286
SPEAKER_0:  capitalism in their view unfettered capitalism was wasteful you're making too much stuff you have surpluses you have

00:05:16,642 --> 00:05:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  shortages if we produce just exactly what we need and you have these people engineers, your engineering society...

00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  then everyone will be happy and you won't have to have any suffering or waste.

00:05:26,754 --> 00:05:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  So socialism at that time was used as a broad umbrella.

00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,654
SPEAKER_0:  It's not using the term that it means today of.

00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:39,774
SPEAKER_0:  necessarily state socialism. It just meant the idea of having society scientifically run.

00:05:40,194 --> 00:05:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  So you had a huge argument, they're different wings, you even had it from the beginning with Marx versus Bakunin because Marx was for...

00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:52,606
SPEAKER_0:  obviously state socialism, the absolute state running everything. Even with

00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  marks and angles.

00:05:55,202 --> 00:05:58,334
SPEAKER_0:  It was a means to an end after man is remade.

00:05:58,562 --> 00:06:08,254
SPEAKER_0:  in his very nature, then the state withers away and everyone's equal and then you have this kind of heaven on earth situation. Bakunin was the opposite. He regarded the state as inherently immoral.

00:06:08,706 --> 00:06:10,526
SPEAKER_0:  and wanted to have kind of like.

00:06:10,754 --> 00:06:14,078
SPEAKER_0:  workers collectives and things like that and ultra localized control.

00:06:14,306 --> 00:06:18,334
SPEAKER_1:  So the end was always stateless. It's just that some people viewed the state as.

00:06:18,786 --> 00:06:20,661
SPEAKER_1:  a convenient effective intermediate.

00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:23,006
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I think at least Mark some process.

00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  plenty of others who just regarded it, you know, have the state owner, have the workers you know, control.

00:06:28,642 --> 00:06:30,334
SPEAKER_0:  the production via the state.

00:06:30,498 --> 00:06:31,806
SPEAKER_1:  By the way, how does my hat look?

00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  It looks great festive.

00:06:34,146 --> 00:06:35,271
SPEAKER_1:  Is this side better?

00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:38,270
SPEAKER_0:  than the other side. I think you want it on this side so people can see you.

00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:39,038
SPEAKER_1:  Oh no.

00:06:40,258 --> 00:06:41,566
SPEAKER_1:  You know like, um...

00:06:41,858 --> 00:06:42,983
SPEAKER_1:  when you have like hair.

00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:45,598
SPEAKER_0:  Peekaboo hair, it's called. Veronica Lake, I think was her name.

00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:50,558
SPEAKER_1:  And then I just glance flirtatiously towards the camera sometimes. I'll get 말이 on the next two over Foran,

00:06:55,234 --> 00:06:56,702
SPEAKER_0:  Wow

00:06:57,538 --> 00:06:58,558
SPEAKER_0:  No glove, no love.

00:07:00,482 --> 00:07:00,926
SPEAKER_0:  The bad.

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,550
SPEAKER_1:  The bad aspect of white gloves is...

00:07:05,122 --> 00:07:06,238
SPEAKER_1:  The blood stains them.

00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,510
SPEAKER_1:  You have to get new ones every time.

00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:13,598
SPEAKER_1:  And now I glance flirtatiously after that.

00:07:14,146 --> 00:07:16,771
SPEAKER_1:  I'm sorry, okay, Bakunin and Marx, go ahead.

00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:19,294
SPEAKER_0:  So there were other...

00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:23,902
SPEAKER_0:  socialists who did not regard this kind of end times where the state would do it the way at all.

00:07:24,226 --> 00:07:25,310
SPEAKER_0:  And there are, you know.

00:07:25,826 --> 00:07:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  various strains in between where you'd have some capitalism and some socialism.

00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,342
SPEAKER_0:  uh... you know the concept of a safety net

00:07:33,826 --> 00:07:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  came out of socialist thinking, the Labour Party came out, the Fabian Socialists in Great Britain, their logo was a wolf in sheep's clothing.

00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,974
SPEAKER_0:  And then when that was too on the nose, they changed it to a tortoise, meaning we're going to get to socialism.

00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,150
SPEAKER_0:  slowly in the sense of either...

00:07:49,474 --> 00:07:51,262
SPEAKER_0:  uh... gradualism or boiling a frog

00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:56,958
SPEAKER_0:  And also the big part of this thinking at the time, this is again, the late 19th century.

00:07:57,282 --> 00:08:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  is the idea that there's going to be a worldwide workers revolution. It wasn't going to be that.

00:08:02,306 --> 00:08:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  you know, in one country, you know, it was gonna happen and then all the other countries would be capitalists. The idea was, all right.

00:08:07,906 --> 00:08:08,286
SPEAKER_0:  Uh

00:08:08,514 --> 00:08:12,638
SPEAKER_0:  like the workers in Germany have more in common with the workers in America.

00:08:12,898 --> 00:08:19,710
SPEAKER_0:  than the workers in Germany have with the capitalists in Germany. So the idea is, alright, like they're the working class all over the world, at one point they're going to be like...

00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  We're being exploited.

00:08:21,474 --> 00:08:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  It's getting worse and worse for us. We can't feed our families. We're getting injured and so on and so forth and there's no compensation for this.

00:08:28,514 --> 00:08:33,246
SPEAKER_0:  We're just going to overthrow our chains and we're going to run everything ourselves. We're the ones running it already anyway.

00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,102
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and you know, the

00:08:35,426 --> 00:08:37,086
SPEAKER_0:  This was their doing all the work.

00:08:37,314 --> 00:08:40,862
SPEAKER_0:  And we're doing all the work, so why shouldn't we be getting all the benefits?

00:08:41,602 --> 00:08:44,382
SPEAKER_1:  What's the role of violence in all of this?

00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  So this was a big.

00:08:46,882 --> 00:08:47,966
SPEAKER_0:  source of contention.

00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  So the Fabians, for example, in Britain, who are all socialists, they were very heavily

00:08:53,762 --> 00:08:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  of the idea that we can do this through the ballot box.

00:08:57,218 --> 00:08:57,598
SPEAKER_0:  We can.

00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,166
SPEAKER_0:  advocate and

00:08:59,426 --> 00:08:59,742
SPEAKER_0:  have.

00:09:00,194 --> 00:09:04,414
SPEAKER_0:  agitate and get the people to be voting for their own self-interest and furthering the state.

00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:06,846
SPEAKER_0:  at the expense of the capitalist class.

00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:11,102
SPEAKER_0:  Then there were the people who were the hardcore anarchists who were like...

00:09:11,682 --> 00:09:12,190
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,326
SPEAKER_0:  If voting changed anything, they wouldn't let us do it.

00:09:15,874 --> 00:09:20,094
SPEAKER_0:  And the only way to have a revolution is to have a revolution.

00:09:20,482 --> 00:09:20,958
SPEAKER_0:  too.

00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,270
SPEAKER_0:  Kill to...

00:09:22,498 --> 00:09:23,326
SPEAKER_0:  Overthrow?

00:09:23,618 --> 00:09:25,470
SPEAKER_0:  to seize these factories.

00:09:25,922 --> 00:09:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  And this was a big argument and it also.

00:09:30,114 --> 00:09:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  fed into the idea of...

00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:32,894
SPEAKER_0:  Where does free speech end?

00:09:33,346 --> 00:09:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  Is it legal to be giving speeches advocating for violence and revolution? Is it legal? Is it legal to be giving speeches advocating for violence and revolution?

00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  He published a book?

00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:48,446
SPEAKER_0:  uh... in the eighteen hundreds about how to build dynamite and how to build bombs

00:09:48,802 --> 00:09:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  And this is a big.

00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  free speech concerned the time because now anyone in their own house

00:09:53,762 --> 00:09:54,878
SPEAKER_0:  can make a bomb and...

00:09:55,138 --> 00:10:03,902
SPEAKER_0:  kill lots of people. And this is something that was happening with enormous frequency at the time. And people tend to think, you know, because we have these kind of prejudices.

00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  or we only remember what's happening now but

00:10:06,818 --> 00:10:13,374
SPEAKER_0:  This was World War I and got started with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

00:10:13,602 --> 00:10:17,630
SPEAKER_0:  There were lots of people, McKinley is another one who I discussed in the book, his assassination.

00:10:17,858 --> 00:10:19,102
SPEAKER_0:  There was lots.

00:10:19,554 --> 00:10:31,678
SPEAKER_0:  of violence happening very regularly. And with the creation of dynamite, it kind of exponentially became more dangerous and threatening. Even now on Wall Street, there was a bomb that went off, I think in the 1920s.

00:10:32,002 --> 00:10:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  And the shards of shrapnel are still in the JP Morgan building, I believe.

00:10:36,642 --> 00:10:37,182
SPEAKER_1:  Do you ever think?

00:10:37,442 --> 00:10:40,158
SPEAKER_1:  if you were alive during that time, what you would be doing?

00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,270
SPEAKER_1:  You think of yourself as an anarchist?

00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:48,030
SPEAKER_1:  Would you be, where would you be? Would you be a socialist, a communist? Which parties would you attend?

00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:48,926
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:10:49,186 --> 00:10:50,311
SPEAKER_1:  figuratively and

00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:59,038
SPEAKER_0:  The thing that was so interesting back then is there was a woman named Mabel Dodge Lujan and she ended her days in Taos, New Mexico. She found an artist colony.

00:10:59,586 --> 00:11:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  and she had an apartment on 9th street and 5th avenue in Manhattan.

00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  uh... shuttle salon

00:11:06,178 --> 00:11:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  and everyone got together and talked and you have Emma Goldman who's an anarchist, Margaret Sanger who invented Planned Parenthood and advocated for birth control.

00:11:12,962 --> 00:11:20,254
SPEAKER_0:  and you'd have the people from the Wobblies, the hardcore labor unions, and everyone kind of, Ed Shellmanekin didn't attend, but he was friends with them all.

00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,654
SPEAKER_0:  So there was this very weird...

00:11:23,554 --> 00:11:27,358
SPEAKER_0:  with the birth of modernism in art and in kind of modernist thinking.

00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,310
SPEAKER_0:  There was this idea of like, all right.

00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:35,870
SPEAKER_0:  Like this was the first time where you could be intellectual as a class, where there really was this space for people who are thinkers.

00:11:36,258 --> 00:11:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  And they just sat around being like, all right, like, what are we gonna do with ourselves? And you had it in modern art.

00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  You had it in literature, you had it in politics.

00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:47,934
SPEAKER_0:  So it was a very exciting time.

00:11:48,354 --> 00:11:51,614
SPEAKER_0:  where people were like, all right, like everything is now on the table.

00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  What are we gonna do with this? And they very much were aware that this was a break.

00:11:56,322 --> 00:12:00,382
SPEAKER_0:  with the pre-industrial revolution kind of.

00:12:00,642 --> 00:12:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  farmer labor era.

00:12:02,018 --> 00:12:02,750
SPEAKER_1:  Do you see?

00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,246
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think for you violence would be compelling?

00:12:05,378 --> 00:12:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  No.

00:12:06,402 --> 00:12:07,678
SPEAKER_0:  First of all, I'm just too small.

00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,686
SPEAKER_0:  Um, but second, I just dynamite.

00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,775
SPEAKER_1:  doesn't care about your size.

00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, but I mean retribution does and I think

00:12:16,226 --> 00:12:20,190
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, but to me violence is the kind of thing where...

00:12:20,482 --> 00:12:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  You think you're running it, but it's running you?

00:12:22,818 --> 00:12:23,550
SPEAKER_0:  Once you

00:12:24,258 --> 00:12:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

00:12:25,154 --> 00:12:28,030
SPEAKER_0:  that line, you know, violence sings its own song.

00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  So whenever I hear even contemporary times where people are advocating for, you know, violent actions, it's like.

00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  When you start a fire, you're not like, I'm just going to burn down this house. You know, it's, it's, it's, and there's many.

00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  cases over and over of people who are building bombs.

00:12:43,714 --> 00:12:48,126
SPEAKER_0:  or trying to assassinate someone or things like that, and it ended up literally.

00:12:48,546 --> 00:12:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  Literally literally blowing up in their own face.

00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,886
SPEAKER_0:  So, and violence doesn't

00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:54,942
SPEAKER_0:  Really?

00:12:55,234 --> 00:13:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  work necessarily because you know if you have an assassination you're not assassinating the presidency.

00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,750
SPEAKER_0:  You know, if you take out, you know, a president.

00:13:03,042 --> 00:13:05,886
SPEAKER_0:  There's another president instantly there. So what have you accomplished? So

00:13:06,658 --> 00:13:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  husband.

00:13:07,522 --> 00:13:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  Dad is gone.

00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  You replace them with someone who now is in a position to crack down.

00:13:12,386 --> 00:13:15,806
SPEAKER_0:  and retaliate with even more violence. So it's a-

00:13:16,322 --> 00:13:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  the calculus for me isn't there. Would I be advocating for then?

00:13:20,194 --> 00:13:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  Who knows?

00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  But I mean, I don't know if I'd be able to have the space to be.

00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:34,270
SPEAKER_0:  I certainly wouldn't have the space to be a podcaster or like a media personality. That wasn't really a thing. To some extent, it was in the 1920s.

00:13:34,562 --> 00:13:37,950
SPEAKER_0:  with the Algonquin roundtable and all the people from the New Yorker magazine.

00:13:38,242 --> 00:13:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  Um, but they were all drunks, you know, it was very much, uh,

00:13:42,626 --> 00:13:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  uh, a weird

00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,814
SPEAKER_0:  kind of situation to be a thinker.

00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:50,654
SPEAKER_1:  What would you think you'd do? Work at a carnival? You look good in lipstick, so...

00:13:50,946 --> 00:14:01,147
SPEAKER_0:  Well, thank you. Um, I looked at anything. Um, what would I, I don't know. I mean, you're not building robots. I mean, you could have been a Tesla, right? Okay. I didn't mean a car. I meant the person. Like I understand.

00:14:01,147 --> 00:14:04,147
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, thank you for explaining the witty comments to me.

00:14:04,147 --> 00:14:07,614
SPEAKER_0:  I didn't witty at all. Cause you wouldn't get Einstein, cause he was an immigrant.

00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,845
SPEAKER_1:  So I wouldn't work with an immigrant, what is that even?

00:14:09,845 --> 00:14:15,230
SPEAKER_0:  No, you would have been a Tesla-like figure. There's already a Tesla, so you wouldn't literally be Tesla. That's why I said a Tesla.

00:14:15,394 --> 00:14:18,974
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, Tesla. Okay. So, all right. So, thank you for the explanation.

00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:24,333
SPEAKER_1:  See, Michael doesn't only make funny things, he also explains them for you. It wasn't fun, man.

00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  It wasn't funny at all. That I agree with.

00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:27,902
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,285
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so yes, when you...

00:14:31,285 --> 00:14:34,174
SPEAKER_0:  She this is like I didn't like you. It's this

00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  Alright.

00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,622
SPEAKER_1:  I'm downgrading it from a 9 down to an 8.

00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,694
SPEAKER_1:  if you keep talking like this

00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:50,942
SPEAKER_1:  A five is a real possibility. All right. So, uh, vacuum is the kind of vacuum that's created with violence is, is usually.

00:14:51,362 --> 00:14:51,966
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:14:52,514 --> 00:14:53,630
SPEAKER_1:  filled with like a

00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,158
SPEAKER_1:  with a harsher figure.

00:14:56,546 --> 00:14:56,894
SPEAKER_1:  So.

00:14:57,122 --> 00:15:02,549
SPEAKER_1:  So you don't think violent revolution ultimately leads to positive progress in the short term.

00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  Well, sometimes it does. The American Revolution, I think, was a positive example. And overthrowing the Tsar, which was done peacefully.

00:15:09,794 --> 00:15:11,838
SPEAKER_0:  was a positive example, but again,

00:15:12,194 --> 00:15:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, when-

00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,294
SPEAKER_0:  violence happens, people get scared.

00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  and they want the violence stopped immediately. And that's a call for authoritarianism.

00:15:19,842 --> 00:15:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  and you see it time and time again. And they also want retribution. They were like, bring this back to normal.

00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:30,398
SPEAKER_0:  and they don't really worry about things like civil liberties or things like that. It's a very, uh, uh,

00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:31,870
SPEAKER_0:  and then it also.

00:15:32,162 --> 00:15:34,462
SPEAKER_0:  creates this space for invasion from.

00:15:34,882 --> 00:15:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  foreign sources or demagogues, you know, like, oh look, they're killing us in the streets. Now you got to support me.

00:15:40,034 --> 00:15:42,174
SPEAKER_0:  It's a very...

00:15:42,754 --> 00:15:43,902
SPEAKER_0:  Deadly game, obviously.

00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,886
SPEAKER_1:  I remember somebody told me.

00:15:47,042 --> 00:15:54,110
SPEAKER_1:  that I forget where it was, but they told me that from the very beginning it was obvious that communism is an evil system.

00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:56,670
SPEAKER_1:  or a system that leads to evil.

00:15:57,634 --> 00:15:59,326
SPEAKER_1:  And to me, at least that's not.

00:15:59,554 --> 00:16:05,246
SPEAKER_1:  If I had to put myself in the beginning of the 20th century at the end of the 19th century, it would be Asia.

00:16:05,602 --> 00:16:06,334
SPEAKER_1:  They are.

00:16:07,106 --> 00:16:08,542
SPEAKER_1:  trying to elevate humanity.

00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,134
SPEAKER_1:  the basic worth of a human being.

00:16:11,362 --> 00:16:15,902
SPEAKER_1:  of a hard working human being, of the working class, of the people that are doing the work and are striving and...

00:16:16,194 --> 00:16:21,566
SPEAKER_1:  just really trying to build up society with their own hands. which seems like a beautiful ideal.

00:16:21,986 --> 00:16:23,774
SPEAKER_1:  So I guess the question is

00:16:24,706 --> 00:16:25,918
SPEAKER_1:  Can you see yourself?

00:16:26,178 --> 00:16:26,942
SPEAKER_1:  believing that.

00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,598
SPEAKER_1:  in the ideas of socialism and communism.

00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,390
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, let's say if you were living.

00:16:31,586 --> 00:16:35,934
SPEAKER_0:  in Russia. Oh yeah, easily. First of all, I don't think anything is obvious in politics.

00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  it's not obvious that you know

00:16:40,226 --> 00:16:43,806
SPEAKER_0:  humans have rights, it's not obvious that liberty is better or the markets either.

00:16:44,258 --> 00:16:45,438
SPEAKER_0:  whether you're four.

00:16:45,794 --> 00:16:51,838
SPEAKER_0:  You know, welfare state or your four more free markets, not that those is obvious. Both of them involve enormous amount of thought.

00:16:52,258 --> 00:16:55,390
SPEAKER_0:  and background information. So when someone says something is obvious,

00:16:56,162 --> 00:17:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  politics, they really mean something's apparent. Well, it's not apparent on its face that if we all get together.

00:17:01,826 --> 00:17:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  and promote a society based on equality.

00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:11,454
SPEAKER_0:  and we all chip in that it's going to really be good for everyone. I mean that to me is the promise.

00:17:11,874 --> 00:17:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  of communism.

00:17:13,954 --> 00:17:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  And it was also very appealing to many people because

00:17:18,178 --> 00:17:18,878
SPEAKER_0:  It was new.

00:17:19,586 --> 00:17:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  So the idea was, all right.

00:17:21,698 --> 00:17:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  We've tried it these other ways.

00:17:23,522 --> 00:17:26,526
SPEAKER_0:  There's all these negative consequences, you have all these slums.

00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  You have people getting, you know.

00:17:28,866 --> 00:17:30,750
SPEAKER_0:  fired and then they have no recourse.

00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  You have women with ten kids.

00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  and they can't feed their kids, infant mortality, you don't have sanitation, you don't have food, everyone's illiterate and uneducated.

00:17:40,514 --> 00:17:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  And then here's saying, look.

00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  If we all chip in together, everyone will have clothes, everyone will have food, everyone will be educated, everyone will do their part. It's going to be rough in the short period.

00:17:50,082 --> 00:17:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  That's a very compelling...

00:17:52,226 --> 00:17:56,382
SPEAKER_0:  case to be made for communism. It's really easy in many ways.

00:17:56,738 --> 00:17:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  when something hasn't been tried.

00:17:58,754 --> 00:17:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  to make it sound.

00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  compelling.

00:18:01,762 --> 00:18:03,934
SPEAKER_0:  because you just talk about how great it's gonna be.

00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:05,534
SPEAKER_0:  And then no one.

00:18:06,082 --> 00:18:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  No one f-

00:18:07,298 --> 00:18:18,878
SPEAKER_0:  You know, people are always arguing about how like Venezuela and Sweden, like, oh, you want democratic socialism to be like Sweden, you don't want it to be like Venezuela. The Venezuelans didn't vote for Venezuela, they voted for Sweden. They ended up with Venezuela.

00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  So it's, I think.

00:18:21,698 --> 00:18:24,222
SPEAKER_0:  And the thing with communism, especially at that era.

00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,526
SPEAKER_0:  It was very much a-

00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:27,806
SPEAKER_0:  correlated.

00:18:28,098 --> 00:18:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  with people who are too smart for their own good.

00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,022
SPEAKER_0:  because they had the idea that.

00:18:33,314 --> 00:18:34,750
SPEAKER_0:  if we are just put in charge.

00:18:35,234 --> 00:18:36,478
SPEAKER_0:  instead of these like.

00:18:37,314 --> 00:18:40,446
SPEAKER_0:  business for people or these heirs to great estates.

00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  if the people who are smart and get it, like us.

00:18:44,002 --> 00:18:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  I don't mean you and me, the people at the time who are advocating for it.

00:18:47,074 --> 00:18:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  Once we're in charge, since we're good people and we want what's best for everyone, um, we're going to make sure everyone's taken care of. And, you know, they always talked about how much they cared about the little guy.

00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  So I'm sure some of them meant it a lot and like, look, if the guy in charge.

00:19:01,634 --> 00:19:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  is very much concerned with the little guy. He's not going to slip between the cracks.

00:19:05,282 --> 00:19:07,102
SPEAKER_0:  and it's just going to be absolutely great.

00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  and we don't have to worry about.

00:19:09,762 --> 00:19:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  the capitalist class just basically exploiting people and having these huge estates.

00:19:15,874 --> 00:19:18,110
SPEAKER_0:  while these people can't even feed their own families.

00:19:18,306 --> 00:19:22,142
SPEAKER_1:  Since we have a little bit of momentum, can you steal me on the case for socialism?

00:19:23,138 --> 00:19:23,934
SPEAKER_1:  At that time...

00:19:24,322 --> 00:19:25,054
SPEAKER_1:  and even today.

00:19:25,922 --> 00:19:26,942
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if it's...

00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,982
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if there's a rhyme and a...

00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,958
SPEAKER_1:  similarity to those.

00:19:33,314 --> 00:19:39,669
SPEAKER_1:  to socialism was implemented at that time and what could possibly be implemented today, but maybe you can dance between the two.

00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:42,302
SPEAKER_0:  The Steelman argument for socialism is...

00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:46,110
SPEAKER_0:  if you have everything up to private industry.

00:19:46,754 --> 00:19:48,702
SPEAKER_0:  You do not have a guarantee.

00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,006
SPEAKER_0:  that someone won't fall between the cracks.

00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  And the other concern is...

00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:57,214
SPEAKER_0:  in any other context if someone is let's suppose mentally ill.

00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,262
SPEAKER_0:  right? Through no fault of their own.

00:19:59,682 --> 00:20:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  And they are, or someone's handicapped, you know, they can't.

00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  feed themselves or mentally disabled or something like that.

00:20:06,082 --> 00:20:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  if you have everything up to charity.

00:20:08,226 --> 00:20:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  some.

00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,614
SPEAKER_0:  if you see this with endangered species, right?

00:20:11,874 --> 00:20:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  the species that are cute.

00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  It's easy to raise money for them and protect them.

00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  Some weird.

00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  kind of frog somewhere that no one cares about.

00:20:19,074 --> 00:20:25,182
SPEAKER_0:  You can't raise money for it. There's people's interests are to what they find interesting. So if someone is.

00:20:26,338 --> 00:20:29,822
SPEAKER_0:  someone who's like not socially appealing in some way, whatever capacity.

00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,582
SPEAKER_0:  they're going to fall between the cracks.

00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,510
SPEAKER_0:  and they're screwed.

00:20:32,962 --> 00:20:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  Under socialism, if you have a government taking care of everything,

00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,558
SPEAKER_0:  No one is left behind.

00:20:38,978 --> 00:20:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  You are guaranteed.

00:20:40,578 --> 00:20:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  that.

00:20:41,218 --> 00:20:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  The lowest of the low and the worst of the worst are still going to make sure that they're not starving the street.

00:20:47,554 --> 00:20:51,646
SPEAKER_0:  or just left behind. So that is a big moral case.

00:20:52,066 --> 00:20:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  to be made for having the state.

00:20:54,114 --> 00:20:57,342
SPEAKER_0:  running everything. In terms of economics, it's a lot harder.

00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,902
SPEAKER_0:  But the argument there would be

00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  It's why it's not fair.

00:21:02,914 --> 00:21:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  a term which.

00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,758
SPEAKER_0:  in my view does not actually have a good meaning.

00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  but it's not fair that...

00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,046
SPEAKER_0:  because you were born a Rockefeller.

00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  and I was born in Poland.

00:21:12,802 --> 00:21:15,390
SPEAKER_0:  that you never have to worry about food for the rest of your life.

00:21:15,714 --> 00:21:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  whereas I have to worry about...

00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:17,886
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

00:21:18,594 --> 00:21:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  paying for a doctor for my kid. Like you just, you won this lottery when you were born and now I have to be screwed and have to respect all your property. Why?

00:21:26,178 --> 00:21:27,326
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:21:27,714 --> 00:21:31,518
SPEAKER_0:  That is another strong argument to be made for socialism.

00:21:31,778 --> 00:21:33,150
SPEAKER_0:  And the other argument is...

00:21:33,474 --> 00:21:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  If you have a...

00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  media apparatus.

00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,038
SPEAKER_0:  that is operated under

00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  profit-seeking principles.

00:21:41,538 --> 00:21:44,318
SPEAKER_0:  It is going to feed into people's worst.

00:21:45,218 --> 00:21:49,118
SPEAKER_0:  qualities, most basic animal-like qualities and sensationless qualities.

00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  and will be used as a mechanism for capitalist control, whereas if the government, which represents all of us, goes higher, the government will stop.

00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,438
SPEAKER_0:  is running things.

00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  then everyone will have a right.

00:21:59,874 --> 00:22:03,999
SPEAKER_0:  have their voice heard and won't be manipulated. That's the argument.

00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:07,262
SPEAKER_1:  the reaching towards the stateless version.

00:22:08,706 --> 00:22:12,286
SPEAKER_1:  sort of because you espouse ideas of anarchism.

00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,558
SPEAKER_1:  it kind of has the same conclusion.

00:22:15,202 --> 00:22:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  which is reaching towards the removal of the state to where we, I guess, have.

00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:23,134
SPEAKER_1:  some distributed reallocation of resources that are...

00:22:23,362 --> 00:22:24,487
SPEAKER_1:  quote unquote, fair.

00:22:24,487 --> 00:22:30,622
SPEAKER_0:  thing is the Marxist vision of the state withering away and becoming anarchism.

00:22:31,042 --> 00:22:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  It's really kind of like the underpants gnomes.

00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:36,958
SPEAKER_0:  Because it's like, step one.

00:22:37,602 --> 00:22:38,727
SPEAKER_0:  You have marks. I missed the You have marks.

00:22:38,727 --> 00:22:39,166
SPEAKER_1:

00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:40,638
SPEAKER_1:  Unsay.

00:22:41,282 --> 00:22:42,302
SPEAKER_0:  You have full.

00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  communism, the states running everything, including education.

00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,254
SPEAKER_0:  Step 2? Step 3?

00:22:48,514 --> 00:22:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  So their idea was that after enough time...

00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,462
SPEAKER_0:  the nature of man himself.

00:22:55,042 --> 00:23:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  was going to change. And then the government would be superfluous because we would all be.

00:23:00,674 --> 00:23:01,470
SPEAKER_0:  uh, equal.

00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:05,822
SPEAKER_0:  and we would all naturally or socially, whatever term they would use.

00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  want to.

00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,598
SPEAKER_0:  act the part that we would need to.

00:23:10,114 --> 00:23:11,390
SPEAKER_0:  And in fact, Reagan...

00:23:11,778 --> 00:23:17,246
SPEAKER_0:  had a great joke about this where there were two commissars, I think, in Moscow.

00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  And when they're walking around, they're going, is this it? Have we done it? Have we reached full communism? Oh no, it's going to get a hell of a lot worse.

00:23:25,794 --> 00:23:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  So, you know, that's kind of the counterargument to that.

00:23:29,858 --> 00:23:30,430
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think?

00:23:31,426 --> 00:23:33,758
SPEAKER_1:  Culture, society can't change the nature of man.

00:23:34,274 --> 00:23:34,622
SPEAKER_1:  No.

00:23:35,394 --> 00:23:36,574
SPEAKER_1:  So no matter...

00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:42,846
SPEAKER_1:  You don't think this idea that, for example, America has been founded on that all men are created to equal.

00:23:43,746 --> 00:23:45,182
SPEAKER_1:  that that idea...

00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,806
SPEAKER_1:  can't permeate the culture and

00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,214
SPEAKER_1:  Thereby...

00:23:49,442 --> 00:23:50,750
SPEAKER_1:  change how we see each other.

00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:51,582
SPEAKER_1:  Howie.

00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,582
SPEAKER_1:  Think of the basic worth of a human being, and thereby change our nature.

00:23:55,714 --> 00:23:57,726
SPEAKER_0:  Doesn't change, that's epigenetic, I don't-

00:23:58,114 --> 00:23:58,558
SPEAKER_0:  Think the-

00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,350
SPEAKER_0:  that changes the nature of man.

00:24:00,642 --> 00:24:01,758
SPEAKER_0:  I think, for example.

00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  If I say someone at which I agree with that someone is innocent until proven guilty.

00:24:06,114 --> 00:24:07,294
SPEAKER_0:  They're not literally innocent.

00:24:07,586 --> 00:24:13,054
SPEAKER_0:  They're regarded in a legal context as innocent, but that person is or is not a murderer or thief or so on and so forth.

00:24:13,346 --> 00:24:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  so we can.

00:24:15,394 --> 00:24:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  legally and ethically regard everyone as equal.

00:24:19,266 --> 00:24:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  But as Thomas Sowell pointed out, a human being isn't even equal to himself over the course of a day. Twins who were genetic clones are not equal to one another. So it is a- EXמע Quran

00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,334
SPEAKER_0:  important thing legally.

00:24:30,562 --> 00:24:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  and it's a good yardstick, but it's not.

00:24:33,378 --> 00:24:34,503
SPEAKER_0:  Literally true. Im pain 100 boil, the

00:24:34,503 --> 00:24:37,054
SPEAKER_1:  think that law becomes ethics so we

00:24:37,378 --> 00:24:37,918
SPEAKER_1:  Um,

00:24:38,882 --> 00:24:42,206
SPEAKER_1:  That idea of justice starts to like...

00:24:42,722 --> 00:24:43,902
SPEAKER_1:  We start to internalize it.

00:24:44,162 --> 00:24:44,798
SPEAKER_1:  that we just...

00:24:45,634 --> 00:24:47,509
SPEAKER_1:  the way we behave, the way we think about the world.

00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  No, I think it's a complete-

00:24:50,082 --> 00:24:50,814
SPEAKER_0:  red herring.

00:24:51,106 --> 00:24:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  because

00:24:52,002 --> 00:24:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  No one is.

00:24:53,026 --> 00:24:54,142
SPEAKER_1:  No, you're right, Harry.

00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,166
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

00:24:55,586 --> 00:24:57,598
SPEAKER_0:  See what I did there.

00:24:58,306 --> 00:24:58,782
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  because

00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,830
SPEAKER_0:  people are still going to always prefer their family to strangers.

00:25:05,282 --> 00:25:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  or they're in group to out group.

00:25:07,074 --> 00:25:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  So in terms of if you're going to have equality, that means it's going to not matter to you whether someone is your mom.

00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:18,014
SPEAKER_0:  where someone is, you know, someone down the street, and I don't see how that will ever become the case.

00:25:18,498 --> 00:25:18,974
SPEAKER_0:  Do you think it would?

00:25:19,106 --> 00:25:20,318
SPEAKER_1:  it would be possible.

00:25:20,578 --> 00:25:21,950
SPEAKER_1:  if you weren't intellectual.

00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:26,750
SPEAKER_1:  Like you are at the beginning of the 20th century. Would you be able to predict?

00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,830
SPEAKER_1:  the rest of the 20th century.

00:25:29,026 --> 00:25:29,406
SPEAKER_0:  No.

00:25:29,922 --> 00:25:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think at all. I think there were so many

00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,190
SPEAKER_0:  Out of nowhere turns.

00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  that no one would have seen them coming. And as an example,

00:25:41,026 --> 00:25:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  Lenin seizing power.

00:25:42,882 --> 00:25:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:25:43,586 --> 00:25:45,918
SPEAKER_0:  making the Bolshevik revolution a reality.

00:25:46,466 --> 00:25:49,214
SPEAKER_0:  was regarded as utopian and insane.

00:25:49,698 --> 00:25:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  The fact that he pulled it off is...

00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  close to miraculous, and it was quite literally unprecedented.

00:25:55,362 --> 00:25:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  The fact that so that's a very big one.

00:25:58,434 --> 00:26:00,382
SPEAKER_1:  Which aspect of it sorry to interrupt?

00:26:00,706 --> 00:26:06,110
SPEAKER_1:  which aspect was hard to predict, that a singular figure with just some ideas would be able to take so much power.

00:26:06,594 --> 00:26:12,679
SPEAKER_0:  and maintain that power and remake that society so drastically, so quickly, despite such opposition.

00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:16,894
SPEAKER_1:  Also, not just a set of temporary protests by hooligans that lead to

00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,206
SPEAKER_1:  um...

00:26:18,594 --> 00:26:22,719
SPEAKER_1:  the short term but then stabilizes but literally changes the entirety of the system.

00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, Ludendorff, who was the German general, he's like, all right, we got to get the Russians out of World War I.

00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:33,214
SPEAKER_0:  He's the one who's like, all right, let's get this lunatic Lenin who already tried and failed.

00:26:33,442 --> 00:26:36,222
SPEAKER_0:  to have a revolution in Russia. Let's send him back there.

00:26:36,514 --> 00:26:42,270
SPEAKER_0:  And he's just going to cause problems to everybody. And it's going to be great because it's going to weaken Russia and then our Eastern Front.

00:26:42,626 --> 00:26:43,838
SPEAKER_0:  isn't going to have to be a problem.

00:26:44,194 --> 00:26:45,726
SPEAKER_0:  And then to his surprise and.

00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,870
SPEAKER_0:  everyone else is including, you know.

00:26:48,194 --> 00:26:50,078
SPEAKER_0:  anarchists and communists worldwide.

00:26:50,466 --> 00:26:55,870
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, they pulled off this, you know, October revolution and then for a while it's like, all right. I mean.

00:26:56,098 --> 00:26:58,558
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I think my understanding is even people at the time...

00:26:58,946 --> 00:27:01,342
SPEAKER_0:  in St. Petersburg and in Moscow were like.

00:27:01,826 --> 00:27:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  What does this even mean, right? Like no one took it seriously?

00:27:04,898 --> 00:27:10,782
SPEAKER_0:  And then very quickly you had the CHECA and the secret police and all these other kind of implementations.

00:27:11,106 --> 00:27:13,982
SPEAKER_0:  of the communist state and people are like, oh.

00:27:14,338 --> 00:27:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  They're not messing around.

00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  But they're like, all right, this is not going to last for long. And you know, the USA, the US and day.

00:27:21,634 --> 00:27:27,614
SPEAKER_0:  We didn't even recognize the Soviet Union's legitimacy for a very long time. There were no diplomatic relations. And after a certain point, it's like...

00:27:28,354 --> 00:27:40,318
SPEAKER_0:  who's the, if you don't recognize Lenin and Stalin's government, who's the government of this, of Russia or the Soviet Union? Is it the Tsar? Like you have to recognize it. It's just, they're not going anywhere. So that was something that was not.

00:27:40,706 --> 00:27:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  I think very...

00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,574
SPEAKER_0:  predictable. The Great Depression.

00:27:45,026 --> 00:27:47,742
SPEAKER_0:  In retrospect, there were certain things that were predictable, but...

00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  It was not at all the case that it needed to last as long as it did in the states as FDR made it do. So there's all sorts of things. I mean, if they...

00:27:56,578 --> 00:27:57,694
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, um,

00:27:58,434 --> 00:27:58,878
SPEAKER_0:  F

00:27:59,106 --> 00:28:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  fought Germany's remilitarization near World War II could have been prevented if you didn't have the Treaty of Versailles.

00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:07,966
SPEAKER_0:  Would you have the hyperinflation? Would you have Hitler? These are all, I think-

00:28:08,546 --> 00:28:15,454
SPEAKER_0:  choose your own adventure moments where things could have gone in other directions. I don't believe this kind of idea. This is a very Marxist idea.

00:28:15,682 --> 00:28:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  that history is inevitable and once you start with certain premises the contradictions kind of unfold. I think it's ridiculous.

00:28:23,586 --> 00:28:25,918
SPEAKER_1:  I feel there's power in the Santa Claus outfit.

00:28:26,274 --> 00:28:26,686
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah?

00:28:27,042 --> 00:28:29,182
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, it's a fundamentally communist.

00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:30,270
SPEAKER_1:  idea, right?

00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:31,838
SPEAKER_1:  How?

00:28:32,066 --> 00:28:34,238
SPEAKER_1:  Arbitrary redistribution of wealth.

00:28:34,466 --> 00:28:35,678
SPEAKER_0:  It's not redistribution.

00:28:36,354 --> 00:28:40,670
SPEAKER_1:  At least I decide who's good and bad. Only I, only I know.

00:28:40,962 --> 00:28:41,406
SPEAKER_1:  This.

00:28:42,274 --> 00:28:42,814
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:28:43,074 --> 00:28:46,366
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I am somehow getting funding from someone, right? No?

00:28:47,874 --> 00:28:52,414
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, listen, I have so much to teach you, little Michael.

00:28:52,802 --> 00:28:53,438
SPEAKER_1:  Workshop.

00:28:53,922 --> 00:28:56,478
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. And how many people do you think are employed?

00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,590
SPEAKER_1:  in this workshop. The

00:28:58,818 --> 00:28:59,198
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

00:28:59,778 --> 00:29:01,653
SPEAKER_0:  i don't know how many of them the workshop uh...

00:29:01,653 --> 00:29:09,438
SPEAKER_1:  I think the rest of you are gonna have to look into it. No, anyway, and the red colors and everything. Is that the biggest holiday of all time, Christmas? Like just in terms of.

00:29:10,306 --> 00:29:12,181
SPEAKER_1:  the intensity of the festivities.

00:29:12,181 --> 00:29:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  No, I think Christmas is a very recent-

00:29:14,914 --> 00:29:17,694
SPEAKER_0:  phenomenon. I think historically it was not a big deal.

00:29:17,826 --> 00:29:20,062
SPEAKER_1:  Now I know in historical case it has not been, but in terms of...

00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,526
SPEAKER_1:  how much it captivates.

00:29:22,978 --> 00:29:24,062
SPEAKER_1:  how intense it is.

00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:29,915
SPEAKER_1:  I guess from a capitalist perspective, like how much is going on, how visual it is, how intense it is, how it grabs a whole.

00:29:29,915 --> 00:29:33,534
SPEAKER_0:  population. I think it's because the idea of Christmas is

00:29:34,434 --> 00:29:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  probably one of the most powerful holiday ideas.

00:29:37,922 --> 00:29:44,574
SPEAKER_0:  Easter is probably up there. Easter is obviously up there because you have Christ dying, his resurrection. So that's kind of a big one.

00:29:44,802 --> 00:29:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  But Christmas is the symbol of

00:29:47,778 --> 00:29:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  brotherhood and kindness and magnanimity. You know, one of the things I despise

00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:57,726
SPEAKER_0:  about our culture is this glory and something I'm fighting very heavily with this book or at least attempting to.

00:29:57,986 --> 00:29:59,614
SPEAKER_0:  Is this glorification of cynicism?

00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:03,518
SPEAKER_0:  This kind of like, oh you like this song, that's cute, stupid.

00:30:03,938 --> 00:30:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  Whereas Christmas is the one time of year

00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  where you could be happy.

00:30:08,834 --> 00:30:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  Enjoy us!

00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,134
SPEAKER_0:  and kind.

00:30:12,162 --> 00:30:13,630
SPEAKER_0:  People don't get to roll their eyes at you.

00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,574
SPEAKER_0:  They get to stop being too cool for school.

00:30:16,994 --> 00:30:18,654
SPEAKER_0:  and they get to be like, you know.

00:30:18,914 --> 00:30:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  I enjoy your friendship, your...

00:30:21,538 --> 00:30:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  my sister, my brother, my dad, my mom, whatever.

00:30:24,162 --> 00:30:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  And...

00:30:25,154 --> 00:30:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  It was Ayn Rand's favorite holiday.

00:30:27,874 --> 00:30:28,734
SPEAKER_0:  I adore it.

00:30:29,026 --> 00:30:30,430
SPEAKER_0:  especially Christmas in New York.

00:30:30,946 --> 00:30:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  And it's just this idea of like...

00:30:33,282 --> 00:30:34,302
SPEAKER_0:  Even though we're called.

00:30:34,594 --> 00:30:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  and it's dark outside, you know, it's still this kind of like, it's still cozy.

00:30:38,914 --> 00:30:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  And you, and the next, let's hope the next year is, because with, with, with Russians, Dmitrovskaya Sena comes on New Year's.

00:30:46,754 --> 00:30:50,878
SPEAKER_0:  So it's kind of like, let's make this next year an even better one. So it's very much the holiday of hope.

00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:51,870
SPEAKER_1:  Enjoy.

00:30:52,866 --> 00:30:54,750
SPEAKER_1:  and like love for family for.

00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,795
SPEAKER_0:  Friendship and kindness and benevolence. Yeah

00:30:57,795 --> 00:30:58,846
SPEAKER_1:  like almost the whole.

00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,798
SPEAKER_1:  that whole rat race of...

00:31:01,346 --> 00:31:06,485
SPEAKER_1:  Chasing material possessions and all that gets put on hold for beef moment. It's just all goes quiet

00:31:06,485 --> 00:31:11,735
SPEAKER_0:  But it's also about giving people material possessions like here, like I value you. This is something that brings you joy.

00:31:11,735 --> 00:31:13,758
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, you're right in the book, which by the way...

00:31:14,594 --> 00:31:16,382
SPEAKER_1:  people should go get buy it right now.

00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,238
SPEAKER_1:  if you support this podcast.

00:31:18,818 --> 00:31:21,534
SPEAKER_1:  Or if you support the ridiculous outfits that Michaels wear.

00:31:21,794 --> 00:31:22,366
SPEAKER_1:  Where's?

00:31:22,978 --> 00:31:25,246
SPEAKER_1:  The more books you buy, the more outfits he is going to wear.

00:31:25,346 --> 00:31:26,622
SPEAKER_0:  I've got two.

00:31:26,882 --> 00:31:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  my next two appearances in the show assuming I don't burn this bridge.

00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  I've got some good one. This bridge.

00:31:32,514 --> 00:31:35,294
SPEAKER_1:  It has been burning for a long time.

00:31:35,746 --> 00:31:39,198
SPEAKER_1:  We've been going across the road by canoe at this point.

00:31:39,618 --> 00:31:40,990
SPEAKER_1:  Next time we're going to be swimming.

00:31:42,466 --> 00:31:46,591
SPEAKER_0:  How the hell are you gonna swim? You're made out of lead!

00:31:46,591 --> 00:31:47,198
SPEAKER_1:  That's true.

00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:50,270
SPEAKER_1:  Sink to the bottom, get dragged across by rope.

00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:54,878
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, you write in the book, cynics like to lie and call themselves realists.

00:31:55,138 --> 00:31:58,910
SPEAKER_1:  Hoping for positive outcomes can thus be dismissed as being naive.

00:31:59,362 --> 00:32:00,190
SPEAKER_1:  or utopian.

00:32:00,866 --> 00:32:03,678
SPEAKER_1:  Can you elaborate on this point? Just like you said right now, I mean,

00:32:05,218 --> 00:32:06,238
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like a-

00:32:07,394 --> 00:32:09,054
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if it's a fundamental-

00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:11,934
SPEAKER_1:  characteristic of our society today or just

00:32:12,546 --> 00:32:14,014
SPEAKER_1:  societies throughout history.

00:32:14,338 --> 00:32:15,454
SPEAKER_1:  But there is a cynicism.

00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,790
SPEAKER_1:  you write in Soviet Union or Zemun.

00:32:18,114 --> 00:32:18,718
SPEAKER_1:  Really.

00:32:19,074 --> 00:32:20,199
SPEAKER_1:  There's a deep cynicism.

00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:21,342
SPEAKER_0:  That was good at the end, yeah.

00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:22,526
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:32:22,786 --> 00:32:23,390
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:27,582
SPEAKER_1:  But there is a cynicism today as well, at least in public discourse. Yes.

00:32:28,258 --> 00:32:29,726
SPEAKER_1:  Why does it happen in a-

00:32:29,954 --> 00:32:30,878
SPEAKER_1:  How can we fight it?

00:32:31,266 --> 00:32:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

00:32:32,066 --> 00:32:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  I think it is.

00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  Easy.

00:32:35,906 --> 00:32:37,662
SPEAKER_0:  to be like, eh, everything sucks.

00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:44,062
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I had my friend Lux, she was a blogger, she was an author.

00:32:44,482 --> 00:32:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  She had this great line because we worked in media.

00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:51,486
SPEAKER_0:  And she's like, if you're at a party and someone starts talking about a new app or website.

00:32:51,938 --> 00:32:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  and you don't know anything about it, just say, Oh, I was on that for a while, it sucked.

00:32:55,522 --> 00:33:00,670
SPEAKER_0:  And that's all you need to say. I'm like, Lex, that's a great line. But I think-

00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:01,598
SPEAKER_0:  It is.

00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  And especially, I'm sure you had to, you experienced this as well with your family. I certainly did with mine.

00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:08,254
SPEAKER_0:  There is this.

00:33:08,706 --> 00:33:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  idea especially in Russian culture but in American culture to some extent as well.

00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:16,446
SPEAKER_0:  where if you have aspirations...

00:33:16,898 --> 00:33:18,974
SPEAKER_0:  I remember there was this show called Russian Dolls.

00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  It was.

00:33:20,738 --> 00:33:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, I just got it, like the Matryoshka. Okay, I just got it, that's the name, okay. The show is called Russian Dolls. It was about Brighton Beach, which is the Russian Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn. It was supposed to be their version of Jersey Shore. It was on Lifetime and it had no ratings. And I remember the last four episodes, they had to burn them, so they just ran it through like 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. one day.

00:33:38,594 --> 00:33:42,846
SPEAKER_0:  And there was this one scene where the, when the girls, I forget her name, probably Natalia.

00:33:43,298 --> 00:33:44,702
SPEAKER_0:  and she'd been in college.

00:33:45,794 --> 00:33:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  and she had been.

00:33:48,034 --> 00:33:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  wondering which one to major in.

00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:52,990
SPEAKER_0:  Right? And this story was so perfect, I'm sure I've told it before.

00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  and she took an aptitude test.

00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  and she went with her mom to get like mani-pedis or something.

00:33:58,018 --> 00:34:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  And she goes, mom, you know, I've had like 80 majors. I didn't know what I wanted to do.

00:34:01,698 --> 00:34:04,542
SPEAKER_0:  And she goes, I took this app to test. It really made sense to me.

00:34:04,866 --> 00:34:10,654
SPEAKER_0:  I am going to go to law school. I want to be a lawyer. This is something I enjoy. And the first thing out of her mom's mouth is how are you going to pay for it?

00:34:11,394 --> 00:34:19,486
SPEAKER_0:  And the girl, and I really relate it, because if you didn't have this Russian upbringing, you watched it, you would think her reaction was completely insane. She just lost it.

00:34:19,714 --> 00:34:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  Just screaming. She's like.

00:34:21,346 --> 00:34:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  People pay for law school all the time.

00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:26,526
SPEAKER_0:  I'll figure out a way. Why is your first reaction to look for a problem?

00:34:26,786 --> 00:34:28,734
SPEAKER_0:  Why is your first response to be like...

00:34:28,962 --> 00:34:45,278
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, wait, are you sure you've thought this through? I have been struggling with one problem for years, what I wanted to do for a living. And now like, as soon as I solve this one big problem of identity, your first reaction is like, let's find a new problem. Why is that your instead of let's figure out how we're going to pay for it.

00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  and that kind of approach.

00:34:48,034 --> 00:34:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  Is so.

00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:50,398
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:56,126
SPEAKER_0:  deadly and it gnaws at you. I don't like giving people advice because-

00:34:56,514 --> 00:35:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  Who the hell am I? And also if I don't know the context of the problem, I'm not informed enough to give advice. But this is a piece of advice that I do for comfort giving. If you are someone who has around you, then you should be aware of the context of the problem.

00:35:06,946 --> 00:35:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  people who as soon as you have any accomplishment or any hope

00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  that their first reaction is to be like, well, what about this?

00:35:13,762 --> 00:35:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  you have to get rid of them or sit them down, maybe give them a chance.

00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:19,614
SPEAKER_0:  because that is something that is such so-

00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  demoralizing.

00:35:21,506 --> 00:35:24,030
SPEAKER_0:  and it drains you and it's like.

00:35:24,866 --> 00:35:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the example I've used all the time, all the time, all the time.

00:35:28,738 --> 00:35:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  I say if you want to be an author.

00:35:31,426 --> 00:35:32,862
SPEAKER_0:  You can go to any bookstore.

00:35:33,442 --> 00:35:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  and look at all the shitty, shitty books, like The White Pill.

00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:38,494
SPEAKER_0:  And you could say to yourself,

00:35:39,042 --> 00:35:40,158
SPEAKER_0:  I could be the shitty author.

00:35:40,578 --> 00:35:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  You don't have to be Hemingway.

00:35:41,698 --> 00:35:43,934
SPEAKER_1:  So people should buy your book just to know.

00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,822
SPEAKER_1:  It doesn't take much.

00:35:45,954 --> 00:35:49,598
SPEAKER_0:  It really does not take much. What shitty writing is all about.

00:35:50,434 --> 00:35:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  and boring.

00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:51,998
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:35:52,098 --> 00:35:53,566
SPEAKER_1:  You could just pick a random-

00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:59,643
SPEAKER_1:  random period in history and just write a bunch of crap about it and put a pretty stamp on the cover and just go

00:35:59,643 --> 00:36:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  It was pretty. Yeah. Yeah

00:36:01,634 --> 00:36:03,742
SPEAKER_0:  But I mean, like for you, right? Like not.

00:36:04,322 --> 00:36:06,741
SPEAKER_0:  You don't, I don't mean you let, but. I was raised by the wolves.

00:36:06,741 --> 00:36:07,134
SPEAKER_1:  If you

00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:07,806
SPEAKER_0:  You

00:36:08,034 --> 00:36:09,054
SPEAKER_0:  The wolf bots.

00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,198
SPEAKER_0:  There's lots of stand-up comedians.

00:36:11,618 --> 00:36:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  who aren't.

00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  Jerry Seinfeld. Yeah. Right? You don't have to be Joe Rogan.

00:36:16,546 --> 00:36:18,654
SPEAKER_0:  You could be someone who's got a medium audience.

00:36:18,978 --> 00:36:22,654
SPEAKER_0:  and are enjoying it. So like the idea that like something has to be

00:36:23,298 --> 00:36:27,166
SPEAKER_0:  You have to be a massive superstar or your failure is also ridiculous, but that's cynicism.

00:36:28,066 --> 00:36:30,878
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, you can even be a failed comedian like Dave Smith.

00:36:31,138 --> 00:36:31,582
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:36,286
SPEAKER_1:  I don't this is generic name I came up with as an example.

00:36:36,706 --> 00:36:38,878
SPEAKER_1:  I think he has a podcast of some kind. Maybe so...

00:36:39,106 --> 00:36:39,422
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

00:36:39,938 --> 00:36:42,563
SPEAKER_1:  Not very funny, I don't know why he would call himself a comedian, but-

00:36:42,563 --> 00:36:43,742
SPEAKER_0:  UB is being ironic.

00:36:44,386 --> 00:36:44,958
SPEAKER_0:  I'm sorry.

00:36:45,474 --> 00:36:46,750
SPEAKER_1:  Um, don't you think?

00:36:47,074 --> 00:36:50,014
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so even then you could do...

00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  something special. Remember what you did with me in the movie theater.

00:36:53,026 --> 00:36:53,438
SPEAKER_1:  What's that?

00:36:54,498 --> 00:36:58,110
SPEAKER_1:  I don't, is, oh, you continue. Can you explain the jokes? Cause I can't.

00:36:58,274 --> 00:37:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not explaining jokes, I'm wearing lipstick. That's not enough.

00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,670
SPEAKER_1:  Now I remember what you did to me in a movie theater.

00:37:05,282 --> 00:37:07,157
SPEAKER_1:  And you wore lipstick that night too.

00:37:07,157 --> 00:37:08,094
SPEAKER_0:  not when I was done.

00:37:08,962 --> 00:37:12,222
SPEAKER_1:  People for sure will think this feels like a gay porn.

00:37:13,122 --> 00:37:16,094
SPEAKER_0:  Like a very long intro. Because we're not wearing pants.

00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  Yes.

00:37:17,218 --> 00:37:20,382
SPEAKER_1:  There's many reasons why this feels like this and the outfits.

00:37:20,674 --> 00:37:22,238
SPEAKER_1:  and just everything about this.

00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. How would you know?

00:37:25,282 --> 00:37:27,454
SPEAKER_1:  I, my friend, I have stories.

00:37:27,586 --> 00:37:29,438
SPEAKER_0:  I thought I don't have friends.

00:37:29,986 --> 00:37:31,111
SPEAKER_0:  I- this is-

00:37:31,111 --> 00:37:34,494
SPEAKER_1:  They're all suspiciously named either Lex or Lux.

00:37:34,818 --> 00:37:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  or stuff like that. Like you lack complete creativity.

00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  just like in the writing of your book. Yeah,

00:37:41,762 --> 00:37:47,774
SPEAKER_1:  It's like you didn't even use like a thesaurus for your book. The same words over and over and over.

00:37:48,162 --> 00:37:51,742
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, the sad thing about the cynicism is like...

00:37:52,578 --> 00:37:55,203
SPEAKER_1:  I don't think it's just a Russian thing.

00:37:55,203 --> 00:38:02,430
SPEAKER_0:  I think the people... No, let me interrupt you because I didn't finish what you were saying earlier. In America, it's not just a Russian thing. In American culture...

00:38:03,042 --> 00:38:04,542
SPEAKER_0:  If you have like a

00:38:05,122 --> 00:38:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  sitcom or a musical.

00:38:07,106 --> 00:38:08,830
SPEAKER_0:  It's regarded as less legitimate.

00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,462
SPEAKER_0:  than a drama.

00:38:10,818 --> 00:38:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  Right? Like if something's got to be about someone struggling.

00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  or someone's suffering, whereas this is like a joyous, happy story, like maybe something like Pixar, right?

00:38:18,722 --> 00:38:22,014
SPEAKER_0:  Like sure they have conflict and they're going for something, but it's overall the

00:38:22,306 --> 00:38:26,654
SPEAKER_0:  background the universe is taking in is very joyous and happy. What is regarded?

00:38:26,882 --> 00:38:27,710
SPEAKER_0:  artistically.

00:38:28,034 --> 00:38:29,118
SPEAKER_0:  as less legitimate.

00:38:29,442 --> 00:38:33,438
SPEAKER_0:  than something which is dark and the background is despair.

00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  And that very subtly.

00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  sends a very, to me,

00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  pernicious message.

00:38:38,786 --> 00:38:40,222
SPEAKER_0:  that the, you know, that.

00:38:40,482 --> 00:38:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  What's real is despair.

00:38:42,562 --> 00:38:50,174
SPEAKER_0:  and happiness is the aberration. And I think if you have that as your mindset, you're setting yourself up for maybe not failure, but certainly not happiness.

00:38:52,002 --> 00:38:53,406
SPEAKER_0:  But that's in a...

00:38:53,538 --> 00:38:57,694
SPEAKER_1:  the figures, the ideas that the culture elevates, but at the local.

00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:02,846
SPEAKER_1:  personal life of parents and teachers, that still happens a lot. in russia and here just

00:39:03,202 --> 00:39:03,774
SPEAKER_1:  My whole...

00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,950
SPEAKER_1:  life especially because I'm a weirdo.

00:39:06,882 --> 00:39:07,454
SPEAKER_1:  I've been.

00:39:07,714 --> 00:39:09,566
SPEAKER_1:  kind of told to...

00:39:10,914 --> 00:39:12,158
SPEAKER_1:  Basically be less weird.

00:39:13,122 --> 00:39:13,886
SPEAKER_1:  be, uh...

00:39:15,074 --> 00:39:15,422
SPEAKER_1:

00:39:17,506 --> 00:39:18,686
SPEAKER_1:  There's a kind of.

00:39:19,426 --> 00:39:22,398
SPEAKER_1:  sense in where there's a certain path you're supposed to take in life.

00:39:23,522 --> 00:39:27,998
SPEAKER_1:  And every time you have a little bit of success on those very specifically defined paths.

00:39:28,322 --> 00:39:30,398
SPEAKER_1:  you're pushed to do more and more and more on those paths.

00:39:30,626 --> 00:39:35,870
SPEAKER_1:  as opposed to celebrating the full complexity of the weirdo that each one of us is, and I certainly am.

00:39:36,226 --> 00:39:36,958
SPEAKER_1:  And I just.

00:39:37,378 --> 00:39:38,142
SPEAKER_1:  Teachers.

00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,550
SPEAKER_1:  even friends.

00:39:40,354 --> 00:39:41,566
SPEAKER_1:  and certainly family.

00:39:42,242 --> 00:39:43,934
SPEAKER_1:  have constantly been...

00:39:44,354 --> 00:39:45,694
SPEAKER_1:  very cynical about

00:39:46,242 --> 00:39:46,622
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:39:46,914 --> 00:39:48,862
SPEAKER_1:  my aspirations, my dreams and so on.

00:39:49,666 --> 00:39:50,046
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

00:39:50,914 --> 00:39:53,694
SPEAKER_1:  I think that actually created a deeply self-critical...

00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:55,038
SPEAKER_1:  Engine in my brain?

00:39:56,514 --> 00:39:57,822
SPEAKER_1:  that I think it ultimately was.

00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:58,750
SPEAKER_1:  Productive.

00:40:00,162 --> 00:40:01,086
SPEAKER_1:  because it was also

00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:01,918
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

00:40:03,138 --> 00:40:07,006
SPEAKER_1:  balanced by just an internal maybe through genetics.

00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:11,294
SPEAKER_1:  I have of optimism about the world, of just seeing the beauty in the world.

00:40:11,682 --> 00:40:13,566
SPEAKER_1:  It is weird looking back.

00:40:14,146 --> 00:40:14,718
SPEAKER_1:  How much do?

00:40:15,202 --> 00:40:17,342
SPEAKER_1:  how much people that love me were trying to...

00:40:17,602 --> 00:40:18,302
SPEAKER_1:  Bring me down.

00:40:18,498 --> 00:40:27,262
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. So strange. It's also very hurtful for me because when I graduated college, it was important for me to be self-made and not take money from my family.

00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:31,870
SPEAKER_0:  And I remember my grandma, this was a huge argument, an ongoing argument.

00:40:32,258 --> 00:40:35,998
SPEAKER_0:  And one time she, you know, as we were leaving, as she was leaving my house, she slipped money in.

00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:39,774
SPEAKER_0:  under the door and I threw it out and it made me so angry.

00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:47,678
SPEAKER_0:  Um, or like one year for my birthday, she gave me, I think like $500, which was a lot of money, you know, when you're like 22 or 23 and I was so pissed.

00:40:48,034 --> 00:40:48,638
SPEAKER_0:  because that.

00:40:49,762 --> 00:40:50,558
SPEAKER_0:  told me.

00:40:50,914 --> 00:40:55,454
SPEAKER_0:  that they didn't believe that I'd be able to feed myself or make it on my own.

00:40:55,842 --> 00:40:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  And I understand their mindset, but it's like...

00:40:59,586 --> 00:41:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not.

00:41:00,354 --> 00:41:01,502
SPEAKER_0:  I wasn't, you know.

00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,646
SPEAKER_0:  I never was never hungry. Like maybe I couldn't.

00:41:04,066 --> 00:41:07,006
SPEAKER_0:  I remember I'd have to wait on the subway because I couldn't afford a cab.

00:41:07,522 --> 00:41:11,422
SPEAKER_0:  But that was a sacrifice I had to make. I had to wait that half hour.

00:41:11,778 --> 00:41:19,390
SPEAKER_0:  It was a huge source and remains a source of enormous tension and contention. And I think also...

00:41:19,874 --> 00:41:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  I'm sure speaking to your upbringing.

00:41:22,338 --> 00:41:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  in their minds, unless you're going into an office, you can't pay the rent. It doesn't make sense.

00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:29,479
SPEAKER_0:  Um, so, but there's.

00:41:29,479 --> 00:41:32,094
SPEAKER_1:  It's just like you said forget the office forget all that

00:41:32,482 --> 00:41:33,182
SPEAKER_1:  No matter what.

00:41:34,082 --> 00:41:34,398
SPEAKER_1:  There's.

00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:35,646
SPEAKER_1:  Always.

00:41:35,938 --> 00:41:37,886
SPEAKER_1:  Whatever you accomplish in life, you always do.

00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,678
SPEAKER_1:  You're always, uh...

00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:40,862
SPEAKER_1:  Negative.

00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:42,622
SPEAKER_1:  about your current position.

00:41:43,362 --> 00:41:44,862
SPEAKER_1:  you always come up with another problem.

00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:49,054
SPEAKER_1:  Just like you said, I was always, is a self generating problem.

00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  box.

00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:51,454
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, I remember I-

00:41:51,714 --> 00:41:55,358
SPEAKER_0:  didn't speak to my dad for a few years, then I'm like, let me give this guy another chance.

00:41:55,906 --> 00:41:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  And in that time period, Harvey Picar, the...

00:41:58,946 --> 00:42:02,814
SPEAKER_0:  author of subject of American splendor the movie and author of the series comic books

00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:05,982
SPEAKER_0:  He and I became friends and he was writing a graphic novel about me.

00:42:06,914 --> 00:42:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  And when I met with my dad, I'm like, oh.

00:42:10,786 --> 00:42:14,110
SPEAKER_0:  Someone's writing a book about me. He goes, I know so

00:42:14,754 --> 00:42:18,878
SPEAKER_0:  And it was one of those moments where I'm like, wow, you're an asshole.

00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,726
SPEAKER_0:  and not the kind of asshole I am. You're just like not a good-

00:42:21,954 --> 00:42:25,694
SPEAKER_0:  person and I don't know or really at this point care.

00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  but.

00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:31,550
SPEAKER_0:  motivation or if there was no motivation with the visceral emotional reasoning for that.

00:42:32,066 --> 00:42:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  but that kind of thing is something I...

00:42:35,426 --> 00:42:36,862
SPEAKER_0:  you know, much later now in life.

00:42:37,186 --> 00:42:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  have absolutely no.

00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:40,135
SPEAKER_0:  tolerance for.

00:42:40,135 --> 00:42:41,438
SPEAKER_1:  in my own.

00:42:41,698 --> 00:42:42,462
SPEAKER_1:  private life.

00:42:42,818 --> 00:42:44,990
SPEAKER_1:  I try to forgive and love those people.

00:42:45,346 --> 00:42:47,646
SPEAKER_1:  but it is, there have been a few.

00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,182
SPEAKER_1:  in my life like this?

00:42:49,602 --> 00:42:49,982
SPEAKER_1:  and

00:42:50,274 --> 00:42:54,366
SPEAKER_1:  I think they are incredible people if you allow yourself to see it, but they're flawed.

00:42:54,946 --> 00:42:55,454
SPEAKER_1:  And so.

00:42:56,802 --> 00:42:58,078
SPEAKER_1:  I tried to forgive them.

00:42:58,466 --> 00:43:00,254
SPEAKER_1:  That said, it is true that-

00:43:00,642 --> 00:43:06,814
SPEAKER_1:  uh... the people that are close to you special family have uh... disproportionately psychological effect on you so you have to be very careful

00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:09,214
SPEAKER_1:  having them in your life too much.

00:43:09,506 --> 00:43:11,102
SPEAKER_1:  Like one thing is to love them.

00:43:12,066 --> 00:43:13,598
SPEAKER_1:  and the other is to actually, you know.

00:43:14,114 --> 00:43:20,062
SPEAKER_1:  Allow yourself to flourish. Surround yourself with people that help you flourish. And like you said, the advice there is really powerful.

00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,398
SPEAKER_1:  especially early on to have

00:43:23,074 --> 00:43:24,382
SPEAKER_1:  people that believe in you.

00:43:24,962 --> 00:43:27,294
SPEAKER_1:  in whatever crazy big dreams you have.

00:43:27,842 --> 00:43:29,854
SPEAKER_1:  They pat you on the back and say, you got this kid.

00:43:30,178 --> 00:43:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  And here's the other thing.

00:43:33,506 --> 00:43:34,782
SPEAKER_0:  If you try...

00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  and you don't make it to that roguin level.

00:43:38,594 --> 00:43:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  It's okay.

00:43:40,066 --> 00:43:42,302
SPEAKER_0:  Like, I have several books that I've written.

00:43:42,626 --> 00:43:44,926
SPEAKER_0:  that are on my hard drive that have not been published.

00:43:45,282 --> 00:43:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  and there were a lot of work.

00:43:46,882 --> 00:43:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  And it was really disappointing when they went out and no publishers were interested in it. Maybe I'll publish it one day, maybe I won't.

00:43:52,674 --> 00:43:53,406
SPEAKER_0:  point being.

00:43:53,666 --> 00:43:55,198
SPEAKER_0:  It's fine, I tried.

00:43:55,522 --> 00:43:59,427
SPEAKER_0:  Is it a romance novel? One is, one is a- Circe, Ooo, Ma-

00:43:59,427 --> 00:43:59,966
SPEAKER_1:  No

00:44:00,258 --> 00:44:02,942
SPEAKER_1:  Does he have a Santa, a guy in a Santa outfit?

00:44:03,586 --> 00:44:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  Can you please?

00:44:05,282 --> 00:44:08,126
SPEAKER_0:  Stop asking me to send you gay pornography!

00:44:08,898 --> 00:44:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  He's calling me up all hours of the night. I need more gay porn. I need some ones. I only have zeros. Yeah. Never enough. Never enough. This one almost got a book deal. This would have been 16 years ago. It was a ladlet novel.

00:44:23,554 --> 00:44:24,702
SPEAKER_0:  ah, no one can evacuate

00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:25,630
SPEAKER_0:  Ladlet.

00:44:26,018 --> 00:44:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  It's like the corn bee.

00:44:27,394 --> 00:44:28,222
SPEAKER_0:  What? Nicorn Bee?

00:44:28,514 --> 00:44:37,310
SPEAKER_0:  about a boy. So there was a little mini-genre of these books about young men trying to struggle their way through this whole little series of them. Fight Club.

00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  uh... it is adjacent to that

00:44:39,618 --> 00:44:41,022
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, it's not literally lad lit.

00:44:41,314 --> 00:44:41,918
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

00:44:42,178 --> 00:44:43,582
SPEAKER_1:  I feel like you would write.

00:44:43,906 --> 00:44:45,566
SPEAKER_1:  great fight club type novel.

00:44:46,178 --> 00:44:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  You know, Fight Club is much, and Chuck Pollin, as my understanding, admitted this, Fight Club is one of the few.

00:44:51,618 --> 00:44:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  things where the movie is better than the book.

00:44:54,882 --> 00:44:55,614
SPEAKER_1:  all since then.

00:44:56,546 --> 00:44:58,494
SPEAKER_1:  But the movie is so iconic.

00:44:58,914 --> 00:44:59,678
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, for sure.

00:44:59,938 --> 00:45:00,286
SPEAKER_1:  but...

00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:03,294
SPEAKER_1:  but still isn't there a deeply like philosophical.

00:45:03,586 --> 00:45:08,286
SPEAKER_1:  It's kind of like David Foster Wallace novels. Doesn't doesn't it doesn't fight club capture some moment in time?

00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:22,142
SPEAKER_0:  That's very kind of... I was hanging out with Kurt Metzger a couple weeks ago, comedian, very failed comedian. Name drop. Yeah, Kurt. Watch out. And he had this great story. He was hanging out with Patrice O'Neill, the late comedian. Name drop. With the great comics of all.

00:45:24,002 --> 00:45:24,542
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:30,558
SPEAKER_0:  I think Patrice goes, Kurt was talking about how much she liked the book or the movie Fight Club and Patrice is like-

00:45:30,818 --> 00:45:38,686
SPEAKER_0:  That is the whitest book on earth. He goes, your problem in life is you don't have enough violence. Your proper life. You need someone to beat you up?

00:45:38,914 --> 00:45:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  That's not a problem for me.

00:45:40,866 --> 00:45:41,991
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it wasn't, I mean, but-

00:45:41,991 --> 00:45:48,286
SPEAKER_1:  still it's it is a very white book but it still captures a kind of anger and angst

00:45:48,642 --> 00:45:52,766
SPEAKER_1:  and a certain subculture in society. That's really powerful. Probably led to.

00:45:53,538 --> 00:45:57,941
SPEAKER_1:  in some part of the thing you wrote about and then you write.

00:45:57,941 --> 00:46:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  Sure. I mean, it was this kind of like, there's that line in the movie where...

00:46:02,946 --> 00:46:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  Edward Norton says I'm a 30 year old boy.

00:46:05,314 --> 00:46:14,590
SPEAKER_0:  this kind of question of what is it, sorry to be Matt Walsh, but what does it mean to be a man, right? What does masculinity mean? Why are so many men so at such a young age?

00:46:14,946 --> 00:46:16,030
SPEAKER_0:  Feeling so lost?

00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:20,734
SPEAKER_0:  this idea that like if I fill my house with nice furniture, that's still not going to be fulfilling to anyone.

00:46:21,058 --> 00:46:22,183
SPEAKER_0:  Matt what was Matt what?

00:46:22,183 --> 00:46:23,070
SPEAKER_1:

00:46:23,234 --> 00:46:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  He's from the Daily Wire, he just did a documentary called What is a Woman?

00:46:26,338 --> 00:46:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  Can you explain? I don't know who he is. So Matt Walsh is someone who works with Daily Wire. Yes.

00:46:32,098 --> 00:46:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  And he just recently did a documentary called, What is a Woman? I think it was called. And he went out to lots of people working in gender theory and that's the thing. And he asked them to define, and he went to the Messiah.

00:46:43,618 --> 00:46:45,182
SPEAKER_0:  in Africa, the tribe.

00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:51,774
SPEAKER_0:  and to talk to people about transgenderism, non-binary, which is a word I know you hate. And the documentary was a...

00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,118
SPEAKER_0:  Surprisingly well done.

00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:54,718
SPEAKER_1:  Is that like a...

00:46:55,042 --> 00:46:56,318
SPEAKER_1:  passive aggressive compliment.

00:46:57,058 --> 00:46:58,183
SPEAKER_1:  Surprisingly well done.

00:46:58,183 --> 00:47:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  Well, because Matt is very, um...

00:47:00,674 --> 00:47:03,550
SPEAKER_0:  aggressive on Twitter. We follow each other.

00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:04,542
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:47:05,346 --> 00:47:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  There was a lot of opportunities.

00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:08,350
SPEAKER_0:  in this film.

00:47:08,738 --> 00:47:11,262
SPEAKER_0:  for him to really be like, oh.

00:47:11,522 --> 00:47:15,038
SPEAKER_0:  And instead, to his credit, he let the people speak.

00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  and it's possible to edit a certain way of course, it was obviously edited.

00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  When he just asked them, can you just define woman for me and playing dumb? We're not playing dumb, just saying, what's your opinion? A lot of the people he was speaking to were getting extremely...

00:47:28,802 --> 00:47:31,422
SPEAKER_0:  uh... agitated so it worked in that kind of

00:47:31,714 --> 00:47:32,542
SPEAKER_0:  context as well.

00:47:32,866 --> 00:47:34,462
SPEAKER_0:  It was not his usual style.

00:47:35,714 --> 00:47:36,702
SPEAKER_1:  Speaking of which.

00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:38,846
SPEAKER_1:  Do you ever regret your behavior on Twitter?

00:47:40,354 --> 00:47:41,886
SPEAKER_0:  There were a couple of times.

00:47:42,402 --> 00:47:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  but very rarely.

00:47:44,674 --> 00:47:49,438
SPEAKER_1:  Can you describe the big strategy before we dive back into the October Revolution?

00:47:49,762 --> 00:47:50,334
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

00:47:50,914 --> 00:47:52,039
SPEAKER_0:  My strategy of-

00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:53,310
SPEAKER_1:  strategy or is it?

00:47:53,922 --> 00:47:54,878
SPEAKER_1:  Does it come from the heart?

00:47:55,586 --> 00:47:56,670
SPEAKER_1:  or does it come from the brain?

00:47:57,538 --> 00:47:58,750
SPEAKER_0:  It comes from...

00:47:59,202 --> 00:48:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  I want to have fun.

00:48:01,506 --> 00:48:03,381
SPEAKER_0:  That's literally what it comes down to. It's like this is-

00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:04,638
SPEAKER_1:  Girls just wanna have fun.

00:48:05,922 --> 00:48:08,574
SPEAKER_0:  Are you drunk? What is in there?

00:48:09,858 --> 00:48:10,174
SPEAKER_0:  Thanks for watching!

00:48:10,978 --> 00:48:12,103
SPEAKER_0:  I'm very cheeky.

00:48:12,103 --> 00:48:14,430
SPEAKER_1:  Have the holiday spirit, even though it's not the holidays.

00:48:14,626 --> 00:48:16,501
SPEAKER_0:  That's eggnog. Delirious. I did not.

00:48:16,501 --> 00:48:22,174
SPEAKER_1:  sleep much last night. I've been, uh, which is I think the second time we talk or the third time the second time.

00:48:22,754 --> 00:48:23,879
SPEAKER_1:  I stayed up almost.

00:48:23,879 --> 00:48:28,958
SPEAKER_0:  all night.

00:48:29,378 --> 00:48:31,966
SPEAKER_0:  so I know when you're leaving or coming home.

00:48:32,162 --> 00:48:34,174
SPEAKER_1:  My camera points at your bedroom.

00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:37,557
SPEAKER_1:  from the inside. So you can see where it's wrinkling. I'll close you that now.

00:48:37,557 --> 00:48:38,014
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

00:48:38,402 --> 00:48:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  Let me ask you this because this is something that's been bothering me. There was a chair that you threw out.

00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm broken.

00:48:44,386 --> 00:48:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  And I was looking at my camera and I'm like, let me see when he threw this out.

00:48:47,522 --> 00:48:52,510
SPEAKER_0:  And then one time you went to the garbage and you adjusted it to make it stick out of the garbage even more. What were you doing there?

00:48:54,562 --> 00:48:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  Was I? Oh, to-

00:48:56,738 --> 00:48:58,791
SPEAKER_1:  to make sure that people know there's a chair in there.

00:48:58,791 --> 00:49:01,791
SPEAKER_0:  Is that really what you- what? Well, like the garbage person-

00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:03,262
SPEAKER_1:  they'd notice the chair so they don't get.

00:49:03,554 --> 00:49:06,179
SPEAKER_1:  Like I always think I don't want them to get like hurt.

00:49:06,179 --> 00:49:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  or whatever. Oh, OK.

00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:10,014
SPEAKER_1:  they open the thing it's like

00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:11,239
SPEAKER_0:  Duh chair.

00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,739
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know what I was thinking.

00:49:12,739 --> 00:49:14,239
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, it was really odd.

00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:17,989
SPEAKER_1:  know how to get rid of a chair it was broken it was cracked and I didn't it was

00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  So Twitter for me, I-

00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  My point is to have fun.

00:49:22,466 --> 00:49:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  It's also fun to kind of smack down people who I regard as bad actors.

00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  And also kind of to promote news that I find interesting that maybe isn't as prominently part of the culture as it might otherwise be.

00:49:34,306 --> 00:49:36,094
SPEAKER_1:  You think sometimes you draw.

00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:40,222
SPEAKER_1:  too broadly the category of people that are bad actors and then some

00:49:40,514 --> 00:49:41,182
SPEAKER_1:  Thereby

00:49:42,274 --> 00:49:43,518
SPEAKER_1:  sort of adding to the.

00:49:44,354 --> 00:49:46,110
SPEAKER_1:  the mockery and the cynicism in the world.

00:49:46,402 --> 00:49:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think mockery and cynicism are at all synonymous.

00:49:49,858 --> 00:49:53,086
SPEAKER_0:  I think cynicism means everyone sucks. I don't think everyone sucks. I think.

00:49:53,442 --> 00:49:53,854
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

00:49:54,274 --> 00:49:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  It is.

00:49:55,074 --> 00:49:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  undeniable that a lot of people suck.

00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:58,398
SPEAKER_1:  What if I told you...

00:49:58,626 --> 00:49:59,710
SPEAKER_1:  Most people don't suck.

00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:01,406
SPEAKER_1:  Could you?

00:50:02,498 --> 00:50:04,373
SPEAKER_1:  Could you steal me on the case that most people don't?

00:50:04,373 --> 00:50:09,374
SPEAKER_0:  I can do it in a cynical way, honestly. It's a quasi-cynical way. I think most people are neither here nor there.

00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:12,382
SPEAKER_0:  Most people just kind of go with the flow.

00:50:12,706 --> 00:50:13,886
SPEAKER_0:  They're amiable.

00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  human beings are social creatures. They want to get along.

00:50:17,474 --> 00:50:21,982
SPEAKER_0:  They don't want to cause problems. They don't have the capacity to be the target of a problem.

00:50:22,434 --> 00:50:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  So, most people, I mean, if most people sucked...

00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:31,358
SPEAKER_0:  then going anywhere would be an excruciating ordeal, right? like literally any like

00:50:31,842 --> 00:50:38,942
SPEAKER_0:  The airport's annoying, but if most people sucked, it would really be annoying. Going to the supermarket would be really annoying. So I don't think most people suck.

00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  but I do think that in...

00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:42,718
SPEAKER_0:  public discourse.

00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  There are lots of people.

00:50:45,186 --> 00:50:46,110
SPEAKER_0:  Who are?

00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  Dishonest.

00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:52,414
SPEAKER_0:  about their agenda. For example, if I'm, you know, I could be a

00:50:53,282 --> 00:50:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  someone who has promoting a certain ideology.

00:50:56,066 --> 00:50:56,414
SPEAKER_0:  But I'm-

00:50:56,738 --> 00:50:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  in the payroll of a candidate.

00:50:58,306 --> 00:51:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  Or, you know, my think tank needs this to happen or I'm being paid for something like that. So that sort of thing, I think, happens all the time. There's the line I have in the book, Upton Sinclair.

00:51:07,074 --> 00:51:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  I forgot how he exact- he word exactly, but it's very hard to convince someone of something if his payroll depends on him not being convinced of it, right?

00:51:14,722 --> 00:51:19,742
SPEAKER_0:  So I think things like that are... The thing I'm really excited about with what Elon's doing with Twitter...

00:51:20,162 --> 00:51:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm just ecstatic about this.

00:51:22,786 --> 00:51:23,326
SPEAKER_0:  is

00:51:23,778 --> 00:51:25,086
SPEAKER_0:  to have the context now.

00:51:25,634 --> 00:51:30,462
SPEAKER_0:  So you'll have a politician making a claim and they're going to award it in certain ways. This is like my favorite example.

00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  is when people are like, if you look at the years 2002 to 2020, terrorism in America, it's like.

00:51:37,058 --> 00:51:38,398
SPEAKER_0:  Did anything happen in 2001?

00:51:38,658 --> 00:51:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  Is there a reason you just coincidentally started in 2002? Like things like that.

00:51:42,914 --> 00:51:43,454
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:51:43,938 --> 00:52:01,278
SPEAKER_0:  When people are manipulating things to force an outcome that they want and to promote an idea that they want disingenuously, to have that underneath that in Twitter now where the audience provides context, I think is something extremely useful and it's a great way to nip propaganda in the bud.

00:52:01,666 --> 00:52:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  and propaganda group.

00:52:02,978 --> 00:52:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  pervades the entire political spectrum, of course.

00:52:05,826 --> 00:52:09,822
SPEAKER_1:  The interesting thing about Twitter is also the discussion about free speech and so on.

00:52:10,722 --> 00:52:12,766
SPEAKER_1:  Interesting to discuss free speech.

00:52:13,058 --> 00:52:16,126
SPEAKER_1:  and the freedom of the press from the context of the Soviet Union. Sure.

00:52:16,354 --> 00:52:19,486
SPEAKER_1:  Let's return to the October Revolution at Lenin.

00:52:22,914 --> 00:52:27,294
SPEAKER_1:  what was the actual revolution what uh... who was when it was some interesting aspects of this

00:52:28,002 --> 00:52:32,446
SPEAKER_1:  this human being and also this moment in history that stand out to you that are important to understand

00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:34,014
SPEAKER_0:  I think the...

00:52:35,682 --> 00:52:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  Interesting thing about Lenin.

00:52:38,082 --> 00:52:39,486
SPEAKER_0:  Is he?

00:52:40,002 --> 00:52:40,862
SPEAKER_0:  Was this zealot?

00:52:41,698 --> 00:52:43,038
SPEAKER_0:  And he was a visionary?

00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:45,438
SPEAKER_0:  and he really kinda meant it.

00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:46,526
SPEAKER_0:  and

00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:49,438
SPEAKER_0:  I'm skipping ahead a little bit, but Lenin...

00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,414
SPEAKER_0:  also with someone who was strategic.

00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  So at a certain point when they were trying to advance communism throughout the Soviet Union

00:52:57,954 --> 00:53:04,254
SPEAKER_0:  and the costs were outweighing the benefits. He did a strategic retreat. He did the new economic policy. He had a rise of kind of these.

00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:07,646
SPEAKER_0:  small capitalists coming back, you could hire people again.

00:53:07,938 --> 00:53:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  And for the hardcore...

00:53:09,602 --> 00:53:14,174
SPEAKER_0:  people in the Soviet Union, hardcore communists. This was a huge betrayal. It's a step back.

00:53:14,722 --> 00:53:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  He didn't do it because he was some kind of.

00:53:16,994 --> 00:53:27,390
SPEAKER_0:  crypto capitalist, he did it because he's like, all right, we know where we got to get to, but we have to go at a certain pace and we have to adjust as we go along. So to have someone who is that much of an ideologue.

00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  and that much of a visionary.

00:53:29,442 --> 00:53:31,070
SPEAKER_0:  but still to have any.

00:53:31,554 --> 00:53:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  element of pragmatism to him.

00:53:34,082 --> 00:53:35,838
SPEAKER_0:  is I think a very rare.

00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:37,415
SPEAKER_0:  combination.

00:53:37,415 --> 00:53:40,798
SPEAKER_1:  And that pragmatism, do you think that's ultimately where things go wrong?

00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:41,982
SPEAKER_1:  Sort of, um...

00:53:43,362 --> 00:53:45,566
SPEAKER_1:  That's where you sacrifice the ideas.

00:53:45,858 --> 00:53:50,686
SPEAKER_0:  Pragmatism in this case was good because by taking a step back

00:53:51,042 --> 00:53:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  You know, he kind of.

00:53:52,226 --> 00:53:54,046
SPEAKER_0:  I'll give himself some breathing room.

00:53:54,498 --> 00:54:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  to allow the revolution to continue to win the civil war. There was a big moment where Germany, it's just there's lots of like funny anecdotes that I learned while researching this book. So, you know, they were.

00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, Germany and Russia, they were negotiating, uh, stale, a ceasefire because they wanted Germany wanted Russia out of the war. And basically Germany was like, all right, you will let you leave.

00:54:16,258 --> 00:54:20,542
SPEAKER_0:  but you have to sign this treaty and basically hand over all this land that we're currently occupying.

00:54:20,834 --> 00:54:23,550
SPEAKER_0:  It was just parts of Ukraine, parts of Poland.

00:54:24,034 --> 00:54:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  And Lenin tells Trotsky to stall. He's just run the clock because he was of the belief.

00:54:29,986 --> 00:54:35,294
SPEAKER_0:  that now that they've taken power in Russia, you're gonna have a worldwide workers revolution. Just like, just stall them.

00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:40,222
SPEAKER_0:  And he stalled, he stalled and at a certain point Germany's like, all right, you're signing this tomorrow or we're invading.

00:54:40,514 --> 00:54:44,318
SPEAKER_0:  And Trotsky basically said, yeah, so we're leaving the war.

00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:46,654
SPEAKER_0:  But we're not signing anything and the Germans are like...

00:54:46,914 --> 00:54:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  What? I can't well that's what we're doing so hey

00:54:50,274 --> 00:54:54,686
SPEAKER_0:  And basically, eventually he had to sign the treaty and cede.

00:54:55,106 --> 00:54:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  huge parts of land and a lot of money.

00:54:57,826 --> 00:54:59,454
SPEAKER_0:  And this was a very.

00:54:59,746 --> 00:55:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  a precarious moment for him to maintain control of Russia.

00:55:04,066 --> 00:55:05,726
SPEAKER_0:  And people were telling him like.

00:55:06,018 --> 00:55:09,022
SPEAKER_0:  You've lost huge amounts of territory.

00:55:09,442 --> 00:55:12,574
SPEAKER_0:  blown it, you should be in jail, and he's like, watch your mouth.

00:55:13,122 --> 00:55:18,846
SPEAKER_0:  Because if you look for the future, it'll be clear which one of us is more likely to be the one ending up in jail. And he was absolutely right.

00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:23,134
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, this was Trotsky or Lenin saying- This was Lenin saying this to Karl Raddick.

00:55:24,482 --> 00:55:25,607
SPEAKER_0:  So who are these?

00:55:25,607 --> 00:55:27,678
SPEAKER_1:  Who is Trotsky? Who is Lenin?

00:55:28,162 --> 00:55:30,014
SPEAKER_1:  Who's Stalin? What is some interesting...

00:55:30,658 --> 00:55:33,982
SPEAKER_1:  aspects of all of this. What it sort of just to linger on it.

00:55:34,402 --> 00:55:36,862
SPEAKER_1:  the personalities, the ideas that are important.

00:55:37,346 --> 00:55:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  Well Trotsky came late to Bolshevism. He was really the brains.

00:55:41,826 --> 00:55:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  in many ways of the October Revolution. He was an amazing strategist.

00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:47,422
SPEAKER_0:  He never forgot.

00:55:47,682 --> 00:55:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  that he was an amazing strategist, had a very high opinion of himself.

00:55:50,562 --> 00:55:52,798
SPEAKER_1:  And by the way, the October revolution, 1917.

00:55:53,346 --> 00:55:54,814
SPEAKER_1:  That's a key moment.

00:55:56,002 --> 00:55:56,478
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

00:55:57,570 --> 00:55:59,678
SPEAKER_1:  Of course, the Russian Revolution lasted a long time.

00:56:00,258 --> 00:56:00,638
SPEAKER_1:  but...

00:56:00,866 --> 00:56:02,142
SPEAKER_1:  This was a key moment.

00:56:02,402 --> 00:56:03,230
SPEAKER_1:  of uh...

00:56:03,522 --> 00:56:06,174
SPEAKER_1:  but a phase shift towards success.

00:56:06,978 --> 00:56:18,750
SPEAKER_0:  of the Bolsheviks. Well, that was the moment. That was like, all right, we are the government now. And now we have to make it's, you know, like Thomas Jefferson said, I think it was Thomas Jefferson or no, it's Ben Franklin, a republic, if you can keep it, it's like, all right.

00:56:19,074 --> 00:56:33,214
SPEAKER_0:  We've made our own kind of government if we can keep it, because that was the big question. You had an international blockade. You had the white armies, the czarist forces who want to restore czarism, or at least the parliament from right before Lenin took over. So this was a big kind of no one's.

00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  was, you know, in some ways it was like the 2016 election. It's like, all right.

00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:38,686
SPEAKER_0:  We vote in Trump.

00:56:39,394 --> 00:56:41,950
SPEAKER_0:  What's this gonna look like? Like no one, no one!

00:56:42,402 --> 00:56:50,293
SPEAKER_0:  had any idea what a Trump presidency was going to look like. All we knew was this guy's on Twitter running his mouth, he's insulting people, and he's had all these views, some are over here, some are over there.

00:56:50,293 --> 00:56:54,782
SPEAKER_1:  And the funny thing is the Russians hacked both elections.

00:56:55,042 --> 00:56:55,582
SPEAKER_0:  See

00:56:56,226 --> 00:56:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  It was Putin and the gremlin.

00:56:58,946 --> 00:56:59,550
SPEAKER_0:  So.

00:56:59,842 --> 00:57:02,814
SPEAKER_0:  Trotsky was, you know, Lenin's right-hand man.

00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and he was, you know, enormous. And to this day, he remains this kind of figure.

00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:10,814
SPEAKER_0:  Who is?

00:57:11,746 --> 00:57:12,798
SPEAKER_0:  supposedly.

00:57:13,122 --> 00:57:13,470
SPEAKER_0:  AIN'T

00:57:13,858 --> 00:57:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  less authoritarian.

00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  anti-Stalinist version of communism that people can endorse.

00:57:21,442 --> 00:57:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  And Stalin of course was Lenin's successor. At first there was a triumvirate.

00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  running Russia as Lenin was recuperating from strokes.

00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:32,318
SPEAKER_0:  then very quickly, not very quickly, but gradually, then suddenly, Stalin.

00:57:32,674 --> 00:57:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  became an absolute dictator and he had a series of

00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:37,982
SPEAKER_0:  and so on and so forth.

00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:41,585
SPEAKER_0:  which solidified his control over the country.

00:57:41,585 --> 00:57:43,358
SPEAKER_1:  And of course for Stalin.

00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:46,270
SPEAKER_1:  Trotsky later but throughout.

00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:50,910
SPEAKER_1:  as you write seem to almost take on a supernatural character.

00:57:51,266 --> 00:57:55,134
SPEAKER_1:  wherein everything that went wrong in the USSR was due not just.

00:57:55,554 --> 00:57:58,526
SPEAKER_1:  to his views, but to his direct orders from abroad.

00:57:59,874 --> 00:58:00,350
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

00:58:00,674 --> 00:58:07,230
SPEAKER_1:  Of course, George Orwell brilliantly in probably my favorite book of his, which is Animal Farm and also 1984.

00:58:08,834 --> 00:58:10,526
SPEAKER_1:  portray Trotsky as a-

00:58:10,914 --> 00:58:13,022
SPEAKER_1:  as snowball and animal farming.

00:58:13,378 --> 00:58:16,126
SPEAKER_1:  Immanuel Goldstein in 1984.

00:58:16,354 --> 00:58:19,806
SPEAKER_1:  is this embodiment of this evil that the woes have to be fighting?

00:58:20,354 --> 00:58:22,558
SPEAKER_1:  then you need that in order to hold.

00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:25,854
SPEAKER_1:  Hold on to power, you always have to have that enemy.

00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  Right. So that, I mean, that's something I talk about in the white pill as well. When things start going wrong, they always have to have scapegoats. Right? And there's this Russian, you know, what the Russians like to do is you can't say things out loud, but if you make jokes, you can say unspeakable truths.

00:58:41,986 --> 00:58:44,798
SPEAKER_0:  And there's this one anecdote where there's a Russian leader.

00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:46,526
SPEAKER_0:  and things are going bad.

00:58:46,882 --> 00:58:50,462
SPEAKER_0:  and he looks in his drawer and there were two letters from his predecessor.

00:58:50,786 --> 00:58:55,902
SPEAKER_0:  And he opens the first letter in a panic and the letter says, you know, for advice and the letter says blame everything on me.

00:58:56,322 --> 00:59:03,774
SPEAKER_0:  So he goes out there and he's like, oh, my predecessor sucked, he was terrible, blah, blah, it's his fault. And everyone's like, okay. And then there's a calamity again. And he's like, oh crap.

00:59:04,002 --> 00:59:05,182
SPEAKER_0:  So he goes back at his desk.

00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  And he reads the second one and it says, sit down and write two letters.

00:59:08,738 --> 00:59:12,158
SPEAKER_0:  So when things start going wrong as they...

00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:15,390
SPEAKER_0:  constantly did throughout the history of the Soviet Union.

00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, or any.

00:59:17,122 --> 00:59:19,230
SPEAKER_0:  you know, totalitarian, authoritarian country.

00:59:19,586 --> 00:59:22,302
SPEAKER_0:  it's someone has to be to blame. since we know.

00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:24,414
SPEAKER_0:  that our ideology is true.

00:59:24,674 --> 00:59:32,350
SPEAKER_0:  scientifically true. If it's not working in reality given the perfection of the ideology, someone must be intentionally

00:59:32,706 --> 00:59:35,326
SPEAKER_0:  undermining it and causing the disconnect.

00:59:35,554 --> 00:59:41,438
SPEAKER_0:  between thought and reality. And in the Soviet Union, there were, I think it was the Kulaks at one point, then it was the Wreckers.

00:59:41,794 --> 00:59:51,262
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, the doctors, it was just different. The capital, there was always someone to Antrock ski, uh, was called a fascist and was accused of plotting with Hitler and all this other stuff.

00:59:51,874 --> 00:59:57,790
SPEAKER_1:  And you also write, the problem with communism is that eventually you run out of possible scape boats.

00:59:58,178 --> 00:59:58,846
SPEAKER_1:  Skip boats.

00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:01,086
SPEAKER_1:  Kip boats, you run out of boats.

01:00:01,666 --> 01:00:03,934
SPEAKER_1:  You two are out of boats. Who's going to carry them?

01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:07,998
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, eventually run out of possible skeg.

01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:09,246
SPEAKER_1:  Goats.

01:00:10,082 --> 01:00:14,366
SPEAKER_1:  It's my second language, this English thing.

01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:18,718
SPEAKER_1:  I'm a failed podcaster. I'm a failure.

01:00:19,266 --> 01:00:28,798
SPEAKER_1:  Eventually you run out of possible escape goats for failure, at which point acknowledging or even noticing that something was wrong itself becomes a form of treason.

01:00:29,538 --> 01:00:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  I saw that in North Korea, right? Wherever you went in North Korea.

01:00:33,538 --> 01:00:34,462
SPEAKER_0:  something was wrong.

01:00:34,754 --> 01:00:37,854
SPEAKER_0:  So if you have four buttons for the elevator, one will be mismatched.

01:00:38,146 --> 01:00:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  Every wall had a crack.

01:00:39,842 --> 01:00:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  Every floor had a stain.

01:00:41,698 --> 01:00:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  The bathroom would be rusted through when you want to flush the urinal.

01:00:45,186 --> 01:00:47,454
SPEAKER_0:  But if you are someone who points this out...

01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:48,638
SPEAKER_0:  Your troublemaker.

01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:58,686
SPEAKER_0:  And you're, oh, you're, oh, you're saying something's wrong. You're criticizing the operation. You're, you're first of all, you're, you're threatening the person who's in charge because now they're incompetent and now that's a big red flag for them.

01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:01,342
SPEAKER_0:  But second, if you're just going around...

01:01:01,634 --> 01:01:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  saying this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, even if it's objectively true.

01:01:05,346 --> 01:01:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  You're a troublemaker and you're a counter-revolutionary. So at a certain point, everyone just has to put on blinders.

01:01:10,626 --> 01:01:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  and pretend that everything is fine. One example I use in the book, an extreme example, was there was a photography professor.

01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,782
SPEAKER_0:  and he pointed out his class.

01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:24,926
SPEAKER_0:  and he was an older man, that before the revolution, the quality of photographic paper was better and he was, I think, executed.

01:01:25,218 --> 01:01:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  for this heresy. So yeah, you have to pretend there was, I just, I'm reading a book right now about the Chinese.

01:01:31,298 --> 01:01:32,414
SPEAKER_0:  Cultural Revolution.

01:01:32,866 --> 01:01:38,494
SPEAKER_0:  And there was an academic, I forget his name, Hugh Shee, I think, and he points out that in these countries...

01:01:39,426 --> 01:01:41,278
SPEAKER_0:  not only do you not have freedom of speech.

01:01:41,506 --> 01:01:42,846
SPEAKER_0:  You don't have freedom of silence.

01:01:43,234 --> 01:01:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  You can't just sit there quietly. You have to say how great things are and how much you're enjoying and how wonderful they are instead of just keeping quiet because if you keep quiet that's suspicious.

01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:54,174
SPEAKER_0:  I had those, um...

01:01:56,290 --> 01:02:01,790
SPEAKER_0:  They're always singing those songs about how happy they are and how great everything is. And if everyone else is singing, who are you to not sing?

01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:10,846
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, those pictures, especially when, you know, when it's Stalin giving speeches and everyone is applauding.

01:02:11,074 --> 01:02:14,622
SPEAKER_1:  any dictator and you don't want to be the...

01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:16,295
SPEAKER_1:  The first person that stopped.

01:02:16,295 --> 01:02:24,862
SPEAKER_0:  stops applauding.

01:02:25,186 --> 01:02:26,910
SPEAKER_0:  And why'd you stop clapping? You don't like Stalin?

01:02:27,746 --> 01:02:29,790
SPEAKER_1:  Just imagine being one of those people clapping.

01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  But that's the thing. They always had a sword over their head and they had, but they all had a lot of blood on their hands too. It's a very, very precarious life.

01:02:40,098 --> 01:02:41,022
SPEAKER_1:  But there's also...

01:02:41,538 --> 01:02:43,678
SPEAKER_1:  I mean 1984 does a good job of this.

01:02:44,322 --> 01:02:44,862
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:02:45,314 --> 01:02:47,582
SPEAKER_1:  What is that, like two minutes of hate or something like this?

01:02:47,874 --> 01:02:53,630
SPEAKER_1:  You lose yourself in the hysteria of it. There's some level of which...

01:02:54,274 --> 01:02:55,166
SPEAKER_1:  At first.

01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:58,878
SPEAKER_1:  It's, you're sacrificing your basic individualistic.

01:02:59,266 --> 01:03:00,286
SPEAKER_1:  ability to think.

01:03:00,674 --> 01:03:02,590
SPEAKER_1:  but then you get lost in this kind of.

01:03:03,042 --> 01:03:04,286
SPEAKER_1:  wave of emotion.

01:03:04,674 --> 01:03:05,534
SPEAKER_1:  and you give into it.

01:03:05,826 --> 01:03:07,838
SPEAKER_1:  You allow yourself, it's like a mix of fear.

01:03:08,098 --> 01:03:11,390
SPEAKER_1:  and then anger, and then you direct that anger towards.

01:03:11,778 --> 01:03:14,494
SPEAKER_1:  like Snowball or Trotsky or whoever the-

01:03:14,946 --> 01:03:15,422
SPEAKER_1:  And like.

01:03:15,938 --> 01:03:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  What is that? You're also losing yourself in the crowd. Yeah, you're losing- Because you're like, it's not just I'm angry, everyone I know, we're all angry together, so you really are becoming a part of something bigger than yourself.

01:03:25,058 --> 01:03:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  and having this kind of communal very-

01:03:26,978 --> 01:03:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  emotional experience.

01:03:29,314 --> 01:03:33,022
SPEAKER_0:  It's like the opposite of thanks of Christmas, right? Christmas, we're all together.

01:03:33,378 --> 01:03:35,934
SPEAKER_0:  Everyone's sharing their joy, everyone's sharing their love.

01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  This is the opposite, literally the opposite. Like everyone's together sharing their hate and anger and rage.

01:03:40,866 --> 01:03:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  but you're all kind of having a mind meld.

01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:49,150
SPEAKER_1:  but I wonder what it's like to be an independent thinker in those moments.

01:03:49,506 --> 01:03:50,631
SPEAKER_1:  Like, allow yourself to-

01:03:50,631 --> 01:03:51,838
SPEAKER_0:  Well, we know.

01:03:52,194 --> 01:03:54,046
SPEAKER_0:  Because there were a lot of them and they were all...

01:03:54,498 --> 01:03:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  hudnished enormously.

01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:57,310
SPEAKER_0:  so they can be noticed.

01:03:57,634 --> 01:04:04,638
SPEAKER_0:  You can notice them. Oh yeah. You even notice it in America. America is a free country, but when people start asking too many questions, it's like, where are you going with this?

01:04:04,930 --> 01:04:08,190
SPEAKER_0:  You know, like if you're in an office even in a corporate setting.

01:04:08,418 --> 01:04:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  You're a troublemaker. You're just, you know, you're making problems for everyone. Why can't you be normal?

01:04:13,762 --> 01:04:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  Why can't you be just like everybody else?

01:04:15,714 --> 01:04:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  So people do not like having to be made to think.

01:04:20,386 --> 01:04:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  And they certainly...

01:04:22,082 --> 01:04:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  despise having to be made to justify themselves.

01:04:25,506 --> 01:04:30,942
SPEAKER_0:  because that's a threat to their status and to their power and this applies in totalitarianism or applies to

01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:32,254
SPEAKER_0:  You know, Dunder Mifflin.

01:04:34,818 --> 01:04:36,670
SPEAKER_1:  I still can't believe you're wearing lipstick.

01:04:37,314 --> 01:04:37,726
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not.

01:04:38,850 --> 01:04:41,054
SPEAKER_1:  uh... goes to show you can

01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:42,622
SPEAKER_1:  lipstick on a pig.

01:04:45,666 --> 01:04:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  It's like a snowball.

01:04:53,442 --> 01:04:55,317
SPEAKER_0:  I think you've just been on a bender, that's what I think.

01:04:55,317 --> 01:04:57,886
SPEAKER_1:  It's been rough. It's been rough. It's been rough.

01:04:59,554 --> 01:05:00,574
SPEAKER_1:  I feel kind of...

01:05:01,282 --> 01:05:07,646
SPEAKER_1:  I feel like I can be myself in this outfit. I honestly feel like I could just go around in this outfit and um...

01:05:09,314 --> 01:05:10,430
SPEAKER_1:  Just be weird.

01:05:11,394 --> 01:05:13,822
SPEAKER_1:  because everyone will accept you if you're wearing a Santa outfit.

01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:17,333
SPEAKER_1:  You can say anything in a Santa outfit, right?

01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:18,654
SPEAKER_0:  Have you seen Bad Santa?

01:05:18,882 --> 01:05:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, that's it. Exactly. You can't say anything. My Fox, Dick.

01:05:24,578 --> 01:05:25,950
SPEAKER_1:  How did Stalin come to power?

01:05:26,338 --> 01:05:27,742
SPEAKER_1:  If we return back to.

01:05:28,994 --> 01:05:30,270
SPEAKER_1:  those early days.

01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:33,310
SPEAKER_1:  post the October Revolution with Lenin and Trotsky.

01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:34,814
SPEAKER_1:  and Stalin.

01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:36,190
SPEAKER_1:  How did he come to power?

01:05:36,546 --> 01:05:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  So what Stalin did very cleverly, Stalin was, you know, he worked the system.

01:05:41,858 --> 01:05:44,286
SPEAKER_0:  he was very much in the background.

01:05:44,802 --> 01:05:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  And what he did better than Trotsky is he was much more a politician.

01:05:48,578 --> 01:05:50,206
SPEAKER_0:  He was a gladhander.

01:05:50,658 --> 01:05:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  He made friends within the party. He made people feel respected and appreciated.

01:05:54,754 --> 01:05:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  and Len entrusted him.

01:05:56,514 --> 01:06:03,262
SPEAKER_0:  When after Lenin's stroke, Stalin was basically the one who was keeping track of him. Lenin asked Stalin at one point to kill him.

01:06:03,682 --> 01:06:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  because after the strokes using capacitated style and talked him out of it, but...

01:06:07,138 --> 01:06:16,894
SPEAKER_0:  At the same time Len was like, if I need someone killed, like this is who I need to talk to. You know, Stalin, if you look up photos of him when he was young, he was a stud, he was a gangster, he was a bank robber.

01:06:17,282 --> 01:06:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, and.

01:06:20,098 --> 01:06:26,110
SPEAKER_0:  You know, he basically worked the system and you had the Trotskyites on one hand, who are much more to the left.

01:06:26,562 --> 01:06:27,678
SPEAKER_0:  Stalin's big.

01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:30,366
SPEAKER_0:  I would guess I would call it a heresy.

01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  was he put forth the idea of socialism in one country.

01:06:34,338 --> 01:06:39,070
SPEAKER_0:  Whereas, like, we're just going to make it work here in what became the Soviet Union. The Trotsky idea.

01:06:39,426 --> 01:06:43,710
SPEAKER_0:  and this is really kind of the Marxist idea, is that the workers revolution has to be worldwide.

01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:47,038
SPEAKER_0:  This is just a worldwide kind of new era of humanity.

01:06:47,426 --> 01:06:50,142
SPEAKER_0:  where Stalin's like, no, no, no, we're just gonna make it here and then later.

01:06:50,466 --> 01:06:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  behind what became the Iron Curtain.

01:06:52,418 --> 01:06:53,150
SPEAKER_0:  But this was

01:06:53,730 --> 01:06:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  sure this was an ideological division between the two.

01:06:57,506 --> 01:07:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  What happens in totalitarian countries, it happens in any kind of like, you know, when you have intermingling of like religion and government.

01:07:04,834 --> 01:07:05,758
SPEAKER_0:  things that are.

01:07:06,146 --> 01:07:12,766
SPEAKER_0:  like ideological disputes, like the Aryan heresy. The Aryan heresy in Christianity is that Christ is subordinate to God the Father, right?

01:07:13,058 --> 01:07:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  Whereas the contemporary Orthodox version, it's one God and three persons, excuse me. So they're all co-equal aspects of God in heaven.

01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:25,726
SPEAKER_0:  but that was an excuse to be like, you guys are evil, you're on the side of the devil, we're going to kill you.

01:07:26,306 --> 01:07:26,974
SPEAKER_0:  These little-

01:07:27,554 --> 01:07:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  disputes about ideas are often a convenient cover.

01:07:31,842 --> 01:07:33,726
SPEAKER_0:  for people to have a power struggle.

01:07:34,466 --> 01:07:41,534
SPEAKER_0:  in the guise of being like, it's not that I'm about wanting to be more powerful, I'm just on the side of the truth and you're speaking lies and that's dangerous to the revolution or to the true faith.

01:07:41,986 --> 01:07:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  So he squeezed.

01:07:44,514 --> 01:07:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  But the thing is Trotsky had the seeds of his own defeat.

01:07:47,586 --> 01:07:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  because per Trotsky

01:07:49,218 --> 01:07:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  The party is always right.

01:07:50,754 --> 01:07:52,734
SPEAKER_0:  You cannot be right against the party, right?

01:07:52,962 --> 01:07:55,294
SPEAKER_0:  So if you have this kind of party structure...

01:07:55,554 --> 01:07:55,966
SPEAKER_0:  And the.

01:07:56,258 --> 01:07:57,214
SPEAKER_0:  Hardy is saying...

01:07:57,442 --> 01:07:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  You're wrong.

01:07:58,818 --> 01:08:00,926
SPEAKER_0:  As an individual, you are wrong.

01:08:01,314 --> 01:08:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  Because the collective is what makes decisions. The collective, the workers, are who have the knowledge.

01:08:06,274 --> 01:08:10,430
SPEAKER_0:  and the information and it is important for you to.

01:08:10,978 --> 01:08:11,518
SPEAKER_0:  Kind of.

01:08:11,906 --> 01:08:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  Subordinate.

01:08:13,218 --> 01:08:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  your selfishness, your individualism to this greater good. in so that, just to summarize.

01:08:18,882 --> 01:08:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  kind of set himself up in many ways.

01:08:23,618 --> 01:08:24,743
SPEAKER_0:  Is it clear to you why tra-

01:08:24,743 --> 01:08:30,078
SPEAKER_1:  You just explained that he set himself up, but you can see how.

01:08:30,370 --> 01:08:31,710
SPEAKER_1:  Different ideologies can be used.

01:08:32,482 --> 01:08:34,686
SPEAKER_1:  to achieve different ends.

01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:38,430
SPEAKER_1:  Is there another alternative possible trajectory where Trotsky could have been?

01:08:38,658 --> 01:08:40,126
SPEAKER_1:  of the head of the Soviet Union.

01:08:40,322 --> 01:08:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  It would be very hard because he was Jewish. So when they were seizing power,

01:08:46,018 --> 01:08:48,574
SPEAKER_0:  Trotsky explicitly said, I can't be in charge, I'm Jewish.

01:08:48,866 --> 01:08:52,094
SPEAKER_0:  So the Soviet Union remained extremely anti-Semitic.

01:08:52,418 --> 01:09:01,726
SPEAKER_0:  One, the reason so many Jews became communists in the Soviet Union because the promise was once the communists took over, we're not going to have pilgrims anymore. Because once you had these Jewish ghettos, you were going to be a Jew.

01:09:01,954 --> 01:09:05,918
SPEAKER_0:  and under the permission or encouragement of the Tsar,

01:09:06,402 --> 01:09:18,750
SPEAKER_0:  Just gangs of people go through killing, raping, robbing, stealing, rioting for days. And just a complete massacre. And the idea is like under communism, everyone's going to be equal. We're not going to have this anymore. They still had it, but-

01:09:19,106 --> 01:09:20,062
SPEAKER_0:  to a lesser extent.

01:09:20,546 --> 01:09:21,022
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:09:22,210 --> 01:09:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  Since Trotsky was Jewish, his real name is Lev Bronstein.

01:09:25,474 --> 01:09:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  You can't you-

01:09:26,626 --> 01:09:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  It was almost impossible.

01:09:28,546 --> 01:09:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  to have a scenario where he was going to be in charge. And Stalin fed into that to some extent.

01:09:33,346 --> 01:09:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  Also this kind of idea of Jewish internationalism. It's like, okay, he doesn't really have loyalty to Russia. And many of the people who were Jewish.

01:09:40,354 --> 01:09:41,982
SPEAKER_0:  who were high up in Stalin's.

01:09:42,434 --> 01:09:43,006
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:09:43,938 --> 01:09:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  government administration.

01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  They very much had to prove their loyalty.

01:09:48,706 --> 01:09:51,331
SPEAKER_0:  uh... to communism as opposed to judaism

01:09:51,331 --> 01:09:53,502
SPEAKER_1:  Throughout the 20th century, what was the relationship?

01:09:54,242 --> 01:09:55,742
SPEAKER_1:  between communism.

01:09:56,578 --> 01:09:57,598
SPEAKER_1:  And, um...

01:09:58,146 --> 01:09:59,742
SPEAKER_1:  Jews in the Soviet Union.

01:10:00,994 --> 01:10:01,598
SPEAKER_1:  What?

01:10:02,178 --> 01:10:07,486
SPEAKER_1:  in terms of antisemitism, the ups and downs of antisemitism. It seems like it lessened

01:10:07,938 --> 01:10:09,470
SPEAKER_1:  It was lesser and greater.

01:10:09,762 --> 01:10:11,998
SPEAKER_1:  in different parts of the 20th century.

01:10:12,386 --> 01:10:14,974
SPEAKER_0:  Well, it's the kind of thing where...

01:10:15,842 --> 01:10:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:10:16,930 --> 01:10:19,806
SPEAKER_0:  If something was bad, there's this Russian rhyme.

01:10:20,098 --> 01:10:24,030
SPEAKER_0:  If there is no water in the tap, who drank it?

01:10:24,482 --> 01:10:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  Like, if there's no water in the sink, who drank it? Did you call the Jews?

01:10:28,354 --> 01:10:33,662
SPEAKER_0:  So if something goes wrong, there's just a convenient historical scapegoat. It's the juice vault.

01:10:34,114 --> 01:10:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  So...

01:10:35,234 --> 01:10:39,550
SPEAKER_0:  This is something that's towards the end of his life very much, and this was after World War II.

01:10:39,778 --> 01:10:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  Stalin was getting ready for another kind of series of programs. All these Jews were getting kicked out of their jobs.

01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:50,110
SPEAKER_0:  Jewish doctors were getting sent to the Far East instead of being in cities.

01:10:50,498 --> 01:10:56,542
SPEAKER_0:  the newspapers started talking about rootless cosmopolitans, which was a term the Nazis also used.

01:10:56,962 --> 01:11:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  to kind of regard Jews as others or as aliens.

01:11:00,546 --> 01:11:03,710
SPEAKER_0:  And this was going to be, and they were very clever about it.

01:11:04,066 --> 01:11:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  Improvda, they would, and I talk about this in the white pill.

01:11:07,650 --> 01:11:11,678
SPEAKER_0:  improv that there were articles, letters to the editor. They were like.

01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:14,494
SPEAKER_0:  You know, things are getting so anti-semitic.

01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  We really should round up all the Jews and send them elsewhere for their own safety. So they were kind of setting the the

01:11:21,314 --> 01:11:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  ground rules or the...

01:11:23,458 --> 01:11:24,062
SPEAKER_0:  basis.

01:11:24,386 --> 01:11:27,486
SPEAKER_0:  to have this sort of program come back, but.

01:11:27,842 --> 01:11:30,558
SPEAKER_0:  spoiler alert, Stalin dies.

01:11:30,914 --> 01:11:32,094
SPEAKER_0:  and immediately.

01:11:32,482 --> 01:11:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:11:33,442 --> 01:11:36,766
SPEAKER_0:  All of this gets reversed and the new administration...

01:11:37,602 --> 01:11:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  rehabilitates the doctors who were accused of trying to hurt him and all this other sort of thing.

01:11:43,458 --> 01:11:44,990
SPEAKER_1:  What is it about the scapegoat?

01:11:45,282 --> 01:11:48,606
SPEAKER_1:  in society. Are we always going to be looking for scapegoats?

01:11:49,058 --> 01:11:51,646
SPEAKER_1:  What do you learn from human nature that this seems to keep happening?

01:11:52,066 --> 01:11:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  I think there's a book called The Nurture Assumption.

01:11:56,674 --> 01:12:00,190
SPEAKER_0:  and I discussed this in the new write and what the author learned

01:12:00,898 --> 01:12:03,966
SPEAKER_0:  is that humans define themselves by opposition.

01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:06,078
SPEAKER_0:  So if you have a group of.

01:12:06,402 --> 01:12:08,190
SPEAKER_0:  and its kids and adults.

01:12:08,706 --> 01:12:11,742
SPEAKER_0:  The kids will see themselves as kids because we're as opposed to adults.

01:12:12,354 --> 01:12:13,566
SPEAKER_0:  If the adults leave.

01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:15,614
SPEAKER_0:  the kids see themselves as boys and girls.

01:12:16,482 --> 01:12:20,190
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not a girl, I'm a boy, I'm not a boy, I'm a girl. So they divide.

01:12:20,674 --> 01:12:22,142
SPEAKER_0:  So this idea.

01:12:22,402 --> 01:12:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  which is a very lefty idea.

01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:28,638
SPEAKER_0:  that human beings naturally all get along is not accurate. The best example of this is

01:12:28,930 --> 01:12:30,942
SPEAKER_0:  Look after 9-11. Look where there's a war.

01:12:31,266 --> 01:12:34,398
SPEAKER_0:  Nothing unites a popula- it's not like when times are thriving.

01:12:34,754 --> 01:12:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  that everyone's all working together when things are bad and there's an enemy.

01:12:38,882 --> 01:12:42,110
SPEAKER_0:  You know, it's the Japanese of Pearl Harbor. It's Al-Qaeda.

01:12:42,498 --> 01:12:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  That's when everyone really comes together because now we have someone to be against.

01:12:47,074 --> 01:12:48,702
SPEAKER_0:  So there will always be.

01:12:50,018 --> 01:12:51,582
SPEAKER_0:  someone has to be the out group.

01:12:52,194 --> 01:12:54,462
SPEAKER_0:  and we have to be the in-group as opposed to them.

01:12:55,426 --> 01:12:55,870
SPEAKER_1:  BUT

01:12:56,354 --> 01:12:57,726
SPEAKER_1:  There's a viciousness.

01:12:58,050 --> 01:12:59,550
SPEAKER_1:  to the actions you take.

01:13:00,162 --> 01:13:01,214
SPEAKER_1:  uh... towards the outgroup

01:13:02,498 --> 01:13:03,902
SPEAKER_1:  that varies throughout history. Yes

01:13:04,226 --> 01:13:04,670
SPEAKER_1:  Some.

01:13:05,058 --> 01:13:06,910
SPEAKER_1:  like the degree of viciousness can cross.

01:13:07,298 --> 01:13:12,606
SPEAKER_1:  the line towards atrocities, towards genocide. Right. And that's the question of in.

01:13:13,954 --> 01:13:15,390
SPEAKER_1:  Why does this sometimes do that?

01:13:15,618 --> 01:13:17,694
SPEAKER_1:  Why does it sometimes cross into genocide?

01:13:18,338 --> 01:13:22,494
SPEAKER_1:  I understand it's a useful thing to have the other to blame in this world.

01:13:22,786 --> 01:13:23,998
SPEAKER_1:  especially when times are rough.

01:13:24,578 --> 01:13:25,822
SPEAKER_1:  but why does that sometimes?

01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:28,478
SPEAKER_1:  Letus of action.

01:13:28,866 --> 01:13:30,494
SPEAKER_1:  that says I'm going to murder.

01:13:30,754 --> 01:13:31,879
SPEAKER_1:  well to torture

01:13:31,879 --> 01:13:32,542
SPEAKER_0:  together.

01:13:32,898 --> 01:13:35,134
SPEAKER_0:  question really is why sometimes it doesn't.

01:13:35,426 --> 01:13:38,206
SPEAKER_0:  Right. One of the things I learned when I was doing the new write.

01:13:38,626 --> 01:13:40,318
SPEAKER_0:  is a lot of the uh

01:13:40,962 --> 01:13:44,606
SPEAKER_0:  Nazis, using that term loosely speaking, you're Nazis, they make the point that like, oh...

01:13:44,866 --> 01:13:49,342
SPEAKER_0:  When the Holocaust happened, it really wasn't that big of a deal, and that only became a big deal in the decades later.

01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:51,998
SPEAKER_0:  And this just shows the power of Jewish influence. And I'm like.

01:13:52,418 --> 01:13:53,566
SPEAKER_0:  This to me is.

01:13:54,242 --> 01:13:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  a great thing. It's a great thing that we sat down.

01:13:58,786 --> 01:14:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  pretty recently historically.

01:14:00,674 --> 01:14:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  And we're like, wait a minute.

01:14:02,306 --> 01:14:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  Guys

01:14:03,266 --> 01:14:04,574
SPEAKER_0:  When we have a war.

01:14:04,962 --> 01:14:06,238
SPEAKER_0:  or we have Conquest.

01:14:06,594 --> 01:14:07,326
SPEAKER_0:  You don't have to just...

01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:11,742
SPEAKER_0:  start killing everyone. Like this is something that's bad and wrong and-

01:14:12,418 --> 01:14:13,182
SPEAKER_0:  Certainly in the last.

01:14:13,762 --> 01:14:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  60 years, 70 years, this is something that people have come to take for granted. But that wasn't the case before, it would always be.

01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:22,878
SPEAKER_0:  or not always, but often if you conquer, you just.

01:14:23,458 --> 01:14:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  go wild and just start slaughtering.

01:14:25,634 --> 01:14:26,718
SPEAKER_0:  Massive people.

01:14:27,042 --> 01:14:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  Um, it's, um...

01:14:28,738 --> 01:14:30,270
SPEAKER_0:  Who's the guy from, um...

01:14:30,978 --> 01:14:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  Harvard, and he- Steven Pinker. Sorry, I forgot his name.

01:14:34,722 --> 01:14:37,438
SPEAKER_0:  So he just talks about like, you know, we know.

01:14:37,762 --> 01:14:39,422
SPEAKER_0:  This is one of the reasons also why.

01:14:39,778 --> 01:14:41,182
SPEAKER_0:  There was so much skepticism.

01:14:41,474 --> 01:14:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  when the Holocaust started because this was regarded as something that was barbaric. This is from the Middle Ages, from the biblical times. We don't do this anymore. We're civilized now.

01:14:51,426 --> 01:14:53,758
SPEAKER_0:  So genocide is.

01:14:54,402 --> 01:14:55,742
SPEAKER_0:  historically the norm.

01:14:56,130 --> 01:14:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's also harder to pull it off.

01:14:58,690 --> 01:14:59,646
SPEAKER_0:  emotionally.

01:15:00,002 --> 01:15:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  when you have the visuals.

01:15:01,538 --> 01:15:02,782
SPEAKER_0:  and when you have the audio.

01:15:03,074 --> 01:15:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  and when you have the voices.

01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:12,702
SPEAKER_0:  of the people being slaughtered. We don't know, you know, if this was 2000 years ago and people, you know, in the Bible, they go kill this group, go kill that group.

01:15:12,994 --> 01:15:16,606
SPEAKER_0:  We don't have their names, we don't have their visuals, we don't have anything. But when you see-

01:15:17,026 --> 01:15:19,198
SPEAKER_0:  someone being like, you know, the.

01:15:19,586 --> 01:15:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  There's a book about, I think, the Rwandan genocide.

01:15:22,882 --> 01:15:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  and the title is, We regret to inform you that tomorrow we will be executed with all of our families like a telegram.

01:15:28,802 --> 01:15:37,534
SPEAKER_0:  And like when you get a telegram like this, it's very different than reading some history book about the Assyrians killed the Phoenicians. It's like, I don't know who this is. I don't know who that is. Right?

01:15:37,954 --> 01:15:38,750
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:15:39,170 --> 01:15:43,166
SPEAKER_0:  I think this is something that has changed very recently. It was this kind of-

01:15:43,490 --> 01:15:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  Interesting moment just that speaks to the

01:15:46,434 --> 01:15:50,078
SPEAKER_0:  the way technology has liberated people from violence.

01:15:50,530 --> 01:15:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  Kristallnacht, which was a moment in the lead up to the Holocaust.

01:15:55,522 --> 01:16:00,766
SPEAKER_0:  where basically, with Hitler's blessing, you had a nationwide burning of Jewish...

01:16:01,154 --> 01:16:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  businesses.

01:16:02,178 --> 01:16:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  Synagogues burnt down.

01:16:03,778 --> 01:16:04,990
SPEAKER_0:  And Kaiser Wilhelm.

01:16:05,378 --> 01:16:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  uh, you know, the Kaiser.

01:16:06,978 --> 01:16:09,246
SPEAKER_0:  He said, for the first time in my life, I'm embarrassed to be a German.

01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:11,486
SPEAKER_0:  But that was a moment where worldwide...

01:16:11,714 --> 01:16:15,326
SPEAKER_0:  Even plenty of people who did not think very highly of Jewish people were like,

01:16:16,514 --> 01:16:17,182
SPEAKER_0:  This is.

01:16:17,986 --> 01:16:20,766
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, rap. This is a complete nightmare.

01:16:21,474 --> 01:16:22,878
SPEAKER_0:  200 years ago, 100 years ago.

01:16:23,554 --> 01:16:25,246
SPEAKER_0:  maybe not literally a Kristallnacht, but.

01:16:25,730 --> 01:16:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  There's an out group and we hate them and we're going to kill them and it's fine.

01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:30,686
SPEAKER_1:  Anything is even.

01:16:31,042 --> 01:16:32,254
SPEAKER_1:  More difficult now.

01:16:32,834 --> 01:16:33,662
SPEAKER_1:  with the internet.

01:16:33,858 --> 01:16:39,166
SPEAKER_0:  Yes. Do that kind of thing. Yeah, I'm not, now, more difficult doesn't mean it doesn't happen, or it can't happen. I'm not saying that at all.

01:16:39,522 --> 01:16:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  But I'm saying...

01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:47,966
SPEAKER_0:  We know a lot about what's going on in North Korea, you know, probably the most secretive country on earth. There's a lot of atrocities in Eritrea.

01:16:48,386 --> 01:16:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  uh... which is kind of known so i think

01:16:51,330 --> 01:16:52,766
SPEAKER_0:  It also, it's also.

01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  Like if you think about it, if you're-

01:16:55,426 --> 01:17:01,022
SPEAKER_0:  how many years ago, 300 years ago, you only know the people in your village and they're all probably gonna look like you so on and so forth

01:17:01,346 --> 01:17:05,054
SPEAKER_0:  Whereas now, if I'm on social media and there's someone from any country...

01:17:05,282 --> 01:17:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  and maybe their picture looks a little different they could use the same anime picture as somebody else

01:17:08,834 --> 01:17:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  but they're putting forth their ideas.

01:17:11,074 --> 01:17:15,678
SPEAKER_0:  you do see the humanity in them and you do see a sense of familiarity and a familial

01:17:16,258 --> 01:17:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  bond with them.

01:17:17,378 --> 01:17:21,246
SPEAKER_0:  And when you hear about these things, you know, when I, again, like I did, when I did Dear Reader,

01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:22,142
SPEAKER_0:  No one.

01:17:22,914 --> 01:17:24,990
SPEAKER_0:  And I was on Al Qaeda and I was on Alex Jones.

01:17:25,282 --> 01:17:26,398
SPEAKER_0:  No one pushed back.

01:17:26,946 --> 01:17:27,678
SPEAKER_0:  about like.

01:17:28,162 --> 01:17:30,782
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, the North Koreans. They were all like, this is horrible.

01:17:31,074 --> 01:17:32,254
SPEAKER_0:  If I had a magic wand.

01:17:32,610 --> 01:17:35,582
SPEAKER_0:  I'd give them food. I wouldn't have them live in fear.

01:17:35,842 --> 01:17:38,686
SPEAKER_0:  uh... and this is something that i don't think was the case

01:17:38,978 --> 01:17:40,158
SPEAKER_0:  a couple hundred years ago.

01:17:40,578 --> 01:17:41,703
SPEAKER_0:  That said, uh...

01:17:41,703 --> 01:17:45,118
SPEAKER_1:  I'd love to get your thoughts about what's going on in Iran, the protests.

01:17:45,474 --> 01:17:50,142
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like the regime there is able to crack down on violence.

01:17:50,274 --> 01:17:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  My thoughts about Iran, let me just, there's something else about Iran which I think is interesting.

01:17:54,658 --> 01:17:56,510
SPEAKER_0:  this whole idea of care for what you wish for.

01:17:56,962 --> 01:18:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  because people have this sight and something I kind of one of the reasons I have the white pill

01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  is Americans really are very naive about the nature of evil.

01:18:04,386 --> 01:18:06,398
SPEAKER_0:  Right? I really think that

01:18:06,626 --> 01:18:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  A dictator has a weird mustache and he's banging the table and he's, you know, like a crazy person.

01:18:12,162 --> 01:18:14,846
SPEAKER_0:  and it's often not the case, but they also think

01:18:15,266 --> 01:18:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  if something is bad.

01:18:17,986 --> 01:18:19,742
SPEAKER_0:  Therefore, the alternative's gonna be better.

01:18:20,674 --> 01:18:23,006
SPEAKER_0:  Um, so you had the shah of Iran.

01:18:23,362 --> 01:18:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  and he was.

01:18:24,258 --> 01:18:27,262
SPEAKER_0:  Kind of authoritarian and no, he's not a good guy.

01:18:27,554 --> 01:18:30,622
SPEAKER_0:  So in 1979, there were a lot of people like, this guy's a-

01:18:31,138 --> 01:18:31,710
SPEAKER_0:  horrible.

01:18:32,002 --> 01:18:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  He's oppressing the Iranian people. Let's get him the F out of there.

01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:36,478
SPEAKER_0:  He's so bad.

01:18:36,994 --> 01:18:39,838
SPEAKER_0:  that whatever comes after it has to be an improvement.

01:18:40,290 --> 01:18:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  And it's like...

01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  No, that's, if you think, I mean, this drives me crazy.

01:18:44,962 --> 01:18:46,302
SPEAKER_0:  when conservatives are like

01:18:46,530 --> 01:18:50,846
SPEAKER_0:  You know, Joe Biden's the worst president we ever had. Like this is destroying America. I'm like.

01:18:51,202 --> 01:18:52,702
SPEAKER_0:  You have no idea.

01:18:53,538 --> 01:18:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  how bad things can get.

01:18:55,458 --> 01:18:57,502
SPEAKER_0:  The fact that you are in a position to

01:18:57,794 --> 01:18:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  complain.

01:18:59,170 --> 01:19:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  means we got a ways to go.

01:19:02,338 --> 01:19:03,326
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, every time.

01:19:03,746 --> 01:19:07,358
SPEAKER_1:  You say that Donald Trump or Joe Biden is the worst president ever.

01:19:07,618 --> 01:19:08,638
SPEAKER_1:  That warms my heart.

01:19:09,122 --> 01:19:11,623
SPEAKER_1:  because you're allowed to.

01:19:11,623 --> 01:19:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  Yes. Isn't this a flock of chickens?

01:19:13,538 --> 01:19:15,774
SPEAKER_1:  It's like, I just let it, it's like music.

01:19:16,738 --> 01:19:17,086
SPEAKER_1:  has.

01:19:17,410 --> 01:19:22,285
SPEAKER_1:  You're allowed to be pretty, in response to a president's tweet, you can write that.

01:19:22,285 --> 01:19:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:23,486
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

01:19:23,746 --> 01:19:25,790
SPEAKER_1:  and it still lives there and it's.

01:19:26,018 --> 01:19:27,774
SPEAKER_1:  and nobody arrests you.

01:19:28,290 --> 01:19:28,670
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:19:29,506 --> 01:19:33,246
SPEAKER_1:  which is a rare thing in human history. Yes. It's the rare thing in the world.

01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:34,398
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, what?

01:19:35,010 --> 01:19:36,350
SPEAKER_1:  It does seem that...

01:19:36,834 --> 01:19:40,606
SPEAKER_1:  Iran, the current regime, is able to crack down on communication channels.

01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:41,630
SPEAKER_1:  It's still-

01:19:44,226 --> 01:19:45,406
SPEAKER_1:  It's surprising to me.

01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:47,518
SPEAKER_1:  how much power a government can have.

01:19:47,842 --> 01:19:48,670
SPEAKER_1:  Like they could.

01:19:49,026 --> 01:19:51,198
SPEAKER_1:  use violence to control the population.

01:19:51,650 --> 01:19:51,966
SPEAKER_1:  Right.

01:19:52,546 --> 01:19:54,462
SPEAKER_1:  and nobody's gonna do anything about it.

01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:56,830
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I just- The rest of the world.

01:19:57,186 --> 01:19:58,142
SPEAKER_1:  just watches.

01:19:58,850 --> 01:20:02,942
SPEAKER_0:  But here's the thing, right? Because if the rest of the world starts doing too much,

01:20:03,330 --> 01:20:05,598
SPEAKER_0:  then they have a justification to crack down even more.

01:20:05,858 --> 01:20:06,750
SPEAKER_0:  This regime, this.

01:20:07,042 --> 01:20:08,222
SPEAKER_0:  protests are not legitimate.

01:20:08,546 --> 01:20:11,838
SPEAKER_0:  These are, this happened constantly in the Soviet Union. These are foreign provocateurs.

01:20:12,098 --> 01:20:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  This is meddling in our country.

01:20:15,330 --> 01:20:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

01:20:16,162 --> 01:20:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, curfew, lockdown.

01:20:18,754 --> 01:20:25,086
SPEAKER_0:  You know, mandatory searches, everyone's a spy. So that narrative is a very convenient one for people who are authoritarian.

01:20:25,506 --> 01:20:27,038
SPEAKER_0:  Um, I...

01:20:27,458 --> 01:20:30,046
SPEAKER_0:  know a lot of people who are Persian, as I'm sure you do as well.

01:20:30,434 --> 01:20:32,094
SPEAKER_0:  very hard working.

01:20:32,322 --> 01:20:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  very bright, great people.

01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and you know, all you could do is hope.

01:20:38,466 --> 01:20:39,518
SPEAKER_0:  for a peaceful

01:20:40,034 --> 01:20:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  liberalization of your- but here's the- people don't realize how-

01:20:43,586 --> 01:20:45,598
SPEAKER_0:  liberal Iran used to be.

01:20:45,826 --> 01:20:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  Andy Warhol

01:20:47,490 --> 01:20:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  Andy Warhol used to be friends with the Shah.

01:20:49,794 --> 01:20:55,486
SPEAKER_0:  And if you read his diaries, he talks about how he knew things weren't going well for the Shah because they had less caviar at the table.

01:20:55,842 --> 01:20:58,846
SPEAKER_0:  But like, this is, he was really kind of-

01:20:59,170 --> 01:20:59,486
SPEAKER_0:  There's.

01:21:00,674 --> 01:21:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  There's I think a.

01:21:01,602 --> 01:21:03,454
SPEAKER_0:  for understanding in America.

01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:05,182
SPEAKER_0:  and I'm not sure why.

01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:08,830
SPEAKER_0:  of what these liberal Muslim countries are like.

01:21:09,314 --> 01:21:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  Um, I-

01:21:10,690 --> 01:21:14,046
SPEAKER_0:  gave a talk in Bodrum in Turkey which is a resort town in Turkey.

01:21:14,562 --> 01:21:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:21:15,202 --> 01:21:16,798
SPEAKER_0:  I had thought previous to that.

01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:18,686
SPEAKER_0:  or I suspected.

01:21:18,946 --> 01:21:22,526
SPEAKER_0:  If push comes to shove and they have to choose people in Turkey between the West.

01:21:22,914 --> 01:21:25,310
SPEAKER_0:  and like al-qaeda, not al-qaeda but like you know

01:21:25,826 --> 01:21:26,558
SPEAKER_0:  hardcore Islam.

01:21:26,786 --> 01:21:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  They're gonna choose Hardcore as love. You go there?

01:21:29,378 --> 01:21:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  And you're like, oh, this is like Los Angeles. Like these people are so liberal, so-

01:21:34,082 --> 01:21:37,246
SPEAKER_0:  and they're the first to be killed. They're the first targets.

01:21:37,602 --> 01:21:39,966
SPEAKER_0:  So that, people like that in Iran are who.

01:21:40,322 --> 01:21:42,654
SPEAKER_0:  my thoughts are and with that i gotta tell you like

01:21:42,946 --> 01:21:45,182
SPEAKER_0:  Nothing makes me more of a feminist.

01:21:45,730 --> 01:21:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  than seeing the women.

01:21:47,298 --> 01:21:53,150
SPEAKER_0:  in countries like this fight for the right to education, the right to dress as they please.

01:21:53,538 --> 01:21:54,910
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe we don't need them driving, but.

01:21:55,170 --> 01:21:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  You know, that's okay.

01:21:58,210 --> 01:21:58,974
SPEAKER_0:  There he is!

01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:01,950
SPEAKER_1:  with that characteristic brilliant humor.

01:22:04,610 --> 01:22:06,174
SPEAKER_1:  that you're so loved for.

01:22:06,562 --> 01:22:14,823
SPEAKER_1:  I should probably be banned for on Twitter. I'm doing my best. Every time you tweet, I just report, report, report. Is

01:22:14,823 --> 01:22:19,253
SPEAKER_0:  this man. You don't have a script. Exactly.

01:22:19,253 --> 01:22:20,958
SPEAKER_1:  Funny enough, I do.

01:22:21,314 --> 01:22:22,014
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:22:22,722 --> 01:22:25,022
SPEAKER_1:  but I don't abuse my power.

01:22:26,210 --> 01:22:27,646
SPEAKER_1:  I wear the ring like Frodo.

01:22:28,482 --> 01:22:29,630
SPEAKER_1:  and I respect the power.

01:22:29,858 --> 01:22:30,686
SPEAKER_1:  But you look like goll-

01:22:32,738 --> 01:22:34,686
SPEAKER_1:  That's not what your mom said last night.

01:22:36,322 --> 01:22:37,790
SPEAKER_0:  She said you're hung like Gollum.

01:22:39,906 --> 01:22:40,446
SPEAKER_1:  Heh.

01:22:41,154 --> 01:22:47,646
SPEAKER_1:  I'm not going down that road with you. I'm not holding hands one another time. I learned my Fumi once.

01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:48,702
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

01:22:49,378 --> 01:22:51,934
SPEAKER_1:  My close childhood friend is from Iran.

01:22:52,226 --> 01:22:54,302
SPEAKER_1:  Oh wow, okay. And uh.

01:22:55,650 --> 01:22:56,926
SPEAKER_1:  I talk to them a lot.

01:22:59,554 --> 01:23:00,190
SPEAKER_1:  I wanted-

01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:01,374
SPEAKER_1:  to go to Iran.

01:23:01,570 --> 01:23:02,558
SPEAKER_0:  But it's so far away.

01:23:03,266 --> 01:23:05,246
SPEAKER_1:  I can see it from my house, my friend.

01:23:05,762 --> 01:23:06,526
SPEAKER_1:  Um,

01:23:06,978 --> 01:23:08,766
SPEAKER_1:  I would love to take that trip, even now.

01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:16,926
SPEAKER_1:  It's just culturally. So all the different little pockets of local cultures that make up Iran. I just heard so many amazing things.

01:23:17,186 --> 01:23:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, my friend Paul went there. He had an amazing time. He just absolutely loved it. He thought the people were awesome.

01:23:21,954 --> 01:23:24,894
SPEAKER_0:  It was so interesting, very developed.

01:23:25,314 --> 01:23:29,438
SPEAKER_0:  uh... just like to run is the history in toronto's insane

01:23:30,658 --> 01:23:33,246
SPEAKER_1:  I would really love to...

01:23:33,922 --> 01:23:35,614
SPEAKER_1:  to visit. Now we return back.

01:23:36,194 --> 01:23:37,822
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know how we ended up in Iran.

01:23:38,754 --> 01:23:42,462
SPEAKER_1:  but let us let us stroll back to Stalin taking power.

01:23:42,786 --> 01:23:45,246
SPEAKER_1:  What role did the suppression of speech?

01:23:46,594 --> 01:23:50,014
SPEAKER_1:  the censorship, the suppression of the freedom of the press.

01:23:50,466 --> 01:23:50,910
SPEAKER_1:  have.

01:23:51,266 --> 01:23:51,998
SPEAKER_1:  in the

01:23:52,322 --> 01:23:52,766
SPEAKER_1:  Stalin.

01:23:53,122 --> 01:23:54,494
SPEAKER_1:  taking hold, taking power.

01:23:54,978 --> 01:23:55,518
SPEAKER_1:  in Lenin.

01:23:55,906 --> 01:23:58,014
SPEAKER_1:  Trotsky and Stalin having power.

01:23:58,178 --> 01:24:01,502
SPEAKER_0:  Well, it was a very useful mechanism to.

01:24:01,730 --> 01:24:02,462
SPEAKER_0:  Direct

01:24:02,690 --> 01:24:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  public.

01:24:03,650 --> 01:24:05,118
SPEAKER_0:  and inform.

01:24:05,826 --> 01:24:10,686
SPEAKER_0:  public perspectives and everything. So first of all, there was a lot of news about how

01:24:11,330 --> 01:24:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:24:12,098 --> 01:24:17,886
SPEAKER_0:  great things were, you have a bumper crop here, you know, grains never better. There's another anecdote.

01:24:18,370 --> 01:24:21,374
SPEAKER_0:  where President Kalinian is talking about how

01:24:21,922 --> 01:24:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:24,990
SPEAKER_0:  I'm Karl Mark Street in Karkev.

01:24:25,346 --> 01:24:31,486
SPEAKER_0:  There's all sorts of new skyscrapers being built and it's just absolutely amazing. And some of the audience gets up and goes, Comrade, I-

01:24:31,778 --> 01:24:40,446
SPEAKER_0:  work on Karl Marx Street, I walk there every day, there's none of these skyscrapers. It goes, see, that's your problem. You're trusting your eyes instead of reading something and learning what's in the papers.

01:24:40,802 --> 01:24:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  So there was this kind of disconnect between.

01:24:43,650 --> 01:24:45,214
SPEAKER_0:  You know, uh, uh,

01:24:45,890 --> 01:24:48,990
SPEAKER_0:  I forgot you probably know the joke like pravda ne pravda

01:24:49,218 --> 01:24:54,270
SPEAKER_0:  Like, Pravda means truth, but there's no truth to be had in Pravda is the kind of Russian line.

01:24:54,914 --> 01:24:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  The point is it.

01:24:56,194 --> 01:24:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  very much.

01:24:57,698 --> 01:25:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  and the other thing this is you know my mom wasn't politically motivated

01:25:02,306 --> 01:25:03,710
SPEAKER_0:  But she talked about how.

01:25:04,226 --> 01:25:05,758
SPEAKER_0:  You didn't have to be smart.

01:25:06,114 --> 01:25:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  to realize how...

01:25:07,586 --> 01:25:08,766
SPEAKER_0:  Dishonest it was?

01:25:09,122 --> 01:25:10,302
SPEAKER_0:  Because one day...

01:25:10,658 --> 01:25:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  someone is the great hero of the Soviet people.

01:25:14,306 --> 01:25:15,422
SPEAKER_0:  And the next week...

01:25:15,746 --> 01:25:19,838
SPEAKER_0:  he's been a traitor and a class enemy and the worst, and then sometimes they reverted.

01:25:20,194 --> 01:25:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  And it's like, okay, like they couldn't even keep their story straight.

01:25:24,098 --> 01:25:27,646
SPEAKER_0:  And in fact, at a certain point when Gorbachev liberalized...

01:25:27,906 --> 01:25:32,222
SPEAKER_0:  They had to cancel tests because the history books had to be rewritten so quickly.

01:25:32,610 --> 01:25:33,214
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:25:33,538 --> 01:25:37,054
SPEAKER_0:  So, and the thing that also with these newspapers.

01:25:37,410 --> 01:25:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  is there was a lot of, it was very monotonous.

01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  because you know you had the same message over and over.

01:25:43,202 --> 01:25:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of these papers were about kind of speaking to the lowest common denominator. Stalin's great.

01:25:48,834 --> 01:25:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  Everything's great, overseas bad.

01:25:50,978 --> 01:25:52,766
SPEAKER_0:  So it,

01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:56,702
SPEAKER_0:  very much was about not informing, but creating.

01:25:57,314 --> 01:25:57,790
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:25:58,082 --> 01:26:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  a certain perspective in the public at large. And also, you were educated as a citizen.

01:26:05,058 --> 01:26:07,166
SPEAKER_0:  on what you're supposed to think and say.

01:26:07,650 --> 01:26:10,654
SPEAKER_0:  So you have, a lot of this was this kind of...

01:26:11,586 --> 01:26:13,662
SPEAKER_0:  private truth, public lies situation.

01:26:14,114 --> 01:26:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  So you could read the paper and at your factory, you could be like...

01:26:17,634 --> 01:26:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  Oh my God, this guy Carl Raddick's great. He's like, oh my God, yeah, he's amazing. You knew what to talk about?

01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:25,758
SPEAKER_0:  and you knew how to look at it as well.

01:26:26,018 --> 01:26:28,670
SPEAKER_0:  And then when you get home, you could just kind of be more honest with.

01:26:28,930 --> 01:26:29,342
SPEAKER_0:  family.

01:26:29,666 --> 01:26:34,686
SPEAKER_1:  But the question is, to which degree does this propaganda and this ideology infiltrate your actual-

01:26:35,330 --> 01:26:35,902
SPEAKER_1:  Thinking.

01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:40,318
SPEAKER_1:  uh... you get you give examples of sex scientists infiltrated science

01:26:40,930 --> 01:26:44,318
SPEAKER_0:  Oh yeah, so basically, you know, Lisenko is the

01:26:45,058 --> 01:26:47,294
SPEAKER_0:  textbook example of synchroism in biology.

01:26:47,522 --> 01:26:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  So because Marxism is materialist...

01:26:50,626 --> 01:26:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  uh... they didn't like the idea that jeans pass on

01:26:54,338 --> 01:26:54,782
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:58,622
SPEAKER_0:  you know, from one generation to the next. So, Lysenkoism kind of was a rejection.

01:26:58,978 --> 01:27:01,758
SPEAKER_0:  of Mendel and that kind of genetics.

01:27:02,178 --> 01:27:02,878
SPEAKER_0:  And

01:27:03,330 --> 01:27:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  If you reject genes, you're really going in a bad direction in terms of biology. The Soviet Union's biological program became an international laughing stock.

01:27:11,170 --> 01:27:14,750
SPEAKER_0:  At one point, Lysenko claimed he crossed a tomato and a potato.

01:27:15,298 --> 01:27:18,078
SPEAKER_0:  You had things where they said they

01:27:18,402 --> 01:27:20,638
SPEAKER_0:  had nuclear, which is, wait, we have.

01:27:20,994 --> 01:27:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  fishing, but they said they invented fusion or hard or heavy water or hard water.

01:27:25,730 --> 01:27:26,430
SPEAKER_0:  point being.

01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:29,086
SPEAKER_0:  in cultures like this.

01:27:29,602 --> 01:27:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  Your-

01:27:31,106 --> 01:27:32,542
SPEAKER_0:  way to achieve.

01:27:33,058 --> 01:27:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  uh, status.

01:27:34,274 --> 01:27:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  wasn't necessarily about your accomplishments, but about your loyalty to orthodoxy. So if you were saying things that got to a result that was congruent,

01:27:43,586 --> 01:27:45,726
SPEAKER_0:  with the broader ideology as a whole.

01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:52,382
SPEAKER_0:  That was much better as a means of furthering yourself in the arts or in the sciences.

01:27:52,674 --> 01:28:01,790
SPEAKER_0:  than if you had something that was innovative, because if you're innovative, it's like, well, how do I fit this in with the broader ruling ideology? The problem with totalitarianism, one of the many problems is...

01:28:02,114 --> 01:28:02,750
SPEAKER_0:  Everything.

01:28:03,330 --> 01:28:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  Literally everything has to be perceived.

01:28:06,594 --> 01:28:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  through the lens of ideology.

01:28:08,578 --> 01:28:11,774
SPEAKER_0:  So, and that is, you know, there were...

01:28:12,386 --> 01:28:15,486
SPEAKER_0:  scientists who were arrested or at least fired.

01:28:15,874 --> 01:28:20,702
SPEAKER_0:  because of their theories about sunspot developments, because it was regarded as un-Marxist. There is just —

01:28:20,930 --> 01:28:22,238
SPEAKER_0:  There was a...

01:28:23,010 --> 01:28:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  An epidemic and all these horses got sick.

01:28:25,858 --> 01:28:28,414
SPEAKER_0:  And because the vaccine didn't work on the horses.

01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:35,390
SPEAKER_0:  the bacteriologists were arrested because they regard as wreckers. It's like, we gave you a job. You didn't do it. You're undermining the socialist state.

01:28:35,746 --> 01:28:38,846
SPEAKER_0:  So it's kind of a backward series of incentives.

01:28:39,202 --> 01:28:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and it's designed to maintain at all costs.

01:28:42,754 --> 01:28:44,798
SPEAKER_0:  the ruling ideological superstructure.

01:28:45,442 --> 01:28:52,510
SPEAKER_1:  You draw a small distinction between the ideology and the ideological superstructure and the propaganda. Aren't those kind of intermixed together?

01:28:52,642 --> 01:29:04,158
SPEAKER_0:  Well, the ideologicals like in the sciences and what's true in genetics or what's true in astronomy, that doesn't really percolate out to the masses, right? So the prob does not is maybe covering this scientist is great or these discoveries are great.

01:29:04,418 --> 01:29:06,782
SPEAKER_0:  but it's not necessarily the same as day to day.

01:29:07,234 --> 01:29:09,109
SPEAKER_0:  or glorifying political leaders.

01:29:09,109 --> 01:29:12,926
SPEAKER_1:  But Pravda is a manifestation of the idea that truth can be.

01:29:13,154 --> 01:29:17,118
SPEAKER_1:  conjured up. Yes, you can be constructed and it could be altered quickly and then.

01:29:18,306 --> 01:29:21,598
SPEAKER_1:  I just, I wonder, sort of 1984 caricatures that.

01:29:21,890 --> 01:29:23,166
SPEAKER_1:  I wonder to what degree.

01:29:24,546 --> 01:29:27,134
SPEAKER_1:  it really could control the way you think.

01:29:28,866 --> 01:29:30,503
SPEAKER_1:  that like how many people that are.

01:29:30,503 --> 01:29:35,710
SPEAKER_0:  I can give you an example, a very easy one. So again, regarding North Korea.

01:29:36,322 --> 01:29:42,462
SPEAKER_0:  The great leader Kim Il-sung, who was the founder of North Korea, had a tumor on the back of his neck.

01:29:42,754 --> 01:29:43,422
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:29:43,650 --> 01:29:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  It was too close to the skull, the spinal column, so they couldn't operate on it. And throughout his life, it got bigger and bigger.

01:29:50,242 --> 01:29:56,862
SPEAKER_0:  And I got mixed messages in my research about whether North Koreans knew about it because they always photographed them from this angle.

01:29:57,890 --> 01:29:58,974
SPEAKER_0:  and I met a refugee.

01:29:59,618 --> 01:30:00,222
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:30:00,834 --> 01:30:09,502
SPEAKER_0:  And I asked her, I'm like, did you know that he had this tumor? She goes, yeah, yeah. When people played him in the movies, they would make up there. And she goes, it was an old war injury.

01:30:10,018 --> 01:30:15,038
SPEAKER_0:  And I go, why would a war injury get bigger throughout your life? And she just stood there.

01:30:15,682 --> 01:30:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  And she was like, holy crap, but she never questioned it.

01:30:18,466 --> 01:30:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  But it was the kind of thing where they put the idea in her head. And since there was no reason to question it, she just kind of went with it her entire life until I talked to her.

01:30:25,634 --> 01:30:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  Audrey, his name.

01:30:27,778 --> 01:30:28,254
SPEAKER_0:  Hi Audrey.

01:30:28,962 --> 01:30:29,726
SPEAKER_1:  Hi Audrey.

01:30:30,178 --> 01:30:32,254
SPEAKER_1:  I wonder what percent of the population is like that.

01:30:32,514 --> 01:30:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  Here's the thing.

01:30:34,114 --> 01:30:35,486
SPEAKER_0:  If there is a cost...

01:30:35,778 --> 01:30:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  to me questioning Lisenko as a great scientist and there was no benefit.

01:30:40,418 --> 01:30:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  Why wouldn't I just go with what's going to-

01:30:43,202 --> 01:30:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  keep me and my family safe.

01:30:44,770 --> 01:30:47,390
SPEAKER_1:  But I also mean just the psychological.

01:30:48,994 --> 01:30:50,430
SPEAKER_1:  there might be a very.

01:30:50,850 --> 01:30:54,590
SPEAKER_1:  local psychological costs are not a cost you go to jail but a cost like

01:30:55,618 --> 01:30:58,110
SPEAKER_1:  You're gonna kind of ruin the conversation by bringing it up.

01:30:58,466 --> 01:30:58,942
SPEAKER_1:  Kind of like.

01:31:00,290 --> 01:31:01,415
SPEAKER_1:  I don't, I'm just.

01:31:01,415 --> 01:31:04,094
SPEAKER_0:  It's like Debbie Downer, right? Yeah.

01:31:04,386 --> 01:31:13,982
SPEAKER_0:  But there's also the whole metaphor of like there's two fish in the river. One says, man, the water is really great today. And the other one goes, what's water? Yeah, like a friend of mine, Adriana, her mom.

01:31:14,210 --> 01:31:15,326
SPEAKER_0:  came to the West.

01:31:15,746 --> 01:31:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  And they went to the supermarket and the mom just in front of all the Fanta.

01:31:18,722 --> 01:31:20,286
SPEAKER_0:  The sense of it just crying.

01:31:20,930 --> 01:31:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  And she's like, what's going on? And she goes, they told us we had more food than you.

01:31:24,962 --> 01:31:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  And when something is, you can, it's, you can under think this story.

01:31:30,626 --> 01:31:35,582
SPEAKER_0:  This guy's an enemy of the people, he was the hero, he just offended someone, this is bullshit.

01:31:36,098 --> 01:31:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  It's almost impossible psychologically.

01:31:38,914 --> 01:31:39,582
SPEAKER_0:  to think.

01:31:40,226 --> 01:31:41,662
SPEAKER_0:  I'm living in the Truman Show.

01:31:42,178 --> 01:31:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  And that's it.

01:31:42,882 --> 01:31:45,022
SPEAKER_0:  EVERYTHING in the media.

01:31:45,602 --> 01:31:46,878
SPEAKER_0:  is not just wrong.

01:31:47,170 --> 01:31:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  but a carefully constructed narrative and a lie.

01:31:50,146 --> 01:31:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  Like what, they're never gonna tell the truth? How you, you know, like what?

01:31:53,602 --> 01:31:56,574
SPEAKER_0:  Like, and even if you do understand that.

01:31:56,930 --> 01:31:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  How would you even read between the lines to deduce what the truth is?

01:31:59,906 --> 01:32:03,582
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it must have been a strange experience. These are stories of soldiers.

01:32:03,938 --> 01:32:06,462
SPEAKER_1:  the Red Army soldiers throughout World War II.

01:32:06,690 --> 01:32:08,990
SPEAKER_1:  as they go to different countries, even Romania.

01:32:10,370 --> 01:32:10,942
SPEAKER_1:  in Europe.

01:32:11,746 --> 01:32:14,942
SPEAKER_1:  to understand that people live much better.

01:32:15,778 --> 01:32:17,703
SPEAKER_1:  than the soldiers did back in the...

01:32:17,703 --> 01:32:22,878
SPEAKER_0:  And that's why a lot of times when they went back, Stalin had them killed because they saw too much or sent to the camps.

01:32:26,178 --> 01:32:29,438
SPEAKER_1:  So just to linger on this idea of free speech, so there's constant.

01:32:30,914 --> 01:32:35,134
SPEAKER_1:  discussion about free speech and this modern debate about social media and all that kind of stuff what

01:32:35,458 --> 01:32:36,638
SPEAKER_1:  What's your take on it?

01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:38,110
SPEAKER_1:  grounding it.

01:32:38,914 --> 01:32:40,318
SPEAKER_1:  not in some kind of

01:32:40,642 --> 01:32:43,998
SPEAKER_1:  shallow discussion of free speech we have today, but more in the context of

01:32:45,282 --> 01:32:45,758
SPEAKER_1:  Uh.

01:32:47,106 --> 01:32:47,742
SPEAKER_1:  Правда

01:32:48,226 --> 01:32:50,462
SPEAKER_1:  and the suppression of speech in...

01:32:51,074 --> 01:32:52,446
SPEAKER_1:  Stalinist Russia.

01:32:52,578 --> 01:32:54,718
SPEAKER_0:  I hate the term free speech.

01:32:55,042 --> 01:32:59,806
SPEAKER_0:  because it's used in many different contexts. Some I agree with entirely, some I disagree with at all.

01:33:00,482 --> 01:33:00,958
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:33:01,378 --> 01:33:02,814
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think everyone.

01:33:03,362 --> 01:33:05,918
SPEAKER_0:  has something to say or some conversation.

01:33:06,658 --> 01:33:08,062
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and.

01:33:08,546 --> 01:33:15,198
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I have my locals community, um, and it used to be, I think that the boilerplate language is, you know, come support.

01:33:15,650 --> 01:33:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  free speech and free discourse and I changed that because I don't like that term.

01:33:20,162 --> 01:33:21,822
SPEAKER_0:  because people will tell you.

01:33:22,370 --> 01:33:26,014
SPEAKER_0:  with some reason that, oh, if you block me on Twitter, you're...

01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:28,126
SPEAKER_0:  avoiding my free speech. Take me.

01:33:28,514 --> 01:33:30,366
SPEAKER_0:  So I don't like that term as a whole.

01:33:30,786 --> 01:33:35,742
SPEAKER_0:  But one of the points of the white pill, and something I see enormous parallels with today,

01:33:36,450 --> 01:33:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  If you have.

01:33:37,890 --> 01:33:38,494
SPEAKER_0:  One.

01:33:39,138 --> 01:33:39,998
SPEAKER_0:  News outlet.

01:33:40,674 --> 01:33:44,062
SPEAKER_0:  or three news outlets with identical ideology.

01:33:44,514 --> 01:33:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  you're not going to be able to get.

01:33:46,658 --> 01:33:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  to any kind of truth.

01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  or any kind of useful information. It's all gonna be pre-filtered for you. It's like a baby bird, and you're eating the mother bird's vomit, right?

01:33:57,122 --> 01:33:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  if you have what we have increasing now.

01:33:59,650 --> 01:34:00,510
SPEAKER_0:  with technology.

01:34:01,058 --> 01:34:03,966
SPEAKER_0:  if you have a world where everyone has a camera on their phone.

01:34:04,546 --> 01:34:07,646
SPEAKER_0:  if you have a world where anyone can put their ideas out there.

01:34:08,066 --> 01:34:09,022
SPEAKER_0:  Maybe they're banned.

01:34:09,282 --> 01:34:11,582
SPEAKER_0:  from certain outlets, but they're not literally.

01:34:11,874 --> 01:34:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  vanished like they were in the USSR.

01:34:14,274 --> 01:34:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  That is very healthy. That is something I'm enormously supportive of.

01:34:18,850 --> 01:34:19,518
SPEAKER_0:  because...

01:34:20,130 --> 01:34:21,118
SPEAKER_0:  Back in the day.

01:34:21,634 --> 01:34:23,806
SPEAKER_0:  if you only had the TV crews with cameras.

01:34:24,098 --> 01:34:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  You can only see what they're capturing and they could edit it.

01:34:27,810 --> 01:34:28,670
SPEAKER_0:  Whereas now...

01:34:29,410 --> 01:34:32,254
SPEAKER_0:  We saw this recently during COVID, right?

01:34:32,546 --> 01:34:36,446
SPEAKER_0:  You had these reporters with masks on and they're talking.

01:34:36,802 --> 01:34:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  but the cameraman.

01:34:38,274 --> 01:34:41,438
SPEAKER_0:  wasn't wearing a mask. So you have the people in the street being like, look.

01:34:41,698 --> 01:34:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  They don't believe it.

01:34:43,362 --> 01:34:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  Or as soon as they would start filming, the guy took the mask off and they'd film them. destructive places and they go-

01:34:48,130 --> 01:34:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  You are lying. You don't believe this. You're putting this on for some purpose. Whether you're leaving the thick of sea of mass or not, that person clearly does not. He's only putting on for show. So that's all crimes.

01:34:59,042 --> 01:35:04,094
SPEAKER_0:  It's people, you know, are anti-police. They say, okay, the cop said this.

01:35:04,482 --> 01:35:07,198
SPEAKER_0:  Did he draw the gun in the sky necessarily so and so forth?

01:35:07,458 --> 01:35:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  It is so much.

01:35:08,738 --> 01:35:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  better.

01:35:09,698 --> 01:35:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  when everyone.

01:35:10,946 --> 01:35:14,078
SPEAKER_0:  has access to as much of the information as possible.

01:35:14,370 --> 01:35:17,950
SPEAKER_0:  and can make that informed decision themselves. Now, there certainly is-

01:35:18,626 --> 01:35:19,390
SPEAKER_0:  space.

01:35:19,778 --> 01:35:24,350
SPEAKER_0:  for informed people to be like, no, no, no, no, this isn't what it looks like. If you look here, if you look there.

01:35:24,642 --> 01:35:26,334
SPEAKER_0:  It's cropped here so and so forth.

01:35:26,626 --> 01:35:28,318
SPEAKER_0:  but that's still much more useful.

01:35:28,738 --> 01:35:29,854
SPEAKER_0:  than just having.

01:35:30,818 --> 01:35:31,774
SPEAKER_0:  20 second clip.

01:35:32,162 --> 01:35:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  that someone has decided to edit for you.

01:35:35,010 --> 01:35:36,478
SPEAKER_1:  So like truth has a way of.

01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:41,773
SPEAKER_1:  because everything is so interconnected, truth, no matter what has a way of finding its way to the

01:35:41,773 --> 01:35:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  the populace. Also, there's an

01:35:44,194 --> 01:35:46,718
SPEAKER_0:  There's a big asymmetry in terms of trust.

01:35:47,266 --> 01:35:50,046
SPEAKER_0:  So if I tell you a hundred truths...

01:35:50,402 --> 01:35:51,358
SPEAKER_0:  and one lie.

01:35:52,066 --> 01:35:56,382
SPEAKER_0:  That lie is equal, I'm screwed. Because once you catch me in a, like a-

01:35:56,610 --> 01:35:59,582
SPEAKER_0:  You don't have to kill someone every day to be a murderer, right? You only have to do it once.

01:35:59,906 --> 01:36:02,750
SPEAKER_0:  So if you catch me in a brazen lie.

01:36:03,234 --> 01:36:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  You're going to look at everything I say after that with an enormous grain of salt.

01:36:06,786 --> 01:36:19,582
SPEAKER_0:  Um, so that is another big asymmetry in favor of truth. If someone trusts you, you have to be honest all the time and you're going to make mistakes, you can own those mistakes and be like, Hey, this is why I made the mistake. This is why I said such and such.

01:36:19,938 --> 01:36:21,758
SPEAKER_1:  But the flip side of that, which.

01:36:22,306 --> 01:36:23,614
SPEAKER_1:  has been disheartening to me.

01:36:24,002 --> 01:36:26,174
SPEAKER_1:  is that people on the conspiracy side

01:36:26,498 --> 01:36:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  conspiracy theory side of things.

01:36:29,538 --> 01:36:30,430
SPEAKER_1:  I've noticed how-

01:36:30,722 --> 01:36:32,766
SPEAKER_1:  Easy it is to just call something a lie.

01:36:33,186 --> 01:36:33,630
SPEAKER_1:  Yes.

01:36:34,274 --> 01:36:38,270
SPEAKER_1:  And then that becomes viral. For some reason there's a desire for people.

01:36:38,786 --> 01:36:43,486
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, for anyone who points out that the Emperor is not wearing a clothes, even when the Emperor is fully clothed.

01:36:45,026 --> 01:36:48,606
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know what that is, but that really seems to mess with this tooth mechanism.

01:36:49,026 --> 01:36:49,950
SPEAKER_1:  So when...

01:36:50,210 --> 01:36:54,206
SPEAKER_1:  when it becomes viral to call people a liar, whether they're a liar or not.

01:36:54,626 --> 01:36:57,662
SPEAKER_1:  It's like you feel like on unstable ground.

01:36:58,114 --> 01:36:58,558
SPEAKER_1:  Because it-

01:36:58,914 --> 01:37:01,374
SPEAKER_1:  To me, that idea of revealing

01:37:01,762 --> 01:37:05,566
SPEAKER_1:  a lie that somebody told is a really powerful mechanism to keep people honest.

01:37:05,954 --> 01:37:08,574
SPEAKER_1:  but when you're like misusing a crying wolf too much.

01:37:08,802 --> 01:37:10,206
SPEAKER_1:  But well, it seems.

01:37:10,594 --> 01:37:14,055
SPEAKER_1:  seems to break the system. It makes me nervous because there's also like a

01:37:14,055 --> 01:37:18,110
SPEAKER_0:  But just if someone is a liar that doesn't mean literally everything they say is a lie.

01:37:18,690 --> 01:37:19,815
SPEAKER_0:  No but what is a lion with-

01:37:19,815 --> 01:37:20,286
SPEAKER_1:  isn't.

01:37:20,546 --> 01:37:22,910
SPEAKER_1:  I just noticed that there's money to be made.

01:37:23,202 --> 01:37:25,342
SPEAKER_1:  in calling out something as a lie.

01:37:26,434 --> 01:37:28,126
SPEAKER_1:  It's just...

01:37:28,514 --> 01:37:29,790
SPEAKER_1:  The conspiracy theories.

01:37:30,082 --> 01:37:30,974
SPEAKER_1:  straight up.

01:37:31,714 --> 01:37:32,222
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

01:37:32,642 --> 01:37:40,190
SPEAKER_1:  the first thing, some traumatic event happened, give an explanation that's not the mainstream explanation. no matter what, whether it's true or lie.

01:37:40,514 --> 01:37:43,646
SPEAKER_1:  There's a lot of virality and money to be made in that.

01:37:44,002 --> 01:37:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  And that makes me nervous.

01:37:45,634 --> 01:37:47,710
SPEAKER_1:  because it doesn't matter if it's true or not.

01:37:48,162 --> 01:37:49,086
SPEAKER_1:  it becomes.

01:37:49,570 --> 01:37:53,758
SPEAKER_1:  anti-establishment ideas are viral whether they are true or not.

01:37:54,402 --> 01:37:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  Sure, but I think establishment ideas are powerful whether they're true or not.

01:37:58,850 --> 01:37:59,975
SPEAKER_0:  So I think I'm.

01:37:59,975 --> 01:38:06,014
SPEAKER_1:  the whole I think you're right and the whole it's good to test the power centers but it just makes me

01:38:07,010 --> 01:38:07,998
SPEAKER_1:  Nervous.

01:38:08,258 --> 01:38:09,886
SPEAKER_1:  in our attention economy.

01:38:10,402 --> 01:38:10,878
SPEAKER_1:  that

01:38:11,138 --> 01:38:14,302
SPEAKER_1:  the sexy thing seems to be the anti-establishment message.

01:38:15,202 --> 01:38:17,598
SPEAKER_1:  and then it feels like that becomes a drug.

01:38:18,146 --> 01:38:19,902
SPEAKER_1:  where you everything.

01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:20,510
SPEAKER_1:  I

01:38:21,122 --> 01:38:23,998
SPEAKER_1:  anything the establishment says, anything institutions say.

01:38:24,226 --> 01:38:27,390
SPEAKER_1:  Anything the mainstream says must be wrong, because it comes from the mainstream.

01:38:27,522 --> 01:38:31,646
SPEAKER_0:  I have that line that you're supposed to take one red pill, not the whole bottle.

01:38:32,642 --> 01:38:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  I am certainly one of those people who is of the idea that they are dishonest far more open that they're honest.

01:38:39,810 --> 01:38:40,286
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:38:40,994 --> 01:38:43,294
SPEAKER_0:  That said, there are people who are of the belief.

01:38:43,618 --> 01:38:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  Let's use an extreme example.

01:38:45,122 --> 01:38:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  that Trump is still the shadow president.

01:38:48,002 --> 01:38:54,846
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and, and, you know, there's going to be these QAnon mass arrests. I thought this was something that like the Daily Beast made up.

01:38:55,202 --> 01:38:56,350
SPEAKER_0:  to make fun of MAGA.

01:38:56,674 --> 01:39:07,262
SPEAKER_0:  But I was just on the phone with my buddy last night and he was like, no, no, if you go to truth central, they're like all over there. And if you disagree with them, they call you a controlled opposition or a grifter or so on and so forth. Is that unfortunate or where?

01:39:07,522 --> 01:39:11,518
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, Truth Central, Trump's social media outlet. Oh, Truth Central.

01:39:11,778 --> 01:39:19,143
SPEAKER_0:  No, truth. We have a, he, he, he forgot the name of it himself. So he's like, that's why I had to create jokes. You gotta explain the jokes. I gotta explain the jokes.

01:39:19,143 --> 01:39:21,950
SPEAKER_1:  Do you like the way Twitter puts that context?

01:39:22,306 --> 01:39:22,622
SPEAKER_1:  Better.

01:39:22,882 --> 01:39:24,638
SPEAKER_1:  You gotta do the joke and then pause.

01:39:24,866 --> 01:39:26,741
SPEAKER_1:  and I turned to the camera and.

01:39:26,741 --> 01:39:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  And have a laugh track.

01:39:28,226 --> 01:39:30,974
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, so people know what the jokes are. That's real humor.

01:39:31,778 --> 01:39:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  So we and then we just clap and then everybody clap

01:39:35,394 --> 01:39:35,966
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:39:36,322 --> 01:39:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  I think for the last two years.

01:39:38,434 --> 01:39:40,158
SPEAKER_0:  especially vis-a-vis COVID.

01:39:40,642 --> 01:39:42,654
SPEAKER_0:  The overwhelming message was...

01:39:43,042 --> 01:39:45,150
SPEAKER_0:  the experts know what they're talking about.

01:39:45,506 --> 01:39:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  And if you are questioning this, you're a vax denier, and you basically should be read out of Polite Society.

01:39:51,906 --> 01:39:55,678
SPEAKER_0:  And one obvious counter example to this was social distancing.

01:39:56,226 --> 01:39:58,462
SPEAKER_0:  If social distancing was efficacious.

01:39:58,722 --> 01:40:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  Why were there no attempts ever to bring it back?

01:40:01,634 --> 01:40:02,910
SPEAKER_0:  right, when you had different waves?

01:40:03,202 --> 01:40:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  And if it wasn't efficacious, why was it so insistent?

01:40:07,106 --> 01:40:13,118
SPEAKER_0:  that we do it, all do it, at the very beginning. In fact, in many places you'll still see the signs on the floor where it's six feet apart.

01:40:13,378 --> 01:40:17,822
SPEAKER_0:  So there's an incongruity there and I think we are forgetting.

01:40:18,146 --> 01:40:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  as a people.

01:40:19,394 --> 01:40:20,446
SPEAKER_0:  The intensity.

01:40:20,866 --> 01:40:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  with and understandably to some extent, if you have this worldwide deadly plague, like yeah, like it's going to be go where the leakiest hole is. So you really got to kind of get everyone on board.

01:40:30,370 --> 01:40:32,062
SPEAKER_0:  but to the vehemence.

01:40:32,354 --> 01:40:34,494
SPEAKER_0:  with which we're told we know what we're doing.

01:40:35,042 --> 01:40:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  This is the way to solve it. If you don't do it, you are causing mass death.

01:40:40,162 --> 01:40:42,078
SPEAKER_0:  that I think fed in very heavily.

01:40:42,434 --> 01:40:47,070
SPEAKER_0:  to people's enormous sense of skepticism toward establishment sources.

01:40:47,778 --> 01:40:52,958
SPEAKER_1:  Speaking of the plague, you opened the book with a quote from Camus. It's a strong, strong quote.

01:40:53,218 --> 01:40:59,390
SPEAKER_0:  KEMU brings me to tears and it's funny because I reread the myth of Sisyphus, which I've been recommending to people and like this book is not good.

01:40:59,618 --> 01:41:00,606
SPEAKER_0:  but he's got his.

01:41:00,834 --> 01:41:03,459
SPEAKER_0:  Ethos is my favorite of all the philosophers.

01:41:03,459 --> 01:41:05,950
SPEAKER_1:  It sounds like the myth of Sisyphus was a myth.

01:41:08,514 --> 01:41:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  He says, after I cute.

01:41:11,010 --> 01:41:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  All I maintain is that on this earth there are plagues and there are victims.

01:41:15,746 --> 01:41:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  And it's up to us so far as possible.

01:41:18,210 --> 01:41:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  not to join forces with the plagues.

01:41:20,834 --> 01:41:21,246
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:41:21,538 --> 01:41:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  Why I have that as the introductory quotes the book.

01:41:24,514 --> 01:41:25,086
SPEAKER_0:  is.

01:41:25,794 --> 01:41:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  I think morality and ethics are very, very complicated subjects.

01:41:30,178 --> 01:41:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  There's lots of gray areas where you don't know which way to choose.

01:41:34,018 --> 01:41:35,390
SPEAKER_0:  but at a bass level.

01:41:35,842 --> 01:41:38,494
SPEAKER_0:  He has another quote that's ascribed to him he never actually said.

01:41:38,882 --> 01:41:40,190
SPEAKER_0:  But something about...

01:41:40,546 --> 01:41:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  you know, is the duty of thinking people not to be on the side of the executioners.

01:41:44,802 --> 01:41:47,550
SPEAKER_0:  if you are, we should do whatever we can.

01:41:48,226 --> 01:41:49,918
SPEAKER_0:  not to have blood on our hands.

01:41:50,434 --> 01:41:51,326
SPEAKER_0:  not to be.

01:41:51,618 --> 01:41:53,342
SPEAKER_0:  murderers not to want.

01:41:53,666 --> 01:41:54,110
SPEAKER_0:  Death.

01:41:54,562 --> 01:41:55,038
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:41:55,554 --> 01:42:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  That in and of itself is a big pill for a lot of people to swallow. We're all brought up.

01:42:00,802 --> 01:42:01,150
SPEAKER_0:  taught.

01:42:01,602 --> 01:42:04,574
SPEAKER_0:  that war is a last resort.

01:42:05,026 --> 01:42:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  And yet when it comes to international affairs, it's always often a first priority and people are champing at the bit.

01:42:11,970 --> 01:42:15,518
SPEAKER_0:  start going in and killing people and what war means isn't

01:42:16,226 --> 01:42:18,430
SPEAKER_0:  good guy soldiers versus bad guy soldiers.

01:42:19,106 --> 01:42:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  My concern is always with the civilians.

01:42:21,442 --> 01:42:30,366
SPEAKER_0:  with the kids who become orphans, with the wives who become widows and things like that. And then communities which are ruined forever.

01:42:30,882 --> 01:42:33,118
SPEAKER_0:  I love that quote of his. I think he's.

01:42:33,378 --> 01:42:35,614
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, the book started, it was going to be...

01:42:36,002 --> 01:42:39,358
SPEAKER_0:  A recontextualization of Kamus thought I was going to rip off.

01:42:39,714 --> 01:42:48,126
SPEAKER_0:  my old buddy Ryan Holiday, what he did with the Stoics and do about Camus. And then when I started rereading Camus, I'm like, oh, there's, I've read more into him than is really there.

01:42:48,354 --> 01:42:49,822
SPEAKER_0:  and then it went the whole other direction.

01:42:50,210 --> 01:42:51,934
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, so you wanted to do...

01:42:52,322 --> 01:42:52,990
SPEAKER_1:  almost.

01:42:54,146 --> 01:43:00,351
SPEAKER_1:  like an existentialist manifesto. So like, one must imagine Sisyphus happy.

01:43:00,351 --> 01:43:05,278
SPEAKER_0:  Well, more like Camus for today and what his philosophy can teach us, like Ryan did with his

01:43:05,538 --> 01:43:07,102
SPEAKER_0:  Many books about the Stokes.

01:43:09,410 --> 01:43:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  and it was gonna be called The Point of Tears.

01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:15,395
SPEAKER_0:  Live to the point of tears? Yes, but the title is going to be the point of tears.

01:43:15,395 --> 01:43:16,895
SPEAKER_1:  I know but from that line.

01:43:16,895 --> 01:43:19,838
SPEAKER_0:  That's a good line, right? I hear so many good lines.

01:43:20,034 --> 01:43:20,350
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

01:43:20,962 --> 01:43:22,087
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe it's not about how- Just such an ingredients,...

01:43:22,087 --> 01:43:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  in bed though right?

01:43:23,170 --> 01:43:27,262
SPEAKER_0:  No, he was a big lethario. He was probably pretty good. He got around.

01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:33,246
SPEAKER_1:  What percent of the audience?

01:43:33,506 --> 01:43:36,254
SPEAKER_1:  of humans on earth you think not the word letharia.

01:43:37,410 --> 01:43:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  How up percent of them have a computer? Look it up.

01:43:40,194 --> 01:43:45,566
SPEAKER_0:  Lothario. It's not some weird term. Lothario. L-O-T-H-A-R-I-O, Lothario. Lothario.

01:43:45,890 --> 01:43:50,558
SPEAKER_1:  A man who behaves selfishly in a response to being in sexual relationships with women

01:43:50,786 --> 01:43:56,497
SPEAKER_1:  They're seduced by handsome, in quotes, they're seduced by handsome Motharia who gains control of their financial...

01:43:56,497 --> 01:44:00,286
SPEAKER_0:  affairs. Oh, I didn't think, I always thought of as more as just someone who's like a stud.

01:44:00,802 --> 01:44:01,927
SPEAKER_0:  Like a player, but not-

01:44:01,927 --> 01:44:04,177
SPEAKER_1:  fire yet is uh... um... eleven mull attempt

01:44:04,177 --> 01:44:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, I didn't realize that. Okay. Well then he's... Selfishly. Okay, that's not him.

01:44:07,682 --> 01:44:08,702
SPEAKER_1:  irresponsibly.

01:44:09,058 --> 01:44:10,174
SPEAKER_1:  And a man, too.

01:44:10,850 --> 01:44:11,454
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:44:12,354 --> 01:44:14,526
SPEAKER_1:  Although Ayn Rand would be proud, selfishly.

01:44:14,946 --> 01:44:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  What's wrong with selfishness? She wouldn't like that kind of selfishness.

01:44:17,890 --> 01:44:18,974
SPEAKER_0:  That's Explicit Haves.

01:44:19,458 --> 01:44:20,583
SPEAKER_0:  A man who behaves su-

01:44:20,583 --> 01:44:24,702
SPEAKER_1:  and irresponsibly in his sexual relationships with women.

01:44:27,074 --> 01:44:27,614
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, okay.

01:44:27,746 --> 01:44:29,182
SPEAKER_0:  So he was just a player.

01:44:29,570 --> 01:44:32,945
SPEAKER_0:  No, no, maybe a stud. I don't think he was promiscuous particularly.

01:44:32,945 --> 01:44:33,694
SPEAKER_1:  Nature didn't get...

01:44:34,242 --> 01:44:34,782
SPEAKER_1:  He got

01:44:35,010 --> 01:44:36,135
SPEAKER_1:  He didn't never got laid, right?

01:44:36,135 --> 01:44:41,095
SPEAKER_0:  He had syphilis, he died of syphilis. Oh, it was from prostitutes. Was it? Okay. Possibly, yeah.

01:44:41,095 --> 01:44:43,774
SPEAKER_1:  It's giving me like I knew the guy. I heard it's from.

01:44:44,514 --> 01:44:45,150
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:44:45,666 --> 01:44:48,190
SPEAKER_1:  He never had a deep, loving, fulfilling relationship.

01:44:48,482 --> 01:44:50,238
SPEAKER_1:  had a very skewed understanding on

01:44:50,498 --> 01:44:50,878
SPEAKER_1:

01:44:51,170 --> 01:44:55,038
SPEAKER_1:  the way he wrote about women. Although somebody wrote to me and said that's-

01:44:55,650 --> 01:44:58,901
SPEAKER_1:  mischaracterization that he was actually very respectful with

01:44:58,901 --> 01:45:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  But hear that line if you're going before women bring a whip?

01:45:01,410 --> 01:45:03,285
SPEAKER_0:  Wasn't that him or was that Shrobenhauer? If I were to quote-

01:45:03,285 --> 01:45:04,894
SPEAKER_1:  you from your Twitter.

01:45:05,538 --> 01:45:06,494
SPEAKER_1:  I think I could.

01:45:06,722 --> 01:45:11,390
SPEAKER_1:  make a very convincing argument that you're sexist, racist, and probably a Nazi.

01:45:12,162 --> 01:45:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  Well I do own like-

01:45:14,370 --> 01:45:15,934
SPEAKER_0:  some of Hitler's stuff. Exactly.

01:45:16,290 --> 01:45:18,174
SPEAKER_0:  I- I got the- I rest.

01:45:18,914 --> 01:45:19,742
SPEAKER_0:  My case.

01:45:20,066 --> 01:45:28,030
SPEAKER_0:  I feel like I'm in Nuremberg. I'm going to be hung by his own tie. This isn't a tie, it's a noose.

01:45:28,930 --> 01:45:30,558
SPEAKER_0:  You should have thought about that.

01:45:31,170 --> 01:45:32,990
SPEAKER_1:  We were saying all those things.

01:45:33,602 --> 01:45:34,206
SPEAKER_1:  Okay.

01:45:34,626 --> 01:45:35,751
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think of the leak of the-

01:45:35,751 --> 01:45:36,606
SPEAKER_0:  Twitter files.

01:45:37,506 --> 01:45:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  I

01:45:38,818 --> 01:45:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  was

01:45:40,290 --> 01:45:41,150
SPEAKER_0:  So...

01:45:42,242 --> 01:45:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  Happy.

01:45:43,810 --> 01:45:45,726
SPEAKER_0:  that Elon gave.

01:45:46,082 --> 01:45:49,470
SPEAKER_0:  the information to Matt Taibbi and Barry Weiss.

01:45:49,954 --> 01:45:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  who are both by any metric lefties.

01:45:52,834 --> 01:45:53,406
SPEAKER_0:  who are both.

01:45:53,794 --> 01:45:56,286
SPEAKER_0:  professional journalists of longstanding

01:45:56,546 --> 01:45:58,110
SPEAKER_0:  with great resumes.

01:45:58,690 --> 01:46:02,974
SPEAKER_0:  And overnight now they're doing PR for the world's, which all the way of the party line was.

01:46:04,866 --> 01:46:08,862
SPEAKER_0:  And the fact that you had all these corporate journalists now having to play catch up.

01:46:09,314 --> 01:46:12,510
SPEAKER_0:  and not having control of the microphone to me.

01:46:12,866 --> 01:46:13,950
SPEAKER_0:  was just absolutely.

01:46:14,274 --> 01:46:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  Amazing

01:46:15,458 --> 01:46:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  I think transparency is...

01:46:19,266 --> 01:46:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  what brought down in many aspects of Soviet Union.

01:46:22,370 --> 01:46:26,302
SPEAKER_0:  at what will bring down what negative aspects of the regime we have here.

01:46:27,042 --> 01:46:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  when you see.

01:46:28,642 --> 01:46:30,750
SPEAKER_0:  the machinations behind the scenes.

01:46:31,074 --> 01:46:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  and then when you see the rationalizations after the fact

01:46:34,658 --> 01:46:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  you realize, oh, these people are not acting in good faith.

01:46:37,666 --> 01:46:38,494
SPEAKER_0:  The fact that...

01:46:38,946 --> 01:46:41,982
SPEAKER_0:  For example, the New York Post article about the

01:46:42,306 --> 01:46:42,750
SPEAKER_0:  Hunter.

01:46:43,010 --> 01:46:43,838
SPEAKER_0:  Biden laptop.

01:46:44,194 --> 01:46:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  And how the New York Times covered it as well. They didn't mention any kind of dick pics.

01:46:48,354 --> 01:46:49,150
SPEAKER_0:  Twitter made it.

01:46:49,410 --> 01:46:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  So I couldn't even DM you.

01:46:52,162 --> 01:46:56,478
SPEAKER_0:  the link to the New York Post article, which was a tool they had previously used only.

01:46:56,898 --> 01:46:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  to prevent.

01:46:58,114 --> 01:46:59,294
SPEAKER_0:  child pornography.

01:46:59,874 --> 01:47:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  So that shows to what extent they were.

01:47:03,618 --> 01:47:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  willing to put their thumb on the scale.

01:47:06,722 --> 01:47:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  but it also shows that

01:47:10,242 --> 01:47:13,406
SPEAKER_0:  for any layman when they're looking at this to realize.

01:47:13,794 --> 01:47:17,694
SPEAKER_0:  what you are perceiving as news or information.

01:47:18,274 --> 01:47:22,270
SPEAKER_0:  is very much sculpted, edited, and guided.

01:47:22,658 --> 01:47:27,006
SPEAKER_0:  by powerful people who have a vested interest in maintaining their.

01:47:27,490 --> 01:47:28,414
SPEAKER_1:  uh... power

01:47:28,930 --> 01:47:32,305
SPEAKER_1:  I think to me the important lesson is this is not a left the right thing.

01:47:32,305 --> 01:47:34,555
SPEAKER_0:  No, not at all. Power versus powerless.

01:47:34,555 --> 01:47:36,862
SPEAKER_1:  but and also the important lesson there.

01:47:37,186 --> 01:47:38,782
SPEAKER_1:  I think at least in the case of Twitter.

01:47:39,266 --> 01:47:41,534
SPEAKER_1:  in our society. It's a-

01:47:41,762 --> 01:47:44,126
SPEAKER_1:  It's a slippery slope, you don't get there overnight.

01:47:44,898 --> 01:47:47,358
SPEAKER_1:  You start using those tools a little bit.

01:47:47,650 --> 01:47:48,542
SPEAKER_1:  A little bit.

01:47:48,930 --> 01:47:52,286
SPEAKER_1:  to slow down this information to just a little bit you start

01:47:52,770 --> 01:47:57,310
SPEAKER_1:  uh, sending emails to each other a little bit and it becomes more and more.

01:47:57,890 --> 01:47:58,590
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

01:47:59,298 --> 01:48:04,798
SPEAKER_1:  You, you, you start forming justifications. You still getting a little more and more comfortable kind of talking about the stuff!

01:48:05,186 --> 01:48:05,566
SPEAKER_1:

01:48:06,210 --> 01:48:06,878
SPEAKER_1:  I think.

01:48:07,618 --> 01:48:10,686
SPEAKER_1:  There are several ways to fight that one is having hardcore integrity upfront.

01:48:10,978 --> 01:48:12,510
SPEAKER_1:  So don't even open the door.

01:48:13,122 --> 01:48:18,334
SPEAKER_1:  But I think realistically human nature is what it is. So I think the only way is through transparency.

01:48:18,754 --> 01:48:23,262
SPEAKER_1:  is this is why the nice, I hate the fact they got politicized.

01:48:23,490 --> 01:48:27,614
SPEAKER_1:  I really hate that the right has run with it. Like, look, the left is...

01:48:27,938 --> 01:48:33,694
SPEAKER_1:  planning the rig elections and so on. To me, it shouldn't be left or right, it shouldn't be about politics.

01:48:33,954 --> 01:48:35,294
SPEAKER_1:  that transparency is good.

01:48:35,522 --> 01:48:36,830
SPEAKER_1:  Other companies should do the same.

01:48:37,122 --> 01:48:38,878
SPEAKER_1:  Facebook should do the same. In effect—

01:48:39,394 --> 01:48:41,214
SPEAKER_1:  That transparency will protect Facebook.

01:48:41,826 --> 01:48:42,654
SPEAKER_1:  who protect.

01:48:42,882 --> 01:48:43,294
SPEAKER_1:  Google.

01:48:43,490 --> 01:48:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  I look.

01:48:44,738 --> 01:48:45,863
SPEAKER_0:  Like this is our situa-

01:48:45,863 --> 01:48:47,363
SPEAKER_1:  tell us what to do.

01:48:47,363 --> 01:48:50,334
SPEAKER_0:  and we'll do our best. I remember when I was writing the new right.

01:48:50,946 --> 01:48:52,446
SPEAKER_0:  Twitter's line was...

01:48:52,930 --> 01:48:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  We're not going to tell you guys what the metrics are by which we ban or censor people.

01:48:58,658 --> 01:49:01,694
SPEAKER_0:  because then bad actors are going to navigate around them.

01:49:02,146 --> 01:49:02,814
SPEAKER_0:  And it's like.

01:49:03,298 --> 01:49:04,894
SPEAKER_0:  What are you doing?

01:49:05,122 --> 01:49:07,262
SPEAKER_0:  tell people in any establishment.

01:49:07,618 --> 01:49:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  what are the rules for which behavior is permissible.

01:49:10,882 --> 01:49:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  If I go to a store...

01:49:12,610 --> 01:49:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  If I return the sweater, is it cash back?

01:49:14,786 --> 01:49:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  No refunds or if I get store credit, you know what I mean? So that they were having this place which was-

01:49:20,322 --> 01:49:21,918
SPEAKER_0:  presented as a

01:49:22,818 --> 01:49:25,214
SPEAKER_0:  huge international space republic discourse

01:49:25,474 --> 01:49:32,670
SPEAKER_0:  and they're not telling you ahead of time, this is what we will tolerate, this is what we will warn you about, this is what will kick you out overnight, that to me was-

01:49:32,962 --> 01:49:34,334
SPEAKER_0:  crazy and outrageous.

01:49:34,690 --> 01:49:36,766
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and I'm really pleased.

01:49:37,218 --> 01:49:40,446
SPEAKER_0:  With to what extent Elon is looking.

01:49:40,706 --> 01:49:45,790
SPEAKER_0:  is being open with their policies. And what I really want to commend him about...

01:49:46,466 --> 01:49:47,102
SPEAKER_0:  is...

01:49:47,394 --> 01:49:47,710
SPEAKER_0:

01:49:47,938 --> 01:49:48,830
SPEAKER_0:  Now I'm triggered.

01:49:49,378 --> 01:49:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  because one of the things that he.

01:49:52,578 --> 01:49:59,198
SPEAKER_0:  took over, he's like, our first priority is getting with a child pornography and child exploitation. Yeah. Right.

01:49:59,650 --> 01:50:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  racial slurs, homophobic slurs, anti-semitic slurs, yeah, yeah.

01:50:02,882 --> 01:50:03,582
SPEAKER_0:  That's cool.

01:50:04,130 --> 01:50:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  Kids getting harmed is number one.

01:50:06,786 --> 01:50:10,366
SPEAKER_0:  And, you know, he fired the old task force because they weren't doing their job.

01:50:10,658 --> 01:50:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, Eliza blue, who you know, you know, she had been on this for a long time, but people who were victims of child pornography, child exploitation were emailing Twitter being like, these are my images, get them off. They're like too bad, porn is allowed on Twitter.

01:50:23,522 --> 01:50:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  he starts trying to crack down on it, this is a very hard problem.

01:50:26,690 --> 01:50:27,678
SPEAKER_0:  because these

01:50:27,906 --> 01:50:31,390
SPEAKER_0:  bad actors have mechanisms to evade

01:50:31,618 --> 01:50:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  you know being bad they they want to get there

01:50:33,954 --> 01:50:35,838
SPEAKER_0:  for lack of a better term product out there.

01:50:36,066 --> 01:50:37,214
SPEAKER_0:  Forbes Magazine.

01:50:38,978 --> 01:50:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  who is an agent of the devil.

01:50:40,898 --> 01:50:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  had a tweet and they tweeted this nine times.

01:50:43,682 --> 01:50:45,246
SPEAKER_0:  You know, now that Elon's here...

01:50:45,666 --> 01:50:48,894
SPEAKER_0:  Twitter's child porn nightmare has gotten much worse.

01:50:49,250 --> 01:50:50,366
SPEAKER_0:  They tweet this nine times.

01:50:50,754 --> 01:50:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  I looked up, anyone listening to this can look up, look at Forbes and do a search.

01:50:54,882 --> 01:50:56,542
SPEAKER_0:  They never mentioned this problem before.

01:50:57,058 --> 01:51:08,798
SPEAKER_0:  So now that Elon is doing something about it, now it's a problem for you. No, it's a problem. Elon's the problem. It's not the child porn that you guys had a problem with. And that to me is like, yeah, I understand that you think that...

01:51:09,058 --> 01:51:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  Elon is a bad guy because he's upset your apple cart.

01:51:12,514 --> 01:51:13,918
SPEAKER_0:  This isn't a political issue.

01:51:14,370 --> 01:51:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  This isn't a gotcha moment. This is a right.

01:51:17,634 --> 01:51:18,814
SPEAKER_0:  Here are some tips.

01:51:19,266 --> 01:51:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  We talked to 10 experts, digital experts.

01:51:22,626 --> 01:51:25,374
SPEAKER_0:  And here are some techniques, Mr. Musk.

01:51:25,666 --> 01:51:26,590
SPEAKER_0:  that you might want to.

01:51:27,042 --> 01:51:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  Take from us free of charge.

01:51:28,642 --> 01:51:30,718
SPEAKER_0:  that will help you solve this. That would be a great article.

01:51:31,682 --> 01:51:35,646
SPEAKER_1:  And I just want to use this opportunity to say quite clearly and strongly.

01:51:35,970 --> 01:51:41,502
SPEAKER_1:  that even though Twitter and other parts of the internet are interpreting some of my statements to mean I'm right.

01:51:42,242 --> 01:51:42,942
SPEAKER_1:  In this case.

01:51:43,298 --> 01:51:45,022
SPEAKER_1:  meaning leaning right, right wing.

01:51:45,474 --> 01:51:53,086
SPEAKER_1:  And in other cases, leaning left, left-wing, I'm not, I'm apolitical, or at least I try to be in my thinking. Take one issue at a time.

01:51:53,314 --> 01:51:57,854
SPEAKER_1:  I do take an opinion on each issue at a time, but I hate camps. I try to avoid.

01:51:58,274 --> 01:51:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  political accounts in general.

01:52:00,034 --> 01:52:01,534
SPEAKER_1:  It just, it sucks that.

01:52:03,778 --> 01:52:06,974
SPEAKER_1:  promoting transparency in this case or celebrating transparency.

01:52:07,522 --> 01:52:07,998
SPEAKER_1:  Um,

01:52:08,482 --> 01:52:09,406
SPEAKER_1:  is somehow.

01:52:10,914 --> 01:52:12,789
SPEAKER_1:  connected to being right wing.

01:52:12,789 --> 01:52:14,718
SPEAKER_0:  being made into.

01:52:15,074 --> 01:52:16,926
SPEAKER_0:  of supposed euphemism.

01:52:17,346 --> 01:52:18,238
SPEAKER_0:  for being right wing.

01:52:19,842 --> 01:52:26,046
SPEAKER_1:  It just, it sucks. It sucks even though I'm wearing a red suit and this is very red themed.

01:52:26,338 --> 01:52:27,463
SPEAKER_1:  conversation..

01:52:27,463 --> 01:52:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, the revolution was the color of blood.

01:52:36,770 --> 01:52:37,982
SPEAKER_1:  Let's sit on that for a second.

01:52:38,466 --> 01:52:41,086
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, you mentioned New York Times bestseller list.

01:52:41,506 --> 01:52:43,582
SPEAKER_1:  You chose to self-publish. Yes, we just.

01:52:44,194 --> 01:52:45,374
SPEAKER_1:  linger on that decision.

01:52:45,858 --> 01:52:48,062
SPEAKER_1:  What are the pros and cons of self-publishing?

01:52:48,226 --> 01:52:49,662
SPEAKER_0:  The cons are...

01:52:50,114 --> 01:52:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  It is acceptable.

01:52:52,226 --> 01:52:53,182
SPEAKER_0:  in our current.

01:52:53,730 --> 01:52:55,966
SPEAKER_0:  business climate or cultural climate.

01:52:56,290 --> 01:52:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  for.

01:52:56,994 --> 01:53:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  corporate media outlets to pretend the book doesn't exist.

01:53:00,898 --> 01:53:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  So basically, and there's reason for it. Oh, I can

01:53:04,322 --> 01:53:05,822
SPEAKER_0:  make the case them pretty easily.

01:53:06,338 --> 01:53:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  If someone's doing it themselves...

01:53:08,610 --> 01:53:10,078
SPEAKER_0:  Who is this guy? Some crackpot.

01:53:10,402 --> 01:53:17,987
SPEAKER_0:  writing crazy stuff from his basement, right? It's a little different, I think, for me, because I'm an established author. C-SPAN gave me an hour on BookTV.

01:53:17,987 --> 01:53:18,737
SPEAKER_1:  little crack bar be.

01:53:18,737 --> 01:53:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, established. For Dear Reader, I think I was the first one to get an hour on BookTV for a book that I did myself.

01:53:24,002 --> 01:53:25,182
SPEAKER_0:  So there is.

01:53:25,474 --> 01:53:26,110
SPEAKER_0:  Thanks for that.

01:53:26,562 --> 01:53:28,766
SPEAKER_0:  Um, it didn't go through a

01:53:29,026 --> 01:53:31,134
SPEAKER_0:  vetting process the way a book.

01:53:31,426 --> 01:53:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  going through a corporate publisher did. So those are the minuses.

01:53:35,714 --> 01:53:36,030
SPEAKER_0:  up.

01:53:36,386 --> 01:53:37,342
SPEAKER_0:  Pros are...

01:53:38,210 --> 01:53:38,654
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

01:53:39,074 --> 01:53:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  I can drop it and publish it immediately.

01:53:42,018 --> 01:53:43,422
SPEAKER_0:  If you go through a bit of-

01:53:43,874 --> 01:53:45,214
SPEAKER_0:  Corporate publisher, you have to wait a year.

01:53:46,114 --> 01:53:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:53:47,138 --> 01:53:51,070
SPEAKER_0:  you can do what you could have the book you want instead of getting past the editor.

01:53:51,458 --> 01:53:55,134
SPEAKER_0:  And some editors are very, very good and there's a whole spectrum. Some of them not so good.

01:53:55,394 --> 01:53:56,542
SPEAKER_0:  So we're good? Let's post on social media!

01:53:57,218 --> 01:53:59,399
SPEAKER_0:  I know the best and the real killers.

01:53:59,399 --> 01:54:02,399
SPEAKER_1:  All right, let's beat the good people on both sides.

01:54:02,399 --> 01:54:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  I don't mean the white nationalists who I condemn totally.

01:54:07,010 --> 01:54:07,550
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

01:54:08,354 --> 01:54:12,414
SPEAKER_0:  So, but the thing is in terms of money, you get six times as much.

01:54:13,314 --> 01:54:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  profit when you self-publish than when you go through corporate publisher.

01:54:16,962 --> 01:54:18,366
SPEAKER_0:  The buck stops here.

01:54:18,658 --> 01:54:21,950
SPEAKER_0:  It's, you know, in one of my books that I co-authored, I won't even mention the name.

01:54:22,274 --> 01:54:23,198
SPEAKER_0:  There is a typo.

01:54:23,746 --> 01:54:25,694
SPEAKER_0:  and they didn't, they don't care. They didn't fix it.

01:54:25,922 --> 01:54:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  for the paperback edition.

01:54:27,490 --> 01:54:33,822
SPEAKER_0:  Here, since I'm going through Amazon, if there's a typo, I can fix it live and it updates. Oh yeah? Yep. You can just update it. F muddles out

01:54:34,274 --> 01:54:35,399
SPEAKER_0:  So that's very useful.

01:54:35,399 --> 01:54:36,958
SPEAKER_1:  You get like a fight club thing where...

01:54:37,250 --> 01:54:39,875
SPEAKER_1:  You can insert like a deck pick in one of the pages.

01:54:39,875 --> 01:54:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, why are you so f-

01:54:41,858 --> 01:54:51,422
SPEAKER_0:  Why do you keep texting me to send you dick pics? Talk about North Pole. Just suggesting, all right, all right. All right, I get it. I'm not the editor. I get it, North Pole, I get it. Yeah.

01:54:52,162 --> 01:54:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  The other advantage...

01:54:54,146 --> 01:54:57,182
SPEAKER_0:  just socially is I think people are

01:54:57,410 --> 01:54:59,742
SPEAKER_0:  Like I found this with the Kickstarter I did for Deereader.

01:55:00,002 --> 01:55:01,854
SPEAKER_0:  people are much more excited to

01:55:02,242 --> 01:55:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  Buy it.

01:55:02,978 --> 01:55:06,302
SPEAKER_0:  and promote it and talk about it when they know you're doing it yourself.

01:55:06,658 --> 01:55:09,118
SPEAKER_0:  instead of you're getting a big check from.

01:55:09,890 --> 01:55:11,902
SPEAKER_0:  you know, St. Martin's, HarperCollins, Penguin, whatever.

01:55:12,258 --> 01:55:17,133
SPEAKER_1:  Are you also trying to use some kind of service to get it distributed to bookstores or you just want to do it?

01:55:17,133 --> 01:55:18,622
SPEAKER_0:  Amazon. No, just Amazon.

01:55:19,010 --> 01:55:21,319
SPEAKER_1:  And that's probably where most sales happen.

01:55:21,319 --> 01:55:23,806
SPEAKER_0:  The vast majority, yeah. So it's not going to be in bookstores.

01:55:24,322 --> 01:55:27,390
SPEAKER_1:  So how difficult is the process of getting it on Amazon?

01:55:27,618 --> 01:55:35,998
SPEAKER_0:  So I'll tell you a funny story about how Amazon works and cause this was a, I always plan for because everyone.

01:55:36,482 --> 01:55:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  A-

01:55:37,794 --> 01:55:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  People's.

01:55:38,466 --> 01:55:44,574
SPEAKER_0:  Here's another piece of advice I will give people. Your life will be a lot easier if you realize that the majority of people in every industry are bad at their jobs.

01:55:44,866 --> 01:55:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  Like once you have that realization, everything else makes sense and your life will be a lot easier, right?

01:55:49,730 --> 01:55:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  So when I did the Anarchist Handbook, which was a collection of essays from various anarchist throughout history,

01:55:56,098 --> 01:55:58,206
SPEAKER_0:  when I submitted it to Amazon.

01:55:58,594 --> 01:55:59,966
SPEAKER_0:  There was a lot of copyright issues.

01:56:00,514 --> 01:56:04,606
SPEAKER_0:  Cause they're like, do you have the rights to this essay? Do you have the rights to this essay? Let's go back and forth with them a lot.

01:56:05,090 --> 01:56:08,638
SPEAKER_0:  to make sure I had copyright where everything was public domain.

01:56:09,090 --> 01:56:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  And the thing is you forward it, you update it, you get the information.

01:56:13,154 --> 01:56:15,262
SPEAKER_0:  Three days, there's another problem, it's not three days.

01:56:15,554 --> 01:56:16,190
SPEAKER_0:  So it's weeks.

01:56:16,450 --> 01:56:18,878
SPEAKER_0:  The other thing with their CreateSpace program is...

01:56:19,298 --> 01:56:19,870
SPEAKER_0:  The.

01:56:20,322 --> 01:56:20,990
SPEAKER_0:  Paperback?

01:56:21,506 --> 01:56:23,454
SPEAKER_0:  and the ebook, the Kindle.

01:56:23,970 --> 01:56:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  art.

01:56:24,738 --> 01:56:26,206
SPEAKER_0:  approved independently.

01:56:27,042 --> 01:56:29,150
SPEAKER_0:  So just because it's approved for one side, it's not approved for the other.

01:56:29,634 --> 01:56:30,238
SPEAKER_0:  After I-

01:56:30,754 --> 01:56:33,406
SPEAKER_0:  published Amicus Handbook and it was a big success.

01:56:34,178 --> 01:56:39,102
SPEAKER_0:  They unleashed, unrolled, excuse me, a hardcover edition program.

01:56:39,490 --> 01:56:41,406
SPEAKER_0:  So I'm like, oh, great, I'll put in hardcover.

01:56:41,890 --> 01:56:50,430
SPEAKER_0:  They're like, sorry, this is too similar to Murray Rothbard's An Amidst State, which is a pamphlet or short book that Murray Rothbard wrote. I go, wait, wait.

01:56:50,914 --> 01:56:52,734
SPEAKER_0:  I have the entirety of anatomy state.

01:56:53,122 --> 01:56:53,790
SPEAKER_0:  In here.

01:56:54,114 --> 01:56:58,494
SPEAKER_0:  I have permission from the Mises Institute in writing, which I'm giving to you to reprint it, initiallyuttering, but they're going to start writing it in the future.

01:56:58,818 --> 01:57:00,126
SPEAKER_0:  and you guys already.

01:57:00,354 --> 01:57:05,630
SPEAKER_0:  haven't been published for a year as a paperback and ebook. Yep. And they're like too bad, blocked.

01:57:05,890 --> 01:57:09,598
SPEAKER_0:  So it's not available as a hardcover on Amazon.

01:57:09,858 --> 01:57:13,374
SPEAKER_0:  even though it's available, maybe now it's going to be pulled as paper, like an ebook.

01:57:13,666 --> 01:57:14,686
SPEAKER_0:  So with this book.

01:57:15,010 --> 01:57:17,758
SPEAKER_0:  I was anticipating, alright, this is gonna be some whatever.

01:57:18,242 --> 01:57:18,558
SPEAKER_0:  Bye.

01:57:18,786 --> 01:57:19,422
SPEAKER_0:  The thing with...

01:57:19,682 --> 01:57:22,238
SPEAKER_0:  How it works is you have to upload it and hit publish.

01:57:22,466 --> 01:57:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  and then you gotta wait for the approval.

01:57:24,674 --> 01:57:27,870
SPEAKER_0:  I'm like, okay, this is gonna be who knows. I just want to get as fast as possible.

01:57:28,482 --> 01:57:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  4 a.m.

01:57:29,922 --> 01:57:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  For less than 24 hours, I get a notification, Congratulations, your book's available for sale, and I have to run downstairs and pull it.

01:57:36,642 --> 01:57:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah. From publication because otherwise it was out and I didn't finish editing it. Yeah. So that's the situation there.

01:57:44,354 --> 01:57:49,979
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, that's fascinating. But that's like powerful. That's like your, it's all in your hands. It's all on you.

01:57:49,979 --> 01:57:52,734
SPEAKER_0:  And I think the program is great.

01:57:53,218 --> 01:57:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  It charts just like any other book.

01:57:55,842 --> 01:58:01,342
SPEAKER_0:  The quality of the books is great. I am very happy with.

01:58:01,794 --> 01:58:07,422
SPEAKER_0:  I have no contact with them. My buddy Tucker Maxx, he had a company that did this and they-

01:58:07,682 --> 01:58:11,807
SPEAKER_0:  basically help people self-polish their own book. They did Dave Goggins book. I think you've talked to him, haven't you? Yeah.

01:58:11,807 --> 01:58:13,307
SPEAKER_1:  Or maybe they emailed me or something.

01:58:13,307 --> 01:58:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, yeah. And.

01:58:15,234 --> 01:58:21,086
SPEAKER_0:  He said, I have done dozens, maybe hundreds of books with them. I have never been able to get someone on the phone.

01:58:21,442 --> 01:58:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  So I don't know what's going on over there, but.

01:58:23,938 --> 01:58:27,262
SPEAKER_0:  Guys, if you want to reach out to me, please call me.

01:58:27,522 --> 01:58:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  It's Michael at LexFreedman.com.

01:58:31,938 --> 01:58:36,063
SPEAKER_0:  Friedman is spelled wrong. Yeah, if you ever have a-

01:58:36,063 --> 01:58:37,534
SPEAKER_1:  Any complaints.

01:58:39,138 --> 01:58:40,830
SPEAKER_1:  please just at me at Twitter.

01:58:41,538 --> 01:58:43,070
SPEAKER_1:  About Michael now

01:58:44,706 --> 01:58:45,406
SPEAKER_1:  Uhhh...

01:58:45,666 --> 01:58:48,222
SPEAKER_1:  Why do you think so few established authors?

01:58:49,538 --> 01:58:50,238
SPEAKER_1:  self-publish.

01:58:51,138 --> 01:58:51,710
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, what?

01:58:52,130 --> 01:58:58,110
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like it makes perfect sense in this modern society to be able to, when you finish the book.

01:58:58,402 --> 01:58:59,486
SPEAKER_1:  to publish it within.

01:58:59,714 --> 01:59:04,062
SPEAKER_0:  A few days, a few weeks. I think I talked to Jordan Peterson about this at length.

01:59:04,322 --> 01:59:06,398
SPEAKER_0:  and Michaela, his daughter, who I'm also good friends with.

01:59:06,786 --> 01:59:10,270
SPEAKER_0:  She's actually named after Gorbachev, who's the big hero of this book. Also a friend.

01:59:10,946 --> 01:59:12,446
SPEAKER_0:  Mikhail Gor- you know I was-

01:59:12,706 --> 01:59:13,566
SPEAKER_0:  In talks.

01:59:14,114 --> 01:59:15,518
SPEAKER_0:  to interview Gorbachev.

01:59:16,194 --> 01:59:21,438
SPEAKER_0:  And then COVID hit. And that's one of the big regrets of my life. I think if I met him, I would be.

01:59:22,498 --> 01:59:25,342
SPEAKER_0:  on my knees, literally kissing his feet, crying.

01:59:25,826 --> 01:59:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, cause of, you know, I mean, one of the big points of the white pill.

01:59:29,762 --> 01:59:31,678
SPEAKER_0:  is there were so many moments.

01:59:32,386 --> 01:59:33,918
SPEAKER_0:  when they were calling him up.

01:59:34,370 --> 01:59:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  Send in the tanks, we want another Tiananmen Square.

01:59:37,762 --> 01:59:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  And he's like, fuck you.

01:59:39,810 --> 01:59:40,350
SPEAKER_0:  So.

01:59:40,834 --> 01:59:43,358
SPEAKER_0:  when you have anyone who has the capacity.

01:59:43,682 --> 01:59:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  to murder.

01:59:45,314 --> 01:59:46,398
SPEAKER_0:  thousands of people.

01:59:46,626 --> 01:59:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  and

01:59:47,682 --> 01:59:51,057
SPEAKER_0:  chooses to withhold that power. Like all I could do is applaud.

01:59:51,057 --> 01:59:52,557
SPEAKER_1:  this that the cynicism.

01:59:52,557 --> 01:59:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  Yes. Wait, so why the authors, why don't they publish the books? I think they're still in the...

01:59:59,202 --> 02:00:04,222
SPEAKER_0:  You know how like there's this whole idea about if you're a movie actor, you don't go on TV because that kind of ruins your brand?

02:00:04,802 --> 02:00:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  So, and that's kind of going away. There's a lot of shows where the lead is now like a former movie actor. And this is kind of like a big thing, like Matthew McConaughey, you know, he had a TV show on HBO, I believe.

02:00:15,106 --> 02:00:17,886
SPEAKER_0:  So I think there's this kind of like, wait a minute. What's that?

02:00:18,690 --> 02:00:19,838
SPEAKER_0:  And he said, I said, all right.

02:00:21,474 --> 02:00:21,982
SPEAKER_1:  I

02:00:22,338 --> 02:00:23,294
SPEAKER_1:  Is it alright?

02:00:23,810 --> 02:00:25,438
SPEAKER_1:  Alright alright alright.

02:00:26,338 --> 02:00:28,702
SPEAKER_1:  Matthew McConaughey, alright, alright. I don't- I don't-

02:00:28,898 --> 02:00:30,814
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know what that is. Sorry.

02:00:31,394 --> 02:00:31,806
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:00:32,642 --> 02:00:35,646
SPEAKER_1:  I'll explain it. Look at the context below. Okay.

02:00:35,874 --> 02:00:38,942
SPEAKER_0:  So I think for them it might be A.

02:00:39,362 --> 02:00:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  a loss of credibility to some extent.

02:00:41,762 --> 02:00:42,558
SPEAKER_0:  but B.

02:00:42,882 --> 02:00:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  They, their agent.

02:00:44,834 --> 02:00:47,326
SPEAKER_0:  whose job is to sell them and get a big advance.

02:00:48,002 --> 02:00:52,894
SPEAKER_0:  wouldn't be encouraged to self-publish because they're age, you know, so I don't think it's percolated to powerful people yet.

02:00:53,282 --> 02:00:54,686
SPEAKER_0:  how feasible this is.

02:00:55,234 --> 02:00:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  and how profitable it is.

02:00:57,698 --> 02:01:01,918
SPEAKER_0:  And how they'll still be able to reach their audience.

02:01:02,210 --> 02:01:02,750
SPEAKER_0:  feel.

02:01:03,938 --> 02:01:04,670
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I don't.

02:01:04,930 --> 02:01:07,614
SPEAKER_0:  If Anarchist Handbook wasn't such a gigantic success...

02:01:08,098 --> 02:01:11,422
SPEAKER_0:  Um, I would be more, more nervous about the white pill.

02:01:11,842 --> 02:01:18,750
SPEAKER_0:  But the fact that it was, and that I saw it from start to finish and I know the ins and outs now I'm like, what are you guys bringing to the table? Besides taking years of my time.

02:01:19,042 --> 02:01:21,667
SPEAKER_0:  and introducing edits that I would not otherwise agree with.

02:01:21,667 --> 02:01:24,222
SPEAKER_1:  I think for some people a book is a...

02:01:25,442 --> 02:01:29,406
SPEAKER_1:  is a sort of beacon of reputation. So it's really important to not.

02:01:29,986 --> 02:01:35,806
SPEAKER_1:  There's somehow not as much reputation associated with self published book unless it's successful. Yes.

02:01:36,482 --> 02:01:38,174
SPEAKER_1:  And then, and then like the.

02:01:38,402 --> 02:01:39,390
SPEAKER_1:  It's success.

02:01:39,746 --> 02:01:42,142
SPEAKER_1:  outshines the actual, however it was published.

02:01:42,626 --> 02:01:45,950
SPEAKER_1:  I think, I guess David Goggins self-published his book.

02:01:46,082 --> 02:01:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  Because it used to be you self-publish when you can't get a book deal. So it's like an admission of failure.

02:01:52,418 --> 02:01:55,454
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, so you would recommend it as something for authors.

02:01:55,586 --> 02:01:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  No, I would recommend it as something for authors of a certain...

02:01:59,266 --> 02:02:02,814
SPEAKER_0:  stature for lack of a better term because it is still in terms of.

02:02:03,106 --> 02:02:05,406
SPEAKER_0:  your resume and your experience.

02:02:05,762 --> 02:02:08,222
SPEAKER_0:  It's better to get a crappy advance.

02:02:08,706 --> 02:02:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  and have a book with St. Martin's that goes nowhere.

02:02:12,642 --> 02:02:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  then

02:02:13,730 --> 02:02:15,454
SPEAKER_0:  a self-published book that goes nowhere.

02:02:16,066 --> 02:02:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:02:16,866 --> 02:02:20,670
SPEAKER_0:  The other thing is you have to make sure you have enough an audience that you can move some copies.

02:02:21,378 --> 02:02:24,158
SPEAKER_1:  What about OnlyFans? Would you recommend authors?

02:02:25,442 --> 02:02:28,894
SPEAKER_1:  How much money do you think you and I could make if we did like bathtub scenes?

02:02:29,250 --> 02:02:32,830
SPEAKER_1:  Only fans not just chilling just reading like reading like Animal Farm

02:02:33,250 --> 02:02:33,598
SPEAKER_1:  Just like.

02:02:33,890 --> 02:02:35,038
SPEAKER_1:  while sitting in a bathroom. They live in the bathroom, you

02:02:35,426 --> 02:02:35,870
SPEAKER_0:  can't wait to catch the rest of the fun

02:02:37,538 --> 02:02:38,910
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know. I don't know.

02:02:39,970 --> 02:02:42,078
SPEAKER_0:  Snowball sorry snowball. Okay snowball

02:02:42,338 --> 02:02:42,654
SPEAKER_0:

02:02:43,170 --> 02:02:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  Uhhhhhh

02:02:44,450 --> 02:02:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  Alright. What was his name? Snowball. No, the horse.

02:02:48,290 --> 02:02:50,165
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, boxer. I hung like a bug.

02:02:50,165 --> 02:02:54,462
SPEAKER_1:  I will work harder.

02:02:55,778 --> 02:02:56,903
SPEAKER_1:  And that guy, I think about-

02:02:56,903 --> 02:02:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  that guy a lot.

02:02:58,050 --> 02:02:58,526
SPEAKER_0:  Boxer?

02:02:58,850 --> 02:03:02,878
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, his motto was, I will work harder. Anything that happens like the.

02:03:03,106 --> 02:03:05,246
SPEAKER_1:  the pigs would take advantage and...

02:03:05,474 --> 02:03:06,846
SPEAKER_1:  his response to everything.

02:03:07,522 --> 02:03:11,505
SPEAKER_1:  He was inspiring to me because he never gave in to the sin of...

02:03:11,505 --> 02:03:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  This is right.

02:03:12,258 --> 02:03:12,894
SPEAKER_0:  and they killed him.

02:03:14,082 --> 02:03:14,878
SPEAKER_0:  Spoiler, sorry.

02:03:16,770 --> 02:03:18,558
SPEAKER_1:  That's a good way to die, never giving in.

02:03:19,330 --> 02:03:23,870
SPEAKER_0:  Well, yeah, there's a lot of that in this book about the people who are like, I'm not, you're not going to break me.

02:03:24,162 --> 02:03:24,798
SPEAKER_0:  Like I am.

02:03:25,602 --> 02:03:26,366
SPEAKER_0:  bigger than this.

02:03:28,002 --> 02:03:29,982
SPEAKER_1:  Did you ever believe in Santa?

02:03:30,850 --> 02:03:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  I remember the day.

02:03:33,026 --> 02:03:37,886
SPEAKER_0:  I woke up on New Years and there was a president under my pillow and it was like, holy shit.

02:03:40,994 --> 02:03:42,078
SPEAKER_0:  Cause DEDMOROZ LEFT IT.

02:03:42,370 --> 02:03:44,190
SPEAKER_0:  That's the whole thing, he leaves your present under your pillow.

02:03:44,450 --> 02:03:49,022
SPEAKER_1:  Right. So you believed, but what I thought the story was going to be when you first realized he's not real.

02:03:49,538 --> 02:03:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  I don't remember when I realized he wasn't real, but that story was, I did think it was real. I was like, oh my god.

02:03:55,010 --> 02:03:55,710
SPEAKER_1:  And okay.

02:03:56,098 --> 02:03:56,862
SPEAKER_1:  There's this.

02:03:58,050 --> 02:03:59,902
SPEAKER_1:  Cause I did too and I don't remember.

02:04:01,186 --> 02:04:04,574
SPEAKER_1:  I don't think I can put myself in the mindset of the kind of person that believed

02:04:05,186 --> 02:04:05,886
SPEAKER_1:  He was real.

02:04:06,722 --> 02:04:09,342
SPEAKER_1:  What did I think? What was my world view that allowed?

02:04:10,914 --> 02:04:13,534
SPEAKER_1:  Like a giant person in a red suit to be real.

02:04:14,370 --> 02:04:15,870
SPEAKER_1:  Although I do remember, I think-

02:04:16,258 --> 02:04:17,982
SPEAKER_1:  The first time a Santa Claus showed up.

02:04:18,338 --> 02:04:20,318
SPEAKER_1:  to our, like, lived in this very small apartment.

02:04:20,962 --> 02:04:23,550
SPEAKER_1:  And when he first showed up to our apartment.

02:04:24,898 --> 02:04:28,286
SPEAKER_1:  I just remember it because he was really drunk and smelled.

02:04:28,802 --> 02:04:35,966
SPEAKER_1:  It was like a party. It was like a new year's party or whatever. So one of the people dressed up with Santa Claus, I just remembered this.

02:04:37,090 --> 02:04:39,838
SPEAKER_1:  Wow, this has gotten like real fast.

02:04:41,602 --> 02:04:44,062
SPEAKER_1:  Of course, like I remember like thinking of course.

02:04:44,290 --> 02:04:49,694
SPEAKER_1:  Of course it would be like, what was I thinking? It's going to be some perfect.

02:04:50,786 --> 02:04:54,110
SPEAKER_1:  like being a perfect being like better than.

02:04:54,434 --> 02:04:56,926
SPEAKER_1:  Like the best of humanity, he was just a regular dude.

02:04:58,210 --> 02:04:58,942
SPEAKER_1:  kind of fat.

02:04:59,266 --> 02:05:01,566
SPEAKER_1:  But like not sexy fat, it was like.

02:05:01,826 --> 02:05:03,701
SPEAKER_1:  Not really that jolly

02:05:03,701 --> 02:05:05,951
SPEAKER_0:  Kind of exhausted.

02:05:05,951 --> 02:05:08,350
SPEAKER_1:  not showering well, but also funny.

02:05:08,770 --> 02:05:11,486
SPEAKER_0:  I remember, I love telling this story.

02:05:12,066 --> 02:05:15,134
SPEAKER_0:  how old I was and I must have been five or six.

02:05:15,522 --> 02:05:19,006
SPEAKER_0:  And it was just that age where you distinguish between what's real and what's not.

02:05:19,458 --> 02:05:20,862
SPEAKER_0:  So like Vikings.

02:05:21,250 --> 02:05:25,054
SPEAKER_0:  and Nights and Ninjas are Real.

02:05:25,410 --> 02:05:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  and dragons.

02:05:26,914 --> 02:05:28,062
SPEAKER_0:  and mermaids.

02:05:28,482 --> 02:05:29,758
SPEAKER_0:  and elves are fake.

02:05:30,114 --> 02:05:33,502
SPEAKER_0:  And I was on the corner of Shore Parkway right before the park.

02:05:33,762 --> 02:05:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  Bensonhurst in Brooklyn.

02:05:35,362 --> 02:05:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  and around the corner wearing a denim vest.

02:05:39,042 --> 02:05:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  uh... was a little person at work

02:05:41,954 --> 02:05:42,974
SPEAKER_0:  And I saw him.

02:05:43,234 --> 02:05:49,854
SPEAKER_0:  And I was like, all right, back to the drawing board. Like, I don't know what's real or not anymore because I just saw a dwarf. So I don't know what's going on.

02:05:49,986 --> 02:05:50,878
SPEAKER_1:  And since then...

02:05:51,650 --> 02:05:56,670
SPEAKER_1:  given your relationship with Alex Jones, you've continued the journey of not knowing what's real or not. That's correct.

02:05:57,538 --> 02:06:00,574
SPEAKER_1:  Alright, let's talk about the next steps after Stalin took power.

02:06:00,898 --> 02:06:03,582
SPEAKER_1:  he started to actually implementing some of the economic

02:06:03,874 --> 02:06:06,206
SPEAKER_1:  some of the policies in this idea of

02:06:06,466 --> 02:06:07,678
SPEAKER_1:  collectivization. Yeah.

02:06:08,450 --> 02:06:10,206
SPEAKER_1:  What's the story of that in the...

02:06:10,434 --> 02:06:11,326
SPEAKER_1:  in the 20s.

02:06:11,938 --> 02:06:14,558
SPEAKER_1:  leading into the 30s. What was this idea?

02:06:14,850 --> 02:06:16,638
SPEAKER_1:  or is the relationship between the regime?

02:06:16,866 --> 02:06:18,686
SPEAKER_1:  the ideology and the farmers.

02:06:18,818 --> 02:06:23,806
SPEAKER_0:  Well, there's always been and obviously very much this day an enormous amount of

02:06:24,898 --> 02:06:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  Em... Emily.

02:06:26,178 --> 02:06:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  for lack of a better term, hatred between Ukraine and Russia. I mean, this is...

02:06:30,882 --> 02:06:31,326
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

02:06:31,586 --> 02:06:34,110
SPEAKER_0:  centuries in the making, if not more.

02:06:34,626 --> 02:06:36,382
SPEAKER_0:  and the Ukraine.

02:06:36,610 --> 02:06:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  or Ukraine now, but at the time, I'm speaking of the region.

02:06:40,418 --> 02:06:45,630
SPEAKER_0:  is and still is the breadbasket of Europe. It was very fertile lands. This is where the food comes from.

02:06:46,338 --> 02:06:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  And this was an issue also for Lenin.

02:06:49,826 --> 02:06:52,318
SPEAKER_0:  as I discuss in the book, because when you had famines there...

02:06:52,898 --> 02:06:54,078
SPEAKER_0:  You know, you have famines.

02:06:54,306 --> 02:06:54,686
SPEAKER_0:  throughout.

02:06:55,202 --> 02:06:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  what later became the Soviet Union.

02:06:57,602 --> 02:07:02,526
SPEAKER_0:  And the problem is this happened in North Korea as well in the 90s when they don't have food.

02:07:03,010 --> 02:07:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  If you let in foreigners and feed your people.

02:07:05,794 --> 02:07:08,446
SPEAKER_0:  all of a sudden you as the government are either superfluous

02:07:08,770 --> 02:07:09,822
SPEAKER_0:  or downright.

02:07:10,562 --> 02:07:13,854
SPEAKER_0:  deleterious to their well-being and that's a threat to your power.

02:07:14,402 --> 02:07:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, so Lenin let in.

02:07:16,034 --> 02:07:20,606
SPEAKER_0:  an American organization, the early 20s, which is actually headed by Herbert Hoover of all people.

02:07:21,250 --> 02:07:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  And after a while, Hoover left because he found that the Bolsheviks were just taking the grain that the Americans were giving to feed the people and selling it for export.

02:07:28,898 --> 02:07:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  while the people suffered. And one of the people who grew up in these

02:07:33,602 --> 02:07:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  uh... starvation times was a young mikhail gorbachev where he had you know i think it's like a quarter or a third of his village starved to death

02:07:40,642 --> 02:07:42,494
SPEAKER_0:  during one of these periodic famines.

02:07:43,202 --> 02:07:45,694
SPEAKER_0:  Um, Stalin's idea, this was a good-

02:07:46,210 --> 02:07:47,518
SPEAKER_0:  mechanism for him.

02:07:47,874 --> 02:07:48,798
SPEAKER_0:  to break.

02:07:49,666 --> 02:07:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  the idea of Ukraine being an independent.

02:07:52,514 --> 02:07:54,590
SPEAKER_0:  nation within its own identity.

02:07:55,106 --> 02:08:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and you know, he had this kind of liquidation of the cool locks, you know, very famously, which thankfully is much more discussed now.

02:08:02,658 --> 02:08:04,478
SPEAKER_0:  than it was maybe when you and I were kids.

02:08:05,122 --> 02:08:12,286
SPEAKER_0:  And a kulak, the real meaning or the literal meaning is kind of this wealthy landowner.

02:08:13,186 --> 02:08:16,414
SPEAKER_0:  But very quickly, it's kind of like it becomes outgroup.

02:08:16,770 --> 02:08:19,070
SPEAKER_0:  So, you know, there was a...

02:08:19,490 --> 02:08:20,734
SPEAKER_0:  a big incentive.

02:08:21,186 --> 02:08:25,918
SPEAKER_0:  call someone you didn't like a cool lock and then good luck to you because now the eyes of the state are on you

02:08:26,146 --> 02:08:27,742
SPEAKER_0:  and you have to prove that you know you didn't.

02:08:28,034 --> 02:08:31,998
SPEAKER_0:  hire people, you didn't have four cows or how many acres or so and so forth.

02:08:32,226 --> 02:08:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  They took a huge

02:08:34,338 --> 02:08:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  percentage of the population, the cool locks.

02:08:36,642 --> 02:08:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  and they just deported them.

02:08:37,858 --> 02:08:41,470
SPEAKER_0:  You know, these are lands that they had for generations and they just spread them throughout.

02:08:41,858 --> 02:08:48,126
SPEAKER_0:  uh, uh, uh, broader Russia. Many of them never made it. And many of them were killed. This was by design.

02:08:48,610 --> 02:08:50,814
SPEAKER_1:  And the dark thing about the cool locks, like you said.

02:08:51,746 --> 02:08:55,070
SPEAKER_1:  when it becomes abused, when it becomes the outgroup.

02:08:55,714 --> 02:08:56,158
SPEAKER_1:  is.

02:08:57,666 --> 02:08:59,294
SPEAKER_1:  Kuok is supposed to be.

02:08:59,586 --> 02:09:00,670
SPEAKER_1:  uh... wealthier

02:09:01,090 --> 02:09:02,142
SPEAKER_1:  and sort of the general.

02:09:02,530 --> 02:09:04,318
SPEAKER_1:  farmer-peasant.

02:09:04,994 --> 02:09:09,214
SPEAKER_1:  And so basically it gives you a mechanism of resentment. And yes, that's better off.

02:09:09,762 --> 02:09:12,222
SPEAKER_1:  must be better off because they're cool. Let's get rid of them.

02:09:12,578 --> 02:09:13,406
SPEAKER_1:  And it has a-

02:09:13,762 --> 02:09:15,902
SPEAKER_1:  uh... just from an economics perspective

02:09:16,226 --> 02:09:17,918
SPEAKER_1:  even leaving ethics aside.

02:09:18,178 --> 02:09:22,430
SPEAKER_1:  It basically completely de-incentivizes.

02:09:22,914 --> 02:09:23,614
SPEAKER_1:  productivity.

02:09:24,034 --> 02:09:29,406
SPEAKER_1:  It wants you to fail because if you succeed your cool lock you're going to be tortured you can be deported

02:09:29,826 --> 02:09:30,951
SPEAKER_1:  Are you going to be dera-

02:09:30,951 --> 02:09:33,790
SPEAKER_0:  I did all that. And also you're poor because he's rich.

02:09:34,178 --> 02:09:35,902
SPEAKER_0:  Like that's a big part of it.

02:09:36,418 --> 02:09:41,278
SPEAKER_0:  So while this was going on and food was becoming a problem because you had a

02:09:42,146 --> 02:09:43,134
SPEAKER_0:  for weather conditions.

02:09:43,778 --> 02:09:46,558
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, there was a campaign about, oh, the reason you're hungry.

02:09:47,010 --> 02:09:49,246
SPEAKER_0:  is because the cool locks are hoarding all their grain.

02:09:49,730 --> 02:09:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  And if you're somewhere else in the Soviet Union, how are you supposed to know any better?

02:09:55,106 --> 02:09:57,214
SPEAKER_0:  because you're being told every year the crops are.

02:09:57,474 --> 02:10:00,894
SPEAKER_0:  Bumper crop, bumper crop, bumper crop, now there's no food, there's no bread.

02:10:01,218 --> 02:10:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  And so, you see, we produced all this bread. It's not getting to you because the Kool-Ax are hoarding the grain.

02:10:07,394 --> 02:10:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  So they came like in what became known as the Haldemore and Applebaum who's a great historian.

02:10:14,786 --> 02:10:19,934
SPEAKER_0:  who unfortunately I disagree with a lot in contemporary politics, but who's done so much great work.

02:10:20,290 --> 02:10:20,702
SPEAKER_0:  about.

02:10:20,930 --> 02:10:22,750
SPEAKER_0:  the Soviet Union that I...

02:10:23,010 --> 02:10:24,606
SPEAKER_0:  pretty much give her a blank check and whatever.

02:10:24,994 --> 02:10:26,270
SPEAKER_0:  she wants to say nowadays.

02:10:26,530 --> 02:10:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  You know, she wrote a great book about this called Red Famine.

02:10:29,346 --> 02:10:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:10:30,338 --> 02:10:33,950
SPEAKER_0:  these activists descended on these villages like locusts.

02:10:34,370 --> 02:10:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  and their job was to requisition as much food as possible.

02:10:38,402 --> 02:10:43,038
SPEAKER_0:  and they would come back at all hours of the night to make sure you weren't hiding food.

02:10:43,298 --> 02:10:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  And this is what was so...

02:10:45,090 --> 02:10:46,014
SPEAKER_0:  pernicious about it.

02:10:46,402 --> 02:10:48,126
SPEAKER_0:  your own body would betray you.

02:10:48,610 --> 02:10:49,566
SPEAKER_0:  They could look at you.

02:10:49,922 --> 02:10:51,710
SPEAKER_0:  and see that you're not losing weight.

02:10:51,938 --> 02:10:53,214
SPEAKER_0:  Got those chubby cheeks?

02:10:53,474 --> 02:10:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  That means you have food and that's the government's food.

02:10:56,514 --> 02:11:04,638
SPEAKER_0:  That is the food of the people. And if you are keeping food for yourself, you are stealing from the people. You're an enemy of the people and you deserve whatever comes to you.

02:11:05,058 --> 02:11:07,998
SPEAKER_0:  And it got to a point where they didn't have grain to-

02:11:08,226 --> 02:11:08,702
SPEAKER_0:  to.

02:11:09,154 --> 02:11:10,622
SPEAKER_0:  plant for the next harvest.

02:11:11,042 --> 02:11:12,446
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and.

02:11:12,962 --> 02:11:14,366
SPEAKER_0:  what was even sicker.

02:11:14,722 --> 02:11:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  is one of the big criticisms of communists.

02:11:18,178 --> 02:11:21,534
SPEAKER_0:  of the Tsar was his internal passport system that...

02:11:21,826 --> 02:11:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  I can't go where I want within.

02:11:24,002 --> 02:11:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  Russia, the Russian Empire, without permission.

02:11:26,626 --> 02:11:27,966
SPEAKER_0:  Stalin reintroduced this.

02:11:28,738 --> 02:11:32,030
SPEAKER_0:  So if your village was targeted, you can't leave.

02:11:32,354 --> 02:11:36,062
SPEAKER_0:  Now some people got away, they tried to get to the cities and so on and so forth.

02:11:36,354 --> 02:11:37,502
SPEAKER_0:  but you get to the city.

02:11:38,050 --> 02:11:40,158
SPEAKER_0:  and you're starving, you have no clothes.

02:11:40,546 --> 02:11:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  You're a Coolock!

02:11:41,730 --> 02:11:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  I'm hungry because of you and now you're too lazy to work. Get the F out of there.

02:11:45,730 --> 02:11:47,230
SPEAKER_0:  And there were stories, you know.

02:11:47,554 --> 02:11:52,254
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I have them in the white pill of this like starving teenage girl and she's

02:11:52,514 --> 02:11:53,630
SPEAKER_0:  begging for food.

02:11:53,954 --> 02:12:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  And the guy knocks the shopkeeper knocks the food out of her hand and she dies on the spot and everyone in that line knew not to, you know, give her.

02:12:01,314 --> 02:12:09,246
SPEAKER_0:  any food or any sympathy because she's a Kulak sympathizer and very quickly if you're a Kulak sympathizer all that has to happen is someone has to call

02:12:09,538 --> 02:12:12,894
SPEAKER_0:  I think it was the NKVD at the time, you know, the different names of the checker.

02:12:13,154 --> 02:12:15,102
SPEAKER_0:  the secret police and they have to be like, oh.

02:12:15,906 --> 02:12:17,918
SPEAKER_0:  You see, whatever her name was, Genia?

02:12:18,306 --> 02:12:20,542
SPEAKER_0:  She was a Kulak sympathizer. We saw Kulak.

02:12:20,770 --> 02:12:23,518
SPEAKER_0:  who was trying to shake us down for food too lazy to work and she

02:12:23,746 --> 02:12:27,102
SPEAKER_0:  felt so bad for them. So you might want to check in on Zhenya. So yeah.

02:12:27,970 --> 02:12:29,982
SPEAKER_1:  But in 32 and 33.

02:12:30,306 --> 02:12:30,974
SPEAKER_1:  Call it a More.

02:12:31,938 --> 02:12:33,086
SPEAKER_1:  It wasn't just...

02:12:34,434 --> 02:12:35,070
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:12:35,618 --> 02:12:37,310
SPEAKER_1:  Small injustice here and there.

02:12:37,794 --> 02:12:38,526
SPEAKER_1:  It was...

02:12:38,946 --> 02:12:41,758
SPEAKER_1:  Mass starvation and suffering.

02:12:41,890 --> 02:12:43,390
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, millions starve to death.

02:12:44,002 --> 02:12:45,054
SPEAKER_0:  in the Ukraine alone.

02:12:45,442 --> 02:12:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  and by design.

02:12:47,970 --> 02:12:53,406
SPEAKER_1:  So you mentioned an Apple bombs book, Red Famine, Star Wars 1 Ukraine.

02:12:53,794 --> 02:12:58,654
SPEAKER_1:  but another excellent book on the topic. And by the way, thank you for recommending that to me. So, Was.

02:12:59,106 --> 02:12:59,902
SPEAKER_1:  Her work's amazing.

02:13:00,290 --> 02:13:02,334
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it's a really, really powerful.

02:13:03,010 --> 02:13:08,094
SPEAKER_1:  a book about not just about Hanumer, but like the context of Ukraine.

02:13:08,802 --> 02:13:10,238
SPEAKER_1:  Basically the history of Ukraine.

02:13:10,754 --> 02:13:12,926
SPEAKER_1:  that's relevant for today. Ya.

02:13:13,730 --> 02:13:17,758
SPEAKER_1:  to understand the relationship between Russia and Ukraine.

02:13:19,106 --> 02:13:26,231
SPEAKER_1:  But another great book is Bloodlands Europe Between Hitler and Stalin by Timothy Snyder. I don't know, I think you also recommended that to me at some point, or maybe not.

02:13:26,231 --> 02:13:30,206
SPEAKER_0:  I haven't but I'm familiar with that and read it. So he-

02:13:30,498 --> 02:13:36,318
SPEAKER_1:  He does quite a bit of, it's brief, but extremely well researched writing about cannibalism there.

02:13:36,930 --> 02:13:43,518
SPEAKER_1:  and that it was not uncommon during the Stalin imposed famine in the Soviet Ukraine for parents to cook and eat their children.

02:13:44,002 --> 02:13:44,990
SPEAKER_1:  He writes, quote,

02:13:45,314 --> 02:13:52,318
SPEAKER_1:  Survival was a moral as well as a physical struggle. A woman doctor wrote to a friend in June 1933 that she had not yet become.

02:13:52,610 --> 02:13:53,278
SPEAKER_1:  a cannibal.

02:13:53,570 --> 02:13:53,950
SPEAKER_1:  But...

02:13:54,242 --> 02:13:58,174
SPEAKER_1:  was not sure that I shall not be won by the time my letter reaches you.

02:13:58,978 --> 02:13:59,678
SPEAKER_1:  in quotes.

02:14:00,194 --> 02:14:04,798
SPEAKER_1:  The good people died first. Those who refused to steal or to prostitute themselves died.

02:14:05,026 --> 02:14:07,070
SPEAKER_1:  Those who gave food to others died.

02:14:07,426 --> 02:14:09,630
SPEAKER_1:  Those who refused to eat corpses died.

02:14:09,858 --> 02:14:12,414
SPEAKER_1:  Those who refused to kill their fellow man died.

02:14:12,706 --> 02:14:17,726
SPEAKER_1:  Parents who resisted cannibalism died before their children did. There are stories in there about...

02:14:18,242 --> 02:14:18,910
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:14:19,906 --> 02:14:21,662
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, cooking. Cooking your children.

02:14:24,194 --> 02:14:26,622
SPEAKER_1:  The other thing about

02:14:26,882 --> 02:14:28,894
SPEAKER_1:  cannibalism about famine in general.

02:14:29,410 --> 02:14:32,222
SPEAKER_1:  that stood out to me, unlike a lot of atrocities.

02:14:32,930 --> 02:14:34,974
SPEAKER_1:  is the people that are starving.

02:14:35,202 --> 02:14:36,190
SPEAKER_1:  are exhausted.

02:14:36,578 --> 02:14:38,558
SPEAKER_1:  They're basically unable to think.

02:14:39,970 --> 02:14:42,366
SPEAKER_1:  so they don't even have the energy to protest.

02:14:43,298 --> 02:14:45,278
SPEAKER_1:  It's a strange kind of way.

02:14:46,050 --> 02:14:47,934
SPEAKER_1:  to kill thinking in the populace.

02:14:49,442 --> 02:14:53,054
SPEAKER_1:  That it kind of, I suppose it was obvious.

02:14:54,306 --> 02:14:56,734
SPEAKER_1:  but there's something fundamental about starvation where...

02:14:57,026 --> 02:14:59,710
SPEAKER_1:  It slowly removes your humanity.

02:15:00,738 --> 02:15:01,150
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:15:03,266 --> 02:15:06,110
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, there was a scene in the book where...

02:15:07,330 --> 02:15:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of times people literally go crazy.

02:15:09,826 --> 02:15:13,822
SPEAKER_0:  And there's a scene where mom at some nursing, a train station was nursing her kid.

02:15:14,082 --> 02:15:16,382
SPEAKER_0:  She was going mad from hunger.

02:15:16,834 --> 02:15:21,278
SPEAKER_0:  and she starts beating the crap out of her baby and kicking it and then she just reverts to normal like nothing had happened.

02:15:21,794 --> 02:15:22,334
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:15:22,498 --> 02:15:26,623
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, madness. Like you lose, yeah, you lose your mind. Yeah.

02:15:26,623 --> 02:15:27,358
SPEAKER_0:  And uh...

02:15:27,810 --> 02:15:38,366
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I don't know what the physiological cause of this. It's not just, I think it's, you know, if someone has dealt with like glycogen depletion, it affects their mood, things like that. So taking to an extreme, who knows what happens when.

02:15:38,786 --> 02:15:40,894
SPEAKER_0:  parts of the brain start functioning and start imploding.

02:15:41,442 --> 02:15:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:15:42,274 --> 02:15:43,518
SPEAKER_0:  But yeah, it's...

02:15:44,546 --> 02:15:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  what i want what just happened this is something that's really cool regarding the holodomor

02:15:49,090 --> 02:15:50,462
SPEAKER_0:  So there was one.

02:15:52,130 --> 02:15:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  Western journalist, Gareth Jones.

02:15:54,978 --> 02:15:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  who was like, all right, something's not adding up here.

02:15:59,106 --> 02:16:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  So he was supposed to take a train.

02:16:01,794 --> 02:16:02,622
SPEAKER_0:  through Ukraine.

02:16:03,202 --> 02:16:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  and he got out early.

02:16:06,082 --> 02:16:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  and decided to start walking through the countryside to go from village to village.

02:16:11,234 --> 02:16:13,438
SPEAKER_0:  and I'll get to his story in a minute.

02:16:14,146 --> 02:16:16,190
SPEAKER_0:  right before we started recording.

02:16:16,962 --> 02:16:19,966
SPEAKER_0:  I got this book in the mail. I ordered it on November 28th.

02:16:20,514 --> 02:16:24,510
SPEAKER_0:  from Great Britain. It was the only copy available on the whole internet.

02:16:25,058 --> 02:16:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  It's called Experiences in Russian 1931. It is anonymous.

02:16:29,250 --> 02:16:29,790
SPEAKER_0:  And it's

02:16:30,114 --> 02:16:30,462
SPEAKER_0:  Uh

02:16:30,690 --> 02:16:35,518
SPEAKER_0:  Gareth Jones wrote the introduction. It was published by the Alton Press in Pittsburgh. It was self-published.

02:16:36,258 --> 02:16:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:16:37,954 --> 02:16:41,054
SPEAKER_0:  See, it just says forward, it just says by the author.

02:16:42,082 --> 02:16:45,758
SPEAKER_0:  So it was the author who went alongside.

02:16:46,306 --> 02:16:46,814
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:16:47,490 --> 02:16:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  Gareth Jones was summoned by the name of...

02:16:50,818 --> 02:16:51,198
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:16:53,090 --> 02:16:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  Henry John Hines.

02:16:54,530 --> 02:16:55,646
SPEAKER_0:  who was...

02:16:55,970 --> 02:16:57,246
SPEAKER_0:  Heir to the Heinz fortune.

02:16:58,178 --> 02:16:58,910
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:16:59,522 --> 02:17:02,558
SPEAKER_0:  You only know that if you start looking at the internet because his name is not anywhere his book.

02:17:02,978 --> 02:17:05,214
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I opened this book up right when I got it.

02:17:05,538 --> 02:17:06,622
SPEAKER_0:  right before we're taping.

02:17:07,298 --> 02:17:08,894
SPEAKER_0:  and it's signed by him.

02:17:09,890 --> 02:17:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  And it took me a second. I'm like, wait a minute, who's this signed by? And it's H.J. Hines because his name was Jack Hines, but it was Henry John Hines.

02:17:16,194 --> 02:17:20,126
SPEAKER_0:  So I'm very excited that I had this little miracle in the mail.

02:17:20,898 --> 02:17:28,023
SPEAKER_0:  Um, but Christmas miracle. It's a Christmas miracle. Um, traveled, they traveled together. They traveled together. So this book's a diary of their travels.

02:17:28,023 --> 02:17:29,534
SPEAKER_1:  Why do you think so few journalists?

02:17:30,754 --> 02:17:31,879
SPEAKER_1:  they was able to do with you.

02:17:31,879 --> 02:17:37,694
SPEAKER_0:  So there were several reasons. First of all, if you were a Western journalist in the Soviet Union,

02:17:38,050 --> 02:17:40,126
SPEAKER_0:  you're under very strict

02:17:40,610 --> 02:17:40,990
SPEAKER_0:  Uh.

02:17:41,442 --> 02:17:44,446
SPEAKER_0:  First of all, you could be deported anytime.

02:17:44,962 --> 02:17:47,166
SPEAKER_0:  You had no, there was no pretense.

02:17:47,554 --> 02:17:50,142
SPEAKER_0:  that you have a right to be a journalist in.

02:17:50,402 --> 02:17:54,174
SPEAKER_0:  especially as a representative of a capitalist by which they met Western paper.

02:17:54,722 --> 02:17:59,774
SPEAKER_0:  Second, it was a complete nightmare getting your articles filed.

02:18:00,034 --> 02:18:08,702
SPEAKER_0:  because you had a censor that you had to go through and the censor's job, whose life depended on it, was to make sure that your story was advantageous to the Soviet Union, or at least neutral.

02:18:09,154 --> 02:18:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, and they had all sorts of techniques, you know, they could spy, they spied on you all the time. They followed you around because you know, you're a foreigner.

02:18:14,818 --> 02:18:18,142
SPEAKER_0:  but also that sensor had to answer somebody.

02:18:18,530 --> 02:18:23,326
SPEAKER_0:  So all the sensor has to do is be like, look, I'm having trouble with my supervisor.

02:18:23,586 --> 02:18:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  And the reporter could be like, well, can I talk to supervisor? It's like, well, I'm sorry, that's not possible. And he's on deadline, but it's too bad. Bureaucracy doesn't recognize the needs of deadlines. So.

02:18:34,082 --> 02:18:35,038
SPEAKER_0:  There was a big.

02:18:35,714 --> 02:18:37,310
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of pressure.

02:18:37,698 --> 02:18:39,518
SPEAKER_0:  on Western journalists to.

02:18:40,002 --> 02:18:44,574
SPEAKER_0:  have to get through this net and that's literally constant. You know, every story it's going to be a fight.

02:18:45,026 --> 02:18:49,918
SPEAKER_0:  So at a certain point, you're just going to be like, all right, and you're going to pre-sensor yourself. You know, if you know...

02:18:50,242 --> 02:18:53,790
SPEAKER_0:  Alright, if I include this, it's not going to get through. What are you supposed to do?

02:18:54,466 --> 02:18:58,686
SPEAKER_0:  I think human beings are naturally, and also a lot of these journalists were.

02:18:59,042 --> 02:18:59,710
SPEAKER_0:  pro-soviet.

02:19:00,386 --> 02:19:01,214
SPEAKER_0:  They thought.

02:19:01,506 --> 02:19:03,358
SPEAKER_0:  This is the society, the future.

02:19:03,746 --> 02:19:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  At least everyone's trying.

02:19:05,954 --> 02:19:09,534
SPEAKER_0:  to make it a better country for everyone, not like back home.

02:19:09,794 --> 02:19:11,614
SPEAKER_0:  with a poor slip between the cracks.

02:19:12,002 --> 02:19:14,526
SPEAKER_0:  We gotta do what we can to make this work.

02:19:15,522 --> 02:19:16,190
SPEAKER_0:  And...

02:19:17,282 --> 02:19:17,854
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

02:19:18,498 --> 02:19:19,358
SPEAKER_0:  There was.

02:19:19,650 --> 02:19:23,902
SPEAKER_0:  a lot of, I don't want to say conspiracy, but within the industry.

02:19:24,194 --> 02:19:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  There was a consensus.

02:19:26,178 --> 02:19:26,526
SPEAKER_0:  that.

02:19:27,042 --> 02:19:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  The Stalin was the good guy, and we were, if not the bad guys, certainly not as good.

02:19:31,650 --> 02:19:32,734
SPEAKER_0:  in certain regards.

02:19:33,058 --> 02:19:36,766
SPEAKER_0:  So when this news of the famine started percolating...

02:19:37,346 --> 02:19:41,438
SPEAKER_0:  all the other Western journalists besides Gareth Jones and Malcolm Muggeridge

02:19:41,954 --> 02:19:43,070
SPEAKER_0:  We're saying this isn't true.

02:19:43,618 --> 02:19:45,822
SPEAKER_0:  It's nothing that they haven't seen before.

02:19:46,434 --> 02:19:48,542
SPEAKER_0:  Paper that took the lead in this was New York Times with

02:19:48,834 --> 02:19:51,646
SPEAKER_0:  their guy Walter Durante who had previously won a Pulitzer.

02:19:51,938 --> 02:19:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  I had interviewed Stalin, which was an enormously rare honor for a Westerner.

02:19:56,450 --> 02:20:02,494
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and he, because he has so much experience covering Russia and the Soviet Union.

02:20:02,818 --> 02:20:07,038
SPEAKER_0:  He basically took the lead and other people followed his lead. You know, he was kind of the Dean.

02:20:07,490 --> 02:20:09,758
SPEAKER_0:  of the press corps in Russia.

02:20:10,146 --> 02:20:13,822
SPEAKER_0:  uh... and he made a point and the thing that they just so many quotes i have from him

02:20:14,338 --> 02:20:22,078
SPEAKER_0:  where he's not only denying that this mass starvation is happening, he's also going after journalists who are questioning the narrative.

02:20:22,658 --> 02:20:24,862
SPEAKER_0:  and he says things like, look.

02:20:25,474 --> 02:20:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  This is nothing that the Russians haven't experienced before they're simply tightening their belts and it's like

02:20:31,202 --> 02:20:32,510
SPEAKER_0:  You only have to tighten your belt.

02:20:33,058 --> 02:20:40,382
SPEAKER_0:  When you don't have enough food, it's not like they started a new exercise regimen and now their body fat's dropping. That's why would someone tighten their belt?

02:20:40,802 --> 02:20:41,630
SPEAKER_0:  So that was one.

02:20:42,018 --> 02:20:42,622
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:20:42,882 --> 02:20:45,438
SPEAKER_0:  The New York Times had a 13 page.

02:20:46,146 --> 02:20:46,846
SPEAKER_0:  article.

02:20:47,362 --> 02:20:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  Big headline, Russians hungry, not starving.

02:20:50,434 --> 02:20:52,862
SPEAKER_0:  And he went after Jones, he went after-

02:20:53,154 --> 02:20:54,494
SPEAKER_0:  I believe

02:20:54,754 --> 02:20:57,054
SPEAKER_0:  No, he did go after Margarit, but the point being that...

02:20:57,474 --> 02:21:01,406
SPEAKER_0:  This is just propaganda from people who want the Soviet Union to fail.

02:21:01,730 --> 02:21:06,942
SPEAKER_0:  You know, they don't understand what they're building here. Uh, you know, he had so many excuses like, Oh,

02:21:07,234 --> 02:21:08,286
SPEAKER_0:  You know, the reason.

02:21:08,514 --> 02:21:19,870
SPEAKER_0:  All these Russians are supposedly leaving their villages to go to the cities isn't because there's no food. It's because they're nomadic. It's tradition. They go from town to town looking for new experiences and it's just.

02:21:20,386 --> 02:21:23,102
SPEAKER_0:  at a certain point, and I think it was 1941.

02:21:23,426 --> 02:21:26,686
SPEAKER_0:  where he was eventually like, or 51 rather, I don't remember.

02:21:26,914 --> 02:21:28,862
SPEAKER_0:  He was like, oh, well, uh.

02:21:29,346 --> 02:21:30,846
SPEAKER_0:  I guess I was kind of wrong.

02:21:31,170 --> 02:21:36,350
SPEAKER_0:  And it's like, he's like, any journalist worth his salt can admit when he's wrong. And it's like, well, were you worth your salt?

02:21:36,738 --> 02:21:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  because you sure, he explicitly said.

02:21:40,194 --> 02:21:41,406
SPEAKER_0:  There's no point.

02:21:41,954 --> 02:21:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  in.

02:21:42,658 --> 02:21:52,734
SPEAKER_0:  sending out journalists to look for themselves. I've been through the countryside and everyone's fine. And it's just that the loudest people are making noise, whereas everyone else is doing the work and trying to...

02:21:52,994 --> 02:22:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  And this isn't about famine, but it's about Westerners skeptical about collectivization, which is just simply a new way of farming. And yeah, it was a new way of farming, and the results were by design.

02:22:03,170 --> 02:22:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  and also accidentally, absolutely catastrophic.

02:22:07,138 --> 02:22:07,454
SPEAKER_0:  Ha ha

02:22:07,714 --> 02:22:08,222
SPEAKER_1:  How?

02:22:08,642 --> 02:22:09,534
SPEAKER_1:  How hard was it?

02:22:10,690 --> 02:22:12,382
SPEAKER_1:  to see the truth at that time, do you think?

02:22:12,994 --> 02:22:15,870
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think that was a mistake that's understandable to make?

02:22:16,514 --> 02:22:17,246
SPEAKER_1:  This is Journalist.

02:22:17,442 --> 02:22:18,398
SPEAKER_0:  if my job.

02:22:18,722 --> 02:22:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  as a journalist.

02:22:20,866 --> 02:22:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  I have two bosses if I'm in Moscow.

02:22:23,554 --> 02:22:26,750
SPEAKER_0:  I've got my reporter in New York or London or whatever.

02:22:27,298 --> 02:22:28,734
SPEAKER_0:  but I've got my sensor.

02:22:29,218 --> 02:22:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  here.

02:22:30,018 --> 02:22:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  and he is making sure I have.

02:22:32,866 --> 02:22:33,342
SPEAKER_0:  house?

02:22:33,730 --> 02:22:34,270
SPEAKER_0:  The department.

02:22:34,562 --> 02:22:35,806
SPEAKER_0:  He makes sure I have food.

02:22:36,162 --> 02:22:38,174
SPEAKER_0:  you make sure you have access to dignitaries.

02:22:38,658 --> 02:22:39,678
SPEAKER_0:  He's my lifeline.

02:22:40,130 --> 02:22:41,278
SPEAKER_0:  If I piss him off...

02:22:41,602 --> 02:22:42,782
SPEAKER_0:  I'm on the next plane.

02:22:43,138 --> 02:22:43,838
SPEAKER_0:  Out of town.

02:22:44,194 --> 02:22:45,319
SPEAKER_0:  So that enough.

02:22:45,319 --> 02:22:47,326
SPEAKER_1:  Is that enough to uh...

02:22:50,050 --> 02:22:50,846
SPEAKER_1:  slowly

02:22:51,202 --> 02:22:53,118
SPEAKER_1:  suffocate the integrity of a journalist.

02:22:53,570 --> 02:22:57,575
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think it was slow at all and it was clearly enough. And because what are they going to do?

02:22:57,575 --> 02:23:01,086
SPEAKER_1:  I disagree with that. I think the failure of integrity...

02:23:02,082 --> 02:23:04,958
SPEAKER_1:  has to come from the New York and the American side.

02:23:05,474 --> 02:23:09,438
SPEAKER_1:  that it's just the flock of fish or whatever that all move in the same.

02:23:09,922 --> 02:23:10,558
SPEAKER_1:  narrative

02:23:10,914 --> 02:23:11,326
SPEAKER_1:  Right.

02:23:12,098 --> 02:23:13,054
SPEAKER_1:  I think journalists

02:23:15,554 --> 02:23:17,694
SPEAKER_1:  would like to be the kind of people that have integrity.

02:23:18,338 --> 02:23:23,646
SPEAKER_1:  So if they are conscious of sacrificing their own integrity, they wouldn't do it. If they're conscious of an act.

02:23:24,130 --> 02:23:25,310
SPEAKER_1:  that's doing it, they wouldn't do it.

02:23:25,858 --> 02:23:28,254
SPEAKER_1:  So it has to happen like a lobster slowly boiling.

02:23:28,930 --> 02:23:31,038
SPEAKER_0:  No, I think it happens when everyone else...

02:23:31,298 --> 02:23:33,063
SPEAKER_0:  is it's a it's a Greek card.

02:23:33,063 --> 02:23:37,694
SPEAKER_1:  Right, right, it's a chorus. That's right. So it's not about the act.

02:23:37,922 --> 02:23:38,974
SPEAKER_1:  But they will, I mean...

02:23:39,426 --> 02:23:41,310
SPEAKER_1:  I've talked to no journalists where I'm.

02:23:41,730 --> 02:23:43,102
SPEAKER_1:  I get the sense.

02:23:43,522 --> 02:23:44,647
SPEAKER_1:  that they will sell the.

02:23:44,647 --> 02:23:45,854
SPEAKER_0:  sold for access.

02:23:47,458 --> 02:23:48,478
SPEAKER_0:  because that's their job.

02:23:49,186 --> 02:23:49,854
SPEAKER_1:  Is it though?

02:23:50,402 --> 02:23:52,478
SPEAKER_1:  because what they do, what journalists do...

02:23:52,962 --> 02:23:54,558
SPEAKER_1:  I've seen American journalists.

02:23:55,074 --> 02:23:55,550
SPEAKER_1:  They.

02:23:56,194 --> 02:23:58,302
SPEAKER_1:  Take a huge amount of pride for having gotten.

02:23:58,946 --> 02:24:01,918
SPEAKER_1:  The interview, whatever that is, the Putin interview.

02:24:02,978 --> 02:24:03,518
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:24:04,482 --> 02:24:08,062
SPEAKER_1:  First of all, they're glowing with pride.

02:24:08,642 --> 02:24:12,126
SPEAKER_1:  It seems like they're always showing off to the other journalists back in America.

02:24:12,482 --> 02:24:15,934
SPEAKER_1:  So they're showing off like, look, I got the access you didn't.

02:24:16,546 --> 02:24:22,974
SPEAKER_1:  And second thing they're doing when they show up to that interview is they ask all the questions that signal to the other journalists.

02:24:24,482 --> 02:24:25,726
SPEAKER_1:  We're on the same side.

02:24:26,146 --> 02:24:27,870
SPEAKER_1:  They asked the most generic.

02:24:28,354 --> 02:24:29,342
SPEAKER_1:  Aggressive.

02:24:29,730 --> 02:24:31,678
SPEAKER_1:  questions to which they know the answers.

02:24:32,578 --> 02:24:34,782
SPEAKER_1:  to, they just, they want to.

02:24:35,170 --> 02:24:37,342
SPEAKER_1:  I want to basically get the access and ask.

02:24:37,634 --> 02:24:39,486
SPEAKER_1:  the quote unquote, hard hitting questions.

02:24:40,290 --> 02:24:42,078
SPEAKER_1:  that they know will not be answered.

02:24:42,434 --> 02:24:45,342
SPEAKER_1:  And this is the entire machinery of it. It's not, it's-

02:24:45,730 --> 02:24:46,942
SPEAKER_1:  This modern journalism.

02:24:47,170 --> 02:24:48,478
SPEAKER_1:  And I suppose at that time...

02:24:49,314 --> 02:24:50,910
SPEAKER_1:  It was worse? It was worse?

02:24:51,490 --> 02:24:55,239
SPEAKER_1:  They weren't even doing the hard hitting, the display of hard hitting.

02:24:55,239 --> 02:24:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  questions.

02:24:56,322 --> 02:24:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  Because think about what

02:24:58,946 --> 02:25:00,254
SPEAKER_0:  high status that is.

02:25:00,674 --> 02:25:03,166
SPEAKER_0:  If I'm an American journalist in Moscow, I'm-

02:25:03,426 --> 02:25:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  allowed in this secretive country.

02:25:06,178 --> 02:25:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  I'm in a- I'm the- I'm the guy!

02:25:09,026 --> 02:25:11,966
SPEAKER_0:  who's very privileged to have access.

02:25:12,418 --> 02:25:18,462
SPEAKER_0:  to live in Moscow and tell Americans, which were all fascinated about this new society, the future, what it's like.

02:25:18,786 --> 02:25:20,190
SPEAKER_0:  and as soon as I...

02:25:20,418 --> 02:25:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  Kinda.

02:25:21,506 --> 02:25:29,054
SPEAKER_0:  uh... start questioning the narrative i'm gonna get kicked out of humiliated very publicly it will well i thought you're in moscow what am i supposed to say

02:25:29,506 --> 02:25:31,262
SPEAKER_0:  So, you know, they...

02:25:31,554 --> 02:25:32,638
SPEAKER_0:  Eugene Lyons.

02:25:33,410 --> 02:25:38,014
SPEAKER_0:  was, you know, he's one of the heroes in the book. He was a young communist and I think he was United Press.

02:25:38,242 --> 02:25:39,774
SPEAKER_0:  he was working for, they sent him there.

02:25:40,194 --> 02:25:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  And when he went there, he's like, oh, this is not what I thought it was going to be like. This is horrible. And he's turned very heavily against it.

02:25:48,130 --> 02:25:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  but he talks about how

02:25:50,082 --> 02:25:51,998
SPEAKER_0:  they would write one thing.

02:25:52,450 --> 02:25:58,238
SPEAKER_0:  and say another thing and then think another thing. And each of those steps was just more and more like kind of lying.

02:25:58,594 --> 02:26:01,566
SPEAKER_0:  in terms of maintaining your sanity and maintaining your narrative.

02:26:02,498 --> 02:26:03,742
SPEAKER_1:  So you...

02:26:04,002 --> 02:26:05,278
SPEAKER_1:  reference an Apple bomb.

02:26:06,178 --> 02:26:14,782
SPEAKER_1:  and say that, quote, starvation was not simply a consequence, it was the goal and it was the law. Stalin intended to break the Ukrainians once and for all.

02:26:15,298 --> 02:26:20,382
SPEAKER_1:  It thus became common for villagers to spy and inform on one another, turning in a neighbor

02:26:20,642 --> 02:26:22,430
SPEAKER_1:  for having a sack of grain might be the...

02:26:22,786 --> 02:26:24,894
SPEAKER_1:  easiest and safest way to procure food.

02:26:25,250 --> 02:26:26,494
SPEAKER_1:  for one's family. Without using any of the

02:26:26,914 --> 02:26:27,422
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

02:26:29,314 --> 02:26:31,550
SPEAKER_1:  To what degree was this the intention?

02:26:32,258 --> 02:26:35,582
SPEAKER_1:  To what degree does Stalin anticipate this kind of

02:26:35,970 --> 02:26:38,686
SPEAKER_1:  suffering as a consequence of the collectivization.

02:26:39,010 --> 02:26:39,454
SPEAKER_1:  policy.

02:26:39,586 --> 02:26:43,774
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know that he intended the suffering to be a consequence of the collectivization.

02:26:44,226 --> 02:26:45,374
SPEAKER_0:  But he, it was.

02:26:46,050 --> 02:26:46,462
SPEAKER_0:  Quite.

02:26:47,618 --> 02:26:51,390
SPEAKER_0:  apparent and I think there's a pretty heavy consensus nowadays.

02:26:51,874 --> 02:26:54,238
SPEAKER_0:  that his goal was very much

02:26:54,722 --> 02:26:56,670
SPEAKER_0:  because Ukraine again.

02:26:56,898 --> 02:27:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  You know, resent to the czar and had this kind of very contentious relationship.

02:27:01,154 --> 02:27:02,078
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, with Russia.

02:27:02,434 --> 02:27:07,358
SPEAKER_0:  which obviously very clearly remains today. I mean, the hatred of Ukrainians for Russians proceeded.

02:27:07,618 --> 02:27:09,214
SPEAKER_0:  Putin's war, I mean...

02:27:09,762 --> 02:27:20,437
SPEAKER_0:  This is even when I was a kid, this, uh, you know, I obviously don't remember it, but my parents just told me like the hatred that they had and understandably, I mean, they're basically under foreign occupation. Uh, what they were going to support an occupation for.

02:27:20,437 --> 02:27:22,142
SPEAKER_1:  So your parents talked about a hatred.

02:27:22,658 --> 02:27:23,783
SPEAKER_1:  by Ukrainian stores Russian.

02:27:23,783 --> 02:27:24,446
SPEAKER_0:  Yo yes

02:27:24,834 --> 02:27:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  Oh yes.

02:27:25,538 --> 02:27:26,686
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I, you know.

02:27:28,674 --> 02:27:30,846
SPEAKER_1:  I certainly haven't visited there this year.

02:27:31,458 --> 02:27:35,742
SPEAKER_1:  because of the most recent invasion in February.

02:27:36,322 --> 02:27:37,278
SPEAKER_1:  that hatred.

02:27:37,826 --> 02:27:40,670
SPEAKER_1:  is nationwide and very intense.

02:27:41,218 --> 02:27:42,142
SPEAKER_1:  But I don't know.

02:27:42,434 --> 02:27:45,310
SPEAKER_1:  I think the feeling, the emotions were much more complex before.

02:27:45,794 --> 02:27:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  But at the same time, they were under occupation before, right? And they couldn't speak Ukrainian. They had to speak Russian.

02:27:51,266 --> 02:27:52,350
SPEAKER_0:  So this was a thing.

02:27:54,562 --> 02:27:55,687
SPEAKER_0:  but because of the force...

02:27:55,687 --> 02:27:56,798
SPEAKER_1:  intermixing.

02:27:58,530 --> 02:28:00,318
SPEAKER_1:  It's a more complex story.

02:28:00,418 --> 02:28:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  Okay.

02:28:01,538 --> 02:28:03,262
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, they weren't certainly fans.

02:28:05,026 --> 02:28:05,886
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, but there's...

02:28:06,754 --> 02:28:14,878
SPEAKER_1:  people that came from Russia, they're living there, they're marrying, they're falling in love, they're working with each other. So like there is the bigger atrocity of the genocide of it.

02:28:15,234 --> 02:28:16,638
SPEAKER_1:  but there's also the reality of...

02:28:16,994 --> 02:28:18,119
SPEAKER_1:  intermixing of the people.

02:28:18,119 --> 02:28:19,619
SPEAKER_0:  Well, sure. I mean, let's say.

02:28:19,619 --> 02:28:20,894
SPEAKER_1:  atrocity of slavery.

02:28:21,154 --> 02:28:22,142
SPEAKER_1:  in the United States.

02:28:22,498 --> 02:28:25,918
SPEAKER_1:  but then there's also a reality that there's now an intermixing of a

02:28:26,178 --> 02:28:30,654
SPEAKER_1:  of other peoples and they fall in love and they live after slavery is abolished.

02:28:31,010 --> 02:28:32,798
SPEAKER_1:  That's just the reality.

02:28:33,666 --> 02:28:35,294
SPEAKER_1:  after the genocide.,

02:28:36,130 --> 02:28:36,990
SPEAKER_1:  proceeds.

02:28:37,282 --> 02:28:38,302
SPEAKER_1:  a kind of.

02:28:38,658 --> 02:28:40,254
SPEAKER_1:  generational integration.

02:28:41,154 --> 02:28:45,406
SPEAKER_1:  that still remembers, like the suffering reverberates, but they're still...

02:28:46,050 --> 02:28:46,654
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:28:47,074 --> 02:28:48,606
SPEAKER_1:  It's a different culture that's created.

02:28:48,866 --> 02:28:49,534
SPEAKER_1:  And now...

02:28:49,922 --> 02:28:50,398
SPEAKER_1:  I think.

02:28:54,210 --> 02:28:55,838
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I have complex story.

02:28:56,098 --> 02:28:58,142
SPEAKER_1:  Most of my family is from Ukraine. So I have a

02:28:58,594 --> 02:28:59,070
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:28:59,298 --> 02:29:00,766
SPEAKER_1:  It's my understanding.

02:29:01,186 --> 02:29:03,038
SPEAKER_1:  is grounded in...

02:29:03,522 --> 02:29:04,478
SPEAKER_1:  Soviet Ukraine.

02:29:04,994 --> 02:29:05,886
SPEAKER_1:  But there is something...

02:29:06,370 --> 02:29:07,902
SPEAKER_1:  in the last 30 years.

02:29:08,162 --> 02:29:08,926
SPEAKER_1:  that's different.

02:29:09,410 --> 02:29:12,574
SPEAKER_1:  Where now, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, there's a true...

02:29:13,730 --> 02:29:15,710
SPEAKER_1:  maybe a renewed fight for independence.

02:29:15,970 --> 02:29:16,926
SPEAKER_1:  That's a different thing.

02:29:18,050 --> 02:29:21,310
SPEAKER_0:  But there's also a difference, like, you know, if I go to North Korea as an American.

02:29:21,634 --> 02:29:22,942
SPEAKER_0:  Right? They're very friendly.

02:29:23,202 --> 02:29:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  Now.

02:29:24,002 --> 02:29:25,950
SPEAKER_0:  Right? They don't perceive me.

02:29:26,434 --> 02:29:27,518
SPEAKER_0:  as part of the

02:29:28,098 --> 02:29:29,118
SPEAKER_0:  Yank devils.

02:29:29,570 --> 02:29:32,510
SPEAKER_0:  They're like, okay, you're an American, but you, you know, you come from America, so...

02:29:32,802 --> 02:29:35,646
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, there's going to be intermarriage, but that's the big difference between.

02:29:35,970 --> 02:29:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  perception of

02:29:37,186 --> 02:29:37,918
SPEAKER_0:  Russia.

02:29:38,498 --> 02:29:39,454
SPEAKER_0:  as an entity.

02:29:39,778 --> 02:29:41,822
SPEAKER_0:  as opposed to some individual Russians.

02:29:43,554 --> 02:29:46,174
SPEAKER_1:  I just, that wasn't the...

02:29:46,626 --> 02:29:50,366
SPEAKER_1:  the experience I've had talking to a lot of friends and family in Ukraine.

02:29:50,594 --> 02:29:51,719
SPEAKER_1:  until the war starts.

02:29:51,719 --> 02:29:55,678
SPEAKER_0:  Really? So they really didn't have this kind of low-key animosity toward Russians? No.

02:29:55,970 --> 02:29:56,894
SPEAKER_0:  There was a lot of.

02:29:57,314 --> 02:29:59,294
SPEAKER_1:  uh... factional conflict

02:30:00,258 --> 02:30:01,694
SPEAKER_1:  inside Ukraine. OK.

02:30:02,434 --> 02:30:07,102
SPEAKER_1:  Now the whole country is united. I think I think there's a clarity now

02:30:07,458 --> 02:30:08,798
SPEAKER_1:  The war gave a clarity.

02:30:09,954 --> 02:30:11,166
SPEAKER_0:  that wasn't there before.

02:30:11,586 --> 02:30:20,405
SPEAKER_0:  No, this is I was saying earlier how humans define themselves by opposition. So now that there's a war, it's like, okay, this all this little stuff doesn't matter. We are all united because we have a common enemy.

02:30:20,405 --> 02:30:22,750
SPEAKER_1:  But there's also, as you know, there's...

02:30:22,978 --> 02:30:24,030
SPEAKER_1:  regions and there's

02:30:24,802 --> 02:30:25,342
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:30:25,890 --> 02:30:31,230
SPEAKER_1:  There's just groups of different people that people, and then one of the big divides of course is the city versus rural.

02:30:31,490 --> 02:30:33,758
SPEAKER_1:  And then in the case of Ukraine, it's...

02:30:34,178 --> 02:30:36,190
SPEAKER_1:  Eastern Ukraine and Western Ukraine.

02:30:36,802 --> 02:30:38,462
SPEAKER_1:  It's very difficult to know what the truth is.

02:30:38,882 --> 02:30:41,534
SPEAKER_1:  because my personal experience is sampled. Right.

02:30:42,146 --> 02:30:47,230
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know how many Ukrainians I know, maybe like 30 or 40, before this trip, like 30 or 40.

02:30:47,490 --> 02:30:49,790
SPEAKER_1:  and then I'm close with just a handful.

02:30:50,978 --> 02:30:54,110
SPEAKER_1:  but then it's hard to know because you get a lot of western press perspective.

02:30:54,370 --> 02:30:57,950
SPEAKER_1:  and you get the Russian perspective and you get other perspectives. It's very hard to know.

02:30:58,370 --> 02:30:59,454
SPEAKER_1:  how much hate there is.

02:31:00,130 --> 02:31:00,510
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:31:00,770 --> 02:31:02,110
SPEAKER_1:  outside of this.

02:31:02,338 --> 02:31:03,006
SPEAKER_1:  conflict.

02:31:03,522 --> 02:31:06,782
SPEAKER_1:  My primary question is, and this is what I ask a lot of people when I...

02:31:07,042 --> 02:31:08,126
SPEAKER_1:  visited Ukraine as...

02:31:09,474 --> 02:31:12,670
SPEAKER_1:  Will you ever be able to forgive the Russians?

02:31:13,122 --> 02:31:14,750
SPEAKER_1:  And a lot of people said.

02:31:15,426 --> 02:31:16,254
SPEAKER_1:  uh... never

02:31:16,962 --> 02:31:17,342
SPEAKER_1:  Never.

02:31:17,762 --> 02:31:18,942
SPEAKER_1:  So this isn't just about.

02:31:19,170 --> 02:31:20,958
SPEAKER_1:  Assuming assuming we win

02:31:21,410 --> 02:31:22,046
SPEAKER_1:  they would say.

02:31:22,306 --> 02:31:24,862
SPEAKER_1:  Assuming we win, we still will not ever forgive.

02:31:25,954 --> 02:31:27,230
SPEAKER_1:  Never forgive.

02:31:27,490 --> 02:31:29,662
SPEAKER_1:  And they said it in a way where like...

02:31:30,562 --> 02:31:32,190
SPEAKER_1:  not only us but our children.

02:31:32,418 --> 02:31:33,118
SPEAKER_1:  never forgive.

02:31:33,858 --> 02:31:36,190
SPEAKER_1:  And it wasn't just, you know what, it wasn't just about.

02:31:36,418 --> 02:31:36,894
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

02:31:37,282 --> 02:31:39,006
SPEAKER_1:  Russia or the Russian leadership.

02:31:39,394 --> 02:31:40,830
SPEAKER_1:  is about the Russian people.

02:31:43,554 --> 02:31:43,998
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:31:44,514 --> 02:31:51,870
SPEAKER_1:  But a lot of people also said that this is our feeling currently, we understand. Like you're lost in the rage of war. Yeah.

02:31:52,706 --> 02:31:57,982
SPEAKER_0:  Because you lose so much. I mean, if you asked Americans, would you ever be friends with Germany or Japan? It'd be like, are you kidding?

02:31:58,434 --> 02:31:59,198
SPEAKER_0:  After Pearl Harbor?

02:32:00,034 --> 02:32:03,230
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, but of course most Americas didn't feel Pearl Harbor.

02:32:03,650 --> 02:32:04,542
SPEAKER_1:  is different.

02:32:05,410 --> 02:32:06,078
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:32:06,786 --> 02:32:09,406
SPEAKER_1:  It's a good point when it's your own land, but uh...

02:32:10,274 --> 02:32:10,974
SPEAKER_1:  What when?

02:32:11,266 --> 02:32:14,238
SPEAKER_1:  imagine was just pro-harbor but it was new york right

02:32:14,498 --> 02:32:16,190
SPEAKER_1:  and Chicago.

02:32:16,994 --> 02:32:20,798
SPEAKER_1:  and Dallas and all these cities being, being bombed. Yeah.

02:32:21,250 --> 02:32:21,598
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

02:32:26,338 --> 02:32:27,262
SPEAKER_1:  It's...

02:32:29,410 --> 02:32:31,870
SPEAKER_1:  just to linger on this war in Ukraine currently.

02:32:33,474 --> 02:32:37,598
SPEAKER_1:  Does it break your heart to see what's going on there now that it's in the same land?

02:32:38,114 --> 02:32:38,846
SPEAKER_1:  as

02:32:39,170 --> 02:32:40,254
SPEAKER_1:  The same series.

02:32:40,930 --> 02:32:44,222
SPEAKER_1:  The same stories are now brought back to the surface.

02:32:45,154 --> 02:32:46,750
SPEAKER_1:  to pit the generational pain.

02:32:47,362 --> 02:32:50,110
SPEAKER_1:  as it was in the time that you're writing about.

02:32:51,106 --> 02:32:52,670
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think it's a fundamentally different?

02:32:53,410 --> 02:32:58,718
SPEAKER_1:  country different war different situation or does it do you see here echoes of the same.

02:32:59,170 --> 02:33:03,198
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think it's the same because I think there is.

02:33:04,162 --> 02:33:06,974
SPEAKER_0:  no one, I mean, there is no one.

02:33:07,746 --> 02:33:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  Pooh.

02:33:08,802 --> 02:33:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  is like, I'm glad this is happening to the Ukrainian people.

02:33:11,970 --> 02:33:12,350
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

02:33:12,706 --> 02:33:13,310
SPEAKER_0:  So even.

02:33:13,826 --> 02:33:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  people who are for.

02:33:15,138 --> 02:33:16,734
SPEAKER_0:  Putin and for the invasion.

02:33:17,186 --> 02:33:19,966
SPEAKER_0:  and whatever justification they might have for his war.

02:33:21,058 --> 02:33:24,702
SPEAKER_0:  No one is like, yeah, let's get those darn Ukrainians.

02:33:25,026 --> 02:33:28,830
SPEAKER_0:  I think there was that sense in America after 9-11.

02:33:29,346 --> 02:33:31,102
SPEAKER_0:  when we invade Afghanistan.

02:33:31,330 --> 02:33:35,070
SPEAKER_0:  and Iraq and there was like F those Iraqis F those Afghan people.

02:33:35,586 --> 02:33:36,094
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:33:36,386 --> 02:33:37,342
SPEAKER_0:  Whereas now...

02:33:38,178 --> 02:33:41,726
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's completely the opposite. I also think a lot of-

02:33:42,114 --> 02:33:43,806
SPEAKER_0:  Russians, I'm sure if I ask them.

02:33:44,354 --> 02:33:44,830
SPEAKER_0:  They're not.

02:33:45,186 --> 02:33:50,142
SPEAKER_0:  thinking like, let's wipe the Ukrainian people off the map. I think whatever reasons they have, it's not.

02:33:50,754 --> 02:33:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  kind of going after this. Even if you have to kind of rile up people against the citizenry, it's not to that level.

02:33:56,226 --> 02:33:56,734
SPEAKER_0:  of

02:33:57,026 --> 02:33:58,238
SPEAKER_0:  The H of the Coolox.

02:33:58,722 --> 02:33:59,838
SPEAKER_0:  uh... hatred of

02:34:00,098 --> 02:34:02,119
SPEAKER_0:  of those villages.

02:34:02,119 --> 02:34:03,550
SPEAKER_1:  There's still a belief though.

02:34:04,002 --> 02:34:08,254
SPEAKER_1:  amongst the soldiers outside the big cities, their belief that the Ukrainian people

02:34:08,930 --> 02:34:11,582
SPEAKER_1:  who the Russian soldiers believe are their brothers and sisters.

02:34:11,906 --> 02:34:13,662
SPEAKER_1:  are occupied by an evil regime.

02:34:14,018 --> 02:34:15,893
SPEAKER_1:  Okay, so you need to save them from the evil of...

02:34:15,893 --> 02:34:17,982
SPEAKER_0:  regime. That's also very different from

02:34:18,274 --> 02:34:19,742
SPEAKER_0:  Yes. So tomorrow morningק he said he wanted to another morning?

02:34:20,098 --> 02:34:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  And also...

02:34:21,442 --> 02:34:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  There is...

02:34:22,722 --> 02:34:24,190
SPEAKER_0:  dispute in the press.

02:34:24,706 --> 02:34:25,182
SPEAKER_0:  about.

02:34:25,570 --> 02:34:26,238
SPEAKER_0:  causes.

02:34:26,562 --> 02:34:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  consequences, the victims, the villains of...

02:34:30,210 --> 02:34:30,974
SPEAKER_0:  Putin's war.

02:34:31,362 --> 02:34:32,606
SPEAKER_0:  But when it came to this...

02:34:33,218 --> 02:34:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  No one is denying.

02:34:35,554 --> 02:34:37,022
SPEAKER_0:  that the war is happening.

02:34:37,282 --> 02:34:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  The New York Times isn't saying.

02:34:39,330 --> 02:34:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  Everything is fine.

02:34:40,994 --> 02:34:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  And the only reason people are saying it's a problem is because they hate.

02:34:44,898 --> 02:34:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  Putin or the H. Zulinski. That's not a thing.

02:34:47,554 --> 02:34:49,726
SPEAKER_0:  and the fact that we have so much footage.

02:34:50,338 --> 02:34:59,678
SPEAKER_0:  of what's happening in Ukraine. And you know, you have, it takes two seconds to go on Google and you have a map of, you know, Russian advancement.

02:35:00,034 --> 02:35:02,942
SPEAKER_0:  parts of the occupying, what parts are not under the control.

02:35:03,202 --> 02:35:07,358
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, you know, I did a little live stream. I raised money for Ukrainian refugees.

02:35:07,586 --> 02:35:10,526
SPEAKER_0:  to feed them because that's my concern, is just keeping people fed.

02:35:10,946 --> 02:35:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:35:11,618 --> 02:35:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  There was none of that, you know, and, and, uh, the, the two people who kind of spoke the truth, Gareth Jones was shot, I think, the day.

02:35:19,842 --> 02:35:22,686
SPEAKER_0:  before his 30th birthday while he was on...

02:35:23,106 --> 02:35:25,566
SPEAKER_0:  uncovering news, I think it was in Mongolia.

02:35:25,954 --> 02:35:26,846
SPEAKER_0:  Malcolm Margaridge.

02:35:27,138 --> 02:35:29,662
SPEAKER_0:  had problem finding work when he exposed this.

02:35:30,114 --> 02:35:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and I think the, like we was talking about earlier, the ubiquity.

02:35:34,786 --> 02:35:36,830
SPEAKER_0:  of things like cell phones and camera phones.

02:35:37,282 --> 02:35:39,262
SPEAKER_0:  uh... would make something like this

02:35:39,906 --> 02:35:43,198
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know, I wouldn't say an impossibility, they could still do it.

02:35:43,618 --> 02:35:45,502
SPEAKER_0:  but it would be really hard.

02:35:45,922 --> 02:35:47,262
SPEAKER_0:  to cover it up.

02:35:47,650 --> 02:35:48,062
SPEAKER_1:  Well...

02:35:48,322 --> 02:35:48,670
SPEAKER_1:  Sir.

02:35:48,898 --> 02:35:51,582
SPEAKER_1:  Push back on that if you just look at Iran.

02:35:52,514 --> 02:35:58,206
SPEAKER_1:  I would draw a different side. I agree with you mostly, but I would also draw a different distinction when the atrocity is happening.

02:35:58,466 --> 02:35:58,878
SPEAKER_1:  to.

02:36:00,258 --> 02:36:06,558
SPEAKER_1:  your own people versus there's a war you crane is a sovereign independent nation there's now a war between two nations

02:36:06,850 --> 02:36:10,302
SPEAKER_1:  It feels like it's easier for journalists to somehow reveal the truth in that.

02:36:10,786 --> 02:36:13,502
SPEAKER_1:  when atrocities happen within the Soviet Union.

02:36:13,858 --> 02:36:15,966
SPEAKER_1:  for some reason that's easier to hide.

02:36:16,546 --> 02:36:23,166
SPEAKER_1:  that's easier for journalists to deceive themselves and easier for the authoritarian leader to hide the information. I think I agree with you. And so that's...

02:36:23,426 --> 02:36:24,318
SPEAKER_1:  That's the dark.

02:36:24,546 --> 02:36:27,582
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, that's why people maybe, maybe you can.

02:36:28,258 --> 02:36:30,974
SPEAKER_1:  educate me on this, but this is why I think.

02:36:33,122 --> 02:36:34,782
SPEAKER_1:  people don't talk about uh...

02:36:35,490 --> 02:36:36,126
SPEAKER_1:  or more.

02:36:36,514 --> 02:36:39,358
SPEAKER_1:  and other atrocities, the greatly forward.

02:36:40,002 --> 02:36:41,790
SPEAKER_1:  Because it's inside the country. Yep.

02:36:42,146 --> 02:36:44,286
SPEAKER_1:  versus the Holocaust that's part of a war.

02:36:45,154 --> 02:36:46,206
SPEAKER_1:  What? Why is that?

02:36:46,594 --> 02:36:47,550
SPEAKER_1:  that we...

02:36:50,146 --> 02:36:51,550
SPEAKER_1:  The word too almost like

02:36:51,906 --> 02:36:52,254
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

02:36:52,642 --> 02:36:59,550
SPEAKER_1:  afraid to polite to what is it that we don't want to cover the atrocities because side the country gets their business

02:36:59,874 --> 02:37:01,749
SPEAKER_1:  so we don't want to touch it. I don't get it.

02:37:01,749 --> 02:37:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  What is it? I think it's that-

02:37:03,778 --> 02:37:05,758
SPEAKER_0:  what we refer to as the news.

02:37:06,274 --> 02:37:08,510
SPEAKER_0:  is in the business of selling narratives, right?

02:37:09,026 --> 02:37:13,374
SPEAKER_0:  And the narrative of the Holocaust is a very powerful one, which is

02:37:13,666 --> 02:37:15,166
SPEAKER_0:  If you let hatred

02:37:15,586 --> 02:37:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  of a subgroup in a population.

02:37:18,946 --> 02:37:20,158
SPEAKER_0:  Get out of control.

02:37:20,546 --> 02:37:22,206
SPEAKER_0:  This is the ultimate.

02:37:22,530 --> 02:37:25,854
SPEAKER_0:  consequence and this is something that we all have to be scared of.

02:37:26,178 --> 02:37:28,670
SPEAKER_0:  and do everything in our power to avoid in the future for any.

02:37:28,930 --> 02:37:31,870
SPEAKER_0:  group. Whereas what's the narrative of

02:37:32,578 --> 02:37:33,342
SPEAKER_0:  The Hollidahmore.

02:37:33,570 --> 02:37:46,590
SPEAKER_0:  Sometimes governments kill their own citizens. There's nothing you could do about it. There's nothing we, I mean, they wouldn't have let us send food. They wouldn't acknowledge, like the newspapers, even Russia weren't acknowledging it. Like, what's the, like, this is some of the issues I had.

02:37:46,818 --> 02:37:50,078
SPEAKER_0:  with regard to trying to advocate for the North Korean people.

02:37:50,338 --> 02:37:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  The reporters would be like, well, what can I do as an American? It's a very natural question. And I'm like, I don't know. I like, all I know is how to speak.

02:37:58,210 --> 02:37:59,294
SPEAKER_0:  to what is happening.

02:37:59,522 --> 02:38:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  But in terms of next steps, I don't have a good answer for you. So that is where.

02:38:03,874 --> 02:38:05,086
SPEAKER_0:  the news kind of-

02:38:05,346 --> 02:38:06,430
SPEAKER_0:  does break down.

02:38:06,722 --> 02:38:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  If there isn't a story or a call to action.

02:38:10,242 --> 02:38:12,062
SPEAKER_0:  the kind of you're kind of almost like.

02:38:12,354 --> 02:38:16,030
SPEAKER_0:  having a movie with a cliffhanger and there's no sequel, it's like, what am I supposed to do here?

02:38:16,258 --> 02:38:27,230
SPEAKER_0:  Like this is not scratching that itch, which for me, as a consumer of news, you know, a layman is like, okay, here's the story. There was a bad guy and the cop shot him or they took him to jail and now the bad guys caught.

02:38:27,490 --> 02:38:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  Beginning middle end.

02:38:28,610 --> 02:38:30,494
SPEAKER_0:  Here it's just like, Mal did this.

02:38:30,850 --> 02:38:34,078
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of people were executed and starved, isn't that awful?

02:38:34,434 --> 02:38:41,118
SPEAKER_0:  well, and now still in power now Richard Nixon is raising a toast to him like that story is just like, how am I supposed to feel about this?

02:38:42,114 --> 02:38:47,518
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it feels like when there's tanks and there's war and this military conflict, then I'm-

02:38:47,746 --> 02:38:49,950
SPEAKER_1:  It's more actionable. You can cover it. Yeah.

02:38:50,178 --> 02:38:52,318
SPEAKER_1:  And it did seem like Nazi Germany.

02:38:52,578 --> 02:38:58,078
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if the Holocaust was the thing that made it most coverable. I think it was that this is a threat to the entire.

02:38:59,010 --> 02:39:02,686
SPEAKER_1:  Well, yeah, we were at war with them, yeah. That's what makes a cover wall in-

02:39:03,074 --> 02:39:05,406
SPEAKER_1:  if the Holocaust was happening just inside the country.

02:39:05,858 --> 02:39:06,654
SPEAKER_1:  inside of Germany.

02:39:08,258 --> 02:39:10,174
SPEAKER_1:  or even if it didn't expand beyond Poland.

02:39:11,554 --> 02:39:20,030
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, it would be like a footnote. It wasn't in many ways a footnote. Like many of the early steps toward it was like they didn't cover it. It's just like, all right, they're being oppressive toward their own people, okay.

02:39:20,258 --> 02:39:21,598
SPEAKER_1:  especially given some of the

02:39:22,434 --> 02:39:24,094
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe if you negotiate certain

02:39:24,514 --> 02:39:28,574
SPEAKER_1:  peace treaties with the Soviet Union and with Germany. Your two, uh, the basic-

02:39:28,898 --> 02:39:30,238
SPEAKER_1:  to pacifist imperative.

02:39:31,554 --> 02:39:32,766
SPEAKER_1:  Oh boy.

02:39:34,306 --> 02:39:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  Sorry, Santa.

02:39:37,250 --> 02:39:39,518
SPEAKER_1:  So we say every time you masturbate.

02:39:40,578 --> 02:39:40,894
SPEAKER_1:  No.

02:39:41,474 --> 02:39:42,270
SPEAKER_1:  after you're done.

02:39:42,594 --> 02:39:43,422
SPEAKER_1:  You know, I'm sorry.

02:39:43,746 --> 02:39:44,318
SPEAKER_1:  Fuck that.

02:39:44,930 --> 02:39:45,406
SPEAKER_1:  Alright.

02:39:46,114 --> 02:39:51,646
SPEAKER_1:  Now see, I hate it when you don't yes and because it leaves me in a hole I dug for myself.

02:39:52,802 --> 02:39:53,502
SPEAKER_1:  Um,

02:39:53,858 --> 02:39:55,966
SPEAKER_1:  and I sit there in a hole.

02:39:57,314 --> 02:39:58,366
SPEAKER_1:  in my sadness.

02:39:59,682 --> 02:40:05,854
SPEAKER_1:  How long have you been writing this book? I mean, how long? Two years. Mentally, it was like two years since you spent time with it. But, um...

02:40:06,594 --> 02:40:07,719
SPEAKER_0:  No, almost three.

02:40:07,719 --> 02:40:08,318
SPEAKER_1:  half, yeah.

02:40:09,122 --> 02:40:12,766
SPEAKER_1:  And I suppose it stages you much longer, like you said, your family.

02:40:14,306 --> 02:40:17,214
SPEAKER_1:  So in many ways, this is a book you've been writing your whole life.

02:40:17,794 --> 02:40:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  I think that's fair that all my work's been leading to this, yeah.

02:40:21,090 --> 02:40:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  It's certainly the most, in my opinion, the most important thing I've done.

02:40:25,474 --> 02:40:26,718
SPEAKER_1:  What stands out to you?

02:40:27,298 --> 02:40:28,510
SPEAKER_1:  about Hollermore.

02:40:29,218 --> 02:40:30,046
SPEAKER_1:  What moments?

02:40:30,338 --> 02:40:32,574
SPEAKER_1:  What aspects of human nature stand out to you?

02:40:35,810 --> 02:40:40,862
SPEAKER_0:  I don't know. I think that story is, I don't want to say story, but I mean like that incident.

02:40:41,570 --> 02:40:42,366
SPEAKER_0:  is...

02:40:43,074 --> 02:40:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, I was familiar with it before.

02:40:44,898 --> 02:40:49,790
SPEAKER_0:  You know what I mean? So I kind of knew about it, you know, in part, thanks to kind of the North Korean work.

02:40:50,114 --> 02:40:50,558
SPEAKER_0:  And it.

02:40:50,786 --> 02:40:52,414
SPEAKER_0:  coming from Ukraine.

02:40:52,930 --> 02:40:55,230
SPEAKER_0:  Um, the thing that was also.

02:40:55,490 --> 02:40:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  kind of insane about it is that they were taking all this grain.

02:40:59,202 --> 02:41:03,486
SPEAKER_0:  and not using it even to feed the Russian people. They were selling it for export for hard currency.

02:41:03,906 --> 02:41:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:41:05,666 --> 02:41:06,558
SPEAKER_0:  I think...

02:41:06,818 --> 02:41:07,774
SPEAKER_0:  W-what?

02:41:08,258 --> 02:41:09,662
SPEAKER_0:  The takeaway there.

02:41:10,498 --> 02:41:14,846
SPEAKER_0:  And I think, again, this is something Westerners and especially Americans don't appreciate.

02:41:15,522 --> 02:41:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  They think that evil often has...

02:41:20,290 --> 02:41:21,406
SPEAKER_0:  Like a logic to it?

02:41:22,082 --> 02:41:22,622
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

02:41:23,010 --> 02:41:28,094
SPEAKER_0:  And it's like, why would, like, because it makes no sense to them, like, why would they kill their own people?

02:41:28,802 --> 02:41:33,918
SPEAKER_0:  Therefore, it probably didn't happen. Right? There's that thing. They really think like, okay,

02:41:34,530 --> 02:41:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  They can understand, you know, country A, country B.

02:41:39,202 --> 02:41:44,126
SPEAKER_0:  You slaughter as a bunch of people country B as a means of conquest. Like that kind of makes sense to them. They know that thing.

02:41:44,514 --> 02:41:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  But like.

02:41:45,506 --> 02:41:46,302
SPEAKER_0:  Why you-

02:41:46,562 --> 02:41:50,750
SPEAKER_0:  starving all these people, like what are you gaining out of it? That doesn't make sense?

02:41:51,042 --> 02:41:54,014
SPEAKER_0:  to them and because it doesn't make sense, there's kind of like, well...

02:41:54,338 --> 02:41:56,350
SPEAKER_0:  It's probably more of this story that I'm hearing and.

02:41:56,930 --> 02:42:00,798
SPEAKER_0:  A lot of times there's not, it's just like evil for the sake of power.

02:42:01,314 --> 02:42:02,750
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and.

02:42:03,330 --> 02:42:04,958
SPEAKER_0:  We don't really have that.

02:42:05,410 --> 02:42:07,326
SPEAKER_0:  certainly anywhere near that scale.

02:42:07,746 --> 02:42:08,830
SPEAKER_0:  and never have.

02:42:09,378 --> 02:42:15,326
SPEAKER_0:  Um, certainly, you know, since, since, since America, uh, has been a thing, I mean, it's, it's.

02:42:15,874 --> 02:42:20,350
SPEAKER_0:  It's—and the fact that this is, like, the 30s, you know what I mean? This isn't that long ago.

02:42:21,026 --> 02:42:23,550
SPEAKER_0:  But I think also the narrative.

02:42:23,906 --> 02:42:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  in some ways is

02:42:26,082 --> 02:42:26,782
SPEAKER_0:  How?

02:42:28,610 --> 02:42:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  You know, technology is also something that kind of people have mixed feelings about.

02:42:32,706 --> 02:42:36,286
SPEAKER_0:  I think like I said this before and this is something I really believe very strongly.

02:42:36,898 --> 02:42:40,638
SPEAKER_0:  the ability of information to be captured and spread easily.

02:42:41,090 --> 02:42:43,230
SPEAKER_0:  is such an effective tool.

02:42:43,682 --> 02:42:44,894
SPEAKER_0:  in exposing.

02:42:45,538 --> 02:42:46,078
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:42:46,914 --> 02:42:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  humanity at its worst.

02:42:48,834 --> 02:42:52,126
SPEAKER_0:  Because it's one thing if I sit here and tell you...

02:42:52,770 --> 02:42:54,558
SPEAKER_0:  what I saw in these villages.

02:42:54,882 --> 02:42:57,438
SPEAKER_0:  It's another thing where I sat you down and showed you a YouTube.

02:42:57,794 --> 02:43:01,502
SPEAKER_0:  And you and I don't know what it's like to look in the eyes of someone who's...

02:43:01,762 --> 02:43:03,838
SPEAKER_0:  thinking about kill eating their own kids.

02:43:04,290 --> 02:43:05,790
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, and you see that face.

02:43:06,402 --> 02:43:08,286
SPEAKER_0:  and you know it's, you know, not something some...

02:43:08,546 --> 02:43:10,942
SPEAKER_0:  CGI, it will haunt you forever.

02:43:13,026 --> 02:43:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  Just looking at the different mechanisms that made all of this happen. So this is not just one guy, Stalin, having a policy.

02:43:19,362 --> 02:43:20,478
SPEAKER_1:  There's a whole system.

02:43:22,530 --> 02:43:24,574
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, one of it is just a system of fear.

02:43:25,410 --> 02:43:27,198
SPEAKER_1:  But how do you implement that system of fear?

02:43:28,098 --> 02:43:29,223
SPEAKER_1:  Well, what- There's a giant-

02:43:29,223 --> 02:43:30,782
SPEAKER_0:  bureaucracy of fear.

02:43:31,074 --> 02:43:33,918
SPEAKER_0:  So what he implemented with the Great Terror.

02:43:34,466 --> 02:43:37,150
SPEAKER_1:  is that's in the 30s in the late 30s.

02:43:37,250 --> 02:43:40,926
SPEAKER_0:  It's throughout the 30s, but yeah, it starts in the...

02:43:41,410 --> 02:43:42,814
SPEAKER_0:  mid to late 30s.

02:43:43,490 --> 02:43:48,382
SPEAKER_0:  Basically, you know, communism was based on the common good and the public good.

02:43:48,834 --> 02:43:50,846
SPEAKER_0:  and anything private, which was bourgeois.

02:43:51,170 --> 02:43:53,054
SPEAKER_0:  was a problem when they were started.

02:43:53,378 --> 02:43:56,190
SPEAKER_0:  you know, when the revolution came, the October Revolution.

02:43:56,418 --> 02:43:58,622
SPEAKER_0:  They wanted to recreate society entirely.

02:43:59,010 --> 02:44:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  And that included like, okay, let's make it so.

02:44:02,978 --> 02:44:09,214
SPEAKER_0:  uh... everyone eats in the cafeteria so that eating by themselves less design buildings everyone has to share bathrooms

02:44:09,442 --> 02:44:17,502
SPEAKER_0:  Like their whole plan was to eliminate any kind of concept of privacy at all. They also had this bizarre kind of radical idea of like...

02:44:17,762 --> 02:44:18,782
SPEAKER_0:  attacking shame.

02:44:19,106 --> 02:44:23,966
SPEAKER_0:  So many of these, you know, before the 1917 people were also very involved, like free love.

02:44:24,322 --> 02:44:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, cause the idea of like having this private bond between husband and wife was also bourgeois and old fashioned. And you know, we're

02:44:30,338 --> 02:44:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  the society of the future that-

02:44:32,194 --> 02:44:39,678
SPEAKER_0:  changed relatively quickly, but they were talking about things like raising kids communally, uh, and, and so on and so forth. So for Stalin,

02:44:40,450 --> 02:44:41,886
SPEAKER_0:  If you and I are friends...

02:44:42,594 --> 02:44:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  We have a bond. That's a threat.

02:44:44,674 --> 02:44:46,494
SPEAKER_0:  to him, the family's a threat.

02:44:46,786 --> 02:44:55,486
SPEAKER_0:  the, any kind of organization is a threat because it's a power center that is, uh, not between a relationship between you and him. And now you have a relationship with somebody else.

02:44:55,842 --> 02:44:58,366
SPEAKER_0:  So he systemically...

02:44:59,170 --> 02:45:01,054
SPEAKER_0:  went through that whole society.

02:45:01,634 --> 02:45:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:45:02,434 --> 02:45:03,582
SPEAKER_0:  you know, it became.

02:45:04,034 --> 02:45:05,950
SPEAKER_0:  There are certain things that became a crime.

02:45:06,242 --> 02:45:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  Then it became a crime to be a spouse.

02:45:08,802 --> 02:45:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  of the enemy of the people.

02:45:10,338 --> 02:45:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  Now right away.

02:45:11,682 --> 02:45:17,150
SPEAKER_0:  I as a child become an orphan because my dad was an enemy of the people, my mom is married to many of the people.

02:45:17,698 --> 02:45:21,790
SPEAKER_0:  Now I don't have parents, they get arrested or executed or whatever, but now—

02:45:22,114 --> 02:45:25,182
SPEAKER_0:  I have nowhere to go, but I can't go to my friend's house.

02:45:25,410 --> 02:45:28,382
SPEAKER_0:  because their family doesn't want to take in a child at the enemy of the people.

02:45:28,802 --> 02:45:30,974
SPEAKER_0:  Um, you had this culture.

02:45:31,266 --> 02:45:34,910
SPEAKER_0:  where everyone was very much encouraged to turn people in.

02:45:35,330 --> 02:45:37,342
SPEAKER_0:  And if you turn, if you're arrested.

02:45:37,954 --> 02:45:39,006
SPEAKER_0:  You know, I'm tortured.

02:45:39,490 --> 02:45:41,374
SPEAKER_0:  You're like, okay, who are your accomplices?

02:45:41,762 --> 02:45:44,094
SPEAKER_0:  and now you just gotta name names people you knew.

02:45:44,450 --> 02:45:48,190
SPEAKER_0:  And then it becomes this whole chain and it's like, how am I going to protest my innocence?

02:45:48,450 --> 02:45:49,246
SPEAKER_0:  If Lex.

02:45:49,570 --> 02:45:50,270
SPEAKER_0:  just said.

02:45:50,498 --> 02:45:50,910
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

02:45:51,170 --> 02:45:51,550
SPEAKER_0:  I-

02:45:51,842 --> 02:45:54,750
SPEAKER_0:  uh... worked with michael and we were working with trotsky it's

02:45:55,074 --> 02:46:04,734
SPEAKER_0:  And we were plotting to overthrow Stalin. Lex testified to this. He signed a confession. What am I supposed to do now? Right. So it worked its way in a most viral fashion.

02:46:05,122 --> 02:46:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  through the whole society. There was a

02:46:07,330 --> 02:46:08,734
SPEAKER_0:  amazing moment where

02:46:09,442 --> 02:46:12,158
SPEAKER_0:  Poor people, peasants, because obviously the powerless are often-

02:46:12,514 --> 02:46:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  going to be caught in the web. They were going to jail for being Trotskyites.

02:46:16,866 --> 02:46:19,006
SPEAKER_0:  I try and they have to ask themselves what's a tractorist.

02:46:19,330 --> 02:46:20,926
SPEAKER_0:  Like they didn't even know who Trotsky was.

02:46:21,474 --> 02:46:23,230
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, and the thing, other thing is...

02:46:23,682 --> 02:46:29,022
SPEAKER_0:  Ethnicity was a problem, right? If you were an ethnicity, you have more power with...

02:46:29,602 --> 02:46:33,278
SPEAKER_0:  other members of that ethnicity than you have with this kind of broader Soviet culture.

02:46:33,570 --> 02:46:33,886
SPEAKER_0:  So.

02:46:34,146 --> 02:46:36,702
SPEAKER_0:  He would just deport entire populations.

02:46:37,090 --> 02:46:39,198
SPEAKER_0:  from their ancestral lands to other parts.

02:46:39,426 --> 02:46:44,030
SPEAKER_0:  A to spread the population around, but also to break that link between the people's.

02:46:44,322 --> 02:46:47,710
SPEAKER_0:  and their lands, there was this 1937 NKVD order.

02:46:48,066 --> 02:46:49,886
SPEAKER_0:  against Polish people where it's just like

02:46:50,242 --> 02:46:52,382
SPEAKER_0:  if you had come from Poland or had a...

02:46:52,898 --> 02:46:54,366
SPEAKER_0:  been just this whole list?

02:46:54,690 --> 02:46:56,990
SPEAKER_0:  And basically people were being arrested because they had

02:46:57,730 --> 02:47:00,926
SPEAKER_0:  Polish last names and I think it was a million people?

02:47:01,314 --> 02:47:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  were killed at like some astronomical number.

02:47:04,002 --> 02:47:08,190
SPEAKER_0:  So there was this anything that was a bond.

02:47:08,738 --> 02:47:14,206
SPEAKER_0:  was a threat to him and it went systemically. So after he had all these kind of-

02:47:14,466 --> 02:47:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  executions of people who were like Lenin's people, the old Bolsheviks.

02:47:18,082 --> 02:47:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  Then he went after, he started arresting the secret police.

02:47:21,442 --> 02:47:22,814
SPEAKER_0:  You know, he arrested all the cops.

02:47:23,042 --> 02:47:30,878
SPEAKER_0:  he arrested all the judges and all these prisoners got to see the judges who yelled at them for being counter revolutionaries and spies. Now they were in the jails.

02:47:31,138 --> 02:47:40,638
SPEAKER_0:  If you were a foreigner, if there was a huge push from the Soviet Union toward African-Americans, right? Cause they're like, look, you were living in a racist country. Here we have.

02:47:40,866 --> 02:47:41,918
SPEAKER_0:  No, um...

02:47:43,202 --> 02:47:46,622
SPEAKER_0:  racial inequality come come live here a bunch of them went

02:47:46,850 --> 02:47:47,966
SPEAKER_0:  and they were all vanished.

02:47:48,258 --> 02:47:54,654
SPEAKER_0:  You know, anyone who knew information about the outside world, if you're a foreigner, Andre Babel, I forget his first name.

02:47:55,010 --> 02:48:03,582
SPEAKER_0:  He had a French writer he was friends with. He was arrested and shot cause he's a spy. Cause you're friends with Melrose. And if you, that means if you're a foreigner, you're a spy speaking Esperanto.

02:48:03,874 --> 02:48:13,790
SPEAKER_0:  became a crime. Having a pen pal. Literally anything that was some kind of chain between yourself and someone else was a threat and was grounds for arrest. It was.

02:48:14,178 --> 02:48:15,742
SPEAKER_0:  uh... the russians would joke

02:48:16,514 --> 02:48:21,662
SPEAKER_0:  about how relieved they would be if someone knocked on your door in the middle of the night to tell you your house was on fire.

02:48:22,146 --> 02:48:24,254
SPEAKER_0:  because it wasn't the NKVD coming to rescue.

02:48:24,770 --> 02:48:27,166
SPEAKER_1:  And of course, most of the accusations probably.

02:48:27,394 --> 02:48:28,510
SPEAKER_1:  or completely false.

02:48:28,898 --> 02:48:31,070
SPEAKER_1:  So not only could you not do all of those things.

02:48:31,810 --> 02:48:32,382
SPEAKER_1:  You

02:48:33,346 --> 02:48:35,390
SPEAKER_1:  were also a victim of just.

02:48:35,586 --> 02:48:41,310
SPEAKER_0:  Being late to work became a felony and also not doing your job became a felony because now you're taking

02:48:42,242 --> 02:48:46,366
SPEAKER_0:  food or product away from the people and you're supposed to be there working for the people.

02:48:46,818 --> 02:48:52,510
SPEAKER_0:  There's this one story, which, you know, I was doing the audio book and this is like I still trying to get through without crying.

02:48:52,866 --> 02:48:59,774
SPEAKER_0:  This was 1920. They were a bunch of kids in Moscow who were pickpockets between ages 11 and 15. They rounded them up.

02:49:00,130 --> 02:49:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  And they're like, all right, point out your accomplices. And they would take them in the trams and you have to point out people. Then they would take them back to the cellar, beat the crap out of these children.

02:49:09,890 --> 02:49:15,358
SPEAKER_0:  And then they take them out again. And if they didn't point out to anybody, they beat them. They're like, all right. So they just start pointing at random.

02:49:15,682 --> 02:49:18,942
SPEAKER_0:  And the thing that was really sick about this story, if that wasn't sick enough...

02:49:19,426 --> 02:49:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  Is that the screams?

02:49:21,538 --> 02:49:28,894
SPEAKER_0:  that the other criminals, the adult hardened criminals had to hear from these children as they realized they were being taken back to the cellar. It was just...

02:49:29,442 --> 02:49:30,078
SPEAKER_0:  horrifying

02:49:33,154 --> 02:49:34,750
SPEAKER_1:  and they so they

02:49:35,170 --> 02:49:38,238
SPEAKER_1:  They tortured people, they tortured confessions out of people.

02:49:38,946 --> 02:49:39,774
SPEAKER_1:  at scale.

02:49:40,034 --> 02:49:40,894
SPEAKER_1:  Oh yeah.

02:49:41,634 --> 02:49:42,046
SPEAKER_1:  and

02:49:42,786 --> 02:49:44,990
SPEAKER_1:  The dark aspect of this is it's all...

02:49:46,050 --> 02:49:47,006
SPEAKER_1:  It's like this weird.

02:49:47,522 --> 02:49:52,318
SPEAKER_1:  It's a bureaucracy of torture. Yes. So like, it's not like that there's.

02:49:54,018 --> 02:49:56,382
SPEAKER_1:  What is it? The torturer is afraid of-

02:49:57,698 --> 02:50:00,126
SPEAKER_1:  Like does it so that he doesn't become the prisoner.

02:50:00,546 --> 02:50:06,366
SPEAKER_0:  Right. Because then it's like, oh, you couldn't get a confession out of him. Are you an enemy that people know as well?

02:50:06,626 --> 02:50:08,318
SPEAKER_0:  and the thing that was even crazier.

02:50:08,674 --> 02:50:11,646
SPEAKER_0:  is that a lot of these interrogators were frustrated.

02:50:11,938 --> 02:50:12,958
SPEAKER_0:  Cause they're like, look.

02:50:13,570 --> 02:50:15,134
SPEAKER_0:  We both know you're innocent.

02:50:15,618 --> 02:50:19,070
SPEAKER_0:  just signed this confession to make my life easier. they knew it was crap.

02:50:19,330 --> 02:50:21,406
SPEAKER_0:  Stalin joked about Stalin

02:50:21,890 --> 02:50:24,062
SPEAKER_0:  joked about this. This is one of his little jokes.

02:50:24,418 --> 02:50:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  There was a kid.

02:50:25,922 --> 02:50:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  uh, who was arrested.

02:50:27,458 --> 02:50:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  And he was said, oh, it was forced to say, you wrote Eugene O'Nagin, which is a play. It goes, that play was by Pushkin.

02:50:35,170 --> 02:50:36,926
SPEAKER_0:  and they tortured him and they tortured him and tortured him.

02:50:37,218 --> 02:50:38,878
SPEAKER_0:  and then his parents are walking down the street.

02:50:39,138 --> 02:50:44,350
SPEAKER_0:  and they run into a secret police and they go, congratulations. And they go for what? Your son wrote Eugene and Egan.

02:50:44,738 --> 02:50:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  like he admitted to it last night like it's just like they could get you to say anything and what else was really really sick

02:50:51,266 --> 02:50:52,350
SPEAKER_0:  which they understood.

02:50:52,738 --> 02:50:58,526
SPEAKER_0:  is they lower the death penalty for kids, I think, to either 14 or 12. I don't remember the top of my head.

02:50:59,106 --> 02:51:02,174
SPEAKER_0:  and what Stalin's head of the secret police did.

02:51:02,434 --> 02:51:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  is when you were interrogating someone, they would, you either had to have.

02:51:06,850 --> 02:51:08,894
SPEAKER_0:  some of that family members.

02:51:09,474 --> 02:51:10,206
SPEAKER_0:  uh um

02:51:10,466 --> 02:51:11,550
SPEAKER_0:  Possessions on the desk?

02:51:11,906 --> 02:51:13,246
SPEAKER_0:  or a copy of the decree.

02:51:13,698 --> 02:51:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  that saying that they can go after your family.

02:51:16,930 --> 02:51:22,974
SPEAKER_0:  And the amount of people who would confess to anything when they saw their family was in danger and they knew this wasn't a bluff.

02:51:23,458 --> 02:51:26,142
SPEAKER_0:  uh... was astronomical then it becomes a chain

02:51:26,466 --> 02:51:30,110
SPEAKER_0:  Because if you confess and I have your confession, how hard is it to get your neighbor?

02:51:31,490 --> 02:51:33,182
SPEAKER_1:  What do you make of the...

02:51:33,410 --> 02:51:34,110
SPEAKER_1:  for time.

02:51:34,370 --> 02:51:38,718
SPEAKER_1:  for most of the time the NKVD was about the head of NKVD.

02:51:39,490 --> 02:51:41,182
SPEAKER_1:  Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria.

02:51:41,698 --> 02:51:48,094
SPEAKER_0:  No, Barry, yeah, I have a death warrant signed by him hanging in my kitchen that I acquired.

02:51:48,354 --> 02:51:50,302
SPEAKER_0:  uh... he was one of the most

02:51:50,722 --> 02:51:51,934
SPEAKER_0:  evil people who ever lived.

02:51:52,834 --> 02:51:57,150
SPEAKER_0:  The thing that Americans don't appreciate is how clever.

02:51:57,570 --> 02:51:58,654
SPEAKER_0:  some of the sadism.

02:51:59,522 --> 02:51:59,934
SPEAKER_0:  is.

02:52:00,322 --> 02:52:04,094
SPEAKER_0:  So there was one actress, I think he took her back to his house.

02:52:04,578 --> 02:52:08,158
SPEAKER_0:  And he asked her to, he tried to get her to sleep with him. Then he promised her that.

02:52:08,482 --> 02:52:09,374
SPEAKER_0:  If she did her.

02:52:09,602 --> 02:52:16,158
SPEAKER_0:  father and either her husband or her grandfather, I don't remember which one it was, is going to be released from jail. Well, they were already dead at that point. He had them executed.

02:52:16,610 --> 02:52:22,590
SPEAKER_0:  They're still finding the bodies of the women he murdered in the grounds of his dacha. It's an embassy now.

02:52:23,138 --> 02:52:31,678
SPEAKER_0:  And the thing is, Stalin knew because at one point, there's a picture of Stalin's daughter in his lap, you know, and she was at his house one day and Stalin calls up, he goes, get out of there immediately.

02:52:32,034 --> 02:52:33,182
SPEAKER_0:  So he...

02:52:33,506 --> 02:52:34,846
SPEAKER_0:  like a good bureaucrat.

02:52:35,170 --> 02:52:39,678
SPEAKER_0:  He had a list, he kept a list of all of his sexual partners. It's still, uh, um.

02:52:40,002 --> 02:52:40,510
SPEAKER_0:  Sealed.

02:52:40,866 --> 02:52:43,134
SPEAKER_0:  but both him and his bodyguard had this list.

02:52:43,554 --> 02:52:44,926
SPEAKER_0:  So just to clarify. Yeah.

02:52:45,186 --> 02:52:55,103
SPEAKER_1:  He headed the operation that did this whole giant mechanism of forced confessions. Yes. He was part of expanding the Gulag. So he was in the head of the Gulag, but he was part of the Gulag.

02:52:55,103 --> 02:52:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  And his famous quote was, show me the man and I'll show you the crime.

02:53:00,354 --> 02:53:03,614
SPEAKER_1:  But on top of that, what you're describing is he was also.

02:53:03,842 --> 02:53:05,086
SPEAKER_1:  related or not.

02:53:05,570 --> 02:53:06,695
SPEAKER_1:  was also just a matter of

02:53:06,695 --> 02:53:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  rapist.

02:53:07,874 --> 02:53:10,494
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, and there's some dispute about whether he went after-

02:53:10,722 --> 02:53:13,662
SPEAKER_0:  with his rapes, but there's plenty of adult women.

02:53:13,986 --> 02:53:21,470
SPEAKER_0:  that were targets for this. There was also another little joke about him, about how Stalin is looking for his pipe and he can't find it and he calls it a barrier.

02:53:21,698 --> 02:53:28,926
SPEAKER_0:  And he's like, okay, I can't find this pipe. And then the afternoon he calls Barry again. He's like, oh, I found the pipe. He goes, but comrade Stalin, we've got four people to confess to still already.

02:53:29,410 --> 02:53:34,285
SPEAKER_0:  So you have to laugh, but then you think about the nature of how it operates. Well, it also the fact that you have to laugh, but then you think about the nature of how it operates.

02:53:34,285 --> 02:53:36,734
SPEAKER_1:  that this kind of person was allowed to run.

02:53:37,730 --> 02:53:39,838
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, I suppose...

02:53:40,226 --> 02:53:43,806
SPEAKER_1:  It's all different kinds of evil, and rape was just a part of the story.

02:53:44,514 --> 02:53:45,822
SPEAKER_1:  his own personal.

02:53:46,050 --> 02:53:46,622
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:53:46,850 --> 02:53:48,318
SPEAKER_1:  willingness to uh

02:53:50,754 --> 02:53:53,278
SPEAKER_1:  oversee torture and commit torture himself.

02:53:53,922 --> 02:53:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  and rape.

02:53:54,978 --> 02:53:59,038
SPEAKER_0:  but it's also what happens when you're in a country where it has no rights of any kind.

02:53:59,714 --> 02:54:01,022
SPEAKER_1:  And by the way, I should mention...

02:54:01,602 --> 02:54:03,550
SPEAKER_1:  that people should get your book.

02:54:04,194 --> 02:54:06,069
SPEAKER_1:  and audio, when's your audiobook coming out?

02:54:06,069 --> 02:54:07,070
SPEAKER_0:  in a couple of weeks.

02:54:07,266 --> 02:54:13,086
SPEAKER_1:  That'll be out shortly. Yeah. You gave me the great honor of voicing this man. That's for the promo.

02:54:13,410 --> 02:54:15,166
SPEAKER_1:  for the promo. Yeah.

02:54:15,842 --> 02:54:16,926
SPEAKER_1:  I appreciate that.

02:54:19,490 --> 02:54:20,734
SPEAKER_1:  for a moment, I actually.

02:54:22,178 --> 02:54:23,070
SPEAKER_1:  It was really difficult.

02:54:23,554 --> 02:54:23,902
SPEAKER_1:  Really?

02:54:24,194 --> 02:54:25,598
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, it was just a sentence.

02:54:26,050 --> 02:54:27,806
SPEAKER_1:  Understand, understand.

02:54:29,410 --> 02:54:30,942
SPEAKER_1:  Ahh

02:54:31,618 --> 02:54:32,743
SPEAKER_1:  because it takes you to that place.

02:54:32,743 --> 02:54:33,374
SPEAKER_0:  place.

02:54:33,602 --> 02:54:35,614
SPEAKER_0:  because he told her, scream if you want, doesn't matter.

02:54:36,450 --> 02:54:37,054
SPEAKER_0:  And he was right.

02:54:37,698 --> 02:54:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  Like that's the thing. He wasn't bluffing. She could scream or she had these women could scream their head off. No one's going to come help them.

02:54:43,074 --> 02:54:46,302
SPEAKER_0:  He would drive around Moscow at night in his limo looking for victims.

02:54:46,466 --> 02:54:48,382
SPEAKER_1:  But somehow me saying those words was tough.

02:54:48,866 --> 02:54:49,534
SPEAKER_1:  I'm sure.

02:54:50,114 --> 02:54:51,742
SPEAKER_1:  is uh... stuff.

02:54:53,666 --> 02:54:57,630
SPEAKER_0:  Because this is where we came from. Do you know what I mean? This isn't just like some kind of.

02:54:57,922 --> 02:54:59,198
SPEAKER_0:  uh, Tolkien villain.

02:55:00,034 --> 02:55:05,886
SPEAKER_1:  But it also was tough because I could see myself being somewhere in that machine somewhere. Like somehow that put me right there.

02:55:07,202 --> 02:55:10,430
SPEAKER_1:  Like, I guess, any, like, they're.

02:55:11,490 --> 02:55:14,846
SPEAKER_1:  Any cog in that machine is committing evil.

02:55:15,426 --> 02:55:15,838
SPEAKER_1:  Yes.

02:55:16,642 --> 02:55:17,662
SPEAKER_1:  That's the dark thing.

02:55:19,138 --> 02:55:19,550
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

02:55:21,026 --> 02:55:25,438
SPEAKER_1:  I think the higher you are to the top, the closer you are to the top.

02:55:26,146 --> 02:55:26,878
SPEAKER_1:  the more.

02:55:27,842 --> 02:55:29,438
SPEAKER_1:  ability you have to stop it.

02:55:31,330 --> 02:55:32,638
SPEAKER_1:  but the less...

02:55:33,794 --> 02:55:35,998
SPEAKER_1:  The more freedom you have to stop it, I suppose.

02:55:36,610 --> 02:55:37,054
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

02:55:37,442 --> 02:55:38,206
SPEAKER_1:  to a point, yeah.

02:55:39,138 --> 02:55:40,414
SPEAKER_1:  but like the little things.

02:55:42,466 --> 02:55:44,734
SPEAKER_1:  So Beria had the freedom to commit rape.

02:55:46,050 --> 02:55:46,846
SPEAKER_1:  or not to.

02:55:48,258 --> 02:55:50,494
SPEAKER_1:  And so he chooses to...

02:55:52,258 --> 02:55:55,262
SPEAKER_1:  sort of increase the amount of evil he's putting out into the world.

02:55:55,874 --> 02:56:01,118
SPEAKER_0:  But then you have to counterbalance that as dark as this calculus is after Stalin dies.

02:56:01,378 --> 02:56:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  Like that week they start.

02:56:04,194 --> 02:56:05,438
SPEAKER_0:  making the gulag shrink.

02:56:06,114 --> 02:56:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  they start pulling back.

02:56:07,458 --> 02:56:09,182
SPEAKER_0:  on the labor camps.

02:56:09,922 --> 02:56:11,646
SPEAKER_0:  So I mean.

02:56:12,290 --> 02:56:14,430
SPEAKER_0:  So that is a big plus in his.

02:56:14,786 --> 02:56:15,294
SPEAKER_0:  Side.

02:56:15,554 --> 02:56:18,718
SPEAKER_0:  Like you start liberating, having this mass amnesty and freeing.

02:56:18,946 --> 02:56:20,894
SPEAKER_0:  people from work camps.

02:56:21,442 --> 02:56:24,734
SPEAKER_0:  That's not minor things, so it's crazy. It's like...

02:56:25,218 --> 02:56:28,542
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not St. Peter, right? I don't know where-

02:56:28,866 --> 02:56:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not saying he's a good person, but it's kind of insane.

02:56:32,514 --> 02:56:34,110
SPEAKER_0:  that someone can do things that

02:56:34,530 --> 02:56:35,742
SPEAKER_0:  everyone listening to this.

02:56:36,034 --> 02:56:37,374
SPEAKER_0:  would regard as pure evil.

02:56:37,922 --> 02:56:39,422
SPEAKER_0:  And at the same time this guy

02:56:39,810 --> 02:56:40,446
SPEAKER_0:  Also...

02:56:40,898 --> 02:56:42,238
SPEAKER_0:  when the time came.

02:56:42,594 --> 02:56:43,166
SPEAKER_0:  Saved.

02:56:43,906 --> 02:56:44,990
SPEAKER_0:  tens of thousands of lives.

02:56:45,506 --> 02:56:51,486
SPEAKER_1:  So in some sense, Stalin is the kind of cancer that permeates all the Soviet minds.

02:56:51,810 --> 02:56:52,894
SPEAKER_1:  And once it's gone...

02:56:53,154 --> 02:56:54,814
SPEAKER_1:  You almost like wake up, wait a minute.

02:56:55,714 --> 02:56:56,839
SPEAKER_1:  What the fuck was I ap-

02:56:56,839 --> 02:57:01,342
SPEAKER_0:  And Khrushchev in, it was a 56 when he gave his secret speech.

02:57:01,858 --> 02:57:03,614
SPEAKER_0:  uh... you know behind closed doors

02:57:03,970 --> 02:57:06,718
SPEAKER_0:  And he's just like, all this criticism of Stalin was true.

02:57:07,202 --> 02:57:13,150
SPEAKER_0:  This is completely not what Mark Sisson's, you know, he tried to salvage the system. This is not what Mark Sisson's about. We can't have a personality cult.

02:57:13,474 --> 02:57:16,254
SPEAKER_0:  uh... you know stalin killed all these

02:57:16,610 --> 02:57:17,470
SPEAKER_0:  Top Generals.

02:57:17,794 --> 02:57:28,574
SPEAKER_0:  And when Hitler turned to betray the pact and invaded, Stalin didn't believe his buddy Hitler was going to do this. And as a result of this, we lost a lot of territory and lives. This is not a military genius. This was Stalin being...

02:57:28,930 --> 02:57:29,534
SPEAKER_0:  An idiot.

02:57:29,762 --> 02:57:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  or a moron, whatever term you want to be. So.

02:57:34,274 --> 02:57:36,798
SPEAKER_0:  You know, yeah, but the thing is...

02:57:37,378 --> 02:57:38,750
SPEAKER_0:  Khrushchev also was a butcher.

02:57:39,010 --> 02:57:42,878
SPEAKER_0:  You know, he had a lot of blood in his hands. You don't become, you know, the thick, solid seat.

02:57:43,138 --> 02:57:46,494
SPEAKER_0:  without having overlooked a lot of murder and chaos. So RM We accepted thatators are paying fine but you don't really want to be one

02:57:46,850 --> 02:57:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  It's such a...

02:57:49,730 --> 02:57:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  That's why it's called subtitled books, a tale of good and evil. There's so much sh-

02:57:53,698 --> 02:57:55,518
SPEAKER_0:  malevolence to go around.

02:57:57,122 --> 02:57:59,326
SPEAKER_1:  What do you think was going through Stalin's mind?

02:57:59,938 --> 02:58:01,470
SPEAKER_1:  in the 20s and the 30s.

02:58:08,226 --> 02:58:09,918
SPEAKER_1:  Did he directly...

02:58:11,906 --> 02:58:14,398
SPEAKER_1:  Allow himself to acknowledge the reality.

02:58:15,106 --> 02:58:18,494
SPEAKER_1:  of the suffering he was causing? What does it take to be that human?

02:58:19,074 --> 02:58:20,638
SPEAKER_1:  Hey, I'm almost interested.

02:58:21,474 --> 02:58:24,382
SPEAKER_1:  to extract lessons from that for leaders of today.

02:58:25,858 --> 02:58:28,478
SPEAKER_1:  How hard is it? Is it that Stalin is evil?

02:58:28,962 --> 02:58:31,902
SPEAKER_1:  Or can you just dilute yourself gradually?

02:58:32,354 --> 02:58:33,918
SPEAKER_1:  into where you don't have a sense.

02:58:34,338 --> 02:58:36,213
SPEAKER_1:  of the effect of your policies in the pod.

02:58:36,213 --> 02:58:40,094
SPEAKER_0:  Well, you're not diluting yourself because you have around you.

02:58:40,674 --> 02:58:42,014
SPEAKER_0:  an entire government.

02:58:42,402 --> 02:58:43,614
SPEAKER_0:  of people telling you.

02:58:44,002 --> 02:58:45,022
SPEAKER_0:  24-7.

02:58:45,282 --> 02:58:46,206
SPEAKER_0:  how great you are.

02:58:46,466 --> 02:58:49,406
SPEAKER_0:  how thankful they are for you, how awesome you are, you're the best.

02:58:49,858 --> 02:58:50,366
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

02:58:50,594 --> 02:58:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  so that.

02:58:51,426 --> 02:58:55,934
SPEAKER_0:  Certainly going to play into it. I've asked myself that question as well. Like, do these people believe they're on bullshit?

02:58:56,418 --> 02:58:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  and

02:58:57,186 --> 02:58:59,454
SPEAKER_0:  And I think the receipts are.

02:58:59,874 --> 02:59:02,814
SPEAKER_0:  When Elena Ceaușescu, who's one of the four women on the cover...

02:59:03,170 --> 02:59:06,814
SPEAKER_0:  when she's being taken away to be executed in 1989.

02:59:07,234 --> 02:59:10,686
SPEAKER_0:  She's yelling at the soldiers, how could you, I raised you like a mother.

02:59:11,042 --> 02:59:11,998
SPEAKER_0:  So she at least.

02:59:12,258 --> 02:59:13,342
SPEAKER_0:  believed her own bullshit.

02:59:13,858 --> 02:59:14,398
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:59:15,394 --> 02:59:18,654
SPEAKER_0:  With Stalin, he was obviously extremely intelligent.

02:59:19,202 --> 02:59:20,606
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's...

02:59:20,898 --> 02:59:26,046
SPEAKER_0:  kind of easy for us to kind of psychologize and say he's a sociopath, he's a narcissist, he's this, he's that.

02:59:26,626 --> 02:59:27,134
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

02:59:27,746 --> 02:59:31,422
SPEAKER_0:  but at a certain point, like if you're surrounded.

02:59:32,002 --> 02:59:33,182
SPEAKER_0:  by a culture.

02:59:33,602 --> 02:59:36,414
SPEAKER_0:  dedicated to glorifying you and everyone you meet.

02:59:36,674 --> 02:59:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  It's so happy to see you.

02:59:38,370 --> 02:59:40,830
SPEAKER_0:  and oh my god all your pronouncements are so good.

02:59:41,410 --> 02:59:44,254
SPEAKER_0:  And you know what, if you make a decision that's wrong...

02:59:44,482 --> 02:59:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  The people around you, it's their job to tell you why it's not your fault.

02:59:47,714 --> 02:59:52,766
SPEAKER_0:  It's the fault of the Wreckers or it's the fault of, you know, Hitler or whoever it is, the Kulaks.

02:59:53,474 --> 02:59:56,606
SPEAKER_0:  At a certain point the human mind wants to believe

02:59:57,186 --> 02:59:58,046
SPEAKER_0:  how great it is.

02:59:58,786 --> 03:00:00,478
SPEAKER_0:  especially someone in that vaunted position.

03:00:03,234 --> 03:00:04,862
SPEAKER_0:  But he had his love, there was this one.

03:00:05,506 --> 03:00:07,390
SPEAKER_0:  funny, I'm using the word loosely quote.

03:00:07,842 --> 03:00:09,790
SPEAKER_0:  when Hitler invades Russia.

03:00:10,210 --> 03:00:17,086
SPEAKER_0:  and he couldn't believe it and he's just missing in action for days because how could Hitler betray me? Deal, birds of a feather.

03:00:17,538 --> 03:00:21,406
SPEAKER_0:  and he had this quote about like we've taken Lenin's legacy and shitted out our asses.

03:00:21,826 --> 03:00:23,262
SPEAKER_0:  I think he was very aware.

03:00:23,618 --> 03:00:25,406
SPEAKER_0:  That's no question that he was aware.

03:00:25,698 --> 03:00:28,798
SPEAKER_0:  that in terms of being a philosopher or a thinker.

03:00:29,154 --> 03:00:30,366
SPEAKER_0:  He wasn't on Lenin's level.

03:00:30,690 --> 03:00:34,718
SPEAKER_0:  Right, so that was, I'm sure, played a lot into his psychology.

03:00:35,970 --> 03:00:37,886
SPEAKER_1:  that he never quite lived up to the...

03:00:38,306 --> 03:00:41,950
SPEAKER_1:  everything he tried. I mean there's some sense that the collectivization

03:00:43,490 --> 03:00:45,662
SPEAKER_1:  that this idea was a failure.

03:00:47,362 --> 03:00:50,846
SPEAKER_1:  the way he responds to the economic policy being a failure.

03:00:51,426 --> 03:00:52,574
SPEAKER_1:  is to lean in.

03:00:53,698 --> 03:00:56,670
SPEAKER_1:  and basically torture anyone who says it's a failure.

03:00:57,218 --> 03:00:58,782
SPEAKER_1:  and double down on the policy.

03:00:59,554 --> 03:01:00,679
SPEAKER_1:  That says something about-

03:01:00,679 --> 03:01:02,398
SPEAKER_0:  But it wasn't a failure, it broke.

03:01:02,914 --> 03:01:03,742
SPEAKER_0:  the Ukrainians.

03:01:04,930 --> 03:01:06,782
SPEAKER_1:  You don't think he believed early on.

03:01:07,938 --> 03:01:11,166
SPEAKER_1:  That's what it turned into, but you don't think in the very early days.

03:01:12,098 --> 03:01:13,918
SPEAKER_1:  There was a thought that collectivization.

03:01:14,562 --> 03:01:16,414
SPEAKER_1:  is the right mechanism by which

03:01:16,834 --> 03:01:19,390
SPEAKER_1:  to enact communism.

03:01:19,586 --> 03:01:21,694
SPEAKER_0:  But I think his goal...

03:01:22,082 --> 03:01:23,646
SPEAKER_0:  was to break.

03:01:24,162 --> 03:01:24,830
SPEAKER_0:  their spirit.

03:01:25,666 --> 03:01:28,478
SPEAKER_0:  and getting them fed was secondary, right?

03:01:28,898 --> 03:01:29,246
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:01:29,986 --> 03:01:32,830
SPEAKER_0:  given the fact that they stopped complaining because they're dead.

03:01:33,634 --> 03:01:34,750
SPEAKER_0:  He got what he wanted.

03:01:35,554 --> 03:01:36,670
SPEAKER_0:  He got it compliant.

03:01:37,058 --> 03:01:37,726
SPEAKER_0:  population.

03:01:38,850 --> 03:01:40,862
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, that's really interesting. I didn't.

03:01:41,890 --> 03:01:43,678
SPEAKER_1:  I wonder how much disagreement there is about...

03:01:44,994 --> 03:01:48,542
SPEAKER_1:  Because if that was the goal from the beginning, that's a different level of evil.

03:01:49,218 --> 03:01:56,158
SPEAKER_0:  I think that was clearly the g- so his h- like I said earlier, he broke with Lenin because he wanted socialism in one country, right? That was his vision.

03:01:56,514 --> 03:01:58,622
SPEAKER_0:  right? And he was also very aware.

03:01:59,330 --> 03:02:04,574
SPEAKER_0:  What became the Soviet Union was extremely diverse. First of all, it's gigantic countries, the big country on Earth.

03:02:04,994 --> 03:02:06,878
SPEAKER_0:  It's not always gigantic. You had-

03:02:07,458 --> 03:02:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  all these peoples, these nationalities within it.

03:02:10,690 --> 03:02:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  that have had historical enmity and they're not going to have loyalty to Moscow. He's a Georgian himself, this was always a big problem.

03:02:16,930 --> 03:02:18,270
SPEAKER_0:  So that was.

03:02:18,722 --> 03:02:21,214
SPEAKER_0:  What he wanted to do as well is to homogenize.

03:02:21,506 --> 03:02:23,582
SPEAKER_0:  and have them be standardized.

03:02:24,098 --> 03:02:25,694
SPEAKER_0:  I don't see how you do that.

03:02:26,114 --> 03:02:30,142
SPEAKER_0:  without either massive re-education, which is only going to go so far.

03:02:30,530 --> 03:02:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  or really just crushing people's spirits.

03:02:36,066 --> 03:02:37,406
SPEAKER_1:  So, like a...

03:02:37,826 --> 03:02:38,462
SPEAKER_1:  Forced.

03:02:39,554 --> 03:02:40,670
SPEAKER_1:  Homogeneity. Yeah.

03:02:43,234 --> 03:02:47,134
SPEAKER_0:  And the other big thing, a big element of Soviet culture.

03:02:47,522 --> 03:02:54,718
SPEAKER_0:  and the Soviet mythology. I mean, he called his name, his anxious name is Stalin. I can't even pronounce his Georgian name, I'm sure it was really or something like that.

03:02:55,010 --> 03:02:55,998
SPEAKER_0:  It means man of steel.

03:02:56,610 --> 03:03:03,230
SPEAKER_0:  So a large part of the, and this still remains in Russian culture to this day. I see it in my family too. And like other Russians I know.

03:03:03,458 --> 03:03:05,822
SPEAKER_0:  There is this pride in ruthlessness.

03:03:06,338 --> 03:03:16,446
SPEAKER_0:  and this kind of like, I'm so tough, like, nothing's gonna affect me, like, yeah, we're gonna suffer, but it's for a greater good or for the long term and not to be kind of sentimental or squeamish about things.

03:03:16,706 --> 03:03:18,581
SPEAKER_0:  Like that was a big part of it. Don't take.

03:03:18,581 --> 03:03:21,543
SPEAKER_1:  Take that away from me too, Michael. You've taken everything.

03:03:21,543 --> 03:03:22,366
SPEAKER_0:  Am I wrong?

03:03:23,170 --> 03:03:25,054
SPEAKER_1:  I admire.

03:03:25,410 --> 03:03:28,126
SPEAKER_1:  not stoicism, but that kind of hardness.

03:03:28,642 --> 03:03:32,017
SPEAKER_1:  I look forward to myself. There's nothing to do with

03:03:32,017 --> 03:03:36,318
SPEAKER_0:  But not to the extent that like if some like for example like if you

03:03:36,674 --> 03:03:37,406
SPEAKER_0:  See?

03:03:37,762 --> 03:03:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:03:38,690 --> 03:03:39,806
SPEAKER_0:  Someone's suffering.

03:03:40,258 --> 03:03:47,998
SPEAKER_0:  And that's being used as a mechanism to get you change your opinion. You're like, they're not going to get to me. Like that is very much part of that Russian psychology.

03:03:49,058 --> 03:03:49,630
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

03:03:50,242 --> 03:03:53,214
SPEAKER_0:  At least at that time. Yes. They'll largely know.

03:03:55,234 --> 03:04:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  I'm not going to be manipulated by someone else's suffering or weakness. That kind of thing. I think that's really part of it to this day.

03:04:02,338 --> 03:04:05,438
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know how much of it is character, how much of it is reality. but sure

03:04:05,538 --> 03:04:05,854
SPEAKER_0:  Sure.

03:04:09,922 --> 03:04:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  I remember I knew someone who was...

03:04:12,578 --> 03:04:14,238
SPEAKER_0:  him and his fiance were Russian.

03:04:14,978 --> 03:04:17,534
SPEAKER_0:  and they had this big fight she took off the ring.

03:04:17,762 --> 03:04:18,174
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

03:04:18,722 --> 03:04:21,566
SPEAKER_0:  And she's like, he's like, that's it.

03:04:22,210 --> 03:04:25,790
SPEAKER_0:  And just like the way he told the story to me, she's like, what do you want me to say?

03:04:26,082 --> 03:04:30,942
SPEAKER_0:  Oh don't leave me baby, I can't live without you. Like that nasty-

03:04:31,170 --> 03:04:31,838
SPEAKER_0:  cruelty.

03:04:32,194 --> 03:04:37,069
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know, man. I know you're... I don't know if there's a Russian thing. That's just...

03:04:37,069 --> 03:04:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  It's just a people thing.

03:04:38,626 --> 03:04:40,126
SPEAKER_0:  I don't think that's an American thing.

03:04:42,210 --> 03:04:45,534
SPEAKER_1:  I think there's all kinds of flavors and they're different.

03:04:45,762 --> 03:04:46,494
SPEAKER_1:  by region.

03:04:46,818 --> 03:04:51,294
SPEAKER_1:  of the way that people are cruel to each other. Sure, I'm not arguing that. America...

03:04:51,554 --> 03:04:54,929
SPEAKER_1:  New Jersey is different than Texas is different than California.

03:04:54,929 --> 03:04:58,526
SPEAKER_0:  You don't think Americans are a higher trust?

03:04:58,946 --> 03:05:00,446
SPEAKER_0:  more kind society.

03:05:00,706 --> 03:05:01,374
SPEAKER_0:  Then Russia?

03:05:01,634 --> 03:05:02,302
SPEAKER_0:  Even today?

03:05:03,458 --> 03:05:04,446
SPEAKER_0:  higher trust.

03:05:04,802 --> 03:05:07,102
SPEAKER_1:  Uh, listen, I'm not going to, so first of all,

03:05:07,330 --> 03:05:07,646
SPEAKER_1:  I

03:05:08,418 --> 03:05:09,982
SPEAKER_1:  I have a very complex

03:05:10,466 --> 03:05:10,942
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

03:05:11,810 --> 03:05:13,685
SPEAKER_1:  feelings about Russia today.

03:05:13,685 --> 03:05:16,638
SPEAKER_0:  I'm talking about January before the war. I'm talking about nowadays.

03:05:17,634 --> 03:05:18,759
SPEAKER_0:  I think it's a co-

03:05:18,759 --> 03:05:24,574
SPEAKER_1:  complex psychological dynamic of what trusting means. I think Russians are generally

03:05:25,090 --> 03:05:27,358
SPEAKER_1:  Less friendly, but have more intimate.

03:05:28,258 --> 03:05:30,526
SPEAKER_1:  friendships yes that's true

03:05:30,882 --> 03:05:32,286
SPEAKER_1:  So it's just a different.

03:05:32,834 --> 03:05:34,974
SPEAKER_0:  It's not different. It's just one is more trusting.

03:05:35,746 --> 03:05:37,566
SPEAKER_0:  Who's wishes more trusting? Americans!

03:05:38,626 --> 03:05:40,030
SPEAKER_1:  but then we define.

03:05:40,354 --> 03:05:41,479
SPEAKER_1:  Trust thing different.

03:05:41,479 --> 03:05:45,886
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, I'll give you an example. If someone's having a party in America and people come over...

03:05:46,530 --> 03:05:50,462
SPEAKER_0:  Okay, that's fine. Everyone's welcome. If it's in Russia, it's like, who's that? Who'd you bring?

03:05:51,010 --> 03:06:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  And there's much more of a like, let me be sure that's okay. This person's here. I know, maybe. You don't have parties. I have never been in a party. And you don't come to mine.

03:06:00,738 --> 03:06:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  www.globalonenessproject.org

03:06:01,986 --> 03:06:03,262
SPEAKER_0:  Van Eskri was very sad.

03:06:04,162 --> 03:06:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  I love that, I love that. Well you should have showed it by showing up. Tührt.

03:06:07,682 --> 03:06:12,126
SPEAKER_1:  Man, I'm a high height from the world and I'm afraid of social interaction

03:06:12,802 --> 03:06:15,998
SPEAKER_1:  and I just lay on the ground instead and feel sorry for myself.

03:06:16,098 --> 03:06:18,654
SPEAKER_0:  It's not bad Santa, it's sad Santa.

03:06:19,810 --> 03:06:24,798
SPEAKER_1:  Well, I conserve my emotional energy towards this one day of the year.

03:06:25,602 --> 03:06:27,934
SPEAKER_1:  intensely spread my joy.

03:06:29,218 --> 03:06:29,598
SPEAKER_1:  Alright.

03:06:30,274 --> 03:06:32,254
SPEAKER_1:  Speaking of which, you tell a Christmas story in the book.

03:06:33,122 --> 03:06:34,654
SPEAKER_0:  Are you spoiling that chapter?

03:06:34,914 --> 03:06:35,742
SPEAKER_0:  It's called Die Hard.

03:06:35,970 --> 03:06:37,845
SPEAKER_1:  All right, well, I'm not gonna spoil it.

03:06:37,845 --> 03:06:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  really good. I was very proud of that chapter.

03:06:41,410 --> 03:06:49,175
SPEAKER_0:  Because the ending that's a Christmas story is just like, I know everyone reading it's going to go Google it, be like, this can't be real, but it was real. There was a我知道 que假.

03:06:49,175 --> 03:06:49,726
SPEAKER_1:  Yes, yeah.

03:06:50,178 --> 03:06:54,462
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, this has to do with the bigger picture. We don't have to, uh...

03:06:54,786 --> 03:06:59,358
SPEAKER_1:  do the big reveal, but the bigger picture of there was an iron curtain and it was coming down.

03:06:59,778 --> 03:07:01,022
SPEAKER_1:  in complex ways.

03:07:01,858 --> 03:07:09,982
SPEAKER_1:  How would you define the Iron Curtain? There's a set of ideologies, a set of countries united by an ideology, and a set of countries united by a different ideology.

03:07:10,594 --> 03:07:11,582
SPEAKER_1:  And…

03:07:12,418 --> 03:07:14,782
SPEAKER_1:  There's a curtain that divided them.

03:07:15,266 --> 03:07:18,718
SPEAKER_1:  and it eventually came down. So how would you describe how it came down?

03:07:20,770 --> 03:07:25,950
SPEAKER_0:  It came, I hate that I can never remember, ever, ever remember if this was Hemingway.

03:07:26,882 --> 03:07:29,118
SPEAKER_0:  No, what's Hemingway? It is Mark Twain.

03:07:29,346 --> 03:07:32,158
SPEAKER_0:  No, it came down two ways, gradually then suddenly.

03:07:33,154 --> 03:07:33,694
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:07:35,426 --> 03:07:42,334
SPEAKER_0:  The thing with the Iron Curtain and the Warsaw Pact, these were a bunch of nations run under communism.

03:07:42,626 --> 03:07:43,518
SPEAKER_0:  but they were all.

03:07:44,130 --> 03:07:45,086
SPEAKER_0:  Almost all.

03:07:45,698 --> 03:07:47,486
SPEAKER_0:  under the sway of Moscow.

03:07:48,258 --> 03:07:52,894
SPEAKER_0:  So if they were going to make big changes, Moscow had to prove it.

03:07:53,442 --> 03:07:56,798
SPEAKER_0:  Um, it was in 19, in the, in the fifties when Hungary.

03:07:57,410 --> 03:07:59,294
SPEAKER_0:  uh... decided to rebel

03:07:59,746 --> 03:08:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  or not liberalized and they even were thinking of leaving the Warsaw Pact.

03:08:05,090 --> 03:08:06,942
SPEAKER_0:  And the Russians send in the tanks.

03:08:07,522 --> 03:08:10,206
SPEAKER_0:  and you have the development of what was called the Brezhnev Doctrine.

03:08:10,562 --> 03:08:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  which was the idea that...

03:08:12,130 --> 03:08:15,294
SPEAKER_0:  It is the duty of all the Warsaw Pact nations.

03:08:15,682 --> 03:08:20,446
SPEAKER_0:  If another country tries to, and this was also in 68 in the Prague spring Czechoslovakia

03:08:20,738 --> 03:08:23,326
SPEAKER_0:  If a nation wants to leave.

03:08:23,778 --> 03:08:30,686
SPEAKER_0:  socialism is incumbent of the social stations to in to do whatever is necessary to make sure there is an account revolution.

03:08:30,946 --> 03:08:32,030
SPEAKER_0:  So they were.

03:08:32,994 --> 03:08:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  very much under Moscow's.

03:08:36,002 --> 03:08:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:08:36,866 --> 03:08:40,670
SPEAKER_0:  And one of the big ways it changed...

03:08:41,186 --> 03:08:42,590
SPEAKER_0:  was one man.

03:08:43,106 --> 03:08:44,414
SPEAKER_0:  And that was Mikhail Gorbachev.

03:08:45,090 --> 03:08:46,910
SPEAKER_0:  and he was the first.

03:08:47,234 --> 03:08:48,158
SPEAKER_0:  Russian leader.

03:08:48,514 --> 03:08:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  to be born after the October Revolution.

03:08:51,458 --> 03:08:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  He grew up and his grandfather was arrested for being a Trotskyite.

03:08:56,034 --> 03:08:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  The other one, you know, was arrested for this or that.

03:08:58,690 --> 03:09:01,310
SPEAKER_0:  He saw his village starve as a result of Stalin.

03:09:01,666 --> 03:09:04,382
SPEAKER_0:  So even though he was a very committed...

03:09:04,898 --> 03:09:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  communists.

03:09:05,890 --> 03:09:07,742
SPEAKER_0:  He also was very

03:09:08,290 --> 03:09:11,294
SPEAKER_0:  and increasingly skeptical of authoritarianism.

03:09:12,130 --> 03:09:12,766
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:09:13,602 --> 03:09:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  You know, in Poland, for example, you had the Solidarity Movement.

03:09:16,898 --> 03:09:17,342
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:09:17,826 --> 03:09:19,902
SPEAKER_0:  and this is a labor union movement.

03:09:20,290 --> 03:09:27,838
SPEAKER_0:  And the government didn't know what to do. They were getting a lot of support from the peoples. They had strikes that, um, then the Gdansk shipyard was, was when, when they started.

03:09:28,226 --> 03:09:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  And basically, mascots hold them.

03:09:30,882 --> 03:09:32,926
SPEAKER_0:  Either you crack down or we're cracking down on you.

03:09:33,698 --> 03:09:38,110
SPEAKER_0:  And they're like, all right. And they declared martial law and the rest of the leaders put them away.

03:09:38,530 --> 03:09:41,214
SPEAKER_0:  But then when Gorbachev, you know, was in charge.

03:09:41,730 --> 03:09:43,038
SPEAKER_0:  there wasn't a gun to their back.

03:09:43,330 --> 03:09:47,614
SPEAKER_0:  And it was the communist leaders themselves who were like, you know what? There's this really funny moment where

03:09:48,546 --> 03:09:51,102
SPEAKER_0:  Lekhvelesta is meeting with Margaret Thatcher.

03:09:51,586 --> 03:09:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  And he's telling her what solidarity the movement wants.

03:09:55,650 --> 03:09:57,822
SPEAKER_0:  and she had been meeting with the Polish government as well.

03:09:58,210 --> 03:09:59,646
SPEAKER_0:  And she's like, look, like.

03:10:00,546 --> 03:10:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  Tell them like what, cause they had, you tried.

03:10:03,522 --> 03:10:13,726
SPEAKER_0:  They wanted, the government wanted her to tell them that we wanted to go shit and work things out. She goes, all right, tell the government what it is that you're asking for. And he just points to the ceiling. He goes, he's like, oh yeah, our meetings are bugged anyway.

03:10:14,146 --> 03:10:14,622
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:10:15,490 --> 03:10:17,054
SPEAKER_0:  They then had the freedom.

03:10:17,698 --> 03:10:19,006
SPEAKER_0:  because they knew.

03:10:19,266 --> 03:10:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  Gorbachev wasn't forcing them.

03:10:21,986 --> 03:10:23,710
SPEAKER_0:  to drive solid air underground.

03:10:24,002 --> 03:10:29,566
SPEAKER_0:  So they had the idea of like, let's work together with these people. And as a result of this, Poland liberalized and...

03:10:29,858 --> 03:10:30,558
SPEAKER_0:  Read itself.

03:10:31,042 --> 03:10:31,742
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, um...

03:10:32,610 --> 03:10:35,614
SPEAKER_0:  fairly easily and with a minimum of bloodshed in 89.

03:10:36,066 --> 03:10:46,270
SPEAKER_0:  And there was this whole argument for the Vietnam War with something called domino theory, which is if you lose Vietnam, then you're going to lose Laos, then you lose Cambodia. One by one, the countries are going to turn communist to the dominoes.

03:10:47,010 --> 03:10:48,574
SPEAKER_0:  People didn't realize the reverse was true.

03:10:48,994 --> 03:10:51,358
SPEAKER_0:  Because after Poland liberalized, then you have...

03:10:51,778 --> 03:10:57,470
SPEAKER_0:  You know, Hungary, then you have, you know, Czechoslovakia, then, you know, you had East Germany and...

03:10:57,986 --> 03:10:59,518
SPEAKER_0:  fall the Berlin Wall so.

03:10:59,746 --> 03:11:02,654
SPEAKER_0:  It's a great thing because as this is happening...

03:11:03,362 --> 03:11:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  the people are looking around.

03:11:05,410 --> 03:11:06,142
SPEAKER_0:  And they're like, wait.

03:11:06,978 --> 03:11:08,606
SPEAKER_0:  That's it? That was, like-

03:11:08,898 --> 03:11:09,918
SPEAKER_0:  This has gotta be a trick.

03:11:10,274 --> 03:11:11,806
SPEAKER_0:  And it wasn't a trick, so.

03:11:12,034 --> 03:11:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  One of my favorite books, which was a big inspiration for this one.

03:11:16,130 --> 03:11:21,790
SPEAKER_0:  was by my favorite historian. I apologize to Victor Petrusa, David Petrusa and Arthur Herman, my second and third.

03:11:22,050 --> 03:11:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  they're tied. But Victor Sebastian wrote a book called Revolution 1989.

03:11:27,714 --> 03:11:30,782
SPEAKER_0:  And he just talked about that year and how all these countries.

03:11:31,106 --> 03:11:34,142
SPEAKER_0:  one after another liberalized and it's just such a

03:11:34,466 --> 03:11:36,990
SPEAKER_0:  and none of them thought this was possible.

03:11:37,218 --> 03:11:37,598
SPEAKER_0:  My f-

03:11:37,858 --> 03:11:40,862
SPEAKER_0:  One of my favorite, favorite moments in this book.

03:11:41,858 --> 03:11:46,238
SPEAKER_0:  is Helmut Kohl, who is the head of West Germany, is in Warsaw with Lech Walesa.

03:11:46,562 --> 03:11:48,062
SPEAKER_0:  discussing the Berlin Wall.

03:11:48,418 --> 03:11:55,326
SPEAKER_0:  And like, Willis is like, I don't think it's going to be around for like another few years. And, and whole Nicole laughs in his face.

03:11:55,906 --> 03:11:56,702
SPEAKER_0:  And he goes...

03:11:57,122 --> 03:11:58,046
SPEAKER_0:  Look, you're young.

03:11:58,434 --> 03:12:01,502
SPEAKER_0:  This isn't how things work. Like, this is gonna take some doing.

03:12:01,954 --> 03:12:08,958
SPEAKER_0:  It fell the next day and Helmut Kohl literally says, I'm at the wrong party. And he got on a plane and got out of Warsaw.

03:12:09,378 --> 03:12:09,822
SPEAKER_0:  So.

03:12:10,210 --> 03:12:13,310
SPEAKER_0:  there are why this book has a broader message.

03:12:13,666 --> 03:12:16,446
SPEAKER_0:  than the actual stories of these incidents.

03:12:16,866 --> 03:12:17,374
SPEAKER_0:  is that.

03:12:17,954 --> 03:12:20,062
SPEAKER_0:  as these wonderful things are happening.

03:12:20,706 --> 03:12:23,070
SPEAKER_0:  The universal consensus at the time is

03:12:23,330 --> 03:12:24,382
SPEAKER_0:  It's never gonna happen.

03:12:24,898 --> 03:12:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  Or if it does happen, it's going to happen only through an enormous amount.

03:12:28,482 --> 03:12:29,694
SPEAKER_0:  of carnage and blood.

03:12:30,146 --> 03:12:32,958
SPEAKER_0:  And when it doesn't, then everyone's like, Oh, it was inevitable.

03:12:33,698 --> 03:12:38,430
SPEAKER_0:  You didn't say it was inevitable at the time. You only said it was inevitable after the fact. And the other thing that I-

03:12:38,690 --> 03:12:39,326
SPEAKER_0:  was really.

03:12:39,586 --> 03:12:40,958
SPEAKER_0:  brought me a lot of joy.

03:12:41,314 --> 03:12:42,910
SPEAKER_0:  is there are so many moments.

03:12:43,266 --> 03:12:44,638
SPEAKER_0:  of men with guns.

03:12:45,250 --> 03:12:46,878
SPEAKER_0:  saying, we're not shooting anyone.

03:12:47,426 --> 03:12:48,414
SPEAKER_0:  Cause they wanted.

03:12:49,378 --> 03:12:50,718
SPEAKER_0:  several Tiananmen squares.

03:12:51,010 --> 03:12:52,222
SPEAKER_0:  They wanted it in.

03:12:52,578 --> 03:12:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  you know east berlin they wanted it in romania

03:12:56,546 --> 03:12:57,950
SPEAKER_0:  as they wanted in Moscow.

03:12:58,306 --> 03:13:02,270
SPEAKER_0:  And these strong, tough, trained men with guns were like...

03:13:02,594 --> 03:13:03,006
SPEAKER_0:  No.

03:13:03,426 --> 03:13:03,870
SPEAKER_0:  We're not.

03:13:04,226 --> 03:13:05,694
SPEAKER_0:  shooting the civilians.

03:13:06,178 --> 03:13:06,590
SPEAKER_0:  And then.

03:13:07,202 --> 03:13:08,382
SPEAKER_0:  Everything else was history.

03:13:09,378 --> 03:13:10,503
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah, just as-

03:13:10,503 --> 03:13:13,950
SPEAKER_1:  surprising as the mass violence committed by

03:13:14,306 --> 03:13:17,502
SPEAKER_1:  Like police and the army on its own citizenry

03:13:17,858 --> 03:13:21,022
SPEAKER_1:  Equally surprising is when they choose not to. Yeah. TURN TO 1 minute 2 seconds

03:13:21,762 --> 03:13:22,142
SPEAKER_0:  Yeah.

03:13:23,042 --> 03:13:24,670
SPEAKER_1:  And what is that? the two

03:13:25,026 --> 03:13:26,014
SPEAKER_1:  How do you explain?

03:13:26,466 --> 03:13:28,798
SPEAKER_1:  1989 how do you explain this?

03:13:29,794 --> 03:13:30,590
SPEAKER_1:  Progress.

03:13:31,554 --> 03:13:32,830
SPEAKER_1:  that happened so suddenly.

03:13:33,570 --> 03:13:34,782
SPEAKER_1:  How do you explain?

03:13:35,106 --> 03:13:35,678
SPEAKER_1:  that

03:13:36,066 --> 03:13:38,590
SPEAKER_1:  in the beginning of the twentieth century.

03:13:39,650 --> 03:13:41,182
SPEAKER_1:  So much revolution happened.

03:13:41,730 --> 03:13:42,974
SPEAKER_1:  that created communism.

03:13:44,290 --> 03:13:46,494
SPEAKER_1:  And how do you explain then the collapse of that?

03:13:46,882 --> 03:13:48,798
SPEAKER_1:  across so many nations at the same time.

03:13:49,218 --> 03:13:52,286
SPEAKER_0:  I think a large part of it had to do.

03:13:52,642 --> 03:13:54,334
SPEAKER_0:  with the closer.

03:13:54,626 --> 03:13:55,614
SPEAKER_0:  interconnections.

03:13:56,034 --> 03:13:58,942
SPEAKER_0:  between people like Gorbachev and Thatcher and Gorbachev and Reagan.

03:13:59,458 --> 03:14:01,502
SPEAKER_0:  because both of them visited Red Square.

03:14:02,210 --> 03:14:04,926
SPEAKER_0:  You know, in the years before, these are...

03:14:05,218 --> 03:14:12,254
SPEAKER_0:  enemies you know they want to invade they want to kill us the Americans thought this about the Russians the Russians thought this about the Americans obviously not so much the British

03:14:12,834 --> 03:14:13,502
SPEAKER_0:  And...

03:14:14,722 --> 03:14:16,606
SPEAKER_0:  they got on really well.

03:14:16,930 --> 03:14:20,798
SPEAKER_0:  When Gorbachev came to checkers, which is the prime minister's

03:14:21,218 --> 03:14:22,462
SPEAKER_0:  countryside estate.

03:14:22,754 --> 03:14:28,734
SPEAKER_0:  Thatcher sat him down and she's lecturing him about human rights and she's lecturing about economics and she's lecturing about this and that.

03:14:29,090 --> 03:14:32,190
SPEAKER_0:  and then she's lecturing him about why he's in eating while he's yelling at her.

03:14:32,418 --> 03:14:33,054
SPEAKER_0:  And he goes...

03:14:33,794 --> 03:14:34,814
SPEAKER_0:  Mrs. Thatcher?

03:14:36,098 --> 03:14:38,078
SPEAKER_0:  I know you have a lot of strong opinions.

03:14:38,914 --> 03:14:39,614
SPEAKER_0:  I do too.

03:14:39,970 --> 03:14:43,870
SPEAKER_0:  I haven't been sent here to recruit you to the communist party." And she just started laughing.

03:14:44,130 --> 03:14:48,638
SPEAKER_0:  But right away, there was such a sense in the air.

03:14:48,994 --> 03:14:50,238
SPEAKER_0:  of we can do better.

03:14:50,626 --> 03:14:55,454
SPEAKER_0:  We're spending all this money on missiles. We're spending all this money on the military. It's expensive.

03:14:55,842 --> 03:14:56,702
SPEAKER_0:  And for what?

03:14:57,154 --> 03:15:00,734
SPEAKER_0:  Uh, we don't have to be looking at each other as enemies. We can-

03:15:01,090 --> 03:15:03,422
SPEAKER_0:  try to work together to kind of at the very least.

03:15:03,682 --> 03:15:07,230
SPEAKER_0:  lower the volume and the heat.

03:15:07,554 --> 03:15:09,470
SPEAKER_1:  How much credit do you give to Gorbachev the man?

03:15:09,762 --> 03:15:10,302
SPEAKER_1:  meaning.

03:15:10,722 --> 03:15:12,798
SPEAKER_1:  How much power does a single individual have?

03:15:12,898 --> 03:15:14,910
SPEAKER_0:  I could not give him more credit.

03:15:15,554 --> 03:15:22,910
SPEAKER_0:  I had a tweet last year where I said, who do you think is the greatest person alive right now? And my answer by far would be Gorbachev. Then he died, I don't know who it is right now.

03:15:23,362 --> 03:15:24,487
SPEAKER_0:  But it's just funny because.

03:15:24,487 --> 03:15:26,174
SPEAKER_1:  Because Gorbachev also had a tweet.

03:15:26,306 --> 03:15:28,158
SPEAKER_0:  Ah, ha ha ha ha ha ha!

03:15:30,242 --> 03:15:32,478
SPEAKER_0:  But it was, it was my thing. And he said...

03:15:32,802 --> 03:15:33,630
SPEAKER_1:  Oh, sure.

03:15:34,210 --> 03:15:34,878
SPEAKER_1:  Um...

03:15:35,586 --> 03:15:41,822
SPEAKER_1:  That would be a good, now I wish I interviewed Gorbachev and ask them the famous question of what do you like?

03:15:42,370 --> 03:15:44,245
SPEAKER_1:  best about Michael Malus.

03:15:44,245 --> 03:15:46,654
SPEAKER_0:  Look, the transition after the Soviet Union fell.

03:15:47,074 --> 03:15:50,622
SPEAKER_0:  to Russia and Yeltsin was not a smooth one by any means.

03:15:51,074 --> 03:15:54,206
SPEAKER_0:  you know, as I say at the end of the book, it's not like they lived happily ever after.

03:15:54,850 --> 03:15:58,398
SPEAKER_0:  But my point, broader point is you take the wins when you can get them.

03:15:58,914 --> 03:16:00,862
SPEAKER_0:  people now had access to passports.

03:16:01,186 --> 03:16:02,110
SPEAKER_0:  They don't have to have.

03:16:02,594 --> 03:16:04,606
SPEAKER_0:  They can leave the country. They have food.

03:16:04,866 --> 03:16:08,702
SPEAKER_0:  They have access to information. It's somewhat censored, but it's really nothing like it was.

03:16:09,090 --> 03:16:10,334
SPEAKER_0:  under the Soviet Union.

03:16:10,722 --> 03:16:13,214
SPEAKER_0:  and they didn't have to live in this kind of.

03:16:14,082 --> 03:16:18,302
SPEAKER_0:  constant fear and they had opportunities and it's such a step forward.

03:16:18,626 --> 03:16:21,854
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and there was this one great moment and I'm good.

03:16:22,146 --> 03:16:25,502
SPEAKER_0:  There's a super, Boris Yeltsin became president of Russia.

03:16:25,794 --> 03:16:28,606
SPEAKER_0:  He's also mayor of Moscow at one point, or the equivalent of mayor.

03:16:29,538 --> 03:16:33,534
SPEAKER_0:  and he came here to visit NASA in the capacity of one or the other.

03:16:34,050 --> 03:16:41,854
SPEAKER_0:  And while he was there, he went to visit a supermarket. It was a Randall's, then I think it's a food town now. It still exists. I'm going to go there. I'm going to start bawling.

03:16:42,722 --> 03:16:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  and as he's looking around...

03:16:45,378 --> 03:16:47,198
SPEAKER_0:  Like, he had never seen so much food.

03:16:47,650 --> 03:16:50,750
SPEAKER_0:  And this is food that even wealthy people in Russia don't have access to.

03:16:51,042 --> 03:16:53,310
SPEAKER_0:  And there's pictures of him just like this, like what the...

03:16:53,890 --> 03:16:55,422
SPEAKER_0:  And the scene that

03:16:55,650 --> 03:16:56,318
SPEAKER_0:  really

03:16:56,546 --> 03:16:57,662
SPEAKER_0:  was poignant to me.

03:16:58,050 --> 03:16:59,326
SPEAKER_0:  is on his flight back.

03:16:59,746 --> 03:17:01,502
SPEAKER_0:  He's sitting there on the plane like this.

03:17:02,434 --> 03:17:03,294
SPEAKER_0:  And he's like...

03:17:03,714 --> 03:17:06,046
SPEAKER_0:  They had to lie to the people.

03:17:06,658 --> 03:17:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  Because if they knew...

03:17:08,258 --> 03:17:10,110
SPEAKER_0:  they wouldn't have been able to get away with it.

03:17:10,338 --> 03:17:12,798
SPEAKER_0:  And that's the moment where it's just like, oh, this wasn't like.

03:17:13,314 --> 03:17:15,902
SPEAKER_0:  skewed propaganda, you know, this was like-

03:17:16,194 --> 03:17:18,782
SPEAKER_0:  they knew and it was a lie from A.

03:17:19,074 --> 03:17:19,774
SPEAKER_0:  to Z.

03:17:20,162 --> 03:17:25,662
SPEAKER_0:  and he was just like, holy crap, just like, and you can just imagine him on that plane, his brain reprogramming.

03:17:25,954 --> 03:17:34,750
SPEAKER_0:  Because if you're taught since you're a kid, and he was an older man, he was no dummy, you think, okay, the Americans are starving and poor, and they're lynching people every day, and then you go to f***.

03:17:34,978 --> 03:17:35,934
SPEAKER_0:  A SUPERMARKET!

03:17:36,162 --> 03:17:38,334
SPEAKER_0:  the most banal place on Earth.

03:17:38,658 --> 03:17:43,486
SPEAKER_0:  And you see, like, I think when the article said, like, they couldn't believe how big the onions were or something like that.

03:17:43,714 --> 03:17:49,374
SPEAKER_0:  And you're seeing this and you're seeing these like janitors, school teachers, these aren't dignitaries and they're regular people just-

03:17:49,602 --> 03:17:50,974
SPEAKER_0:  pick whatever they want and you're just like.

03:17:51,522 --> 03:17:54,814
SPEAKER_0:  Like, it's like the equivalent of having a stroke?

03:17:55,810 --> 03:18:00,222
SPEAKER_1:  I do think that that's one of the most powerful things is the grocery store.

03:18:00,770 --> 03:18:02,782
SPEAKER_1:  as they go in terms of drawing.

03:18:03,010 --> 03:18:05,310
SPEAKER_1:  A distinction between the two systems. Yeah.

03:18:05,858 --> 03:18:09,438
SPEAKER_1:  Cause you know, you can have like technology, you can show off technology and so on.

03:18:09,922 --> 03:18:13,790
SPEAKER_1:  But you can kind of sign right off technologies like, okay, that's the mechanism.

03:18:14,786 --> 03:18:15,870
SPEAKER_1:  of the devil.

03:18:16,162 --> 03:18:17,630
SPEAKER_1:  But when you look at just.

03:18:18,370 --> 03:18:19,102
SPEAKER_1:  Uh...

03:18:19,874 --> 03:18:21,630
SPEAKER_1:  Fruit and veggies and like

03:18:22,018 --> 03:18:24,126
SPEAKER_1:  very big fruit and veggies and like.

03:18:24,994 --> 03:18:26,686
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah, and fruit in particular.

03:18:26,914 --> 03:18:29,214
SPEAKER_1:  like certain kinds of fruit that are just not available in Russia.

03:18:30,050 --> 03:18:32,190
SPEAKER_1:  I mean, yeah, that really shows.

03:18:32,706 --> 03:18:33,310
SPEAKER_1:  Wait a minute.

03:18:33,954 --> 03:18:34,270
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah.

03:18:37,570 --> 03:18:39,998
SPEAKER_1:  It's interesting, like when you're older and you...

03:18:40,770 --> 03:18:41,822
SPEAKER_1:  have to face.

03:18:42,402 --> 03:18:45,214
SPEAKER_1:  the reality that you believe to be true.

03:18:45,698 --> 03:18:47,262
SPEAKER_1:  that your whole life has been based.

03:18:47,682 --> 03:18:53,182
SPEAKER_0:  And a set of lies. And you're not mistakes, not like a little bit like blatant.

03:18:53,666 --> 03:18:55,262
SPEAKER_0:  lies from top to bottom.

03:18:55,874 --> 03:18:58,302
SPEAKER_0:  start to finish that I don't know what that's like.

03:18:59,234 --> 03:19:00,094
SPEAKER_0:  How much uh...

03:19:00,226 --> 03:19:03,614
SPEAKER_1:  You start the book, I think you start the book with Ayn Rand.

03:19:03,906 --> 03:19:05,150
SPEAKER_1:  Yes. Yes. Yes.

03:19:06,754 --> 03:19:07,710
SPEAKER_1:  as one does.

03:19:08,418 --> 03:19:13,502
SPEAKER_1:  So before the revolution, she was born in Russia, she witnessed the revolution.

03:19:14,370 --> 03:19:14,942
SPEAKER_1:  uh...

03:19:15,170 --> 03:19:15,806
SPEAKER_1:  and moved.

03:19:16,098 --> 03:19:19,934
SPEAKER_1:  uh... to the united states in the twenty twenty six twenty six

03:19:20,258 --> 03:19:21,758
SPEAKER_1:  I remember like it was yesterday.

03:19:22,242 --> 03:19:28,766
SPEAKER_1:  Anyway, she you write that she spent a lot of her life trying to convince Americans in the world that.

03:19:29,826 --> 03:19:32,254
SPEAKER_1:  the negative effects of totalitarian government.

03:19:32,770 --> 03:19:33,086
SPEAKER_1:  Just.

03:19:33,314 --> 03:19:36,286
SPEAKER_1:  you know maybe using her as an example but also

03:19:36,866 --> 03:19:39,326
SPEAKER_1:  this question can we draw a distinction between

03:19:39,874 --> 03:19:42,046
SPEAKER_1:  authoritarian regimes, and communism.

03:19:42,530 --> 03:19:47,550
SPEAKER_1:  Is it possible to steal man the case that not all implementations of socialism and communism

03:19:47,906 --> 03:19:50,398
SPEAKER_1:  would lead to the atrocities we've seen in the Soviet Union.

03:19:50,882 --> 03:19:52,702
SPEAKER_1:  and in China under Mao.

03:19:53,730 --> 03:19:57,342
SPEAKER_1:  Like when you in studying all of this, how much blame do you put?

03:19:57,698 --> 03:19:59,230
SPEAKER_1:  on the ideologies.

03:19:59,650 --> 03:20:01,086
SPEAKER_1:  on Marxist ideologies.

03:20:01,474 --> 03:20:03,870
SPEAKER_1:  versus the particular leaders and dictators.

03:20:04,002 --> 03:20:09,086
SPEAKER_0:  Well, you have to blame the leaders a lot because they had different leaders in different countries where

03:20:09,794 --> 03:20:12,670
SPEAKER_0:  uh, different from each other. Oh hi from DukeCheck, who took

03:20:13,090 --> 03:20:16,478
SPEAKER_0:  Czechoslovakia and he tried to introduce socialism with a human face.

03:20:16,802 --> 03:20:21,502
SPEAKER_0:  in the Prague Spring of 1968, he was like, all right, we got to do away with this authoritarianism.

03:20:21,826 --> 03:20:27,294
SPEAKER_0:  We gotta have more free speech. He was thinking of introducing elements of democracy. Now then the Russians sent in the tanks.

03:20:27,682 --> 03:20:34,110
SPEAKER_0:  But the point is he certainly was someone who was like, all right, this, this has got to stop. This is just absolutely crazy.

03:20:34,402 --> 03:20:34,878
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:20:35,106 --> 03:20:36,446
SPEAKER_0:  Khrushchev and

03:20:37,058 --> 03:20:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  Stalin were not the same animal at all.

03:20:39,874 --> 03:20:43,390
SPEAKER_0:  So I think the problem with...

03:20:44,034 --> 03:20:46,686
SPEAKER_0:  communism in the Marxist sense.

03:20:47,042 --> 03:20:53,374
SPEAKER_0:  is that you're going to have an introducing element of authoritarianism simply because you can't have economic planning.

03:20:53,858 --> 03:20:57,118
SPEAKER_0:  If I don't have a price mechanism, I don't know how price is what.

03:20:57,506 --> 03:21:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  is me knowing as a consumer or a producer.

03:21:01,634 --> 03:21:11,678
SPEAKER_0:  what should be produced or what there's a shortage of. As prices increase, that's a signal that we have a shortage here. As prices decrease, that means that there's a surplus here. But if I'm setting the price, I don't really have...

03:21:11,906 --> 03:21:12,542
SPEAKER_0:  No.

03:21:12,866 --> 03:21:17,566
SPEAKER_0:  how much weed I need to produce if I'm compared to corn, compared to shoes as compared to Santa costumes.

03:21:17,794 --> 03:21:21,214
SPEAKER_0:  So that is a big problem. The other issue is...

03:21:21,474 --> 03:21:22,590
SPEAKER_0:  If you have one...

03:21:23,266 --> 03:21:25,118
SPEAKER_0:  uh... agency the government

03:21:25,410 --> 03:21:28,286
SPEAKER_0:  having a monopoly on, let's suppose, the news.

03:21:28,834 --> 03:21:34,590
SPEAKER_0:  like you were talking about earlier with Twitter, it's gonna be really hard to have any kind of objective discourse.

03:21:34,978 --> 03:21:35,998
SPEAKER_0:  because...

03:21:36,322 --> 03:21:44,734
SPEAKER_0:  Everyone is going to be working for the same organization that is going to cause a problem in terms of having a feedback mechanism, even in the best scenario, in terms of...

03:21:45,122 --> 03:21:46,878
SPEAKER_0:  This is a problem, this isn't a problem.

03:21:47,234 --> 03:21:50,462
SPEAKER_0:  And when you have a monopoly, which is what a government is...

03:21:50,786 --> 03:22:02,238
SPEAKER_0:  I think people are very familiar with what the problems happen with monopoly. There's a lack of accountability, bureaucracies are faceless and then no one's to blame, yet everyone kind of suffers as a consequence.

03:22:02,594 --> 03:22:04,190
SPEAKER_0:  It doesn't necessarily have to be.

03:22:04,642 --> 03:22:06,910
SPEAKER_0:  as authoritarian as Stalinism.

03:22:07,906 --> 03:22:08,286
SPEAKER_0:  You-

03:22:08,770 --> 03:22:09,982
SPEAKER_0:  I can't have it.

03:22:10,210 --> 03:22:12,734
SPEAKER_0:  a government which is authority by its nature.

03:22:13,058 --> 03:22:14,270
SPEAKER_0:  be this pervasive.

03:22:15,202 --> 03:22:17,246
SPEAKER_0:  without a strong amount of

03:22:17,666 --> 03:22:22,174
SPEAKER_0:  of oppression. Same thing with even if you just have like let's say socialized healthcare.

03:22:22,434 --> 03:22:40,862
SPEAKER_0:  You're going to have to make it illegal for doctors to practice privately. You're going to have to have rationing, so on and so forth. Now that might be a price that people are willing to pay because you can't have infinite spending on healthcare, right? So something's going to have to give somewhere. So there is an element of authoritarianism there and people are comfortable with that and I can wrap my head around it.

03:22:41,090 --> 03:22:42,398
SPEAKER_0:  But if you're going to have...

03:22:42,818 --> 03:22:45,982
SPEAKER_0:  one organization running literally everything in society.

03:22:46,338 --> 03:22:48,702
SPEAKER_0:  I don't see how you do that and have any.

03:22:49,090 --> 03:22:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  measure of liberalism.

03:22:51,650 --> 03:22:53,726
SPEAKER_1:  Why do you think Ayn Rand had so much trouble?

03:22:55,906 --> 03:22:56,414
SPEAKER_1:  time.

03:22:56,738 --> 03:22:58,846
SPEAKER_1:  people the danger of

03:23:00,098 --> 03:23:00,670
SPEAKER_1:  Soviet

03:23:01,346 --> 03:23:02,046
SPEAKER_1:  Stalinism.

03:23:04,450 --> 03:23:05,918
SPEAKER_0:  Well, I think...

03:23:07,906 --> 03:23:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  The pertinent question is why did Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman have so much problems?

03:23:12,226 --> 03:23:17,726
SPEAKER_0:  So they were hardcore. These are anarchists. Yeah, they're Emma Goldman's on the cover. They were deported.

03:23:17,986 --> 03:23:18,494
SPEAKER_0:  Um...

03:23:19,106 --> 03:23:23,166
SPEAKER_0:  from the US, J. Edgar Hoover saw them off at Ellis Island. They were sent to...

03:23:23,522 --> 03:23:23,998
SPEAKER_0:  Russia

03:23:24,386 --> 03:23:25,022
SPEAKER_0:  They were.

03:23:25,538 --> 03:23:29,982
SPEAKER_0:  Bloodthirsty revolutionaries. They had no shortage advocating violence when necessary.

03:23:30,498 --> 03:23:36,446
SPEAKER_0:  And when they went there, they were just like, this is a complete nightmare. They both individually had meetings with Lenin complaining about.

03:23:36,674 --> 03:23:42,046
SPEAKER_0:  political prisoners complaining about lack of free speech. He told them, you know, this is a revolutionary time. You could do that later.

03:23:42,530 --> 03:23:49,502
SPEAKER_0:  And when they both left, she wrote a memoir, it was split into two books, My Disillusionment Russia and My Ferdinand Disillusionment Russia.

03:23:49,794 --> 03:23:51,742
SPEAKER_0:  He wrote the Bolshevik Myth.

03:23:52,226 --> 03:23:54,430
SPEAKER_0:  And she was in England and she gave a speech?

03:23:54,946 --> 03:24:02,846
SPEAKER_0:  And she's just like, if you guys think this is for the workers, this is the biggest lie I've ever heard. Like they're oppressing the workers. Like no capitalist has ever imagined.

03:24:03,202 --> 03:24:12,830
SPEAKER_0:  And you know, as she described it, like people just shifting their sheets, seats, they're interrupting her and she, when she opened her talk, she had a standing ovation and when she was done you could hear pin drop.

03:24:13,218 --> 03:24:15,870
SPEAKER_0:  So they didn't want to hear it because this was.

03:24:16,322 --> 03:24:23,326
SPEAKER_0:  This kind of, and Eugene Lyons talks about it later, this was like the guinea pig theory of the Russian people. Like, we're gonna experiment on them.

03:24:23,586 --> 03:24:24,286
SPEAKER_0:  Over there.

03:24:24,866 --> 03:24:29,214
SPEAKER_0:  If it works, great, we're right. If it's wrong, it's their problem. And sure, these animals squeal, but-

03:24:29,602 --> 03:24:31,934
SPEAKER_0:  they're beneath us and of course they're gonna make some noise but

03:24:32,226 --> 03:24:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  you know this is a noble experiment but they're experimenting on a country several countries

03:24:36,834 --> 03:24:38,046
SPEAKER_0:  So I think...

03:24:38,530 --> 03:24:41,054
SPEAKER_0:  an ideology like this which appeals.

03:24:41,410 --> 03:24:42,942
SPEAKER_0:  to intellectuals because...

03:24:43,170 --> 03:24:46,942
SPEAKER_0:  you know, if it works or if it's implemented, they're the ones who are gods.

03:24:47,330 --> 03:24:57,854
SPEAKER_0:  in effect in a society, like their status cannot be higher, they really want this to work. They want a society where they are the near aristocracy of the most important people.

03:24:58,210 --> 03:25:25,278
SPEAKER_0:  And their criticisms of America, if they had a binary worldview, if America is bad and this is the opposite of America, then by definition it's good. And the other binary that they bought into is the Nazis and the fascists hate the communists and the communists, true, up to a point, hated the fascists and the Nazis. Okay, well, Hitler is evil, so this guy's against Hitler, we're with him. So that's an argument that's still made.

03:25:25,506 --> 03:25:40,446
SPEAKER_0:  in schools growing up when you talk about World War II, where they're like, we teamed up with Stalin, and they don't really talk about Stalin being a bad guy, but it's like, we worked with him to fight Hitler because Hitler was a unique evil. Now, that is certainly true that Hitler's a unique evil, but that doesn't mean or even imply that Hitler was a bad guy.

03:25:40,738 --> 03:25:43,806
SPEAKER_0:  that Stalin is somehow an angel or a saint.

03:25:44,898 --> 03:25:48,126
SPEAKER_1:  Do you think some of the lessons of history are forgotten here in our?

03:25:49,250 --> 03:25:49,854
SPEAKER_1:  in arm

03:25:50,210 --> 03:25:51,550
SPEAKER_1:  Modern political discourse.

03:25:51,842 --> 03:25:52,967
SPEAKER_1:  that are important to remember.

03:25:52,967 --> 03:26:01,022
SPEAKER_0:  I was so triggered because I was in the supermarket and there was a company that's selling Russian ice cream because it meets these high-level Soviet standards.

03:26:01,378 --> 03:26:03,998
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm just like, you think this is some kind of joke?

03:26:04,354 --> 03:26:08,478
SPEAKER_0:  You think this is some kind of kitschy punchline that you had decades of people.

03:26:08,706 --> 03:26:18,398
SPEAKER_0:  who were taught in school to turn their parents into the police if they were hoarding grain, even if it cost them their own lives, where it was a crime to be married to someone who was an enemy of the state.

03:26:18,690 --> 03:26:22,302
SPEAKER_0:  where you had torture being the norm, where people are institutionalized.

03:26:22,626 --> 03:26:32,542
SPEAKER_0:  because they were politically disadvantageous and they were called insane. Like this isn't just like, oh, this hammer and sickle is this cool, wacky symbol. Like the amount of blood.

03:26:32,898 --> 03:26:39,134
SPEAKER_0:  under this symbol was just enormous. And, and so, yeah, I think that lesson has very much been forgotten. How did the ice cream taste?

03:26:39,714 --> 03:26:40,414
SPEAKER_0:  It was fine.

03:26:42,722 --> 03:26:45,630
SPEAKER_0:  I'm a Baskin Robbins guy to be honest, but Van Lewin's does some great work.

03:26:46,242 --> 03:26:48,894
SPEAKER_1:  Baskin-Ramos doesn't have any Soviet flavors.

03:26:49,506 --> 03:26:49,982
SPEAKER_1:  No.

03:26:54,242 --> 03:26:54,718
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:26:54,946 --> 03:26:55,390
SPEAKER_1:

03:26:55,906 --> 03:27:01,726
SPEAKER_1:  Those are dark jokes, dark, dark jokes. I'm going to self-publish a book of jokes.

03:27:02,434 --> 03:27:02,782
SPEAKER_1:  Thanks for watching!

03:27:04,866 --> 03:27:06,270
SPEAKER_1:  Um, coming out.

03:27:07,874 --> 03:27:08,382
SPEAKER_1:  Um,

03:27:08,834 --> 03:27:11,550
SPEAKER_1:  in a grocery store near you. Okay guys.

03:27:12,706 --> 03:27:14,718
SPEAKER_1:  What was the hardest part about writing this book?

03:27:15,170 --> 03:27:16,702
SPEAKER_1:  Spent two years writing it.

03:27:17,826 --> 03:27:22,782
SPEAKER_0:  So when I write books for celebrities and I was co-authoring them, I did it kind of like method acting.

03:27:23,362 --> 03:27:27,198
SPEAKER_0:  I try to get into their head as much as possible to kind of speak in their voice.

03:27:28,194 --> 03:27:29,950
SPEAKER_0:  And when you're dealing with...

03:27:32,098 --> 03:27:33,470
SPEAKER_0:  children being.

03:27:33,762 --> 03:27:34,366
SPEAKER_0:  tortured.

03:27:35,010 --> 03:27:35,646
SPEAKER_0:  harmed.

03:27:36,162 --> 03:27:36,766
SPEAKER_0:  Start.

03:27:37,538 --> 03:27:39,390
SPEAKER_0:  and you're trying to empathize with.

03:27:40,162 --> 03:27:41,566
SPEAKER_0:  The characters, it's-

03:27:42,210 --> 03:27:43,102
SPEAKER_0:  It's hard to take.

03:27:43,650 --> 03:27:45,854
SPEAKER_0:  Um, the other big part I had.

03:27:46,274 --> 03:27:49,310
SPEAKER_0:  Like I was saying earlier, I was just very, very concerned.

03:27:49,858 --> 03:27:50,782
SPEAKER_0:  that I told it.

03:27:51,298 --> 03:27:53,438
SPEAKER_0:  this story and that it did it justice.

03:27:53,922 --> 03:27:59,486
SPEAKER_0:  because I think this is something that is, I still don't understand and I'm kind of angry about it.

03:28:00,034 --> 03:28:01,438
SPEAKER_0:  that it's fallen on me.

03:28:02,050 --> 03:28:04,126
SPEAKER_0:  to tell this story. This is some-

03:28:04,802 --> 03:28:05,566
SPEAKER_0:  Miner.

03:28:06,274 --> 03:28:08,542
SPEAKER_0:  incident that happened in some random town and...

03:28:08,802 --> 03:28:09,438
SPEAKER_0:  Pick a state.

03:28:09,922 --> 03:28:11,070
SPEAKER_0:  This is half the world.

03:28:11,522 --> 03:28:12,318
SPEAKER_0:  for, you know.

03:28:12,706 --> 03:28:14,142
SPEAKER_0:  70, 80 years.

03:28:14,690 --> 03:28:21,886
SPEAKER_0:  And the fact that it's, this is the eighties. This isn't, we were, I mean, you and I are old enough to remember the eighties. There's a show. I remember the eighties.

03:28:22,242 --> 03:28:24,638
SPEAKER_0:  The fact that all these things have just kind of

03:28:24,930 --> 03:28:26,494
SPEAKER_0:  We have this collective amnesia.

03:28:26,978 --> 03:28:32,862
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and if not even amnesia, I think a lot of this stuff, even I like, was not known even at the time or was kind of obscured.

03:28:33,666 --> 03:28:34,046
SPEAKER_0:  Uh

03:28:34,306 --> 03:28:40,574
SPEAKER_0:  This is, I remember I was at the Blaze, which is a network run by Glenn Beck, and they're conservatives and-

03:28:40,834 --> 03:28:42,142
SPEAKER_0:  I have a lot of fun there.

03:28:42,722 --> 03:28:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm just sitting there and then.

03:28:45,250 --> 03:28:49,982
SPEAKER_0:  Sometimes they veer off, they're like, oh, Biden's a communist. Okay, Biden's a communist.

03:28:51,234 --> 03:28:52,830
SPEAKER_0:  I'm like, we talk so much about-

03:28:53,538 --> 03:28:54,398
SPEAKER_0:  You know, slavery.

03:28:54,690 --> 03:28:58,270
SPEAKER_0:  the civil war, the atrocities, we talk about World War II and the Holocaust. I'm like...

03:28:58,658 --> 03:29:08,414
SPEAKER_0:  How is no one talking about this? And this was can very easily be portrayed as like conservatism's big victory because Reagan and Thatcher were so instrumental in guiding this to a safe landing.

03:29:08,898 --> 03:29:09,566
SPEAKER_0:  and

03:29:09,826 --> 03:29:14,046
SPEAKER_0:  I'm like, how is no one telling a story? And then one day my brain is like, you know, you.

03:29:14,786 --> 03:29:16,766
SPEAKER_0:  Write books for a living. This is kind of your job.

03:29:17,250 --> 03:29:20,606
SPEAKER_0:  And I'm like, all right, but I still don't, I still, I got to tell you I'm.

03:29:21,122 --> 03:29:22,494
SPEAKER_0:  kind of confused.

03:29:22,978 --> 03:29:23,358
SPEAKER_0:  that.

03:29:24,322 --> 03:29:27,934
SPEAKER_0:  I'm the one who has to do this because this should be.

03:29:28,194 --> 03:29:28,702
SPEAKER_0:  They should be.

03:29:29,058 --> 03:29:29,374
SPEAKER_0:  You know.

03:29:29,634 --> 03:29:32,990
SPEAKER_0:  There should be 30 books like this. And this is a model to follow.

03:29:33,378 --> 03:29:35,134
SPEAKER_1:  Yeah. And it's also, um,

03:29:36,034 --> 03:29:37,886
SPEAKER_1:  That is such recent history. Yeah!

03:29:39,202 --> 03:29:42,302
SPEAKER_1:  but it also kind of makes you realize that there might be...

03:29:43,970 --> 03:29:44,862
SPEAKER_1:  other fights?

03:29:46,466 --> 03:29:47,326
SPEAKER_1:  for progress.

03:29:47,874 --> 03:29:48,638
SPEAKER_1:  going on right now.

03:29:49,218 --> 03:29:51,774
SPEAKER_1:  The world that we don't know about, so you wrote about North Korea?

03:29:52,834 --> 03:29:55,518
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know to what degree there could possibly be fights.

03:29:56,194 --> 03:29:56,542
SPEAKER_1:  there.

03:29:56,802 --> 03:29:57,502
SPEAKER_1:  for progress.

03:29:58,146 --> 03:29:58,782
SPEAKER_1:  but...

03:29:59,010 --> 03:30:01,790
SPEAKER_1:  They could be boiling up.

03:30:02,402 --> 03:30:04,574
SPEAKER_1:  In China, that could be boiling up.

03:30:04,866 --> 03:30:06,014
SPEAKER_1:  Battles for progress?

03:30:06,594 --> 03:30:07,998
SPEAKER_1:  in other parts of the world.

03:30:08,290 --> 03:30:10,078
SPEAKER_1:  Russia that could be.

03:30:10,850 --> 03:30:12,158
SPEAKER_1:  And in America.

03:30:12,418 --> 03:30:13,150
SPEAKER_1:  in America.

03:30:13,570 --> 03:30:15,902
SPEAKER_1:  And these are all different kind of battles for progress.

03:30:16,162 --> 03:30:16,638
SPEAKER_1:  And now.

03:30:17,154 --> 03:30:17,630
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:30:18,722 --> 03:30:19,678
SPEAKER_1:  Sometimes...

03:30:21,922 --> 03:30:23,806
SPEAKER_1:  Sometimes I, you know.

03:30:24,834 --> 03:30:28,670
SPEAKER_1:  We sometimes tend to criticize these battles for progress, like, uh...

03:30:29,186 --> 03:30:31,678
SPEAKER_1:  If it's on the left, we'll call it like wokeism.

03:30:31,938 --> 03:30:32,510
SPEAKER_1:  or whatever.

03:30:33,090 --> 03:30:34,622
SPEAKER_1:  And we pick extreme.

03:30:35,138 --> 03:30:35,934
SPEAKER_1:  elements of it.

03:30:36,226 --> 03:30:38,878
SPEAKER_1:  and show how silly and ridiculous it is.

03:30:39,170 --> 03:30:42,142
SPEAKER_1:  not realising it, not acknowledging that there's a...

03:30:42,722 --> 03:30:45,310
SPEAKER_1:  a more civil battle going on underneath.

03:30:45,762 --> 03:30:46,878
SPEAKER_1:  for actual for

03:30:47,266 --> 03:30:47,582
SPEAKER_1:  for

03:30:47,874 --> 03:30:48,670
SPEAKER_1:  respecting

03:30:48,930 --> 03:30:49,406
SPEAKER_1:  human.

03:30:50,338 --> 03:30:52,574
SPEAKER_1:  dignity from all.

03:30:52,866 --> 03:30:54,334
SPEAKER_1:  for people for all walks of life.

03:30:54,626 --> 03:30:55,294
SPEAKER_1:  And the same.

03:30:55,842 --> 03:31:03,646
SPEAKER_1:  We tend to call anybody who questions mainstream narratives, conspiracy theorists, we dismiss them immediately. And they're ultimately fighting for progress.

03:31:03,938 --> 03:31:05,982
SPEAKER_1:  to people who criticize Fauci and everybody else.

03:31:06,466 --> 03:31:07,358
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if they're...

03:31:08,002 --> 03:31:08,798
SPEAKER_1:  I think they want.

03:31:09,922 --> 03:31:10,942
SPEAKER_1:  institutions.

03:31:11,650 --> 03:31:13,662
SPEAKER_1:  that serve the public.

03:31:14,082 --> 03:31:15,326
SPEAKER_1:  They're fighting for progress too.

03:31:15,618 --> 03:31:19,134
SPEAKER_1:  and we tend to dismiss them. Like each side tends to caricature the other.

03:31:19,746 --> 03:31:23,326
SPEAKER_1:  But the battle for progress is happening. I guess that's what your-

03:31:24,290 --> 03:31:26,558
SPEAKER_1:  That's the hopeful message with the white pill.

03:31:27,042 --> 03:31:28,446
SPEAKER_1:  Right? That there- there's-

03:31:28,706 --> 03:31:29,662
SPEAKER_1:  Progress being made.

03:31:29,954 --> 03:31:30,846
SPEAKER_1:  Somehow we're all f-

03:31:31,170 --> 03:31:32,295
SPEAKER_1:  Making progress here.

03:31:32,295 --> 03:31:35,006
SPEAKER_0:  I think more the hopeful message is that...

03:31:35,650 --> 03:31:36,894
SPEAKER_0:  It's not possible.

03:31:37,186 --> 03:31:38,238
SPEAKER_0:  that we have to lose.

03:31:38,754 --> 03:31:41,502
SPEAKER_0:  Like if someone tells you the straight face, you can't win.

03:31:41,954 --> 03:31:44,382
SPEAKER_0:  the enemy is too impressive and strong, I'm like-

03:31:44,770 --> 03:31:47,742
SPEAKER_0:  What are you talking about? I mean, look, this was-

03:31:48,034 --> 03:31:49,182
SPEAKER_0:  The Soviet Union!

03:31:49,634 --> 03:31:50,942
SPEAKER_0:  And it happened.

03:31:51,170 --> 03:31:51,678
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

03:31:52,066 --> 03:31:58,398
SPEAKER_0:  relatively quickly and relatively peacefully. I mean, again, and it wasn't because.

03:31:58,754 --> 03:32:06,654
SPEAKER_0:  the Hanuker in East Germany was like, oh, I'm just gonna vacate my seat. He was like sending the tanks and the military guy said no.

03:32:07,138 --> 03:32:11,870
SPEAKER_0:  So they wanted blood. There were plenty of people who wanted blood and would have been happy to have it.

03:32:12,322 --> 03:32:13,086
SPEAKER_1:  So to you.

03:32:14,018 --> 03:32:14,910
SPEAKER_1:  What the f-

03:32:15,330 --> 03:32:17,982
SPEAKER_1:  Maybe if not the fall of the Soviet Union.

03:32:18,626 --> 03:32:20,446
SPEAKER_1:  the fall of the Iron Curtain.

03:32:21,474 --> 03:32:22,718
SPEAKER_1:  is great.

03:32:23,298 --> 03:32:25,374
SPEAKER_1:  leap of progress in the 20th century.

03:32:26,114 --> 03:32:28,734
SPEAKER_0:  I don't see how anyone can argue against that point.

03:32:29,698 --> 03:32:30,823
SPEAKER_0:  with a straight face.

03:32:30,823 --> 03:32:32,414
SPEAKER_1:  That gives you hope that we...

03:32:32,642 --> 03:32:34,558
SPEAKER_1:  that we humanity were able to do that.

03:32:35,682 --> 03:32:39,678
SPEAKER_0:  Yes, and at the same time, we were told at the time...

03:32:39,938 --> 03:32:40,542
SPEAKER_0:  Give it up!

03:32:40,866 --> 03:32:41,886
SPEAKER_0:  Be realistic.

03:32:42,466 --> 03:32:43,678
SPEAKER_0:  It's utopian.

03:32:44,002 --> 03:32:49,054
SPEAKER_0:  to think this is going anywhere, maybe in 100 years. Look, there's a recent check off on Star Trek.

03:32:49,538 --> 03:32:53,726
SPEAKER_0:  Because the idea is even for our future, you're going to have America and you're going to have the Soviet Union.

03:32:54,114 --> 03:32:56,830
SPEAKER_0:  Like this is the reality. It was called Real Politics.

03:32:57,250 --> 03:33:00,158
SPEAKER_0:  We're going to have detente because it's, you know, it's this permanent stalemate.

03:33:00,386 --> 03:33:02,590
SPEAKER_0:  We had the Vietnam War, we got our asses kicked.

03:33:02,914 --> 03:33:11,614
SPEAKER_0:  Russia's not going anywhere. America's not going anywhere. We got to learn to live with each other, blah, blah, blah. And Reagan said, you don't want to hear my strategy.

03:33:11,970 --> 03:33:16,030
SPEAKER_0:  for the cold war some people might say it's simple or even simplistic here it is

03:33:16,354 --> 03:33:17,246
SPEAKER_0:  We win, they lose.

03:33:18,466 --> 03:33:20,286
SPEAKER_0:  and the people who won.

03:33:20,610 --> 03:33:28,414
SPEAKER_0:  were the Russian people and the Ukrainian people and the Lithuanian people and the Polish people and the Romanian people especially and the Hungarian people.

03:33:28,802 --> 03:33:31,230
SPEAKER_0:  And it's just...

03:33:32,450 --> 03:33:34,558
SPEAKER_0:  There are so many moments of great joy.

03:33:35,042 --> 03:33:38,462
SPEAKER_0:  uh... that you know it just tears coming down my face because

03:33:38,786 --> 03:33:39,550
SPEAKER_0:  You're, you're

03:33:40,066 --> 03:33:41,694
SPEAKER_0:  Go, you're like in Prague.

03:33:41,986 --> 03:33:49,534
SPEAKER_0:  when Dubček, again, who tried to liberalize in 1968, and then when they sent in the tanks, they deported him to Slovakia somewhere to do some forestry job.

03:33:49,826 --> 03:33:53,918
SPEAKER_0:  Like he appears in their big squares just waving from the balcony like this ghost.

03:33:54,338 --> 03:33:55,838
SPEAKER_0:  uh... from twenty years prior

03:33:56,258 --> 03:33:57,086
SPEAKER_0:  being like, look.

03:33:57,442 --> 03:33:57,982
SPEAKER_0:  You know?

03:33:58,498 --> 03:34:00,926
SPEAKER_0:  The spirit of 68 is still alive here.

03:34:01,218 --> 03:34:04,126
SPEAKER_0:  in Czechoslovakia and it was like a matter of weeks?

03:34:04,354 --> 03:34:07,518
SPEAKER_0:  The entire government resigned and then they liberalized. It's just...

03:34:08,002 --> 03:34:09,726
SPEAKER_0:  so many things about

03:34:10,306 --> 03:34:11,358
SPEAKER_0:  just overnight.

03:34:11,618 --> 03:34:14,462
SPEAKER_0:  uh... just change for the profound better

03:34:14,914 --> 03:34:17,790
SPEAKER_0:  Um, and you know, people are so

03:34:18,594 --> 03:34:19,390
SPEAKER_0:  Committed.

03:34:20,066 --> 03:34:21,246
SPEAKER_0:  to making sure.

03:34:21,474 --> 03:34:26,078
SPEAKER_0:  you don't have hope and if things get better, oh, it doesn't really matter because the broader picture never gets better.

03:34:26,306 --> 03:34:28,190
SPEAKER_0:  And there's lots of data.

03:34:28,450 --> 03:34:32,766
SPEAKER_0:  to the contrary where that's happened before. And this isn't some magical faraway place.

03:34:32,994 --> 03:34:36,542
SPEAKER_0:  This is the opposite of magical faraway place. It's Eastern Europe.

03:34:38,082 --> 03:34:40,606
SPEAKER_1:  To me, I think one such narrative that...

03:34:41,378 --> 03:34:43,390
SPEAKER_1:  People assume will always be true

03:34:43,938 --> 03:34:47,294
SPEAKER_1:  or just to a degree will always be true like in American politics.

03:34:47,618 --> 03:34:48,734
SPEAKER_1:  is the extreme.

03:34:49,026 --> 03:34:50,078
SPEAKER_1:  levels of division.

03:34:50,786 --> 03:34:53,150
SPEAKER_1:  And it seems to me like that too we can overcome.

03:34:54,626 --> 03:35:00,574
SPEAKER_1:  So the division in American politics that seems to be counterproductive, I think that can be overcome.

03:35:02,050 --> 03:35:03,646
SPEAKER_1:  And I think the

03:35:04,162 --> 03:35:06,686
SPEAKER_1:  the division in geopolitics currently.

03:35:07,266 --> 03:35:10,270
SPEAKER_1:  with Russia, China and the United States.

03:35:10,658 --> 03:35:12,286
SPEAKER_1:  particularly

03:35:12,578 --> 03:35:13,886
SPEAKER_1:  China and the United States.

03:35:14,210 --> 03:35:15,166
SPEAKER_1:  it be overcome.

03:35:16,322 --> 03:35:18,270
SPEAKER_1:  And I think that requires great leadership.

03:35:20,642 --> 03:35:23,166
SPEAKER_1:  that galvanizes the populace.

03:35:24,130 --> 03:35:25,950
SPEAKER_1:  to the better angels of their nature.

03:35:26,370 --> 03:35:27,326
SPEAKER_1:  I can't have hope for that.

03:35:27,650 --> 03:35:31,710
SPEAKER_1:  People have become really cynical on social media and elsewhere in the way they talk.

03:35:32,226 --> 03:35:35,006
SPEAKER_1:  The liberals are destroying this country.

03:35:35,586 --> 03:35:38,334
SPEAKER_1:  the conservatives are destroying this country.

03:35:38,786 --> 03:35:41,150
SPEAKER_1:  this kind of language is becoming more and more popular.

03:35:41,858 --> 03:35:42,174
SPEAKER_1:  Um.

03:35:42,914 --> 03:35:45,598
SPEAKER_1:  I think that's, I hope that that's temporary.

03:35:49,634 --> 03:35:51,166
SPEAKER_1:  At least that's my weight pill.

03:35:52,034 --> 03:35:56,190
SPEAKER_1:  I don't know if you have that kind of hope for, like what does hope look like for you?

03:35:56,706 --> 03:35:57,182
SPEAKER_1:  in.

03:35:58,178 --> 03:35:59,230
SPEAKER_1:  American politics.

03:35:59,650 --> 03:36:01,790
SPEAKER_1:  Forget American politics, American the nation.

03:36:02,274 --> 03:36:02,782
SPEAKER_1:  country.

03:36:03,042 --> 03:36:03,422
SPEAKER_1:  people.

03:36:04,098 --> 03:36:04,510
SPEAKER_0:  Um.

03:36:06,562 --> 03:36:07,486
SPEAKER_0:  My hope.

03:36:09,890 --> 03:36:10,398
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

03:36:12,034 --> 03:36:14,494
SPEAKER_0:  which I don't think is an unrealistic one.

03:36:15,746 --> 03:36:16,318
SPEAKER_0:  is that.

03:36:17,282 --> 03:36:18,590
SPEAKER_0:  the next generation.

03:36:19,234 --> 03:36:21,246
SPEAKER_0:  has a better life.

03:36:21,922 --> 03:36:24,958
SPEAKER_0:  than you and I have had in this country.

03:36:25,858 --> 03:36:28,350
SPEAKER_0:  And I think anyone who thinks...

03:36:29,506 --> 03:36:31,454
SPEAKER_0:  that America is over.

03:36:32,450 --> 03:36:34,558
SPEAKER_0:  Or is one president away?

03:36:35,010 --> 03:36:36,158
SPEAKER_0:  from being destroyed.

03:36:36,994 --> 03:36:40,254
SPEAKER_0:  cannot in good conscience call themselves a patriot.

03:36:40,898 --> 03:36:43,934
SPEAKER_0:  because if you think America is so weak.

03:36:44,418 --> 03:36:45,854
SPEAKER_0:  that it takes a Biden.

03:36:46,082 --> 03:36:47,006
SPEAKER_0:  or a Trump.

03:36:47,618 --> 03:36:50,654
SPEAKER_0:  to irrevocate or Obama to irrevocably destroy it.

03:36:51,106 --> 03:36:52,190
SPEAKER_0:  then it's already a wrap.

03:36:53,634 --> 03:36:54,270
SPEAKER_0:  And I-

03:36:54,594 --> 03:36:58,174
SPEAKER_0:  I think that's just absolutely ridiculous. If you look what this country has survived.

03:36:58,530 --> 03:36:59,358
SPEAKER_0:  Great Depression.

03:36:59,842 --> 03:37:00,830
SPEAKER_0:  World War II.

03:37:01,154 --> 03:37:02,142
SPEAKER_0:  The Civil War.

03:37:02,402 --> 03:37:05,502
SPEAKER_0:  I mean, my god, so we've been through worse before.

03:37:06,082 --> 03:37:06,526
SPEAKER_0:  Uh...

03:37:06,786 --> 03:37:08,958
SPEAKER_0:  It wasn't always easy, certainly not.

03:37:09,634 --> 03:37:10,878
SPEAKER_0:  but I am-

03:37:11,714 --> 03:37:12,126
SPEAKER_0:  I-I-

03:37:12,674 --> 03:37:17,022
SPEAKER_0:  It's so hard for me as someone who's a helpful person, not by my nature, I'm not-

03:37:17,378 --> 03:37:21,054
SPEAKER_0:  You know, Michael kindness, who does work for random house, or at least he did last time I talked to him.

03:37:22,178 --> 03:37:23,678
SPEAKER_0:  I look at even like-

03:37:24,578 --> 03:37:30,526
SPEAKER_0:  The thing is when you speak positively, it sounds corny. That's how screwed up our cynical culture is. Have you seen my Twitter?

03:37:31,362 --> 03:37:31,902
SPEAKER_0:  I'm trying to.

03:37:32,226 --> 03:37:33,630
SPEAKER_0:  You're verified now.

03:37:34,370 --> 03:37:34,942
SPEAKER_0:  That's good.

03:37:35,202 --> 03:37:36,510
SPEAKER_0:  But even like something like Etsy.

03:37:37,666 --> 03:37:39,541
SPEAKER_0:  Like you can go and Etsy. Homer Nathan

03:37:39,541 --> 03:37:41,041
SPEAKER_1:  for that verification.

03:37:41,041 --> 03:37:42,430
SPEAKER_0:  Hahahaha

03:37:43,842 --> 03:37:44,670
SPEAKER_0:  I earned it.

03:37:45,122 --> 03:37:56,222
SPEAKER_0:  It's an opportunity for independent artists to create something special and cool. And I've bought a lot of stuff from them. That in and of itself is something that's pretty awesome. There's so much, I'm into shaving soaps.

03:37:56,610 --> 03:37:57,566
SPEAKER_0:  Right?

03:37:57,794 --> 03:37:58,430
SPEAKER_0:  It's a f-

03:37:58,786 --> 03:38:01,246
SPEAKER_0:  The point is, there's like dozens of artisans.

03:38:01,986 --> 03:38:04,094
SPEAKER_0:  Every day when you have a shave it brings you...

03:38:04,386 --> 03:38:05,822
SPEAKER_0:  uh... some joy

03:38:06,178 --> 03:38:08,030
SPEAKER_0:  So there's just so many.

03:38:08,386 --> 03:38:11,838
SPEAKER_0:  things that are wonderful and I know there's people listening to this.

03:38:12,130 --> 03:38:13,150
SPEAKER_0:  Rollin' their eyes.

03:38:13,442 --> 03:38:16,542
SPEAKER_0:  How can you talk about shaving soaps when my daughter...

03:38:16,898 --> 03:38:19,998
SPEAKER_0:  or when my wife or when blah blah blah and I'm not

03:38:20,354 --> 03:38:23,742
SPEAKER_0:  disparaging or dismissing what you're regarding as a problem.

03:38:24,098 --> 03:38:27,198
SPEAKER_0:  My point is hope means the belief.

03:38:27,682 --> 03:38:29,758
SPEAKER_0:  that it's not at all a certainty.

03:38:30,082 --> 03:38:33,566
SPEAKER_0:  that this problem will be insurmountable. That's all it means.

03:38:35,010 --> 03:38:37,246
SPEAKER_1:  What do you look forward to in 2023?

03:38:39,330 --> 03:38:40,766
SPEAKER_1:  since this is a holiday special.

03:38:42,690 --> 03:38:43,326
SPEAKER_0:  Honestly?

03:38:44,002 --> 03:38:45,950
SPEAKER_0:  Like if I look forward.

03:38:46,658 --> 03:38:48,318
SPEAKER_0:  to a lot of young people.

03:38:49,538 --> 03:38:50,462
SPEAKER_0:  realizing.

03:38:51,074 --> 03:38:54,270
SPEAKER_0:  that they still have lots of opportunity in this country.

03:38:54,914 --> 03:38:56,286
SPEAKER_0:  and taking control.

03:38:56,706 --> 03:39:05,214
SPEAKER_0:  of their own selves and realizing they can be a better person tomorrow than they are today.

03:39:05,474 --> 03:39:12,222
SPEAKER_0:  which may they may not identify or government which they might not identify with or like or think is deplorable and realize you know what

03:39:12,578 --> 03:39:18,174
SPEAKER_0:  I have it in me to improve and find joy and happiness and also the fact that that is

03:39:18,434 --> 03:39:19,166
SPEAKER_0:  So...

03:39:19,426 --> 03:39:25,694
SPEAKER_0:  compelling and contagious. That is what I would want in 2023. And also for New York to get nuked.

03:39:28,610 --> 03:39:33,630
SPEAKER_0:  So those two things could be accomplished. Can I go back and switch the order? Because I think New York won.

03:39:36,258 --> 03:39:37,383
SPEAKER_0:  Oh, the jokes.

03:39:37,383 --> 03:39:45,534
SPEAKER_1:  the jokes and one day friends, if you, uh, if you work hard enough in believing yourself, you too can nuke New York. No, you too.

03:39:46,146 --> 03:39:47,934
SPEAKER_1:  can, uh, spend.

03:39:48,802 --> 03:39:49,438
SPEAKER_1:  Your-

03:39:51,458 --> 03:39:52,126
SPEAKER_1:  days.

03:39:52,770 --> 03:39:53,694
SPEAKER_1:  dressing up.

03:39:54,626 --> 03:39:55,614
SPEAKER_1:  Grown men.

03:39:56,098 --> 03:39:58,590
SPEAKER_0:  dressing up in a Santa outfit.

03:39:59,394 --> 03:40:01,982
SPEAKER_1:  and putting on lipstick and having.

03:40:02,434 --> 03:40:06,686
